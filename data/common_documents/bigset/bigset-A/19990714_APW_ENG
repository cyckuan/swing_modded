	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 26.92  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index reached a new closing  
high today amid a rally in technology stocks that was spurred by a 
tame inflation report and a strong earnings outlook from computer 
chip maker Intel. Blue chip stocks failed to keep pace, falling on 
profit-taking and nervousness about economic and political 
uncertainty overseas. The Nasdaq composite rose 39.14 to 2,817.37, 
topping its record close reached last Friday. The Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 26.92 at 11,148.10, adding to its 
26-point drop on Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 
4.60 at 1,398.16.

	Banks Have Mixed Results  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First Union Corp. today confirmed its earlier  
prediction of an earnings drop; and Fleet Financial Group Inc. said 
its profits rose 15 percent. First Union Corp.'s second-quarter net 
earnings fell 1 percent to $873 million, or 82 cents a share, from 
operating earnings of $883 million, or 92 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. The quarterly results were better than the 
Charlotte, N.C.-based bank forecast in May, and a penny over 
analysts' expectations. Fleet Financial Group Inc., based in 
Boston, reported a 15 percent jump in profits for the second 
quarter as fees rose and its brokerage unit posted strong results. 
The nation's eighth-largest banking company earned $450 million, or 
74 cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectations by a penny. 
That compares with earnings of $393 million, or 65 cents a share, 
in the second quarter last year. First Union shares were at 46 
13/16, up 1/8. Fleet shares were at 42 1/8, up 3/16.

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bank of America customers next year will  
be able to do their banking with mobile phones, electronic 
organizers and other handheld, Internet-connected, wireless 
devices. Charlotte-based Bank of America announced today a deal 
with Toronto-based 724 Solutions Inc. The technology company will 
provide software to let Bank of America's 30 million U.S. customers 
to accomplish banking transactions with wireless communication 
devices, including cellular phones, hand-held organizers and 
``smart phones,'' which are a hybrid of the two. Bank of America 
says it will be the first major U.S. financial institution to offer 
wireless banking.

	IBM Pension Plan Under Scrutiny  
</P>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A controversial change in IBM's pension  
plan, which many employees complain robs older workers of benefits 
on which they had relied, is getting congressional scrutiny. Eleven 
members of Congress suggest that the company's pension changes 
amount to age discrimination and they asked the Internal Revenue 
Service this week to look into it. Although they are seeking review 
of all ``cash balance plans,'' the congressmen were prompted by the 
changes at IBM, which took effect July 1.

	Cable TV Boosts Time Warner Profit  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner today posted net earnings of $593  
million in the second quarter as a large gain from cable television 
deals boosted profits. The earnings, which were equivalent to 43 
cents per share, compared to net profits of $101 million, or 2 
cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenues slipped to 
$3.57 billion from $3.67 billion. Time Warner's net figures for the 
second quarter reflected several one-time gains, mainly a $771 
million profit from various sales and exchanges of cable television 
properties.

	AlliedSignal Earnings Up 13 Pct  
</P>
<P>
	MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Sweeping reorganization, cost  
cutting and shifts to some higher-profit products helped 
AlliedSignal Inc. post a 13 percent jump in second-quarter 
earnings. Income from continuing operations was up 12 percent, on 
sharply higher profits in the aerospace systems, turbine 
technologies and transportation products divisions within 
AlliedSignal, which is awaiting shareholder approval of its planned 
merger with Honeywell Inc. AlliedSignal, which also makes 
automotive products, chemicals and advanced materials, reported net 
income for the April-June quarter totaling $395 million, or 70 
cents per share, matching estimates from analysts surveyed by First 
Call. In the year-ago period, AlliedSignal earned $350 million, or 
61 cents per share. AlliedSignal shares were at 66 1/4, up 1/4.

	Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level unexpectedly  
declined last month while consumers' spending slowed dramatically. 
With more news like this, the Federal Reserve may be content to 
remain on the sidelines and not push interest rates higher this 
year, economists said. The 0.1 percent decline in the Producer 
Price Index -- which measures inflation pressures before they reach 
the consumer -- was the first decline in four months and reflected a 
dip in energy prices, the Labor Department said today. And, the 
tiny 0.1 percent June increase in retail sales, which accounts for 
one-third of total economic activity, followed a hefty 1.2 percent 
gain in sales in May, the Commerce Department said in a separate 
report. A one percent drop in sales of cars and trucks, the biggest 
decline in this area since March, was the main factor slowing 
overall retail sales in June.

	Microsoft-Bristol Case Goes to Jury  
</P>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A jury began deliberations today over  
whether Microsoft Corp. violated antitrust laws in its dealings 
with a small Danbury, Conn. software company. Bristol Technology 
Inc. makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs, such as 
word processors and spreadsheets, written to work with Windows to 
be converted to run on computers with different operating systems 
such as Unix. The two companies had a three-year contract in which 
Microsoft gave Bristol access to source code -- software blueprints 
-- it needed to create Wind/U. Bristol sued in August after being 
unable to reach an agreement with Microsoft for a new contract for 
the latest versions of the Windows NT operating system. Bristol is 
making anti-trust claims against Microsoft, including a claim that 
Microsoft refused to negotiate a new contract.

	Sikorsky To Cut 1,100 Jobs

<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.  
plans to cut 1,100 jobs in Connecticut, citing a need to reduce 
overhead and become more competitive in a global marketplace. The 
company also said today that it plans to close some of its 10 
plants in the state, but company spokesman William Tuttle would not 
identify the factories targeted for closure. All but about 1,000 of 
Sikorsky's 8,100 employees are in Connecticut. The company also has 
plants in West Palm Beach, Fla., Troy, Ala., and smaller facilities 
around the world. None of the plants outside Connecticut will be 
affected by the cuts, Tuttle said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Jab at Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- President Clinton mocked Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush on Wednesday for calling himself a ``compassionate 
conservative,'' saying the term applies to Republicans who intend 
to do nothing in office -- except be nice about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a ``national conversation'' convened by the  
Democratic Leadership Council, Clinton said Republicans have 
latched onto compassionate conversatism because it implies a sense 
of social responsibility. But at the same time, he said, they are 
rejecting socially responsible policies, such as using the federal 
budget surplus to bail out Social Security and Medicare, 
restricting criminals' access to guns and raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This compassionate conservatism has a great ring to it, you  
know,'' Clinton said. ``It sounds so good. And near as I can tell, 
here's what it means: It means, 'I like you. I do.' ... 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save  
Social Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to 
raise the minimum wage. I'd like to do these things. But I just 
can't, and I feel terrible about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd laughed uproariously at Clinton's remarks, and he  
quipped: ``You don't have to give me credit if you repeat that back 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, Bush also was in Baltimore, visiting a poor  
inner city neighborhood and later attending a fund-raiser expected 
to net $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The president followed the lead of California Lt. Gov. Cruz  
Bustamante, who -- without directly referring to Bush-- criticized 
compassionate conservatism as a rehash of failed GOP policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think if you put a nice word in front of a mean  
word, you can fool people,'' Bustamante said. ``What a travesty it 
would be if the next president were the heir apparent to voodoo 
economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In praising Bustamante, Clinton seized the chance to deliver an  
intended pun. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I like about the California lieutenant governor is  
he doesn't beat around the bush,'' Clinton said, laughing. ``You 
know what's on his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he hesitated before launching into his criticism of Bush,  
saying ``I shouldn't do this, because it's not really presidential, 
but I'm going to do it anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke shortly after the White House announced that the  
president would take to the road to help Vice President Al Gore 
raise funds for his Democratic presidential bid. Gore trails both 
Bush and his main Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley, in raising 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the crowd of mostly moderate Democrats they should  
feel proud that Republicans are adopting some of their centrist 
``third way'' ideology, even if they are using it on the opposite 
end of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third way has become the way of the future,'' Clinton  
said. ``We tried it their way. We tried it our way. I don't care if 
the election is next week, never mind next year, we have worked too 
long to get this country out of the hole, we are moving in the 
right direction and we must not compromise the future of America 
and the next generation just for the next election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced a national drive to sign up low-income  
working families for food stamp benefits. He said he wanted to 
``make sure that working people know there is no indignity in 
taking public assistance to help feed their children if they're out 
there working 40 hours a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also relaxed rules to allow low-income families  
receiving government assistance for child care or other needs to 
also qualify for food stamps even if they own a car worth $4,650 or 
more.

</P>
<P>
	MINDEN, Nev. (AP) -- Donald Engen, the head of the Smithsonian  
Institution's National Air and Space Museum, died Tuesday when his 
glider broke apart and crashed. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen was killed along with William Ivans, an internationally  
known pilot who was piloting the motorized glider. The cause of the 
crash was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen, of Arlington, Va., had been director of the Air and Space  
Museum in Washington since 1996. He also was administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration from 1984 to 1987, and earlier 
served for two years on the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	A much-decorated Navy pilot, Engen retired as a vice admiral in  
1978. He also was a test pilot for many years and had served as 
general manager of Piper Aircraft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as head of the Air and Space Museum after his  
predecessor, Martin Harwit, resigned in 1995. Harwit left amid 
criticism that a planned atomic bomb exhibit would have depicted 
the United States as the aggressor and Japan as the victim of World 
War II.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Benjamin J. Gingiss, who founded a tuxedo shop in  
Chicago that grew into a large national chain, died Saturday of 
complications from cancer. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingiss started a one-store operation in downtown Chicago with  
his brothers in 1936 after they struggled to find decent tuxedos to 
wear to their sister's wedding. The shop became a franchise, 
Gingiss Formalwear, with about 300 locations.

	Gingiss was also president of the Illinois Humane Society, and a  
board member of Rosary College and the Lyric Opera.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Everett Greenbaum, who collaborated with  
fellow writer Jim Fritzell on the 1950s television sitcom ``Mr. 
Peepers'' and other series including ``The Andy Griffith Show'' and 
``M-A-S-H,'' died Sunday of brain cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbaum, a native of Buffalo, N.Y., studied at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Sorbonne in Paris, 
and served in World War II as a Navy pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he wrote, produced and starred in a Boston radio  
show called ``Greenbaum's Gallery.'' Greenbaum and Fritzell teamed 
up in 1952 for Wally Cox's ``Mr. Peepers,'' a collaboration that 
continued until Fritzell's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair earned a Peabody Award, four Emmy nominations, three  
Writers Guild comedy awards and the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award. 
They wrote eight feature films, including ``Good Neighbor Sam'' and 
``The Shakiest Gun in the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his own, Greenbaum wrote two books, including the memoir  
``The Goldenberg Who Couldn't Dance,'' and worked on ``The George 
Gobel Show.'' He also appeared in brief roles on Griffith's 
``Matlock'' series and other programs.

	GREENSBORO (AP) -- Clarence L. ``Curly'' Harris, manager of the  
Greensboro F.W. Woolworth Store lunch counter where the sit-in 
movement for civil rights caught fire, died Monday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Harris' downtown diner where, on Feb. 1, 1960, four  
students from North Carolina A&AMP;T State University refused to leave 
the segregated lunch counter after being refused service. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest lasted nearly six months and shut down one of the  
busiest lunch counters in the Woolworth chain. Black students in 
other cities drew inspiration from the protests to begin similar 
sit-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on their side,'' he said. His objection, he said, was in  
never having been consulted before his business came under siege by 
the burgeoning movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Over time, the all-day sit-ins left his business hemorrhaging  
money, Harris said. Still, he continued paying his lunch counter 
and kitchen staffers, which included 13 black people, during the 
protest.

<P>
	The cause of death was not released. The coroner said it appears  
that Newman died of natural causes. An autopsy was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman managed his mother's career through his Newman Management  
Inc., one of four Knight-related companies sharing offices in 
Southern Nevada.

<P>
	This year, Newman helped his mother launch Many Roads, a  
specialty record label formed to support her recent gospel album, 
``Many Different Roads,'' and other gospel artists. 
</P>

	Showers and storms darkened the Southeast on Wednesday. It was  
pleasant over New England and the Great Lakes area, while the 
Pacific Northwest saw clouds.

<P>
	The most persistent shower activity continued across the eastern  
parts of North Carolina and Virginia into Maryland and Delaware.

	Farther south, the central and southern Plains were fair and  
pleasant with only a few scattered showers occurring along the Gulf 
in southeastern Texas.

<P>
	The Southwest continued to be very wet with more flooding  
occurring across parts of the Desert Southwest as a result of the 
monsoonal flow in the region. Rain continued from Southern

<HEADLINE> Cheap Guns Cause Chaos in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The introduction of cheap, easy to maintain  
weapons into sub-Saharan Africa has had a ``catastrophic'' effect 
on the continent's politically fragile countries, the State 
Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some (African) countries, it is easier and cheaper to buy  
an AK-47 than to attend a movie or provide a decent meal,'' the 
department says in a report issued Tuesday as Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright delivered a major address on Africa policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is partly responsible for the 11 major conflicts  
in Africa, says the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proliferation of light weapons, financed by cash, diamonds  
or other commodities, did not cause Africa's wars, but it has 
prolonged them and made them more lethal,'' the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	In her New York speech, Albright acknowledged that the United  
States has been doing more to end conflicts in Europe than in 
Africa and said more resources must be found to support 
peacekeeping, reconstruction and reconciliation on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, speaking at a convention of the National Association  
for the Advancement of Colored People, said the reason Europe has 
been getting a higher priority than Africa is that the United 
States has allies in Europe to share the risks and costs of 
responding to crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Africa, such resources are scarce,'' she said. ``But that  
is no excuse for disengaging or giving up. Instead, it is a 
challenge, as President Clinton has suggested, to use the lessons 
of Kosovo to help us do better in Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the speech, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, a critic of U.S.  
policy in Africa, said he was glad Albright addressed concerns 
about the relative neglect of Africa and felt she was sensitive to 
views of black Americans. But he said he still had concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation between Rwanda and Kosovo is just the latest  
example of the problem mindset,'' Mfume said. ``The problem is not 
her. It is the permanent foreign policy mindset that we see 
situations in terms of the East and the West. African nations are 
treated differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts rejected such analyses as too simplistic,  
recalling that when the Bush administration faced simultaneous 
humanitarian crises in Bosnia and Somalia in 1992, it intervened 
with troops in Somalia but not in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in the forthcoming issue of Arms Control Today, a  
publication of the private Arms Control Association, also expresses 
concern about the resource discrepancy between Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing statistics provided by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, it says  
the United States is sending $15 million to a Nigerian-led West 
African group that is working to end the war in Sierra Leone. This 
compares with the $13 billion ``down payment'' for Kosovo, the 
editorial says. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fair and sustainable policy must tap the energies and  
resources that ease rather than aggravate the lingering question of 
why the United States sometimes appears readier to help a 
distressed white country than a distressed black one,'' the 
commentary adds.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Apologizes for Belle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Baltimore Orioles fan who sent a written  
protest to team owner Peter Angelos about outfielder Albert Belle's 
on-the-field antics was invited to sit in Angelos' box at Camden 
Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos also apologized to Norm D. St. Landau, of University  
Park, who faxed his letter to the Orioles detailing lewd gestures 
he said Belle made to fans during a June 4 game at Camden Yards 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Landau said Belle gestured to fans in the bleachers with his

<HEADLINE> SLOC Buys Winter Sports Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee took  
over Olympic venues for ski jumping, bobsledding and speed skating 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires SLOC to reimburse Utah taxpayers $59 million  
for building the Utah Winter Sports Park near Park City and a 
speed-skating oval at the Oquirrh Park Fitness Center in Kearns, a 
Salt Lake City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	It means the park and skating oval will remain open to athletes  
and the public before and after the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC already made a $1 million down payment on the purchase. The  
balance is due in January. Next March, SLOC must pay $40 million 
into a Legacy Fund to support the Olympic facilities, supposedly 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah taxpayers still could be left holding a bag after the 2002  
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest from the Legacy Fund will fall short of running the  
sports park and skating oval, said Randy Dryer, chairman of the 
Utah Sports Authority, the state agency that built the venues. 
</P>
<P>
	The venues will need an operating subsidy of $500,000 to $1  
million a year, Dryer told the Legislature's Sports Advisory 
Committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't ask us for the money, legislators replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's up to the private sector,'' committee chairman  
Jordan Tanner of Provo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah officials are determined to run an Olympics without  
government subsidies, but taxpayers are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City, the official host, had to guarantee the Olympics  
against any financial losses, and the state agreed to indemnify the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC, for its part, agreed years ago to reimburse $59 million  
that state and local taxpayers invested to build the sports park 
and skating oval. A sales tax diversion raised the money in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though SLOC is buying the Olympic venues, it won't get to  
keep or sell them. The venues eventually will be turned over 
debt-free to the Utah Athletic Foundation, a nonprofit organization 
that will use the Legacy Fund to run the facilities after the 
games.

<HEADLINE> Manager of Protest Counter Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Clarence L. ``Curly'' Harris, manager of  
the city's Woolworth's lunch counter where the civil rights sit-in 
movement was born, has died. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Harris' downtown diner where, on Feb. 1, 1960, four  
students from North Carolina A&AMP;T State University refused to leave 
the segregated lunch counter after being refused service. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly six months, hundreds of other area college students  
followed suit, shutting down one of the busiest counters in the 
chain. In the end, the counter was integrated and black students in 
other cities drew inspiration to begin similar protests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1998 interview, Harris said he saw no heroism in the four  
students' initial defiance, saying they could have taken 
Woolworth's to court instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on their side,'' he said. His objection, he said, was in  
never having been consulted before his business came under siege by 
the burgeoning movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we could have worked something out,'' Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
	McArthur Davis, the leader of a nonprofit effort to preserve the  
old store as a civil rights museum, said Harris' reluctance to have 
the students arrested for trespassing had an unintended effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought by not having the students arrested, it would fail  
to gain publicity and the effort would die,'' Davis said. ``That in 
and of itself helped the movement spread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over time, the all-day sit-ins left his business hemorrhaging  
money, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests ``cost me $150,000 in lost business,'' he said.  
``Wound up I lost one-third of my profits and I lost one-third of 
my salary. I resented it because I got no help from my company, I 
got no help from the city, I got no help from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Harris continued paying his lunch counter and kitchen staff  
members, 13 of whom were black. 
</P>
<P>
	Geneva Tisdale, a black woman who worked at the South Elm Street  
store from 1951 until it closed in early 1994, recalled Harris 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always nice to me,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Port Tops in Fish Landings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Alaskan port of Dutch Harbor-Unalaska  
topped the nation in fish landings last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial fishermen brought the port 597.1 million pounds of  
fish, worth $110.0 million in 1998 -- making it the port with both 
the highest volume and greatest dollar value of fish landings in 
the country, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service said Dutch  
Harbor-Unalaska netted the top landings slot for the 11th straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked port for landings was Reedville, Va., at 509.0  
million pounds; followed by Kodiak, Alaska, 357.6 million; 
Empire-Venice, La., 328.0 million; and Seattle, 312.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranking second in the value of its landings was New Bedford,  
Mass., at $93.5 million; followed by Kodiak, $78.7 million; 
Brownsville-Port Isabel, Texas, $64.2; and Honolulu, $49.0 million.

<HEADLINE> 'Hogan's Alley' Is the Unfair-way  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- ``Hogan's Alley'' is a bad  
neighborhood. And now the alley's even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasty, narrow strip down the par-5, sixth fairway is named  
for Ben Hogan, who in 1953 won the British Open at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hogan's day, two pot bunkers about 265 yards off the tee  
ruined the ideal line to the green. There were two choices: thread 
the ball through a 25-yard gap between the bunkers and an 
out-of-bounds fence, or play safe to the right, which made getting 
near the green in 2 impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there's a third bunker -- 310 yards off the tee -- dug there  
six months ago in Hogan's honor by head greenskeeper John Philp and 
deputy Paul O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is a 7,361-yard links course and might be the  
toughest test in golf. So O'Connor thinks it merits ``a rough, 
tough alley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, a 32-year-old Irishman, has spent nine years helping  
restore a course that fell into disrepair after Tom Watson won the 
last British Open there 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The others on the exclusive list of Open winners at Carnoustie  
include Tommy Armour (1931), Sir Henry Cotton ('37) and Gary Player 
('68). 
</P>
<P>
	``The bunker is there to protect some of the Hogan mystique and  
to guarantee the integrity of the hole,'' said O'Connor, who 
suggested the change to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which 
oversees golf everywhere but the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the power the players have now and the equipment, flying  
the first two bunkers was too easy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying all three is impossible, even on a rare calm day. Even  
for Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods played the Scottish Open on this course in 1995 and '96  
and was able to clear the two at will. But not now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the wind was into me, I still was able to carry those  
bunkers, that's always a nice advantage to have,'' O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made the pros think, and we've hurt their egos a  
little,'' he added. ``It makes them choose their weapons and armor 
carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth plays due west into a prevailing southwest wind with a  
knee-high meadow of grass narrowing the 578-yard hole to 14 yards 
at one point -- the narrowest on the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the width of a room,'' U.S. Open champion Payne  
Stewart said during practice for Thursday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hogan played this course his one time he arrived two weeks  
early to practice meticulously. He often angered Scots with his 
cutting comments about the course and the modest accommodations in 
this small speck of a town on the rugged North Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Send back to Texas for my lawnmower,'' he is reported to have  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stories have him walking the course backward to see every  
hill and gully. 
</P>
<P>
	His final two rounds to win in 1953 were played on the same day.  
He shot 70 and a then course-record 68, played in a cold, driving 
rain that forced him to take penicillin for a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
	That was his ninth major, and his last to go with the U.S. Open  
and Masters titles the same year. His performance won him the 
respect of Scots, who dubbed him the ``Wee Ice Mon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan is everywhere in Carnoustie, where he promised to return  
and never did. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 80-room hotel just off the 18th green has a Hogan Suite  
with a balcony overlooking the sea and the course. Down the road is 
the Hogan House Hotel, a modest bed and breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	It's disputed whether Hogan played all four of his tee shots on  
No. 6 down the alley or just the final two. According to one tale 
O'Connor likes, Hogan never ``took a divot on his second shot on 
No. 6, so he could land the ball in that same spot every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also unclear if the new bunker, having done it's work, will  
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal and Ancient paid for it and, faced with complaints  
from Carnoustie members, might remove it after the Open. Philp, the 
head greenskeeper, hopes not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want it to influence the championship in some way,'' he  
said. ``I want the challenge of `Hogan's Alley' to be as strong now 
as it always has been and ever was.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets tumbled Wednesday amid  
growing political tension between Taiwan and China, concerns that 
China might devalue its currency, and fears of higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo, Asia's biggest market, bucked the trend and posted a  
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices plunged to their lowest level in four  
weeks. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.9 percent, or 405.36 
points, to 13,575.57. The Hang Seng fell 80.91 points, or 0.6 
percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, the Weighted Price Index plunged 315.84 points, or  
3.84 percent, to 7,888.66, in the second largest drop this year. 
The index had already fallen 3.06 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, the Kospi index plummeted 3.4 percent, or 33.83  
points, to close at 953.67. Concerns over a domestic interest rate 
hike accelerated the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were dumping shares amid the latest standoff between  
Taiwan and China, sparked by Taiwan President Lee Tung-hui's recent 
remarks that bilateral relations should be conducted on a 
``state-to-state'' basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee infuriated Beijing, which maintains that Taiwan and China  
are two separate political entities within a single state and 
warned Taiwan of dire consequences for ``playing with fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors also worried that China might devalue its  
currency, the yuan, after China's central bank governor, Dai 
Xianglong, commented that its value should be determined by market 
forces rather than administrative policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A yuan devaluation could deal regional currency and stock  
markets a heavy blow. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 176.77  
points, or 0.97 percent, to 18,357.86. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had 
lost 0.42 points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors were cheered by continued gains in high  
technology companies reliant on international sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese  
yen. The dollar bought 121.12 yen in late trading, down from 122.14 
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 
121.32 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares in Manila and Sydney also fell as investors  
remained worried ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data, 
which analysts said would provide hints on whether the U.S. Federal 
Reserve might increase interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 33.53 points, or 1.3  
percent, to 2,570.96. Sydney's All Ordinaries Index closed down 9.5 
points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,054.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell as investors sold banking and finance  
shares heavily ahead of the release of second-quarter results from 
financial institutions, due on July 21. The SET index hit a 
five-week low of 494.00 points, down 1.2 percent, or 6.25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares rose as sentiment improved after  
President B.J. Habibie said he would step aside for his rival, 
Megawati Sukarnoputri, if she wins the presidency. The JSX 
Composite Index rallied 1.3 percent, or 8.695 points, to 664.882. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rose, even though some brokerages  
are making investors put up more cash to invest in the market. The 
Composite Index closed at 851.21 points, up 9.20 points, or 1.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed flat, with a late sell-off on Taiwan  
concerns erasing strong gains by media company Singapore Press 
Holdings Ltd., which hit a record high on growing optimism on the 
country's economy. The Straits Times Index rose just 0.14 point, or 
0.06 percent, to 2,178.63. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks fell slightly despite solid gains  
made by Fletcher Challenge's energy and paper division on group 
restructuring. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 4.52 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 2,169.55.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Valve May Predict Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The hardening or thickening of a tiny heart valve -- a common  
condition among the elderly that doctors often consider 
inconsequential -- may actually be an important predictor of heart 
attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that a severe narrowing or blockage  
in the left aortic valve is a predictor of heart disease. A new 
study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, has 
shown for the first time that a precursor condition called 
sclerosis can also be a warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Sclerosis is a hardening or thickening in the aortic valve,  
often due to a buildup of calcium deposits. The condition is found 
in approximately 25 percent of all adults over 65. 
</P>
<P>
	The study offers hope that a simple screening procedure can  
accurately forecast the risk of heart disease in people with no 
other symptoms. The procedure, called echocardiography, uses 
ultrasound to produce a two-dimensional picture of the heart and 
costs $350 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sclerosis itself has been thought to be just a benign,  
incidental finding of aging because it's so common,'' said Dr. 
Catherine Otto of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led 
the study. ``Having it is not benign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otto said she does not recommend routine echocardiograms for  
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Echocardiograms are usually done after a doctor detects a heart  
murmur using a stethoscope. Otto said that in light of her 
findings, the image should be closely examined for sclerosis of the 
aortic valve. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied the echocardiograms of 5,621 men and  
women 65 and older. The valve was normal in 70 percent. In 29 
percent, the valve was hardening or thickening, but there was no 
obstruction. The valve was narrowing, meaning there was some degree 
of obstruction, in 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Following up five years later, the doctors found that hardening  
of the valve is associated with a 50 percent higher risk of death 
from heart disease compared with those whose valves are normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers do not believe that sclerosis is a direct cause  
of death but rather a ``marker'' for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Blase Carabello of the Houston  
Veterans Affairs Medical Center said aortic valve sclerosis should 
be viewed ``as a harbinger of future events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes these data remarkable is the fact that this  
condition has been well known for decades and yet has generally 
been considered benign,'' Carabello wrote. ``Textbooks that mention 
the condition usually do so in passing.''

<HEADLINE> Intel's Second-Quarter Profit Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- Intel shares were up sharply this morning after  
the No. 1 computer chip maker predicted a strong recovery from a 
disappointing second-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel reported late Tuesday that its profits, while jumping 49  
percent in the quarter, failed to meet Wall Street forecasts due to 
sharp prices cuts on its computer chips. But the company added that 
its outlook should improve in the second half of the year because 
the price-cutting strategy had enabled it to steal market share 
from rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $1.75  
billion, or 51 cents a share, two cents below Wall Street 
expectations. That compared to a profit of $1.17 billion, or 33 
cents a share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 14 percent to $6.75 billion from $5.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel stock was up 2 percent in morning trading, rising $1.12 1/2 a  
share to $66.50 as the most active stock on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said microprocessor sales dropped slightly in the second  
quarter compared to the first quarter of this year. The company's 
average price for chips dropped, reflecting a shift to 
microprocessors as the brains of cheaper personal computers. Sales 
of sub-$1,000 PCs have boomed, prompting Intel to aggressively 
promote these less lucrative chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chief executive Craig Barrett said the lower-than-expected  
earnings also ``reflected a seasonal slowdown, and we look forward 
to a strong second half.'' The company had regained share in the 
low-priced PC market and sales of the company's new microprocessor, 
the Pentium III, were growing strongly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pentium III processor, a high performance multimedia  
processor for the most demanding Internet applications, is on track 
to be our fastest ramping processor ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Securities analyst Hans Mosesman agreed that Intel  
was in a better position to increase its sales during the second 
half of this year. ``They accomplished what they wanted to do and 
the outlook is positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosesman noted that computer sales are always higher during the  
second half of the year, which should boost Intel's business. PC 
sales generally rise during this period due to back-to-school and 
holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 26, Intel said it earned $3.75  
billion, or $1.08 per share. That was up from a profit of $2.45 
billion, or 69 cents a share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $13.85 billion from $11.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the company repurchased a total of 25  
million shares of common stock, at a cost of $1.5 billion, under an 
ongoing program. Since the program began in 1990, the company has 
repurchased 634.6 million shares at a total cost of $16.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not reflected in this period, Intel acquired Dialogic  
Corporation for $780 million in cash.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man accused of being the railroad killer was  
linked to a ninth slaying and charged with capital murder today, 
hours after he asked a judge, ``Can all this be done very quickly 
so I can say I'm guilty?'' Shortly after Angel Maturino Resendez 
made his request during a court appearance on a burglary charge in

	Senate GOP Gains HMO Victories  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans refused to extend new HMO  
rules to all 161 million people with private health insurance 
today. GOP leaders crafted alternatives to other Democratic 
proposals in an effort to blunt political damage. Only a handful of 
Republicans have defected in a series of votes this week over the 
details of new patient protections. That's partly because 
Republicans answered -- or promised to answer -- Democratic proposals 
on emergency room care, women's health and clinical trials.

federal safety regulators today released track test results on 12 
vehicles. A computer is being used to steer the vehicles through 
sharp turns so officials were able to reliably repeat the 
maneuvers, a report said. The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration plans to propose a federal test later this year to 
provide consumers with information on the relative likelihood of 
rollover for cars and light trucks -- pickups, sport utility 
vehicles and vans, agency officials said.

	Clinton Offers Food Stamp Help  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Seeking to encourage the fast-moving shift of  
Americans from welfare to work, President Clinton took steps today 
to help low-income families with jobs receive food stamps. The 
president said the administration would streamline reporting rules 
for food stamp recipients and launch a national campaign ``to make 
sure that working people know there is no indignity in taking 
public assistance to help feed their children if they're out there 
working 40 hours a week.'' Only two of five working families 
eligible for food stamps actually apply for assistance and receive 
it, the White House said.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the popularity of fax machines and e-mail  
grows, the U.S. Postal Service hopes to give ``snail mail'' a boost 
by allowing customers to buy stamps over the Internet and print the 
postage directly onto envelopes and labels. PC Postage marks the 
Postal Service's first big step into electronic commerce. The 
program is being tested by a select number of small businesses in 
California and the Washington, D.C., area. It could be available 
nationwide by the end of summer.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long and costly investigation into the  
explosion of TWA Flight 800 will conclude by this winter at the 
latest, the head of the lead investigative agency said today as the 
third anniversary approached. Investigators are certain that a 
fuel-air explosion in the center fuel tank brought down the Boeing

determination of the ignition source still has not been made, said

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc.'s profit nearly doubled in  
the recent quarter as demand surged for the company's iMac desktop 
computer. The results released today offered the latest evidence of 
a resurgence at Apple this past year, further easing any doubts 
over the company's prospects. Apple's profit in its fiscal third 
quarter rose to $203 million, or $1.20 a share. That was up from a 
profit of $101 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Looking to take the first step in a labor  
dispute with owners, almost all major league umpires said today 
they will resign Sept. 2 and not work the final 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. The move was announced following a sometimes raucous 
meeting of the Major League Umpires Association at a Philadelphia 
hotel. Owners, tired of repeated fight with umpires, seemed almost 
pleased by the decision.

	New Drug Protects Newborns from AIDS  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists working in Uganda have discovered a  
dramatically more effective way to prevent pregnant women from 
spreading the AIDS virus to their babies: a drug treatment that 
costs just $4 per mother and could save up to 1,000 newborns a day. 
The drug nevirapine already is widely sold around the world to 
treat AIDS. But the new study found it is 47 percent more effective 
than the therapy now recommended in developing countries for 
preventing mother-to-baby transmission of the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Gets Rock Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WANTAGH, N.Y. (AP) -- Retirees Ruth and Hal Sackstein raced for  
Jones Beach in pants and long-sleeved shirts when the radio relayed 
the news: Hillary Rodham Clinton was on Long Island, chatting up 
sun-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got out of the house so fast,'' said Mrs. Sackstein of  
New York City's Queens borough. ``We would not miss seeing her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the first lady was greeted like a rock star at the  
popular beach Tuesday as a crowd of several hundred people gathered 
to shake hands and snap pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has established an exploratory committee for a  
likely Senate campaign, began making visits through the state last 
week in what she has described as a ``listening tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was to return to Long Island today for a forum on gun  
control and a discussion on health issues in Great Neck. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, has also  
established an exploratory committee for a possible Senate run. He 
has criticized Mrs. Clinton's interest in the state as 
carpetbagging. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told reporters she had not decided yet where in the  
state she might live, but has looked over a few houses and received 
brochures and videos on others. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can afford it, I'd buy,'' she said, ``but I probably will  
end up renting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melanie Antonelli, a hair salon owner from upstate Cornwall  
visiting the beach, said she is a Republican but would vote for 
Mrs. Clinton anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more women in politics,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began her day at Westchester Community College in  
Valhalla at a forum with with former welfare recipients who now 
have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support welfare reform,'' she said. ``I believe we needed to  
make those changes, but it can only work if we have child care, 
support and other necessities that people need to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Hodges, a once-homeless, single mother who now works at  
a center for AIDS patients after getting a child care grant, said 
she worries about losing the grant and appreciated Mrs. Clinton's 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It showed me she was concerned,'' Miss Hodges said. ``She  
really was listening. She was very friendly, very open to 
suggestion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She spoke in generalities. I wouldn't think Giuliani would  
have any problem agreeing with any of it,'' said Sarah Stern, a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also expressed support for universal  
pre-kindergarten, which New York state has declined to fund; for 
making college tuition tax-deductible; and for a federal initiative 
to pay for school construction that the White House has backed but 
Congress has not. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of old schools and a lot of fast-growing  
suburbs,'' she said. ``It's not just an inner-city problem, it's 
also a suburban -- and as I learned last week -- a rural problem as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another potential Senate candidate, Rick Lazio, a  
Long Island congressman, said several Senate GOP leaders, Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott among them, would be holding a 
Washington fund-raiser for him.

<HEADLINE> Feds Release Rollover Test Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a step toward vehicle rollover ratings,  
federal safety regulators on Wednesday released track test results 
on 12 vehicles -- including one that nearly tipped over. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer is being used to steer the vehicles through sharp  
turns so officials were able to reliably repeat the maneuvers, a 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to  
propose a federal test later this year to provide consumers with 
information on the relative likelihood of rollover for cars and 
light trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles and vans, agency 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A compact pickup, the 1997 Ranger, tipped so far to the side  
during two tests that it was caught by the metal outriggers on its 
sides that are designed to prevent it from rolling over and hurting 
the driver, the agency report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no outriggers were present, the vehicle might well have  
rolled over,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway crash data shows that pickups and sport-utility  
vehicles, which have a higher center of gravity, roll over more 
than cars. But developing a test to assess rollover propensity has 
long been controversial among automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups applauded the agency's testing, saying  
development of a rating system is even more important now since 
light truck sales have grown rapidly this decade to nearly half of 
auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hopeful sign that NHTSA will move decisively to help  
reduce death and injuries from rollover,'' said R. David Pittle, 
the technical director for Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer 
Reports. ``A rating system for consumers will be a major step 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group had petitioned the agency to develop such a rollover  
test. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety agency tested the 12 vehicles in severe driving  
maneuvers using the computer to execute turns at speeds up to 60 
mph. The two main tests involved a sharp turn in one direction 
followed by an even larger turn in the opposite direction, and a 
single large turn similar to getting on a cloverleaf ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ranger and a mid-size sport utility vehicle, the 1998  
Chevrolet Tracker, also had moderate tipping in a single turn test 
that involved some braking by the driver. A moderate tilt meant the 
vehicle tipped up on two wheels by more than 2 inches. Each of the 
vehicles has two moderate tilts on that test. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal test researchers cautioned against comparing the vehicle  
test results to draw conclusions about any individual vehicle since 
so few vehicles have been tested and officials were still deciding 
on the best test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results cannot be used to draw meaningful comparisons  
about the stability of specific models,'' an agency statement said. 
However, the report did say the Ranger ``exhibited the highest 
rollover propensity in this study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the company had just  
received the report and could not comment in detail until engineers 
had a chance to review it. However, she said the agency's rollover 
findings for the Ranger ``are not consistent with what we've found 
during nearly two decades of Ranger engineering, testing and 
development work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at General Motors, which sells the Tracker, said the  
outrigger adds weight to the vehicles and skews test results. The 
Tracker is made by Suzuki Motor Corp. and sold under the Chevrolet 
nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have long said a driver's behavior is the most  
important factor in determining vehicle rollover; for instance, a 
motorist who drives too fast and plows off the road is more likely 
to roll over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phenomenon of rollover is primarily attributed to driver  
behavior,'' said GM spokesman Greg Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in light trucks result  
from rollover, NHTSA says. By comparison, 22 percent of car deaths 
involve rollovers. More than 9,400 people died in rollover crashes 
in 1997, the latest year statistics were available.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Terrorist Threats Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An anthrax release in Boston, a North Korean  
sale of nuclear bombs and an Iraqi nerve-agent attack on U.S. 
troops were among the potential threats to Americans cited 
Wednesday by a commission urging government action to combat such 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are woefully unprepared, and we would like to see something  
done before some incident occurs,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, the 
commission's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, R-Pa., said he would introduce legislation Thursday to  
tighten export controls on items that might be used to manufacture 
heavily destructive weaponry and wants to have all worldwide 
transactions recorded electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	The main proposals of the 12-member panel, headed by former CIA  
Director John Deutch and including a wide range of government and 
private nonproliferation experts, were disclosed in interviews last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the commission's report contained ``a  
number of interesting recommendations and observations that deserve 
serious consideration.'' He directed his national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, to coordinate an interagency assessment of the 
recommendations and to report back within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission on Wednesday released 265 pages of report and  
documentation that spells out fears of potential doomsday weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	The material also details a plan to give the vice president the  
lead role in preventing and dealing with the threat of weapons of 
mass destruction, which the commission says has increased markedly 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the country needs to be better protected,'' Deutch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission concludes that the top levels of government are  
``not effectively organized to combat proliferation'' and 
recommends the president appoint a ``national director to combat 
proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director would coordinate diplomatic steps to stop the  
spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The director 
also would oversee a special government panel, made up of assistant 
secretaries from various agencies, that would seek to prevent the 
targeting of Americans and to respond to any catastrophic attack at 
home or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch said placing the government's nonproliferation efforts  
under a single budget and director would help in preparing to deal 
with ``a calamitous eventuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One commission member, former Democratic Sen. James Exon of  
Nebraska, dissenting from the report's main recommendation, urged 
greater Cabinet-level involvement and a nonproliferation director 
who would report directly to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been crafted, in may opinion, is another lower-level  
'working group,''' Exon said. He agreed with the extent of the 
threat and proposed an even more aggressive response. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal already has received a cool response at the  
Pentagon. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said last week that 
the existing lines of authority are sufficiently clear and do not 
require the appointment of a special coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the scenarios outlined in the report by the Commission to  
Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the 
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: 
</P>
<P>
	--Anthrax is released in a Boston subway station during rush  
hour, sending 6,000 people to hospital emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Analysts estimate that North Korean scientists have assembled  
10 nuclear weapons, and intelligence reports say North Korea is 
planning to sell two. 
</P>
<P>
	--Iraqi President Saddam Hussein orders Scud missiles carrying  
nerve agents fired upon U.S. troops in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	--A disgruntled Russian scientist at Ozersk acquires 44 pounds of  
highly enriched uranium and sells it to Iran.

<HEADLINE> DNA Implicates Ex-Deputy in Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fourteen years after a sergeant was shot to  
death, DNA tests unavailable at the time have implicated a former 
sheriff's deputy as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Eugene Kirby is the focus of a nationwide manhunt, having  
disappeared days before police issued a warrant for his arrest in 
the murder of Sgt. George Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say a DNA sample taken from Kirby matched blood  
collected from the crime scene in 1985. A love triangle may have 
been the motive, police sources told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur, 37, was found dead in his van parked on a freeway ramp.  
He was shot after leaving work at the Men's Central Jail, where 
Kirby also worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives believe Kirby, who is now retired, hid inside  
Arthur's van and shot him while he was driving, causing the vehicle 
to crash. Witnesses said they saw a man crawl from the wreckage and 
limp away. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's autopsy showed Arthur had struggled with his  
attacker before he was shot. At the time, however, the technology 
did not exist to link the hair and blood samples found in the van 
to a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, investigators reopened the case and took DNA samples  
from several people, including Kirby. On July 7, they went to the 
54-year-old Kirby's current home in Spokane, Wash., but his wife 
said he left June 30 without explanation.

<HEADLINE> Parziale Named Bureau Chief in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eva Parziale, director of the photo archive of  
The Associated Press since 1997 and a former bureau chief in 
Oregon, has been named chief of bureau in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	She succeeds Jake Booher, who is retiring after 35 years with  
the AP, the last 18 in charge of Ohio operations. The appointment 
was announced today by President Louis D. Boccardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Parziale joined the AP in San Francisco in 1984. After earning a  
master's degree in journalism at Columbia University in 1985, she 
rejoined the AP in Miami. She also was correspondent in Portland, 
Maine; news editor in Columbia, S.C.; and assistant chief of bureau 
in Kansas City before being named bureau chief in Portland in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Parziale, 38, graduated from Bowling Green State University and  
worked for the Lake County Telegraph in Painesville, Ohio, before 
joining the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Booher joined the AP in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1964. He worked on  
the news cooperative's main editing desk in New York and was news 
editor in Salt Lake City before becoming bureau chief in 
Louisville, Ky., in 1976. He has been bureau chief in Columbus 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Booher, 61, grew up in Knoxville, Tenn., and is a graduate of  
the University of Tennessee. He worked for the Knoxville 
News-Sentinel before joining the AP.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Open $517 Million Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Finally, Seattle baseball fans will get to see  
green grass and blue skies. And when the skies turn sodden, they 
get to watch the roof close over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field, a $517.6 million project featuring a retractable  
roof, kicks off a new era of major league baseball in the Pacific 
Northwest on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching their team play inside for 22 1/2 seasons in the  
tomblike and dingy Kingdome, the Mariners will begin play in their 
new home next to Puget Sound's Elliott Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four home games, including Thursday night's opener  
against the San Diego Padres, are sold out and the other four games 
of the first Safeco homestand are selling out fast. 
</P>
<P>
	When the roof is open, as it's expected to be this week, fans  
can view Seattle's scenic skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time in their 22 1/2-year history, the Mariners  
will field at home on natural grass, not AstroTurf. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Ken Griffey Jr. and the team's other sluggers will miss  
the carry and relatively short fences of the Kingdome is another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field has bigger dimensions than the cozy Kingdome and  
the move across the street is expected to cut the Mariners' 
prolific home run numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Said designated hitter Edgar Martinez: ``Inside the gaps, it's  
big. Plus the ball doesn't travel that well. Left field and right 
field are OK, but the gaps are hard to hit them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the increased fan interest could provide the revenue to  
help keep Griffey and Alex Rodriguez in Seattle when they become 
free agents after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Mariners feel they've got a 47,000-seat home now to  
match Camden Yards in Baltimore, Coors Field in Denver, Jacobs 
Field in Cleveland, Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix and The Ballpark 
in Arlington, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Jamie Moyer (8-5) will pitch the Safeco opener  
against the Padres and All-Star pitcher Andy Ashby (8-4). 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium is drawing rave reviews. The fans love its features  
and the fact that they won't have to watch baseball indoors 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field's features range from excellent sight lines, to its  
concession stands and large number of toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stadium comes with controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Some local fans and officials feel the Mariners' owners are  
trying to renege on their deal with taxpayers, trying for more tax 
revenues to cover cost $100 million in cost overruns on the 
ballpark, of which $379 million was covered by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-game series with the Padres, the Mariners will  
face the Arizona Diamondbacks and Randy Johnson, who is scheduled 
to pitch on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was an American League Cy Young Award winner, a 20-game  
winner and the author of a no-hitter for the Mariners before he was 
traded to Houston last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners will open at Safeco Field with a five-game losing  
streak and a team ERA of 6.02. They're three games under .500 and 
in third place in the AL West, six games behind first-place Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Could the new park raise morale?  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like being indoors all day,'' third baseman Russ  
Davis said. ``This is a beautiful part of the country and you 
should be able to enjoy the weather. I think the fans are going to 
enjoy it a lot more, too.''

<HEADLINE> Army Mulls Retirement Pay for Hale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is reconsidering whether a retired  
two-star general who admitted having sex with the wives of four 
subordinates should be allowed to keep his high rank and his full 
pension of more than $6,000 a month, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale was reprimanded and fined after a  
court-martial in March, but he escaped a possible 11-year term in a 
military prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Wednesday he is convening a  
special panel to review Hale's case and recommend whether Hale 
should retire as a two-star major general, or the lower-ranking 
one-star brigadier general. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board advises the secretary of the highest grade in which  
the officer in question served satisfactorily,'' a statement from 
the Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	The board should act quickly, Army officials said, and Caldera  
will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's lawyer, Frank Spinner, did not immediately return a  
message left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was the highest-ranking Army officer to face court-martial  
since 1952. His case led to allegations the Pentagon had a double 
standard for dealing with sexual misconduct when it came to 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was allowed to retire with honor last year despite claims  
of improprieties he committed while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. The resulting furor led the Pentagon to change its 
rules to bar top officers from retiring while facing allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also decided to take the highly unusual step of  
court-martialing Hale even though he was already retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was convicted of seven counts of conduct unbecoming an  
officer, and one count of lying to investigators. He was ordered to 
pay a $10,000 fine and forfeit $12,000 of his $75,744 annual 
pension for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale stands to lose up to $750 a month in retirement pay if he  
is reduced in rank.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eases Food Stamp Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- President Clinton took several steps Wednesday  
to widen eligibility for food stamps as a way to encourage the 
continuing shift of Americans from welfare to low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are changing the rules so thousands of poor working  
families won't be denied food stamps, as they are today, just 
because they own a reliable car,'' Clinton told a meeting of the 
Democratic Leadership Council here. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ordered a simplification of food stamp rules that  
the White House said discourage recipients from getting jobs and 
burdens agencies with excessive paperwork. For instance, under the 
new rules, working families receiving food stamps will have to 
report expected earnings each quarter, rather than each month. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules implemented through an executive order also will  
allow states to use more lenient asset tests in determining 
eligibility. Currently, working families on federal assistance, 
such as child care, lose food stamp eligibility if their car is 
worth more than $4,650. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who administers the food  
stamp program, also will launch a public education campaign aimed 
at advising low-income families of their possible eligibility, the 
White House said.

<HEADLINE> Old Pike Is Just Getting Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't let the name fool you.  
</P>
<P>
	Old Pike is a young rock band: five single guys in their 20s who  
are hoping their debut CD ``Ten Thousand Nights'' won't be their 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Pike consists of singer Tim Jones, keyboardist Mike Flynn,  
guitarist Carl Broemel, bassist Jason Brammer and drummer Pat 
Spurgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's roots are in Indiana -- Pike Township High School in  
Indianapolis to be exact, hence the band's name. Jones, Broemel and 
Brammer were students there. Old Pike was formed at Indiana 
University in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members say they are probably more influenced by Bruce  
Springsteen than by local star John Mellencamp, who lives near 
Bloomington, Ind., where the band makes its home. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn joined Old Pike in 1996 and he began taking care of the  
business side of things. He got to know the names of people who 
hired bands and worked at record companies. He sent tapes to clubs, 
booked engagements and invited recording executives to hear the 
band play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd pretend I was the manager,'' Flynn said. ``I'd say, `I've  
got a great band that wants to come through your town.' I got 
pretty lucky with a lot of shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, band members supported themselves by doing small  
construction jobs, borrowing $5,000 from a friend and taking loans 
from their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's first recordings were for Flat Earth Records in  
Indianapolis. Old Pike spent five days in October 1997 doing seven 
songs for an extended-play recording. The band also had a split 
record come out with Chamberlain, on Dog House Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones writes the band's lyrics, and Flynn and Broemel write the  
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Pike toured three weeks with Ben Folds Five in November  
1997. The band played 1,500-seat, sold-out audiences every night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intensity and love for music was there and kids like to  
see that,'' Flynn said. ``It was our first experience of larger 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we played the Fillmore in San Francisco, everybody was  
backstage calling friends, saying, `We're at the Fillmore.' It was 
one of the highlights of my life. Every sold-out show, they put the 
poster up at the Fillmore. No matter what happens, I can take my 
kids there someday and say, `See. I did it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Old Pike signed with Sony's 550 Music label during last year's  
South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. They had performed 
at the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' 
showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the band connected with producer Jim Scott.  
</P>
<P>
	``His objective was to make a rock 'n' roll record, which is  
kind of the point,'' Jones said. ``A lot of producers are into 
getting a hit right away -- which hopefully we can live with or live 
without. He wanted us to make a CD people would be able to listen 
to for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell Wednesday against most major  
currencies as the euro recovered slightly from the new low it set a 
day earlier and Japanese authorities failed to intervene on push 
the yen lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0209, up  
from late Tuesday's $1.0164 and above the record low of $1.0108 set 
earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the euro remains 14 percent below its level of  
nearly $1.19 when it started trading Jan. 4, replacing the 
currencies of 11 European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 120.59 Japanese yen, down from  
121.32 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Nickerson, a currency strategist in New York for Bank of  
America, said the Bank of Japan's continued absence from the 
currency markets was a key factor in the dollar's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already gone through some levels here where we would  
have expected to see them'' buying dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities have expressed concern that a strong yen  
could hurt exports and inhibit Japanese economic recovery. The Bank 
of Japan showed over the past month it was willing to buy dollars 
aggressively in an effort to curb the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar may have also been hurt by reports of an unexpected  
decline in U.S. wholesale prices and a weaker-than-expected rise in 
U.S. retail sales last month. The government statistics were seen 
as easing pressure on Federal Reserve policy-makers to raise 
interest rates further. Rising U.S. rates boost returns on 
dollar-denominated investments and often increase demand for the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.5727  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5766 a day earlier, and 1.4810 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.4815. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.5637 from late Tuesday's $1.5574.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9152  
German marks, down from 1.9216; and 6.4250 French francs, down from 
6.4537.

<HEADLINE> Voyeur Dorm Ruled an Adult Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- City officials are cracking down on Voyeur  
Dorm, a house where young women are filmed day and night, clothed 
and unclothed by a battery of live Internet cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's Variance Review Board ruled Tuesday that the house is  
not a home, but a business in the same category as strip clubs and 
requires an adult occupational license to continue its activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``These women are basically taking their clothes off for  
profit,'' board member Ana Wallrapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Web surfers pay $34 per month to view the site, which provides  
images from more than 30 cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The college students receive free room and board, tuition and a  
stipend in return for living in the house, but are not required to 
perform for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site says the cameras are all around the house,  
including the bathroom. ``Nothing is off limits. There are no 
taboos,'' it says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the women, who identified herself only as Alex, said the  
arrangement means her mother doesn't have to pay her college 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a neat concept,'' she said. ``I don't know  
why people are making such a big deal out of nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voyeur Dorm is a partnership of Dan Marshlack, owner of the  
house, and Internet Entertainment Group of Seattle, which runs 
numerous Web sex sites. The owners plan to appeal, said their 
lawyer, Mark Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the owners lose in court, Dolan said, Voyeur Dorm won't  
go away. It may end up in a studio or some other commercial 
location. More than 5,000 customers nationwide watch the site, 
Dolan said.

<HEADLINE> Credit Slander Restraints Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida appeals court made it  
easier Wednesday to sue for credit slander when it said the 
two-year statute of limitations starts anew each time an inaccurate 
report is released. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal-- the first of its  
kind in Florida -- could open the door for more lawsuits by people 
who discover an inaccurate mark on their credit report years after 
the mark was put there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope so,'' said attorney Donald Kohl, who represented  
Michael A. Musto, a Lake Worth truck company owner, in his slander 
lawsuit against Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp., and its collections 
agency, Oklahoma-based Recovery Specialists Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Musto claimed he was denied credit on several occasions  
beginning in 1996 -- three years after BellSouth's collections agent 
reported to a credit bureau Musto had failed to reimburse BellSouth 
for $680 to repair a phone line that had been pulled down by one of 
his trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Musto disputed the bill, saying BellSouth was responsible for  
the damage because the line hung below county height regulations. 
BellSouth referred the case to a collections agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Musto did not discover Recovery Specialists had put a bad mark  
on his credit until another creditor asked for a copy of his report 
in January 1997 when he tried to buy an $80,000 truck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their defense, attorneys for BellSouth and Recovery claimed  
Musto was barred from suing because of a two-year statute of 
limitations, which started to run when the initial report was made 
to a credit bureau in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A Palm Beach County Circuit judge agreed and issued a summary  
judgment in favor of BellSouth and Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Musto argued on appeal that each time his credit report  
was provided to a potential creditor it should be seen as a new 
publication, and therefore reset the two-year window for filing 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Michele McNichol, an attorney who represented BellSouth and  
Recovery, said the decision could mean almost limitless liability 
for companies who report payment problems or other issues to credit 
bureaus because years often pass between requests for someone's 
credit report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has significant implications,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the judges said ``endless liability ... is simply not a  
concern where no mass publication or potentially endless repetition 
of the defamatory statement is likely to occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of inaccurate credit reports likely would be  
issued, the court said, and then only to those potential creditors 
in a position to secure such a confidential report. 
</P>
<P>
	McNichol said she'd not yet spoken to her clients so she did not  
know if they would seek a rehearing or appeal to the state Supreme 
Court.

<HEADLINE> Banks Report Mixed Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two big banks reported divergent second-quarter results  
Wednesday, as First Union Corp. confirmed its earlier prediction of 
an earnings drop and Fleet Financial Group Inc. said its profits 
rose 15 percent. 

</P>
<P>
                         *First Union Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	First Union's second-quarter net earnings fell 1 percent to $873  
million, or 82 cents a share, from operating earnings of $883 
million, or 92 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sixth-largest bank reported operating earnings for  
the year-ago quarter because its net profits were reduced sharply 
by $634 million in one-time acquisition and restructuring costs. 
Operating earnings made for a more accurate picture of the 
company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly results were better than the Charlotte, N.C.-based  
bank forecast in May, when it deflated Wall Street expectations for 
the second time this year by predicting second-quarter earnings in 
the range of $770 million to $800 million, or 80 to 83 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were also a penny over the expectations of analysts  
polled by the research firm First Call Corp. Before the bank 
revised its earnings outlook in May, analysts expected First Union 
to earn about 97 cents per share in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union reported a 13 percent increase in fee and other  
income to $1.7 billion, excluding portfolio securities 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Edward Crutchfield said one  
reason for the company's struggles has been its tripling in size 
over the last three years. First Union's largest acquisition, 
Philadelphia's CoreStates Financial Corp., has not produced the 
revenues First Union had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, First Union said it would trim its work force 7  
percent to cut annual costs by $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After merger-related and restructuring charges, net income for  
the year's first six months was $1.6 billion, or $1.63 per share, 
compared with $1 billion, or $1.07 per share, for the first six 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union's shares rose 12 1/2 cents to $46.81 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Fleet Financial Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Boston-based Fleet reported a 15 percent jump in profits for the  
second quarter as fees rose and its brokerage unit posted strong 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's eighth-largest banking company earned $450 million,  
or 74 cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectations by a penny.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Profit Up 138 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser Co.'s second-quarter  
profits more than doubled on strong demand for lumber and other 
wood products. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser had net earnings of $164 million, or 82 cents per  
share, up 138 percent from $69 million, or 34 cents a share, in the 
same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the quarter rose 14 percent from $2.7 billion to  
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results surpassed analysts' consensus prediction of 70 cents  
a share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said new home construction and homeowners'  
renovation of existing houses contributed to growth in its wood 
products business and in its real estate segment. It predicted the 
growth would continue into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser's wood products business had operating earnings of  
$173.8 million, a 226 percent increase over the $53.3 million in 
earnings for second-quarter 1998. Earnings for real estate rose 
from $16.5 million to $44.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the timberlands segment also were up, while the  
pulp, paper and packaging segment was down slightly because of 
plant maintenance, drought conditions affecting the Plymouth, N.C., 
mill, and a labor dispute at the Dryden, Ontario, paper mill. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, profits were $166 million,  
or 58 cents a share, compared with $154 million, or 77 cents a 
share, a year earlier. The net earnings include a one-time charge 
of $150 million for an accounting change and the sale of 
Weyerhaeuser's composite products business. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the first half were $5.7 billion, up from $5.3  
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares for Weyerhauser Co. remained unchanged at $63.50 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Chung Replaces Ramos As MLS All-Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- Midfielder Mark Chung of the New York-New  
Jersey MetroStars will replace injured teammate Tab Ramos at the 
MLS All-Star game Saturday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Conference coach Thomas Rongen selected Chung, who will  
be making his second All-Star appearance. Chung, 29, leads the 
MetroStars in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor and a thrill to represent the MetroStars at the  
All-Star game and I'm thankful to the coaching staff for selecting 
me,'' Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos, 32, withdrew because of a leg injury. He was voted to  
start by the fans despite making only four regular-season starts 
because of a variety of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung started his pro career playing for the San Diego Sockers  
of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, winning its rookie of the 
year award in 1995.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: TWA 800 Probe Nearing End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long and costly investigation into the  
explosion of TWA Flight 800 will conclude by this winter at the 
latest, the head of the lead investigative agency said Wednesday as 
the third anniversary approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are certain that a fuel-air explosion in the  
center fuel tank brought down the Boeing 747 on July 17, 1996, 
killing all 230 aboard, but a final determination of the ignition 
source still has not been made, Jim Hall, chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	For the safety board, the investigation has been the longest and  
most expensive probe in its 30-year history. Hall said he didn't 
yet want staffers diverting their time to tallying the cost, but 
``it's clearly going to be millions and millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Loeb, the panel's head of aviation safety, said  
investigators have already examined the possibility of a static 
electricity buildup, stray current from nearby fuel pumps and 
electrical shorts in the tank's fuel-quantity indicating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The final phase of their work is now focusing on possible  
electro-magnetic induction, which occurs when electricity from an 
active source or wire causes a trace of activity in a nearby wire. 
Investigators have studied external sources such as radar-emitting 
military planes and ships. They have also looked at carry-on items 
such as laptop computers and other personal electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they are testing electronics built into the plane itself,  
although they have not ruled out any of the earlier possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't favor any particular ways of getting ignition, but we  
know there are a number of them and the FAA has addressed some of 
them,'' Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In directives issued since the crash, the Federal Aviation  
Administration has ordered a series of safety changes on a variety 
of airplanes. They include new wiring checks on older aircraft, the 
installation of extra wire insulation and a prohibition on draining 
the center fuel tanks in 747s, a practice which can cause 
overheating in fuel-pump bearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hall and Loeb indicated the five-member safety board will  
likely recommend further safety precautions when it holds its final 
meeting about the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have our final board  
meeting and final report by the end of the year,'' the chairman 
said as he sat in his office with binders about the crash nearby. 
He said if there are delays, the meeting will occur by ``early 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-to-Paris flight exploded in a clear evening sky  
shortly after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport. The 
wreckage fell 13,000 feet into the waters off Long Island. There 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the following weeks, the Navy, FBI and other state, federal  
and local agencies mounted an extensive recovery operation and 
investigation. It included checks for bomb-toting terrorists and 
eyewitness reports that a missile was seen streaking toward the 
jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also partially rebuilt the airplane in a hangar in  
Calverton, N.Y., in their search for clues. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives of the victims plan a series of remembrances over  
the weekend, including a memorial service and the dedication of a 
monument. Both Hall and Loeb will attend and also deliver an 
investigation update to the families. 
</P>
<P>
	While some have speculated that the plane was blown out of the  
sky by terrorists or the military, the FBI concluded that no 
criminal act was involved. On Wednesday, Hall adamantly repeated 
that the plane was not harmed by a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stories will probably continue past my lifetime,'' he said.  
``One of the board's important roles is to protect the integrity of 
investigations and, in doing so, the integrity of the government we 
all work for.''

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	July 12  
</P>
<P>
	Austin (Texas) American-Statesman, on law enforcement racial  
profiling: 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, some officers have acknowledged that they do stop  
drivers because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Their admissions sparked a fiery national debate on stereotypes  
and the law. Lawmakers nationwide are scrambling to pass 
legislation requiring law enforcement agencies to record 
information on all traffic stops. That's fine as far as it goes, 
but legislation can't change the racial attitudes at the heart of 
this practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Every day, many blacks and Hispanics are stopped, searched and  
questioned because they fit the stereotypical image of a drug 
trafficker, car thief or some other criminal. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of several incidents nationwide, President Clinton  
issued an executive order last month. He called for federal 
law-enforcement agencies to collect, and make public data on the 
race, ethnicity, age and gender of all people they stop or arrest, 
and encouraged state agencies do the same. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Neither law-enforcement agencies nor the public benefit from a  
system that victimizes law-abiding citizens and erodes public 
confidence. Law enforcement officials need to make a good-faith 
effort, then, at gathering the information. If, as they claim, 
racial profiling is not a widespread practice, the data will show 
that. And the public's confidence will be strengthened. 

</P>
<P>
	July 10  
</P>
<P>
	The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., on George W. Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	It's obvious and not the least surprising that Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush sought and found safe haven in the National Guard in 1968. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Bush's service in the National Guard allows him to solemnly  
declare that he served his country, but in terms of military 
background, it clearly shows that the Texas governor is no chip off 
the old block. 
</P>
<P>
	His famous father, former President George Bush, in sharp  
contrast, volunteered for service in World War II and marched off 
to fight, as did so many other young men of that generation. The 
elder Bush became a genuine war hero as a young Navy combat pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the younger Bush is the leading candidate in the  
campaign for the Republican nomination, and it might already be too 
late to knock him out of the 2000 presidential race, particularly 
considering the pot of campaign gold Bush is sitting on. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's reached this point in spite of the fact that most of  
the country knows virtually nothing about him as a man or where he 
stands on political issues. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's way past time that the country began to learn more -- a lot  
more -- about the younger Bush, the man who would be a 
second-generation president. 

</P>
<P>
	July 7  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on the federal formula and  
HMOs: 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs throughout the country are going to ask their Medicare  
patients to pay more and, in some cases, will cut their benefits. 
And in some cases, the organizations will drop out of Medicare 
entirely. The result will force as many as a quarter of a million 
people nationwide to find new health providers. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't paint the HMOs as villains, as some politicians and  
federal officials are trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many factors involved, including inefficiency at some  
HMOs, but the problem in most cases is in how HMOs are reimbursed 
for their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The government uses a formula that results in some HMOs not  
being fully reimbursed for service. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Up until 1997, the government's Medicare formula reimbursed the  
HMOs at 95 percent of what was paid to fee-for-service health 
providers in the HMOs' localities, according to Stuart Butler, a 
policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation. In some instances, this 
might mean the HMOs were paid too much, and, in others, too little. 
</P>
<P>
	To fix things, Congress revamped the formula. But it's still a  
formula, still a way of dictating to businesses what they must 
provide in specified services at specified prices without talking 
local costs of living and a host of changing market issues into 
account. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 12  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to Medicare, what Americans need -- and Bill  
Clinton still fails to deliver -- is a market-oriented, new Medicare 
in which providers compete for customers who're rewarded for 
shopping for the best health care buy that meets their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	As a start Congress should lift caps on the number of medical  
savings accounts (MSAs) allowed by federal law MSA's would provide 
seniors a base benefit with which to purchase catastrophic health 
insurance and to build up savings for other health care needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington then should resume the dialog started by the reform  
commission to bring Medicare closer to a real long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this would be easier if Clinton would stop playing  
politics with a volatile and important public policy issue.

<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on jury award against General Motors:  
</P>
<P>
	A California jury this week handed down a $4.8-billion punitive  
damage award against General Motors in an auto accident in which 
passengers were horribly burned. Obviously, and understandably, the 
jury acted both out of sympathy with the victims and outrage 
against the auto maker. But it is virtually certain that any award 
of this size will be drastically reduced by either the trial judge 
or on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, public trust in product liability cases tried by juries  
might well be going down the drain with these excessive awards. 
Many legal experts believe that astronomical punitive damages 
ultimately will invite strict federal limits on awards. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This week's judgment ... went to survivors of a fiery crash that  
occurred when a 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended by a drunk 
driver. ... What damned GM before this jury was an internal 
document showing that the company calculated it would come out 
better financially by paying for accident injuries than making the 
Malibu's fuel system safer at a cost of $8.59 per car. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1978 case eerily similar to this one, $125 million in  
punitive damages involving Ford's Pinto was reduced to $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the states are trying to grapple with the  
unpredictability of punitive damages in liability cases, either 
imposing limits on the size of the awards or restricting conditions 
under which they can be imposed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is unique in having a civil jury system and in  
allowing juries to impose punitive damages. But unpredictable 
decisions might prove to be the weakest point in the American 
system. 

</P>

<P>
	The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, on Hillary Clinton's travel  
arrangements: 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Air Force, under the command of her husband, is flying  
Hillary Clinton around New York as she explores a possible Senate 
campaign. ... 
</P>
<P>
	She has already made 11 trips to the Empire State at a cost to  
taxpayers of $220,555, the Republican National Committee complains. 
Next week she plans to take another ``listening tour'' across the 
state and will do it in a military aircraft. Her spokesmen explain 
that the Secret Service recommends she take military planes for 
security reasons and that she is following campaign laws with care. 
...
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokesman explains that White House staffers are  
indeed working for her, but on their own time. They also put in a 
solid 40 hours a week for taxpayers, the White House stressed. And 
if she makes any trips for her campaign, then her campaign will 
reimburse the government for the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer she delays the official start of her campaign, the  
longer she can travel at taxpayers' expense as the first lady. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 12  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on the bald eagle:  
</P>
<P>
	The bald eagle's impending exit from the protected species list  
is surely something to celebrate, not least for the symbolism of 
the achievement. But let there be no mistaking the rarity of this 
victory over the forces of extinction, or the enormity of loss to 
which it makes exception. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Great extinctions of the past seem tied to catastrophic climate  
changes, triggered by such factors as huge volcanic eruptions or an 
asteroid's smashing into the earth. This time, the culprit is Homo 
sapiens -- sometimes called the ``exterminator species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contemporary climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions  
is already showing dramatic harm to corals and some other coastal 
plants and birds. But this remains a minor, if alarming, factor 
compared to such familiar contributors as habitat destruction (for 
agricultural, commercial and water development), pollution and 
introduction of exotic species. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered in this context, the salvation of the bald eagle or  
any single species is rather a small accomplishment -- unless it 
moves a certain other species to see the promise, as well as the 
necessity, in reforming these exterminating practices.

	The Marion (Ohio) Star, on women's World Cup soccer:  
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, young girls are flooding stadiums to see  
their idols. Not ... boys gyrating and crooning prepubescent love 
songs, or Britney Spears and her ilk with their bare midriffs, 
caked-on makeup and pouty lips, but 11 muscled young women joined 
in an unbeatable force. 
</P>
<P>
	Beating more than their opponents, women's World Cup soccer has  
taken the world, and America, by storm. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fantastic to have an American team making such a strong  
showing in a sport with fierce competition from around the world. 
After the men's poor performance in France made America look 
soccer-challenged, it's wonderful to see the women defending our 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The real coup, however, is not for American pride, but for  
America's girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's soccer has provided fresh new role models for young  
women. In a world full of dizzying media images, these athletes are 
a breath of fresh air.

	The Guardian, London, on demonstrations in Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	The violent demonstrations that have shaken Tehran and other  
cities during the past few days are an unusually public expression 
of deep-seated tensions within post-revolutionary Iran. 
Paradoxically -- and paradox is never far away in the land of the 
``Mercedes mullahs'' -- the protests could strengthen the hand of 
the reform-minded President Mohammad Khatami, or provoke a sharp 
conservative backlash that could prove his undoing. ... Khatami's 
is a canny path, balancing the temporal and the spiritual in a 
country where the middle way is not much trodden. But his business 
is transition, not tumult. He will not go as fast as many, 
particularly the young, would like. ... Given the limited choices 
available now, Khatami's unifying idea of a reformist Islamic state 
ruled by the ballot box is worth holding on to. 

</P>
<P>
	July 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Northern Ireland:  
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists ... are being asked to put their trust in  
(Prime Minister Tony) Blair rather than in the law. ... The Ulster 
Unionists executive, meanwhile, should stand back a little from the 
details and look at the big picture. The negotiations failed 
because the republicans offered no guarantee of peace -- an IRA 
commitment to a full decommissioning timetable, and some prior 
decommissioning of weapons. Why was such action not forthcoming? 
... The Prime Minister's ... quest for peace in Northern Ireland 
has been an extraordinary mixture of over-ambition and goodwill, 
and his tireless commitment commands respect. But the man who 
assailed Milosevic abroad -- perhaps the most powerful, and 
certainly the most popular, of our post-war prime ministers -- has 
retreated before a tiny band of terrorists at home. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Le Figaro, Paris, on protests in Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	Today, who cries, ``Down with despotism'' in the streets of  
Tehran? The youth, of course. But also their older brothers and 
sisters, the Islamic students who, once faithful in the first years 
of the revolution, have turned liberal. For them, anger rises 
quickly: 20 years ago, they vented it onto the shah. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the revolutionary path in Iran typical? Not quite. For the  
past two years, it's been the ruling power that has started a 
revolution in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the Iranian president is only trying to remove religion  
from the political field. The fight is not between the laymen and 
the clergy but between the Islamic civil society and Islamic 
despotism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khomeynist Iran has been for a long time what Cuba was for  
the Third World: a model of the successful revolution. Today, all 
eyes are on the Islamic ``perestroika.'' Most Iranians, two-thirds 
of whom are under 25, aspire to change. 
</P>
<P>
	In not understanding these Iranians -- or in understanding them  
all too well and wanting to stymie them -- the conservatives have 
perhaps plunged their country into a dangerous spiral. 

</P>
<P>
	July 13  
</P>
<P>
	Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, on Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	Revolution, it is said, swallows its children. But in its turn  
it is swallowed by its grandchildren, becoming a victim of the 
emergence of a new generation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Iran hasn't escaped this phenomenon. At the beginning, the  
mullahs' revolution swept away everything in its path. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For a time the Islamic revolution seemed to have survived the  
death of Ayatollah Khomeini. But his heirs -- like the imperial 
regime they overthrew -- considered themselves the guardians of the 
temple, holding on to their privileges, deaf and blind to the 
appearance of a new generation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer was an extreme symbol of the aspirations of modernity.  
The young (and female) crowd which celebrated the exploits of the 
national team in France was the same one which carried Mohammad 
Khatami, leader of the reformers, to the presidency with 70 percent 
of the votes. The same people who, today, defy the fading power of 
the conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	We have come full circle.

<P>
	Il Manifesto, Rome, on student demonstrations in Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	The student demonstrations that have exploded in Iran say simple  
things and pose complicated problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It is simple to observe that there is globalization, and that it  
is impossible to just keep a country under a theocratic mantle, and 
that even fundamentalism can become intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs of optimism from Iran. The world continues to  
change and not even fundamentalists can stop the change. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would be wrong to think that the student demonstrations  
are a homage to Western democracy, or an effort to get rid of 
Islam's cultural values. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on student protests:  
</P>
<P>
	It looks as if student power is proliferating in the Muslim  
countries. Student demonstrators on the streets of Tehran in the 
past week were similar to the ones last May in Indonesia, which 
changed the political landscape of the world's largest Muslim 
nation. Thousands of Malaysian students have protested on and off 
since the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim last year. Now, the Iranian students are returning to the 
streets with gusto. This time, they have in their minds a similar 
objective -- reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The interesting thing in today's Iran is this: two decades after  
the toppling of the Shah, student power is still a factor to be 
reckoned with. Images of student protesters pounding their chests 
like Chinese drums may scare those who are not familiar with the 
ferocity of Iranian revolutionary fervor. They want changes, and 
they want them now. ... The Iranian government must learn from 
history that no government, even that of the disgraced Shah of 
Iran, can survive determined Iranians on the street. 

</P>
<P>
	July 12  
</P>
<P>
	El Pais, Madrid, on Colombian peace process:  
</P>
<P>
	After all their violent attacks, the Revolutionary Armed Forces  
of Colombia (FARC) has a peculiar way of desiring peace. 
</P>
<P>
	President (Andres) Pastrana may be pursuing a fantasy in giving  
another opportunity to the insurgents by initiating conversations 
now scheduled for the 20th. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Given the impossibility of defeating the insurgents militarily,  
and with all the political investment the president has placed in 
searching for a compromise, there remains little alternative but to 
continue supporting the start of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidency of Pastrana has placed all its bets on this one  
and decisive card. But if there must be failure, the sooner this is 
clear, the better. 

</P>
<P>
	July 10  
</P>
<P>
	Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on Mideast peace process:  
</P>
<P>
	Although Prime Minister Ehud Barak's struggle for peacemaking  
should be given full credit, there is little cause for optimism. 
Discord could arise within his Labor Party and the other ruling 
parties in the process of resumed peacemaking negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Barak has taken an uncompromising attitude toward  
the dispute over the divided holy city, Jerusalem. The Palestinians 
want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as their capital, while the 
new Israeli prime minister has maintained that Jerusalem should 
remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	All this may make it difficult for Barak to gain headway in  
negotiations with the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Authority, which postponed a unilateral  
declaration of independence in May, has welcomed the Barak 
administration. The time has come to take concrete action to 
restart the peace process and end the decades-long strife. 
</P>
<P>
	It is essential for the international community to help bring  
the peace process to a successful conclusion. Among other things, 
we hope that the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton will 
play an active role in mediating the process.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Stadium Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A giant crane used for building Miller Park  
collapsed Wednesday onto the partially finished stadium, killing at 
least three people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' collapsed while trying to  
lift a section of the retractable roof, aerial photos shown on 
local television stations showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong winds in the area were gusting to about 30 mph at the  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Geoff Leber, a senior plastic surgery resident at the nearby  
Veterans Administration hospital, said he was taking photos of the 
crane's lift just before 5 p.m. but had gone back inside the 
hospital when a patient told him the crane collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just wondering how that crane could support all that  
weight. It was windy at the time,'' he said. When he looked back 
outside, ``you could see the whole structure inside the stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new ballpark for the Milwaukee Brewers is scheduled to open  
next season. Its most unique feature is the retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof is being built by Mitsubishi. The huge crane, soaring  
480 feet into the air, was used to lift seven sections of a roof 
structure with a total weight of 12,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	With about half the sections in place, the roof had been  
expected to be done in about November. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the 43,000-seat, grass-field ballpark had  
resulted in few accidents until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
being lowered into position collided with an aerial basket. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker fell 60 feet from the retractable roof May 10 and was  
hospitalized about a week with multiple injuries.

<HEADLINE> Hugh Downs To Report Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Veteran broadcast journalist Hugh Downs, who  
recently announced his retirement as host of ABC-TV's ``20/20'' 
news show, will begin working with the Internet video network 
iNEXTV Corp. this fall, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs, 78, who will leave ``20/20'' in September, will work on  
stories and projects for the New York-based iNEXTV, a provider of 
audio and visual content for the Internet. Downs, the company said, 
will have a lot of freedom in what he chooses to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	One project Downs will be involved in will be iNEXTV's Executive  
Branch TV, which will cover the White House and the activities of 
executive agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs' work will be shown on iNEXTV's network of three Internet  
video sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs joins CNN's Lou Dobbs as another high-profile journalist  
making a foray into the Internet. Dobbs quit CNN's ``Moneyline'' 
last month to launch Space.com, a Web site devoted to educating 
users about outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs began his career as a journalist with NBC after serving in  
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced he was leaving ABC in May, Downs hinted at his  
latest move. ``This fast-moving cybernetic age holds such challenge 
and opportunity that I now find it irresistible,'' he said in 
reference to new media.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com, the online superstore, likes  
to boast that ``If we don't have your book nobody does.'' An 
industry regulator says the claim is false and should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to interpret the slogan literally, it would  
discourage searches from other sources,'' said Nicholas Vianna, 
advertising review specialist with the National Advertising 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the book industry there are private books, local  
publishers, all kinds of books,'' Vianna said Tuesday. ``Some of 
the independent sellers make their livelihood on that special niche 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAD was responding to a complaint filed last December by the  
American Booksellers Association, which compiled a list of 100 
out-of-print titles and found 24 that were available only through 
competitors of Barnesandnoble.com. They included such obscure works 
as ``Cartels, Combines &AMP; Trusts in Post-War Germany'' and ``Studies 
in Machiavellianism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of independent booksellers complained because that  
slogan just wasn't accurate,'' said association president Richard 
Howorth, whose organization consists overwhelmingly of independent 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Barnesandnoble.com agreed to comply with last week's  
decision, as of Tuesday the slogan still appeared on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagreed with the NAD's recommendation but chose to comply  
because we were moving away from that advertising slogan,'' said 
spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating. ``We agreed to remove or modify the 
slogan over the next several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Advertising Division, part of the Council of Better  
Business Bureaus, is a self-regulating body established by the 
advertising industry. Compliance with NAD decisions is voluntary, 
but some cases are referred to the Federal Trade Commission.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ind. Star Recker Faces Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball star Luke  
Recker, injured in a weekend traffic accident that killed one 
person, will be released from the hospital on Thursday, but faces 
surgery for a broken wrist on Friday in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A review of his original X-rays following continued swelling  
on his left wrist led doctors to determine he does have a fracture 
of a small bone in his left wrist,'' Mercy spokesman Joe Wade Plunk 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be released from Mercy Hospital in the morning. But he  
is going in for surgery Friday at Methodist Hospital in 
Indianapolis,'' Plunk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, who transferred to Arizona after last season, severely  
lacerated his left ear in the three-vehicle accident Saturday night 
that killed the driver of the car Recker was in. Recker's 
girlfriend, Kelly Craig, 19, and her brother, Jason Craig, 17, both 
of Jasper, Ind., were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk said Recker seemed in good spirits during a visit  
Wednesday, but ``his main concern is his girlfriend, who is in the 
hospital in Farmington, New Mexico. He more or less feels helpless 
to help her, and now he's going back to Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Craig, who suffered a spinal fracture and partial  
paralysis, remained in serious condition at San Juan Regional 
Medical Center in Farmington, while Jason Craig remained critical 
with a head injury, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were injured in the accident near  
Durango, in southwestern Colorado. Recker was a passenger in a 
vehicle driven by John Hollberg, 23, of Senoia, Ga., who was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the pickup who allegedly caused the accident, Bob  
Hardwick, 21, of Durango, was being held on $50,000 bond for 
investigation of vehicular homicide, reckless driving, driving 
under the influence, careless driving resulting in bodily injury 
and vehicular assault.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Moves Vs. Monfort Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea has accused Monfort Inc.  
of illegally upgrading beef quality certificates and banned the 
American meat packer from bidding on government purchases of 
imported beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said Wednesday it took the  
action after 313 tons of Monfort meat sold to the government in 
November was found to have been improperly upgraded to ``choice'' 
from ``no grade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action dealt a further blow to Monfort, whose 30 percent  
share of South Korea's growing imported beef market has already 
been hurt by a trademark dispute with its former South Korean 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials said they were investigating an allegation  
that Monfort had systematically upgraded U.S. Department of 
Agriculture certificates on its meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this a serious violation. There will be harsher  
punishment if we find similar violations in beef sold to private 
distributors as well,'' said Kim Jong-bin, a ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
	The government buys about one-third of at least 200,000 tons of  
beef that South Korea promised to import annually under the World 
Trade Organization free trade pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also ordered Viteck and Unicorp --  
California-based meat exporters which shipped the Monfort beef -- to 
pay $76,077 in damages. They were also banned from South Korea for 
1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Viteck and Unicorp were reportedly owned by the family of Kim  
Gap-su, a Korean-American who had worked as Monfort's South Korean 
distributor for 10 years until he was fired in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The certificate was altered while the meat was going through  
Mr. Kim's hands,'' said Lee Soo-yeon of Seoul's MediCom, a public 
relations firm that speaks for Monfort. ``Monfort had no knowledge 
of what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, now in the United States, was not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Monfort filed a lawsuit in April, accusing Kim of registering a  
Monfort trademark in Korea in 1993 in his own company's name 
without Monfort's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Kim persuaded South Korea's customs  
authorities to block entry to 776 tons of Monfort beef, saying his 
trademark registration gave him exclusive rights to the Monfort 
label in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The import ban ended in June when Monfort won a preliminary  
injunction barring Kim from enforcing his trademark rights pending 
a ruling on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Monfort, of Greeley, Colo., is owned by food giant ConAgra Inc.

<HEADLINE> Extension Sought in Ramsey Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The district attorney's office wants funds  
to extend the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury session into August. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury probe into the child beauty queen's December 1996  
killing began last September and is now funded through the end of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working on a request,'' said Assistant District  
Attorney Bill Wise on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, agencies investigating the Ramsey case have spent an  
estimated $1.74 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has not met since May 25. During that period,  
Boulder detectives have been conducting additional investigation 
into JonBenet's killing, collecting DNA samples from some witnesses 
and interviewing others on specific details about Patsy Ramsey, 
JonBenet's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy and John Ramsey are considered suspects in the murder of  
their child, who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of 
their Boulder home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who moved to Atlanta with their son, Burke, in July  
1997, have maintained their innocence.

<HEADLINE> Club for Those Who Don't Save Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- There's a club for which the rich and not-so-rich,  
the old and not-so-old, are automatically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Stone, a retirement expert at the College for Financial  
Planning, calls it the Drifters Club. It extends ownership to 
anyone who isn't saving adequately for his or her retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	British pop singer Elton John, for example, is a full member of  
the club, according to Stone, an academic associate at the college. 
</P>
<P>
	John, 52, spends so much money, reportedly $400,000 a week on  
credit cards, that he recently requested a $40 million loan to pay 
off his bills, according to recent media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the Drifters Club is widespread, cutting across  
all ages and all incomes levels, according to Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the example of a fictitious couple Stone calls Tina and  
Jack Ames. Tina and Jack are each 55. Their children are grown. 
Jack works in a management position earning $55,000; Tina is a 
self-employed real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
	While her income varies year to year, their combined income  
averages roughly $140,000a year. Tina saves nothing in a retirement 
account, citing the ups and downs and expenses of her business. 
Jack only recently started saving $2,000 in an individual 
retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with this picture?'' asks Stone. ``The Ames are a  
relatively affluent couple, yet they are putting aside little for 
the future. Like Elton John, they are parked on the tracks and 
don't see the train coming. Neither shows any urgency or concern. 
Neither has a plan or even a goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone says it's imnportant that the couple develop a spending  
plan and begin saving toward retirement immediately. He emphasizes 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	If the couple wants to retire at 65, only 10 years away, they  
could begin saving $25,000 a year on a tax-deferred basis -- a 
realistic goal considering they no longer have children to raise. 
In 10 years, earning 12 percent a year, they would accumulate 
$569,011 before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if they delay their savings plan one year, they would  
accumulate only $483,045 by age 65, leaving them a nest egg that is 
15 percent smaller. If they wait two years before starting to save, 
their nest egg will be almost 29 percent smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Ames, time is important because they have so few years  
left to fund their retirement,'' Stone says. Even if they push 
retirement back to age 70, a one-year delay before starting to save 
leaves a 13 percent smaller nest egg, and a two-year delay shrinks 
it by 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To get the Ames out of the Drifters Club, Stone says, they need  
to start by calculating their net worth -- their assets minus their 
liabilities. This balance sheet will provide the benchmark to gauge 
their future progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to establish a formal spending plan. First,  
they must list their approximate annual income, even though theirs 
varies. Then they need to write down their annual expenses, 
preferably broken down by categories. 
</P>
<P>
	This might include tracking for a month or two every penny they  
spend in cash -- often the ``black hole'' of spending. Once they 
know where their money is coming from, and especially where it is 
going, they can prioritize their spending in order to free up 
$25,000 to put into their retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to examine the list of their income and expenses,  
cut some expenses and stop spending their tomorrows,'' Stone says. 
``If they see the importance of saving for retirement, they will 
find the dollars in their spending pattern and redirect them to 
savings. The key is control: learning how we spend out money 
enables us not to spend it. A spending and savings plan gives us 
that control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spending and savings plan is the one way for the Ames to  
cancel their membership in the Drifters Club. It's also a strategy 
Elton John might want to consider, Stone says.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Inmate Called a 'Predator' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Prosecutors say a 94-year-old man -- the  
oldest inmate in Wisconsin's prison system -- should remain confined 
when his prison term ends this month because he is still a 
dangerous sexual predator. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted child molester Ellef Ellefson is an ``untreated  
pedophile,'' prosecutor William Hanrahan said at a hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lifelong pattern of offending, from 1937 when he was  
a Boy Scout leader to the time he was an octogenarian,'' Hanrahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellefson is due to be released July 27 after being imprisoned  
for first-degree sexual assault, but state predator laws permit 
judges to continue an inmates' confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanrahan said further commitment is the only way to protect the  
public from Ellefson, whose last offense was in La Crosse in 1990 
when he molested three boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older people are subject to stereotypes,'' Hanrahan said.  
``They're presumed not to experience human emotions like happiness, 
rage or sexual urges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ramona Gonzalez ordered Ellefson transferred to a mental  
health institute for evaluation. The judge scheduled another 
hearing for Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	If a jury finds he is still sexually dangerous, the judge could  
commit him to a mental hospital for sexual offender treatment -- 
possibly for the rest of his life. If not, he will be paroled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellefson's attorney declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> How Atlanta Kid Survived Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Deleane Briskey's home had seen violence before  
the massacre that only her young son would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Four times in recent months, police had been called to the  
single-story house -- twice after fights between Ms. Briskey's 
boyfriend and her ex-husband. But when police arrived on Monday, 
they found the bodies of Ms. Briskey, four of her children and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole survivor, 11-year-old Santonio Lucas, told police his  
mother's boyfriend, Cyrano Marks, dragged him through the house as 
he killed. Marks then turned the gun on himself, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio told police Marks was angry that she wanted to end  
their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Marks, 39, herded Ms. Briskey, her sister and four  
children into the master bedroom, but the family scattered when he 
brandished a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all tried to run, but none were able to escape the  
house,'' said Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson. Marks then dragged 
Santonio with him from room to room as he shot the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio said he managed to break free and run into a closet.  
Marks found him, placed a pillow in front of the boy's face and 
pulled the trigger. The weapon jammed. Marks stepped back, fiddled 
with the gun and fired again. The bullet smashed through the boy's 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio fell to the ground and played dead. Moments later, he  
heard another shot. Marks had turned the gun on himself, but 
Santonio feared the killer was still alive. He huddled in a closet 
for eight hours before running next door to the home of Eugene 
Broadus. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadus heard the shots at 6:45 a.m., but assumed they were  
firecrackers. He was gone when Santonio knocked on his door around 
2:30 p.m. His wife told him what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Would you help me? My stepdaddy just killed my mom,  
my auntie and all my family,''' Broadus said. ``He was just sucking 
his thumb the whole time.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Killer Had Violent Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The 11-year-old boy who survived the massacre of  
most of his family, shot in the elbow but escaping death when their 
assailant's gun misfired, was visited today by relatives and the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't too good. He's still hurting from it,'' said the  
boy's father, David Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven-year-old Santonio Lucas told police his mother's  
boyfriend, Cyrano Marks, dragged him through their house Monday as 
he killed. Marks then turned the gun on himself, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the bodies of Santonio's mother, Deleane Briskey,  
four of her children, her sister, and Marks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Toni McLaurin said doctors hope that after Santonio  
undergoes surgery early next week he will soon be able to move the 
elbow again. But she said the boy will have to compensate if he 
ever plays sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never be a normal elbow, but we should be able to  
restore function,'' the physician said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio's uncle, Dwight Lucas, said the boy and his 10-year-old  
sister, Jalisa, who wasn't home at the time of the shootings, will 
live with their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell also visited Santonio at the hospital this  
morning. ``I just tried to reassure him that we care about him,'' 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio told police that Marks was angry that she wanted to end  
their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Marks, 39, herded Ms. Briskey, her sister and four  
children into the master bedroom, but the family scattered when he 
brandished a pistol.

actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine him taking the life of innocent kids,'' she  
told WSB-TV. ``I just can't explain it. ... I just want the

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Turn to Minors for Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ted Nolan and Ron Low had NHL coaching  
credentials. But Curt Fraser had the inside track with the man who 
was doing the hiring for the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's newest team introduced Fraser as its first coach  
Wednesday, picking a 41-year-old who had great success in the minor 
leagues but has never coached at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you hire someone you've known previously, you're over the  
first hurdle,'' said Thrashers general manager Don Waddell, who 
picked Fraser over Nolan and Low. ``I know what he's capable of and 
he knows what I'm capable of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser and Waddell have been close friends since they teamed up  
in 1995 to build an International Hockey League expansion franchise 
in Orlando. The Solar Bears reached the league finals in their 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell left after two years in Orlando to take a job with the  
Detroit Red Wings, then moved on to the Thrashers. Fraser remained 
behind to coach the Solar Bears, leading them to the IHL finals 
again this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The four years I had in the `I' trained me well,'' said  
Fraser, who had a 192-111-25 record in Orlando, the league's 
second-best mark during that span. ``I'm prepared for the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell waited until just 80 days before the team's first game  
to hire a coach, paring the list of candidates to three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan was a coach of the year with the Buffalo Sabres, Low  
coached the Edmonton Oilers for 4 1/2 years, but Fraser wound up 
getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell spent last weekend mulling his choice, making sure in  
his own mind that he wasn't hiring Fraser simply because of their 
personal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he the best guy? Is Ron Low the best guy? Is Ted Nolan the  
best guy,'' Waddell asked himself. ``Honestly, I came to the 
decision that Curt was the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was a feisty, aggressive left-winger during a 12-year NHL  
career, scoring 193 goals and racking up 1,306 penalty minutes 
while playing for Vancouver, Chicago and Minnesota. He still 
chuckles at the thought of his on-ice battles with former Atlanta 
Flames tough guy Willi Plett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 12 years in the NHL,'' Fraser said. ``I know the  
league. I know the players. I know how they feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as his playing career ended in 1990, he began plotting  
his return to the NHL as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't care if it took me two years, 10 years or 15 years,''  
Fraser said, ``that's what I wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four years with the IHL's Milwaukee Admirals -- two as  
an assistant coach, two as a head coach. After one season with 
Syracuse of the American Hockey League, he joined Waddell in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next four years, the Solar Bears won eight of 12  
playoff series and had a 17-4 record in playoff elimination games. 
This past season, they became the first team in the IHL's 54-year 
history to rally from an 0-3 deficit in a best-of-7 series, beating 
Detroit in the Eastern Conference finals before losing to Houston 
4-3 in the Turner Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my strength as a coach is being very resilient,''  
Fraser said. ``I'm good at refocusing my teams. All of my teams 
have responded well to being down and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell initially wanted to hire a coach with NHL experience,  
but he began to change his mind as he watched Ken Hitchcock -- who 
formerly coached in the IHL -- guide the Dallas Stars to the Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I closed the process, I was eliminating some good  
people,'' Waddell said. ``We were looking for someone to grow with 
the program. When you get someone who's been coaching a long time, 
they can get set in their ways. This team is going to change a lot 
over the next couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, who signed a three-year contract, takes over a team that  
figures to struggle for at least a couple of seasons -- particularly 
at the offensive end of the ice. Still, he vowed the Thrashers 
won't be trying to win every game 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we want to sit back and be a defensive team? No,'' Fraser  
said. ``This team is going to be very aggressive. It's going to be 
a team the fans will enjoy coming out to see.''

<HEADLINE> Cruise Line Discloses Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Carnival Cruise Lines has disclosed that its crew  
members were accused of sexual assault 62 times in a five-year span 
ending last summer, and a former employee who says she was raped 
claims the company tried to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival disclosed the scope of the assaults Tuesday under  
orders from a judge who is hearing the woman's lawsuit against the 
Miami-based cruise line. The complaints involved alleged incidents 
among the crew and between the crew and guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of alleged incidents -- and bear in mind that it is  
a list of allegations, not necessarily substantiated incidents -- 
includes everything from sexual harassment complaints by crew to an 
unwanted kiss to matters of a more serious sexual nature,'' 
Carnival attorney Curtis Mase said. ``Many of the incidents do not 
involve alleged rape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who worked for Carnival for three years before she  
quit in 1998, alleged a fellow officer raped her last August in her 
cabin aboard the cruise ship Imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Fox, an attorney for the woman, said Carnival tried to  
cover it up and assisted the perpetrator in fleeing the country 
back to Italy before the FBI could question and detain him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mase said the assailant in her case, Italian engineer Yurij  
Senes, was fired for drinking within six hours of going on duty and 
for being tardy. He said that Senes was sent to Italy ``in 
accordance with federal repatriation laws'' for fired workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senes was charged in September with one federal count of rape on  
the high seas, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, said 
U.S. Attorney Jennifer Prior in Miami. Trial is set for November. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman is seeking unspecified damages and wants Carnival to  
supply ships with special kits for rape victims and to assist 
prosecutors' efforts to win Senes' extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mase said the cruise line carried more than 6.5 million guests  
along with tens of thousands of crew members during the five-year 
period when the incidents allegedly occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	When accused last fall of covering up assault claims, Carnival  
responded by saying it is ``at least 10 times more likely for a 
sexual assault to occur in a small town in America than on a cruise 
ship.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Expected To End School Busing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A generation after Boston erupted in violence over  
court-ordered busing to desegregate public schools, the school 
board was expected to end busing in a city where the vast majority 
of pupils are now minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying all of this is a dose of good old common sense that  
says `Let's move on. It's not the '70s. It's not the '80s. It's the 
end of the '90s,''' said Superintendent Thomas Payzant, flanked at 
a news conference by three dozen parents, politicians and community 
leaders -- black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	Much has changed since the 1974 federal court order that forced  
the city to bus white students into black neighborhoods and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	The order sparked huge protests, staining the city's reputation  
as white parents hurled rocks and epithets at buses that brought 
black children into their neighborhoods, then refused to let their 
own attend black schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with whites having pulled out of the city in past years  
and a burgeoning immigrant population having moved in, the school 
system has become 85 percent minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a group of white parents filed a lawsuit alleging  
that the busing policy discriminates against their children by 
denying them access to their chosen schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal put forth by Payzant, Boston parents would  
still get to choose where they want to send their children to 
school. Race, however, will not be a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The school department would evaluate other criteria when  
deciding which students attend which schools: the proximity of the 
child's home to the school; whether he or she has any siblings 
there; and the results of a yearly school choice lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said racial issues have distracted  
the city from what should be its main goal: improving teaching and 
student learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy would take effect in the fall of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Busing in the transportation sense would still exist. There  
aren't enough neighborhood schools to allow every one of the city's 
63,000 students to walk, and some parents would opt to send their 
children to schools across town. 
</P>
<P>
	Menino has promised to build six new neighborhood schools in the  
most impoverished areas of the city that need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the proposed change would not significantly  
change the racial breakdown of the schools because the city's 
population is now about 85 percent minority -- 49 percent black, 26 
percent Hispanic and 9 percent Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few of the city's 129 schools would end up with a mostly  
white student body, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago, about 48 percent of the city's school  
children were minority. Back then, schools were either entirely 
white or black. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, who represents some of the city's  
predominantly black areas, said Boston still has much work to do in 
ensuring that all its schools are of equal caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said, the mere fact that blacks and whites were  
together endorsing the new proposal shows how much the city has 
changed over 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Withdrawing From GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- John Kasich's campaign for the Republican  
presidential nomination, short of both cash and public support, is 
coming to an end without ever officially beginning, GOP officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-term Ohio congressman was expected to announce today  
that he is leaving the 2000 presidential race. Republican 
officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The 
Associated Press in Washington on Tuesday that Kasich would drop 
out and endorse the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich scheduled announcements today in Columbus and in  
Washington, where Bush was expected to appear. Kasich campaign 
spokesman Todd Harris declined to comment on Kasich's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait for John Kasich's announcement,'' Bush said  
as he arrived in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich would be the second candidate in two days to announce his  
withdrawal from consideration for the Republican nomination for 
president. New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith said Tuesday he was 
quitting the party and running for president as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Kasich never became an announced candidate for the  
nomination, having set up an exploratory committee to finance his 
travels. But there was never any doubt that he was running hard, 
and he made many trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that 
will hold the first caucuses and primary, respectively, of the 
campaign season in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls showed Kasich in single digits and unable to break  
into the tier of contenders closest to Bush. He was able to raise 
only $1.6 million in the first six months of 1999, compared with 
Bush's total of $36.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think John's always been realistic about this thing,  
realistic about his fund raising,'' said Robert Bennett, chairman 
of the Ohio Republican Party since 1988. ``That's why he's got an 
exploratory committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, 47, has used the platform of the House Budget Committee,  
which he has chaired since the Republicans took over Congress in 
1995, to preach fiscal conservatism. He had a lead role in the 
GOP's plans to cut spending and balance the budget and has been a 
critic of government subsidies to business and industry, which he 
calls ``corporate welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials also said they did not expect Kasich to  
reverse a decision to leave Congress at the end of his term.

<HEADLINE> PBS Decried in Political Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Republicans on Capitol Hill are demanding a review  
of funding for public broadcasting after learning that WGBH-TV gave 
a list of its donors to the Democrats -- a swap that came to light 
after a 4-year-old ``Barney'' fan started getting fund-raising 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode could threaten funding for public broadcasting  
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	WGBH have acknowledged giving a list of donors' names earlier  
this year to the Democratic National Committee, despite tax laws 
that prohibit public stations from playing political favorites. The 
station received in return a list of contributors to the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unfortunate if members of Congress take action  
against the whole system because one member made a mistake,'' said 
Angela Lifsey, a WGBH spokeswoman. ``What happened was not a 
partisan situation. It was the result of administrative errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee had been scheduled to consider  
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for public broadcasting 
on Wednesday, but the meeting was postponed because of the furor. 
Lawmakers said they want to hold a hearing first to air their 
concerns, probably in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the Commerce Committee's  
telecommunications subcommittee, said he will reduce his funding 
proposal for public broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't punitive,'' said Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson.  
But Johnson said: ``The worst part about this whole thing is that 
it feeds the old stereotypes. There are a number of people in our 
party who are absolutely convinced that public broadcasting is in 
the hip pocket of the Democratic Party and liberals in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name swap was discovered in May after Sam Black, a  
4-year-old boy from Wellesley who watches public TV's ``Barney,'' 
began receiving mail from the DNC, including an ``agenda survey'' 
and a fund-raising pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Jody Black, had donated $40 to WGBH last fall in  
gratitude for its children's programs. She made the donation in her 
name and Sam's. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the station mistakenly gave a few thousand names  
to the DNC in exchange for an equal number of names. The deal was 
made by new employees who weren't aware of station policy, WGBH 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the commerce subcommittee's ranking  
Democrat, hopes Tauzin's plan still provides for an adequate 
increase for public broadcasting, said his spokesman, David 
Moulton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that there are very strong opponents of public  
broadcasting who will seize any opportunity to try to hurt that 
system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Republican party poked fun at the controversy  
by issuing a news release about a ``secret Democrat plan'' to use 
well-known PBS shows to promote Massachusetts Democrats. Among the 
ideas: ``Barney the Dinosaur'' will now be called ``Barney Frank 
the Dinosaur'' -- a reference to the Massachusetts congressman.

<HEADLINE> Time Extended for Penguins Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux was granted an additional 10  
days to complete his proposal to buy the bankrupt Pittsburgh 
Penguins and work out details with investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame center has put together a $50 million plan to  
buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz on Wednesday gave  
Lemieux until July 26. The deadline had been Friday, but Lemieux's 
lawyers said they needed more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The details, in principle, have all been resolved,'' said  
Michael Kaminski, a bankruptcy lawyer for the Penguins. ``It's just 
a lot of lawyer-intensive work papering the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is under protection from creditors. Lemieux's proposal  
could remove the Penguins from court supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux must come up with the $50 million to purchase the club  
and reach agreements with SMG Inc., the Penguins landlord at the 
Civic Arena, and broadcaster Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Lemieux's lawyers -- Chuck Greenberg and Douglas Campbell  
-- did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaminski said details of the deal were still being worked out  
with one key investor, Los Angeles supermarket executive Ronald 
Burkle. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle is a 46-year-old former chairman of Fred Meyer Inc., the  
fifth-largest grocery store chain in the nation before merging with 
Kroger Corp. this spring. He is expected to put up $20 million of 
the $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Penguins owner Roger Marino says he would be willing to  
put up $2 million or possibly more if that would prevent Lemieux's 
deal from falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was earlier part of the Lemieux plan. Marino's lawyer,  
Harry Manion, said his client would prefer to stay out of the deal, 
not wanting to go from owner to limited partner.

<HEADLINE> Girl With Brain Partially Removed OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A teen-ager plagued by seizures caused by a  
deadly neurological condition was moving and starting to open her 
eyes today after surgeons removed half of her brain to block the 
spread of her rare disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Ramirez was in fair condition at Johns Hopkins Medical  
Center, said her surgeon, Dr. Benjamin Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Scar tissue from previous operations slowed the surgery that  
lasted nine hours Tuesday, but there were ``no real 
complications,'' Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation removed the left side of Amber's brain -- the side  
that controls speech and fine motor movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived all my life with seizures,'' Amber said before the  
operation. ``I'm tired of having to put up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery could leave 15-year-old Amber without the ability to  
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber, who was diagnosed with Rasmussen's disease, was making  
some sounds and was starting to open her eyes, and she grabbed his 
hand when she was stimulated, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also moved her left arm and leg when stimulated, said Dr.  
John Freeman, director of the pediatric epilepsy program at 
Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate she will be able to use her arm, not for fine  
movement, but as a helper hand,'' Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the surgery, the Lincoln, Neb., girl faced the  
possibility of mental retardation, paralysis and even death as the 
disease gradually attacked her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rasmussen's syndrome eats away at one side of the brain like a  
PAC Man,'' Freeman said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber and her mother, Sheri Ramirez, knew that the girl was  
considered old for the procedure. But Carson said he was confident 
the procedure will work, though she will need years of 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a bit older than most patients who had a hemispherectomy  
but she's certainly not the oldest patient we've operated on,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's disease began with a limp in 1993, when she was 9. She  
couldn't remember getting hurt, but her right foot ached. She was 
in a wheelchair two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the seizures began, one each hour, pulling on her right leg  
and arm until she wanted to scream from the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	She was eventually diagnosed with Rasmussen's syndrome, which  
affects about 1,000 people worldwide. Medication and surgery to 
remove diseased snippets of brain tissue slowed the disease but 
could not stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's doctors say the remaining portion of her brain will try  
to compensate for the tissue removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a hemispherectomy, the other side of the brain picks up  
a lot of function,'' Freeman said. ``Intelligence and memory 
remain, but the patient will walk with a limp and will not be able 
to use their opposite hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ramirez said she and her daughter understood that the  
rehabilitation would be long and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought a lot about the future when making our decision. We  
thought about Amber maybe being able to leave home and being 
independent,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ``Amber wanted to get rid of her 
seizures, to not have to have somebody walk two steps behind her 
all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Berkeley Station Rocked by Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Public radio station KPFA, a longtime  
outlet for radical politics in famously liberal Berkeley, has been 
rocked by arrests, firings and demonstrations in what staff members 
see as a battle against corporate conformity. 
</P>
<P>
	Staffers say the station's parent company, the nonprofit  
Pacifica Foundation, is trying to make KPFA more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people have come in and have stolen the station,'' said  
Lavarn Williams, one of some 30 people holding a day-long protest 
outside the station Wednesday morning. ``Instead of free speech, 
they want government-controlled speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams is a consultant brought in to help the station --  
one of the nation's oldest listener-supported stations -- celebrate 
its 50th anniversary. Instead, she found herself caught up in an 
escalating series of clashes over KPFA's soul. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest has gotten so bad that on Wednesday, the doors were  
locked and managers were playing tapes of old shows. ``Everyone at 
KPFA has been placed on administrative leave until we're able to 
cool things off,'' said Pacifica spokeswoman Elan Fabbri. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime staffers say Pacifica's board wants to give KPFA a more  
conventional image so that it can attract corporate donations. They 
also suspect that Pacifica, which owns five radio stations, is 
interested in selling KPFA. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of those contentions is true, Ms. Fabbri said. ``There  
is no attempt to `corporatize.' That's a nice little buzzword 
that's been thrown into this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	KPFA, founded by World War II conscientious objectors, plays a  
mix of music, public affairs and educational programming. The 
station claims to have been the first to play the Grateful Dead. 
Over the years, it also broadcast Allen Ginsberg reading ``Howl!'' 
and Patty Hearst, the kidnapped newspaper heiress, denouncing her 
parents as ``capitalist pigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dissent over the future of KPFA has been building since April,  
when popular general manager Nicole Sawaya was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two longtime programmers, broadcaster Larry Bensky and volunteer  
folk music host Robbie Osman, were later fired for denouncing 
management policies on the air. Last month, 13 people were arrested 
for trespassing as they demonstrated against those firings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, Dennis Bernstein, host of a public affairs  
program called ``Flashpoints,'' was yanked off the air for talking 
about conflicts with the station's management. That violated orders 
not to report on growing tensions between KPFA and its parent 
company, Ms. Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was told he was being put on administrative leave  
after his program ended, but his ensuing tussle with Pacifica 
guards was heard on the air. ``Those are my personal papers!'' 
Bernstein was heard yelling. ``Don't go into my desk!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management cut off the newscast and, in a quintessentially  
Berkeley moment, replaced the evening news with a taped 
Marxist-Maoist analysis of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, seven other KPFA employees and more than 40  
protesters were arrested Tuesday night for trespassing after they 
refused to leave the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted that I would be pulled from the air by  
people who founded the station to stand as a bastion of free 
speech,'' Bernstein said later. ``This is an absolute case of 
censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the station say it is not so much a radical forum  
as one of the last remaining outlets for alternative points of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country wants to manufacture consent,'' said retired  
anatomy professor Jack Chamberlain, who held up a sign reading 
``Speak Free or Die'' outside KPFA.

<HEADLINE> Holland Mulls Coaching Minnesota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Terry Holland, former basketball coach at  
Virginia and the school's athletic director for four years, says he 
expects to decide by the weekend whether to become basketball coach 
at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	In a copyright story for Thursday's editions, the Star Tribune  
said Holland was offered a seven-year contract that would pay him 
close to $1 million per year, $500,000 of that from outside sources 
such as basketball camps and shoe deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland told the newspaper after he met with the search  
committee and toured the facilities Wednesday that he hadn't yet 
accepted the job. He planned to fly back to Virginia on Thursday 
morning to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is making sure for both parties that it is the  
right thing,'' Holland said. ``As I mentioned earlier, a lot of 
people have said to me, and they have probably said to folks here 
at the University of Minnesota, this is a natural. But we need to 
make sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said he, athletic director Mark Dienhart and assistant  
AD Jeff Schemmel talked about how his contract should be 
structured. There has been criticism about the contract of Clem 
Haskins, who resigned in wake of an academic fraud scandal but got 
a $1.5 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still working on the contract,'' Holland said. ``We  
haven't come to any final conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland told the Star Tribune he does not want to return to  
administration if he takes the Minnesota job.

	``I would want a contract that very clearly says that, that I'm  
here to coach basketball for the rest of my career,'' he said. ``If 
I do this, I certainly have no interest in going back into 
administration again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland had a 418-216 record in 21 seasons as coach at Davidson  
and Virginia, holding the latter job from 1975 through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland comes highly recommended.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those pushing Holland for the job are Big Ten commissioner  
Jim Delany, Wake Forest coach Dave Odom and Kentucky athletic 
director C.M. Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	If Holland, one of the highest-paid athletic directors in the  
country at about $250,000 a year, turns down the Gophers, Jim 
Crews, a former Indiana assistant and head coach at Evansville the 
past 13 years, is said to be next on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Schemmel made it clear Holland is their first choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've offered him the job,'' Schemmel told the Star Tribune.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan Shells Indian Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Pakistani artillery shells hit an  
Indian town in Kashmir today even as some Islamic fighters withdrew 
from India's portion of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	India sent reconnaissance jets over the 1972 cease-fire line  
that divides Kashmir to ensure that Pakistan-based fighters are 
moving back from bunkered positions they had seized on strategic 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Pakistan's agreement with President Clinton to take  
``concrete steps'' to end the fighting in Kashmir, its artillery 
have shelled India's only highway through northern Kashmir for two 
consecutive nights and intermittently hit towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Islamabad, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf denied  
Pakistani troops were continuing to fire on Indian positions. ``To 
my knowledge, we are not involved in any shelling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Artillery fire, however, has come from positions inside  
Pakistan, where Pakistani troops are positioned. The Islamic 
fighters are not known to have artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian officers speculate it is meant to cover the retreat,  
although India had agreed Sunday, during a meeting between the two 
nations' military chiefs, that withdrawing fighters would not be 
fired upon. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelling continued into the daylight hours today, hitting  
the Indian town of Dras, where India has a major military presence. 
Four houses were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said Indian soldiers were wounded in exchanges of small  
arms fire with resistant infiltrators in Mushkoh Valley to the west 
of Dras, and Batalik to the east. In Batalik, officers said their 
soldiers can see Islamic fighters who have taken positions right on 
the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the Siachen Glacier, outside the area covered by the  
agreement to disengage forces, Indian jets spotted cement bunkers 
and airstrikes appear imminent, an intelligence officer told The 
Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the three bunkers were spotted near Turtuk, in a valley  
near the mountains of Batalik, where some of the heaviest fighting 
has taken place since May. More than 1,200 combatants have been 
reported killed in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian army seized Turtuk in the last war with Pakistan in  
1971. About 25 people from the town were caught last month with 
stores of weapons and explosives, and were suspected to be working 
with Pakistan-based fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	At Bandipora, 10 miles from the cease-fire line, police said  
separatist militants attacked a heavily guarded paramilitary police 
camp Tuesday and shot to death a senior officer, three of his men 
and a soldier's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, a commando force from New Delhi stormed the  
barracks where militants had held 12 soldiers' relatives hostage 
overnight. All the civilians were rescued and the building was 
reduced to rubble after a two-hour firefight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	India has said it will consider resuming peace talks with  
Pakistan that began in February only after the last intruder has 
left its territory. India's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Raminder 
Singh Jassal, has said that India holds Pakistan responsible for 
supporting terrorist acts by the militants in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan says it has no control over what it calls freedom  
fighters in Muslim-majority Kashmir who are seeking independence 
from the mostly Hindu India or a merger with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining  
independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Tallies HMO Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Holding firm for a second day, Senate  
Republicans refused to extend new HMO rules to all 161 million 
people with private health insurance on Wednesday. GOP leaders 
crafted alternatives to other Democratic proposals in an effort to 
blunt political damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of Republicans have defected in a series of votes  
this week over the details of new patient protections. That's 
partly because Republicans answered -- or promised to answer -- 
Democratic proposals on emergency room care, women's health and 
clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why people are sticking together, because they know we  
are going to deliver on the substance,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, 
R-Tenn., who is helping to lead the GOP effort. ``That's the 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate considered more than a half-dozen issues Wednesday,  
including clinical trials, breast cancer treatments, emergency room 
treatments, access to specialists and a new tax deduction for 
long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted, 52-48, to restrict many of the provisions to  
the 48 million Americans whose health plans fall outside state 
regulation. Democrats wanted to cover all 161 million people with 
private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also agreed to require health insurance companies to  
pay for overnight hospital stays when women are treated for breast 
cancer, if a doctor recommends it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on breast cancer came a day after Republicans rejected  
a similar, broader Democratic measure and promised to produce their 
own version. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, all 45 Democrats balked at the GOP breast  
cancer provision because it also eliminated a Democratic amendment 
that would have allowed easier access to experimental treatments. 
Democrats tried to get the Senate to include both provisions, but 
Republicans refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Republicans promised to produce their own amendment on  
experimental treatments by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll deliver,'' Frist said, promising to fold some ``very  
good'' Democratic ideas into the final GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major issue yet to be considered is the right to sue.  
Democrats want to give patients who are denied care the power to 
take their health plans to court. That issue was set for debate 
Thursday, when the Senate will take a final vote on the HMO 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Senate is virtually certain to approve the  
Republican plan, which President Clinton has signaled he will veto. 
With no compromise in sight, it is unlikely any of these rules will 
become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have legislation offering new  
federal rights for Americans in health maintenance organizations 
and other managed care plans. But the GOP plan is more modest than 
the Democratic bill on virtually every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Senate took a second vote concerning who is  
covered under the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It had considered the same issue Tuesday, but that vote was  
muddied because it was actually voting to replace the measure on 
coverage with one concerning taxes. The vote Wednesday vote was a 
direct referendum on who is covered by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is covered is among the most fundamental questions being  
debated this week, clearly demonstrating each party's approach to 
the role of government. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill would apply many of the new patient protections  
only to the 48 million Americans who are in health plans that are 
exempt from similar state regulations. Other people are covered by 
state law, and Republicans say states can adopt these rules if they 
want to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that the source of all wisdom when it comes to  
health care is in Washington, D.C.,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla. ``We don't have the philosophy that one size fits all ... 
that whatever the states have done is not good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to include all 161 million Americans who have  
private health insurance. This would assure that everyone gets the 
new rights, even if the states do not adopt them on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of the federal government is to step in when  
protections need to be everywhere in this country,'' said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who went to Capitol 
Hill to boost the Democrats' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans did extend some of their provisions beyond the  
core 48 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast cancer amendment, introduced by Sen. Olympia Snowe,  
R-Maine, covers everyone with private health insurance except state 
and local workers, or about 140 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	And the GOP would require all health plans to adopt appeals  
procedures, allowing patients to take denials of care to outside 
panels. The same goes for a ban on discrimination against people 
based on their genetic information. 
</P>
<P>
	No Democrat has voted with Republicans during this week's  
debate, and only a handful of Republicans have voted with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Those siding with Democrats at least once were GOP Sens. Spencer  
Abraham of Michigan, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Peter Fitzgerald 
of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania 
and John Warner of Virginia.

<HEADLINE> News Channels Following Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MSNBC's Laura Ingraham was immersed in serious  
political talk with presidential contender John McCain when, 
suddenly, the screen filled with a picture of Jesse Ventura in a 
feather boa and jewel-studded sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota governor's return to the wrestling ring blends  
politics and entertainment in a novel fashion and, as a result, 
gave cable news networks an interesting test of how it defined 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel aired live coverage of Ventura's announcement  
that he'll referee a World Wrestling Federation match next month. 
So did MSNBC. CNN ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do news events and still have fun,'' John Moody, Fox  
News Channel's vice president for news, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox commentator Dick Morris, called the event ``a ritual  
political suicide ... In the last 15 minutes, this man has 
destroyed his political career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage of Ventura's news conference delayed Ingraham's MSNBC  
interview with McCain on issues facing presidential candidates, 
leaving the Arizona senator looking slightly perturbed. Ingraham 
asked McCain to talk about Ventura's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN thought Ventura's announcement wasn't particularly  
newsworthy, spokesman Earl Casey said. CNN was covering the arrest 
of a suspect in the railroad killer case and Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak's visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our decision at the time to give more topical  
information to our viewers,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN was also queasy about airing live video provided by the WWF  
to promote a pay-per-view event. CNN founder Ted Turner's TNT 
network also telecast World Championship Wrestling events, and the 
WCW is the WWF's mortal competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody admitted Fox considered whether it was being used to  
promote an event but thought he couldn't pass up the event. Fox 
used the WWF's video. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesse Ventura is a political phenomenon,'' he said. ``There is  
no other way to describe him. To come from his background and be 
elected governor is a political rarity. Therefore, he's 
newsworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had its own news crew at Ventura's announcement, said Bob  
Epstein, MSNBC executive producer. He said covering the event was a 
perfect fit with Ingraham's show, which tries to mix politics and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really did show how these lines have been crossed and  
merged into one,'' Epstein said.

<HEADLINE>  First Half Forgetful for Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Despite a strong start and fast finish, the  
first half of the season has been a total disaster for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, who have proven to be one of the worst teams money 
can buy so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to completely forget about the first half, to tell you  
the truth,'' said catcher Todd Hundley, one of the many 
disappointments on one of baseball's highest-paid teams through 86 
games. ``We're not worried about the total picture, we're worried 
about the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That comes Thursday night when the Dodgers return from the  
All-Star break to open a three-game interleague series at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodger hopes were high before the season, and understandably so.  
General manager Kevin Malone shelled out plenty of the Fox Group's 
money, much of it to Kevin Brown, to produce a winner, and there 
was even talk of a World Series appearance from a team that hasn't 
won a postseason game since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Mondesi hit two dramatic homers on opening day to trigger a  
5-1 start, and it appeared the Dodgers were on their way. However, 
they struggled soon thereafter and the four-game winning streak 
they took into the break wasn't enough to get them out of last 
place in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other teams are outperforming us,'' first-year manager  
Davey Johnson admitted. ``We need to change that. I think we're 
pressing, but all of us press when things don't go our way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been painful, no doubt.''  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's previous teams finished first or second in all 10  
years he managed a full season. That streak is in serious jeopardy, 
since the Dodgers (39-47) trail the NL West-leading San Francisco 
Giants by 10 games with 76 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics tell much of the story.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers are next-to-last in the NL in team batting average  
(.263), 12th in runs scored (397), and 14th in on-base percentage 
(.336). 
</P>
<P>
	That might be acceptable if the pitching was up to usual Dodger  
standards, but it's not even close. The team ERA of 4.58 ranks 10th 
in the NL, and would be the highest since the franchise moved to 
Los Angeles from Brooklyn 41 years ago if the season ended today. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the staff ERA has been over 4.00 just three times since  
the team moved -- 4.47 in 1958, 4.04 in 1961, and 4.17 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown (9-6, 3.53 ERA), who became baseball's first $100 million  
man when he signed a signed a seven-year, $105 million contract 
last December, and Ismael Valdes (7-7, 3.36 ERA) have pitched 
reasonably well. However, the other starters -- Darren Dreifort 
(7-8, 5.77 ERA), Chan Ho Park (5-7, 6.52 ERA) and Carlos Perez 
(2-9, 6.95 ERA) -- have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the fans are frustrated and the front office is  
frustrated, but there's no one more frustrated than we as 
players,'' said Hundley, who is hitting only .229 and has thrown 
out just 10 of 74 base-stealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to bounce back from reconstructive surgery on his  
throwing elbow, Hundley missed most of spring training and is still 
paying for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi got off to a great start, prompting comparisons to  
fellow Dominican Sammy Sosa. However, Mondesi has hit just one 
homer since finishing May with 18, and hasn't homered in his last 
102 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hollandsworth, a reserve, is one of the few accomplished  
left-handed hitters the Dodgers have, prompting recent trade talk 
involving first baseman Eric Karros, a right-handed batter. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if the Dodgers don't get back into the division race in  
the next few weeks, there's a good chance they'll try to make some 
deals to dump salaries and replenish the farm system before the 
July 31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at all our options,'' Malone said. ``Our first  
choice is we get on a roll and play winning baseball, and all the 
questions we have will have been answered.''

the next few weeks, there's a good chance they'll try to make some 
deals to dump salaries and replenish the farm system before the

choice is we get on a roll and play winning baseball, and all the 
questions we have will have been answered.''

<HEADLINE> Arrested Mother Suing NBA Entity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Laurie Del Negro spotted a newspaper ad  
offering a good price on San Antonio Spurs caps during the NBA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrilled by the bargain, she bought more than four dozen and  
sold some outside the Alamodome before attending a Spurs game with 
her husband on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of earning extra bucks, Del Negro was hauled away in  
handcuffs and spent the night in jail. Now, she's suing NBA 
Properties Inc., the marketing and licensing arm of the league. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA Properties, which worked with plain-clothed police officers,  
accused Del Negro of counterfeiting the merchandise but has since 
dropped its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA would not comment on Del Negro's arrest, citing the  
pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that no rights were violated,'' said Hilary  
Cassidy, an NBA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 43-year-old Del Negro, a mother of two teen-age  
daughters, contends that in its zeal to squeeze ``every last buck'' 
out of its merchandise licensing fees, NBA Properties caused her to 
be falsely arrested and publicly humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so unbelievable that I kept telling myself that this is  
going to be over in just a few minutes. They're going to say, 
'Oops, I made a mistake,' '' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Negro spent nearly 15 hours behind bars before being  
released on $800 bond at 5:30 a.m. the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	She is seeking ``substantial damages,'' her lawyer, Bernard  
Fischman, said without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
	She also is suing Jim Dunworth Inc., owner of Designer Outlet,  
where she bought the caps at a going-out-of-business sale. A Jim 
Dunworth Inc. representative did not return a telephone call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the caps were indeed fakes. Each one  
had a tag bearing what looked like a serial number and official 
seal. NBA Properties had said it appeared the caps were made by a 
former business partner.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped vs. the yen Wednesday, while  
Japanese stocks jumped amid hopes for Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.08 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 1.06  
yen, late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 
121.32 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 176.77  
points, or 0.97 percent, to close at 18,357.86 points. On Tuesday, 
the average closed down 0.42 points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, investors sold dollars on reduced concern  
that the Bank of Japan will intervene to weaken the yen, as it has 
done on several recent occasions. The moves were meant to help the 
nation's economy recover from its worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, reducing dollar-denominated earnings of 
Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the central bank seems comfortable with the current  
dollar-yen level, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also unlikely that the Bank of Japan will step into the  
currency market right now because the United States wants Japan to 
improve economic fundamentals rather than tinker with currency 
exchange rates, said Kosuke Hanao, a currency trader at the 
Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general mood is against intervention,'' Hanao said. There  
is resistance in the U.S. Congress to Japanese moves to strengthen 
the dollar, a move that could exacerbate the United States' soaring 
trade deficit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern that demand for U.S. products and services could decline  
in Latin American economies also hurt the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	New uncertainty about Latin America surfaced Monday when  
candidates for Argentina's October elections raised the possibility 
of debt restructuring, which could hurt some U.S. lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.22 yen, down  
from 123.64 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose amid active buying of  
international blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section jumped 13.38 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,497.07. 
The TOPIX closed down 0.42 points, or 0.03 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
25.96 points to 11,175.02. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6550 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6000 
percent, driving its price down to 101.26 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Suit Goes to Conn. Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A jury began deliberations Wednesday in  
the case of a small Danbury software company that claims Microsoft 
Corp. violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury in U.S. District Court deliberated for about four hours  
before adjourning for the day. Deliberations were scheduled to 
resume at 9 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc. claimed during a six-week civil trial  
that Microsoft cut off its access to Windows source code -- software 
blueprints -- hampering its ability to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs,  
such as word processors and spreadsheets, written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies had a three-year contract in which Microsoft  
gave Bristol access to source code it needed to create Wind/U. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol sued in August, claiming it was unable to reach an  
agreement with Microsoft for a new contract for the latest versions 
of Windows NT, a top program for running computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyers told the jury the company tried repeatedly to  
negotiate a new contract with Bristol, and that Bristol rejected 
the same licensing deal that was approved by Mainsoft, one of its 
main competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the evidence shows Microsoft treated Bristol very  
fairly and favorably,'' Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said after 
the case went to the jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is before the jury, and we have full confidence  
that the jury will make the right decision,'' said Bristol Chief 
Executive Officer Keith Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is also facing a much larger antitrust case in  
Washington, brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. The 
government contends that Microsoft illegally wielded monopoly power 
from its dominant Windows product to expand into new markets, such 
as Internet software, and thus crush competitors.

<HEADLINE> Ludzik Takes Over As Lightning Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- When the Tampa Bay Lightning decided on a  
coaching change, there was no question the struggling franchise 
would turn to Steve Ludzik. 
</P>
<P>
	The former NHL player not only had close ties to new owner  
William Davidson and vice president of hockey operations Rick 
Dudley, but his style fits the philosophy of the new regime to a 
tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's game, there's a new wave of coach,'' Dudley said  
Wednesday after firing Jacques Demers and replacing him with the 
38-year-old Ludzik. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old coach said this is my system and you will do it. The  
new wave says I have to be able to adjust because not everything I 
do every day is going to work against everything someone else 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ludzik spent the last three seasons in the International Hockey  
League coaching Davidson's Detroit Vipers. He was an assistant 
under Dudley for a year before succeeding his boss and leading the 
club to a pair of appearances in the IHL's Turner Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Lightning to a group led by Davidson was  
finalized last month. Dudley, meanwhile, was lured from the Ottawa 
Senators to run the team's hockey operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Demers led the Lightning for a little less than two seasons,  
finishing with the NHL's worst record each year, including a 
19-54-9 mark last winter. He had three years remaining on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Dudley decided not to retain Demers, whose 409 victories  
rank 11th on the league's all-time list, he moved swiftly to bring 
in Ludzik. Director of player development Don Murdoch was also 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludzik, 38, becomes the team's fourth coach in eight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	He compiled a 154-58-34 record in the IHL and led Detroit to the  
league title in 1997. The Vipers were Turner Cup finalists the 
following year and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	His transition to coaching in the NHL figures to be helped by  
his relationship with Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to build this franchise the way we did it in  
Detroit ... Every coach that takes over says: `We're going to be 
the hardest-working team.' We're going to be hard-working, but 
we're going to work smart. We're going to learn and we're going to 
do things the right way,'' Ludzik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demers, who led Montreal to the Stanley Cup title in 1993,  
joined the Lightning in November 1997. In just under two seasons, 
he guided the team to a 34-96-17 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to serving as coach, he was the team's general  
manager, a role that will be handled now by Dudley, who also was 
responsible for making two draft-day trades that figure to help the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know these people,'' Ludzik said. ``We will not stop until  
we get this franchise where it should be. And I can't say I'd be 
happy playing average. I want to get to the top of the 
conference.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Ex-Deputy Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A former California sheriff's deputy was  
found dead Wednesday a few days after he became the subject of a 
nationwide search for allegedly killing a colleague 14 years ago in 
a possible love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA tests unavailable at the time of the 1985 killing were  
performed on blood and hair evidence, implicating retired Los 
Angeles sheriff's deputy Ted Eugene Kirby in the death of Sgt. 
George Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby, 54, disappeared June 30 after having provided saliva and  
other DNA samples to police. On Monday, police issued a warrant for 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	A television reporter and photographer in Kirby's neighborhood  
Wednesday found his decomposed body near his Spokane home. 
</P>
<P>
	The body ``appeared to have some sort of head trauma,'' possibly  
a gunshot wound, Spokane County sheriff's spokesman Deputy Dave 
Reagan said. A handgun was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say a DNA sample taken from Kirby matched blood  
collected from the crime scene in 1985. A love triangle may have 
been the motive, police sources told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur, 37, was found dead in his van parked on a Los Angeles  
freeway ramp. He was shot after leaving work at the Men's Central 
Jail, where Kirby also worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives believe Kirby, who retired from the jail, hid inside  
Arthur's van and shot him while he was driving, causing the vehicle 
to crash. Witnesses said they saw a man crawl from the wreckage and 
limp away. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's autopsy showed Arthur had struggled with his  
attacker before he was shot. At the time, however, the technology 
did not exist to link the hair and blood samples found in the van 
to a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, investigators reopened the case and took DNA samples  
from several people, including Kirby. On July 7, they went to 
Kirby's home in Spokane, but his wife said he left June 30 without 
explanation.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise 0.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales growth slowed in June, rising  
just 0.1 percent, reflecting a sharp drop in automotive sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Total retail sales, which represent about a third of the  
nation's economic output, rose last month to a seasonally adjusted 
$243.3 billion, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The June increase followed a big 1.2 percent gain in retail  
sales in May -- better than the government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected June's retail sales growth to slow, mainly  
predicting that consumers' red-hot buying spree for autos and 
trucks so far this year would cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, retail sales have climbed or held steady for 11 months  
running and were 8 percent percent higher than June of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' robust appetite for shopping is being fueled by the  
country's economic good times. The nation's low unemployment rate 
is hovering at levels that haven't been seen in three decades. 
Consumer confidence is high, inflation remains low and the stock 
market continues to post record gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall increase in retail sales, automotive sales  
fell a sharp 1 percent in June after reporting strong gains of 3.5 
percent in May. And, sales at gasoline stations also went down 0.4 
percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without the often volatile autos category, retail sales  
would have increased 0.4 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last at least three  
years -- fell 0.4 percent in June following a strong 2.3 percent 
increase in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture stores' sales rose 0.2 percent in June after being up  
0.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, also were up  
in June, rising 0.4 percent, following a 0.5 percent increase in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	At apparel and accessory shops, sales rose 0.2 percent in June  
and sales at department and general merchandise stores rose 0.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Food store sales also edged up in June, rising 0.1 percent,  
while grocery store sales inched down 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar and restaurant sales crept up 0.2 percent and drug and  
proprietary stores rose a sharp 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the nation's biggest retailers reported surprisingly  
strong sales in June as the strong U.S. economy and warm weather 
had Americans buying everything from bathing suits to air 
conditioners. Discount chains, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, 
were the biggest winners. Specialty clothing and department stores 
also fared well.

<HEADLINE>  Ventura Will Referee WWF Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who wrestled  
professionally as ``The Body,'' is returning to the ring. This 
time, however, he'll be The Guest Referee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura promised today to bring ``law and order'' back to  
wrestling when he appears at the World Wrestling Federation's 
``SummerSlam'' event Aug. 22, ``because I rule here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was introduced to a crowd of several hundred cheering  
wrestling fans by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon. He bellowed: ``I'm 
bigger than you, McMahon, I'm more powerful than you, I'm more 
powerful than the World Wrestling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you're in this state, you hold no power here. It's  
very simple. It's The Body rules, it's my rules, or the highway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, know for wearing feather boas in the ring before  
he retired from wrestling in 1986, was dressed in a business suit 
but accepted yellow and black feather boas from female wrestler 
Chyna and wrapped them around his neck, then donned jewel-studded 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he will be paid $100,000 for the event. Half will  
go to a foundation for abused children and half will go to a 
scholarship endowment at his alma mater, Roosevelt High School in 
Minneapolis. Ventura said he also will get videotape royalties and 
payment for use of his name, but he said the amount is 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Ventura slapped down any suggestion that his return to  
wrestling threatens the dignity of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no rule that says a governor can't have fun. There's  
no rule that says a governor on his own time can't be a human,'' he 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP Chairman Ron Eibensteiner today challenged Ventura to  
account for every dime he receives for his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our governor, donning tights and performing in a ballet of  
violence, as he likes to call it, will not bring honor and dignity 
to the office of governor in our state,'' Eibensteiner said. ``It 
seems as though, if the paycheck is big enough, The Body can be 
resurrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura countered such criticism by saying GOP St. Paul Mayor  
Norm Coleman just struck a deal as a paid radio host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's the outcry? See, for Republicans, he's an  
entrepreneur,'' Ventura said. The governor also has a radio show, 
but receives no money. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hoopla, the Reform Party governor has recorded some  
significant achievements in his first half year, including a 
permanent income tax cut and sales tax rebates. Ventura and 
Democratic and Republican leaders declared the legislative session 
a success. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll published today, 56 percent of Minnesotans rate  
Ventura's performance as governor as good or excellent, although 
about half the respondents were concerned about his unorthodox 
behavior.

<HEADLINE> New Products Boost Polaroid Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Polaroid Corp. reported Wednesday that  
second-quarter earnings rose 22 percent on increased sales of new 
products including its disposable instant camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings were $15 million for the quarter ended June 27, or  
33 cents per share, compared to $12 million, or 27 cents per share, 
for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's figure took into account $10 million set aside for  
money owed by Russian retailers and a $26.3 million gain on real 
estate sales, both of which were pretax items. When those items are 
excluded, Polaroid had per-share earnings of 3 cents in the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenue rose 4.7 percent to $487 million from  
$465 million last year. Worldwide sales of instant cameras were up 
60 percent compared to last year, due in part to increased sales in 
Japan and to a lesser extent in the Americas, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales increase in both regions was attributed to the  
introduction of new products, especially PopShots, a disposable 
instant camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in Europe fell to $107 million from $117 million last year  
due to lower conventional and instant film sales and unfavorable 
foreign exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Polaroid has lost money in five of the last six years amid  
declining sales. It has changed its product mix in hope of 
regaining market share lost to traditional cameras.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Mows Down Baseball's Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- At the end of the next century, baseball fans  
still will be talking about what Pedro Martinez did on this night. 
</P>
<P>
	Of how Mark McGwire flailed at strike three.  
</P>
<P>
	Of how Sammy Sosa looked like a statue when a called third  
zoomed by. 
</P>
<P>
	Of how Barry Larkin, Larry Walker and Jeff Bagwell walked away  
from the plate, strikeout victims all. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's biggest boppers came to the plate and Pedro Martinez  
made the power go out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't appreciate leading off today. I had to do  
it,'' Larkin said, in awe of Martinez's MVP performance in the 
American League's 4-1 victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez became the first pitcher to strike out the first three  
batters in an All-Star game, fanning Larkin, Walker and Sosa in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the ball when it went by me,'' Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
	He boosted his record to the first tour when he got McGwire on  
four pitches leading off the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout old Fenway Park, fans were buzzing. Would Martinez  
equal, maybe surpass, the great Carl Hubbell, who struck out five 
of baseball's best, all in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of how bad he wants to make hitters look,''  
Texas closer John Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it came down to Matt Williams, no slouch himself with 23  
homers this season. Williams, who threatened Roger Maris' home run 
record before the 1994 strike, turned out to be the only blemish. 
And it wasn't that much of a smudge, a grounder to second that was 
misplayed for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	All Martinez did was strike out Jeff Bagwell, and Ivan Rodriguez  
threw out Williams at second for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys, those are some of the best in the world,''  
Martinez said after his 28-pitch performance in two electric 
innings. ``But anything could happen, and that's what makes our 
game so special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez silenced the National League dugout.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty obvious there's not a lot to say,'' Jeromy Burnitz  
recalled. ``Guys aren't coming back happy and gay when they strike 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is 15-3 at the All-Star break, and has an outside  
chance to become the first 30-game winner in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best lively arm in the game of baseball,''  
McGwire said. ``There's a very, very good chance he'll win 30 or 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performance drew comparisons of the 1934 All-Star game at  
New York's Polo Grounds, when Hubbell struck out Babe Ruth, Lou 
Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin, each and every one 
elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin (165), Walker (250), Sosa (305), McGwire (485) and  
Bagwell (249) have combined for 1,454 homers. Hubbell's victims in 
1934 finished their careers with 2,218, and before long, Martinez's 
prey may top that. 
</P>
<P>
	Era of offense? Not with Martinez on the mound.  
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring all the sluggers on the field, fans who stuck around  
after the game kept chanting his name. In the shadow of the Green 
Monster, the very symbol of offense, Martinez was the star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Pedro pretty much dominated and lifted everybody up,''  
Cleveland's Jim Thome said. ``He's a big-game pitcher, and he rises 
to the occasion.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore No. 1 in Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Asian financial crisis could not hold  
Singapore back from once again ranking as the world's most 
competitive nation. The United States moved up to second place from 
last year's third-place rating, while Hong Kong dropped to third, 
according to a survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, prepared by the World Economic Forum, measures eight  
variables -- from government regulations to technology and labor 
conditions -- to try to determine which economies have the best 
ability to achieve rapid growth in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing this year's Global Competitiveness Report ``top 10''  
were Taiwan, in fourth place, followed by Canada, Switzerland, 
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland. The 
bottom five were Russia, in last place, preceded by Ukraine, 
Zimbabwe, Bulgaria and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University Professor who served as an  
adviser to the project, noted that many Asian economies ranked high 
in 1997, before the crisis caused by the collapse of several 
currencies and the flight of foreign capital. Some are just now 
showing signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Asian economies recover in the next few years and  
resume fairly rapid growth, then we would claim some vindication 
for the index,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited three countries that moved up significantly in  
this year's rating, compared with 1998: Italy, up eight positions 
to No. 35; Poland, up eight to No. 43, and Finland, up four to No. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, the report said, ``strongly improved its infrastructure  
ratings due to enhanced rail and telephone data.'' For Poland, the 
advance reflected ``rapidly improving labor market indicators,'' 
while Finland scored strongly in telecommunications and information 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom-most tier all suffered from a variety of ailments,  
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All are characterized by a low extent of the rule of law,  
reliability of property rights and poor infrastructure,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report measures finance, government policies,  
infrastructure, technology, management, labor, institutions and 
barriers to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, a Geneva-based international center dedicated to  
improving business and government, collects published data on the 
countries and conducts a survey of more than 4,000 executives 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore has led the list of most-competitive countries in the  
four years that the report has been published. The United States, 
which ranked fourth in 1996, moved to third in 1997 and 1998 before 
reaching No. 2 this year. Hong Kong had held second place for three 
years before dropping this year to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's biggest economy, Japan, still struggling to recover from  
the financial crisis, slipped to 14th place from 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest European Union countries also slipped slightly in  
1999 from 1998, France to 23rd from 22nd, and Germany to 25th from 
24th.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says Bush Overlooking Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, shadowboxing  
with his chief Republican opponent, suggested today that Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush was ``ready to move into the mansion before the 
election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who trails Bush in many polls and has raised  
only half as much money, drew parallels between the 2000 
presidential race and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack's 1998 victory, 
although he never mentioned Bush by name. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when he was 20 points behind in the polls and  
there were people who said he couldn't win, right? Hmmmm,'' he 
theatrically reminded Democratic activists at the Java Joe's 
coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``He developed -- what was it? -- momentum and ideas while his  
Republican opponent was ready to move into the mansion before the 
election. I don't know, maybe it's deja vu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president used a farmhouse surrounded by cornfields  
near Waukee as a venue for pledging a renewed battle against drug 
abuse. The house has been used recently as a lab for manufacturing 
methamphetamine, also known as crank or speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly addictive drug has become ``a particularly insidious  
kind of threat'' in rural communities in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that when methamphetamines can strike a place like  
this, we've got to strike back hard in a determined way,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a dinner Tuesday, Gore sharpened jabs at Bush and asked women  
to bear with his slower, steadier race focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore derided Bush for his recent rejection of any ``litmus  
test'' on the abortion issue and his signature on Texas legislation 
allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms and barring 
localities from suing gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the GOP stand on abortion rights, Gore parroted  
language Bush used recently to say that, as president, he would not 
select Supreme Court nominees on the basis of their views on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about it. There IS a litmus test in the  
Republican party,'' Gore insisted to some five dozen Des 
Moines-area women he was trying to recruit for his campaign 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I yield to no one in my support of women's rights,'' said  
Gore, who loses narrowly to Bush among women in current polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the vice president closed a two-day Iowa swing with a  
deliberative expansion on his theme of the week: crime. His drug 
speech in Waukee followed a Monday speech in Boston on gun control 
and urban crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the illegal drug in rural communities has soared in  
recent years. Police seizures from clandestine meth labs in 
Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Nebraska tripled between 
1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Low on specifics and bare of cost estimates, Gore is proposing  
to add 100 Drug Enforcement Administration agents specially 
assigned to rural areas and trained to shut down meth labs. The 
Clinton administration budget for fiscal 2000 asks Congress for $20 
million for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would create anti-meth education programs in rural  
schools and launch a new multimedia campaign -- like the egg in the 
frying pan with the slogan ``This is your brain on drugs,'' but 
specially targeted to rural residents. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposes doubling the number of areas designated as high  
intensity drug trafficking, a designation that brings additional 
federal attention and funds for police. There are currently 20 such 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he would up the ante by 50,000 on an old Bill Clinton  
campaign pledge to put 100,000 new cops on the beats in 
neighborhoods across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his outward focus on laying out his own policy agenda,  
Gore, for the first time since Federal Election Commission reports 
two weeks ago showed Bush raised a record $36 million in campaign 
cash this year, vented some frustration as he plugged for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep our powder dry, conserve our resources,  
develop as much unity of purpose as we can,'' the Democratic 
presidential hopeful told local women activists here Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other side, the Republican side, has raised more money  
than anyone ever has,'' Gore said in dire-warning tones. ``They 
have raised all this money and they're not even slowing down.''

<HEADLINE> Blues Sign Turgeon to Two-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues signed their No. 1 center  
Pierre Turgeon on Wednesday to a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon, 29, would have become an unrestricted free agent on  
July 1. But the Blues informed him last month that they would give 
him a qualifying offer to retain his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues would not comment on the terms of the deal. Turgeon  
earlier said he was seeking $5 million to $6 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	He won arbitration last season to make $4.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite averaging better than a point per game in his 12-year  
career, including three with the Blues, Turgeon's status with the 
team had been in doubt until a superior performance in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring just five goals and 10 points in 15 playoff games  
in his two previous springs with the Blues, Turgeon led the Blues 
in playoff scoring with four goals and 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon got the overtime game-winning goal in Game 7 against  
Phoenix in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. He 
also scored an overtime goal against the Dallas Stars in Game 4 of 
the second round of the playoffs, setting a team record for most OT 
goals in a playoff year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pierre showed everyone in the playoffs that he is capable of  
being one of the elite centers in the NHL, and we're impressed that 
he is accepting the challenge to be that kind of player for us on 
every shift in the years ahead,'' Blues general manager Larry Pleau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has scored at least 20 goals in 11 consecutive seasons. He  
has 397 goals and 997 points in 877 career games, including 79 
goals and 207 points in 196 games with the Blues.

<HEADLINE> Postal Service $1B in Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three-quarters of the way through its fiscal  
year, the post office is $1 billion in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	That indicates the agency should finish the year close to its  
planned $200 million profit, according to Chief Financial Officer 
Richard M. Porras. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the third quarter, in May, the Postal Service had  
expenses of $43.1 billion and income of $44.2 billion for a net of 
$1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Norm Scherstrom noted Wednesday that costs  
traditionally outrun income in the fourth quarter for the agency. 
Last year, he noted, the post office was $900 million in the red 
for the last three months of its fiscal year, which ends in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office raised the price of stamps a penny to 33 cents  
in January in anticipation of rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the post office reported that 94 percent of local  
mail was delivered on time in the spring quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On-time delivery was measured through a series of test letters  
sent by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in 465 ZIP codes 
covering about 80 percent of first-class mail delivery. The company 
measured the percentage of letters delivered overnight in 85 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Top performers at 96 percent were Billings, Mont.; Omaha, Neb.;  
Wichita, Kan.; Sioux Falls, S.D., and Springfield, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Many Cities Still Working on Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly half the nation's 21 largest cities  
won't complete work on coping with the Y2K computer bug until the 
final quarter of the year, according to a congressional report. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cities, Dallas and Boston, have finished their preparations  
to ensure their computers will continue to function on Jan. 1, 
2000. Nine others expect to be fully ready by Sept. 30, and 10 
cities say they will be ready between Oct. 1 and the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, is to be released at a hearing Thursday of the 
Senate's special committee on the Y2K problem. The Associated Press 
obtained a draft copy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO asked the cities to provide information on the Y2K  
status of systems supporting such city services as electric power, 
water, emergency services, hospitals, transportation and public 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that most cities say they have completed work on  
city-run transportation and telecommunication systems, but still 
have more to do in the areas of water and wastewater treatment 
systems, public buildings and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem relates to older computer systems that recognize  
only the last two digits of a year and could read the digits ``00'' 
as 1900 rather than 2000. That could cause computer systems to 
malfunction or break down, disrupting basic civil services. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies, at the prodding of Congress and the White  
House, are generally thought to be in good shape, but there is more 
concern about the efforts state and local governments are making in 
fixing computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report noted that while most cities won't be totally  
prepared until later in the year, many have made substantial 
progress. Los Angeles, for example, will have all systems 
Y2K-compliant by the end of September, except for wastewater 
treatment systems, which will be finished in November. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso plans to be Year 2000-ready by Sept. 1 except for its  
police department, which is scheduled to be ready on Dec. 1. 
Baltimore is the only other city anticipating a December completion 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that six cities have finished contingency  
plans for breakdowns while six cities have carried out independent 
verification of their Y2K measures. Thirteen other cities are now 
conducting independent verification. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities saying they will be Y2K ready by Sept. 30 are New York;  
Houston; Philadelphia; San Diego; San Jose, Calif.; Indianapolis; 
Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Those that will finish work in the final three months of the  
year are Los Angeles; Chicago; Phoenix; San Antonio; Detroit; San 
Francisco; Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; El Paso, Texas; and 
Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires, at odds with owners  
since Roberto Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, voted 
Wednesday to resign Sept. 2 and not work the final month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a meeting of the Major League  
Umpires Association, amounted to the first blow in their latest 
dispute with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, meanwhile, seemed almost pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting and said they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. The other 11 were expected to announce their resignations 
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
Games resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually. The deal bars strikes, so 
the resignations are an attempt to get around that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1984 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained a court 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of the repeated threats, seem to have adopted an  
attitude that the umpires are replaceable. Alderson said the 
umpires' actions made him wonder if this would ``escalate this 
situation to the point were it might be irretrievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> Tiny Valve May Predict Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The hardening or thickening of a tiny heart valve -- a common  
condition among the elderly that doctors usually dismiss as 
inconsequential -- may, in fact, be a powerful predictor of heart 
attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that a severe narrowing or blockage  
in the left aortic valve is a predictor of heart disease. A new 
study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, has 
shown for the first time that a precursor condition called 
sclerosis can also be a warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Sclerosis is a hardening or thickening in the aortic valve,  
often due to a buildup of calcium deposits. The condition is found 
in roughly 25 percent of all adults over 65. 
</P>
<P>
	The study offers hope that a simple screening procedure can  
accurately forecast the risk of heart disease in people with no 
other symptoms. The procedure, called echocardiography, uses 
ultrasound to produce a two-dimensional picture of the heart and 
costs roughly $350 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sclerosis itself has been thought to be just a benign,  
incidental finding of aging because it's so common,'' said Dr. 
Catherine M. Otto of the University of Washington in Seattle, who 
led the study. ``Having it is not benign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otto said she does not recommend routine echocardiograms for  
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Echocardiograms are usually done after a doctor detects a heart  
murmur using a stethoscope. Otto said that in light of her 
findings, the image should be closely examined for sclerosis of the 
aortic valve. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied the echocardiograms of 5,621 men and  
women 65 and older. The valve was normal in 70 percent. In 29 
percent, the valve was hardening or thickening, but there was no 
obstruction. The valve was narrowing, meaning there was some degree 
of obstruction, in 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Following up five years later, the doctors found that hardening  
of the valve is associated with a 50 percent higher risk of death 
from heart disease compared with those whose valves are normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers do not believe that sclerosis is a direct cause  
of death but rather a ``marker'' for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Blase A. Carabello of the  
Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center said aortic valve sclerosis 
should be viewed ``as a harbinger of future events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes these data remarkable is the fact that this  
condition has been well known for decades and yet has generally 
been considered benign,'' Carabello wrote. ``Textbooks that mention 
the condition usually do so in passing.''

<HEADLINE> Whipped Cream in Can Inventor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Aaron ``Bunny'' Lapin, who put whipped cream  
in a spray can a half-century ago and called it Reddi-wip, turning 
a dessert topping into a symbol of postwar America's drive for 
convenience, has died at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin died Saturday of heart failure at a Los Angeles hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Reddi-wip was first sold in 1948 by St. Louis milkmen and  
quickly expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Lapin was 
soon dubbed the Whipped Cream King, and last year Time magazine 
listed Reddi-wip as one of the century's 100 great things for 
consumers, along with the pop-top can and Spam. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the aerosol topping bought in the United States each  
year is Reddi-wip, packaged in the familiar red, white and blue 
can. It is marketed as ``a hassle-free way to top off sweet 
treats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Louis, Lapin went to the University of Missouri and  
Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. He was a clothing 
salesman but moved into the food business during World War II, 
selling Sta-Whip, a wartime substitute for whipping cream. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Crown Cork and Seal Co. introduced the Spra-tainer, the  
first seamless, lined aerosol canister, and Lapin became one of 
Crown's first customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to packaging Reddi-wip, Lapin's Clayton Corp. also  
made and sold the valves used in the cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton was also one of the first companies to put shaving cream  
in an aerosol can, but Lapin decided not to market the product 
because he didn't want to compete with shaving cream makers who 
might buy his valves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton and its subsidiaries also make industrial valves and  
closures, caulk, adhesives and foam plastic products such as 
insulation and cushioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin eventually lost control of Clayton and sold his interest  
in Reddi-wip, which is now made by Beatrice Foods Inc. in Waukesha, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin later started Bunlap Corp., which marketed the milkshake  
product Touch 'N Shake and a cinnamon-flavored margarine called 
Touch 'N Spread. Those products didn't take off like Reddi-wip. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by a son, a daughter and two brothers.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Tallies HMO Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans piled up a string of  
victories in early sparring over patients' rights legislation. 
Angry Democrats accused GOP senators of turning their backs on the 
millions of Americans frustrated by managed-care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we saw what compassionate conservatism portends to be,''  
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said Tuesday, referring to a phrase 
used by a GOP presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
``It is not compassionate. It is conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to expand patients' rights against health  
maintenance organizations more than Republicans, who say the 
Democrats' approach would make insurance too expensive for many 
more Americans. The GOP is pushing a bill that would make more 
modest changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate resumed debate today on a proposal by Sen.  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to guarantee insurance coverage of 
routine health care for sick people getting treatment through 
clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans balked, saying it would increase costs.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we put this new mandate on ... somebody's got to pay for  
it,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the chamber's only physician. 
``The federal government's not going to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voting on amendments was continuing today, with final passage of  
the legislation possible Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In initial voting Tuesday, Republicans shot down a number of  
Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of narrow votes mostly along party lines, the Senate  
on Tuesday defeated a Democratic plan that would have made insurers 
pay for what doctors say are medically necessary treatments. 
Democrats also lost on amendments to expand women's health and 
emergency room care. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, senators approved, 53-47, a GOP provision that  
would restrict many of the new rights to the 48 million Americans 
currently exempt from state regulation. This includes protections 
involving emergency room care, access to obstetrician-gynecologists 
and the right to keep a doctor during a course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to cover an additional 113 million people who  
already are under state regulations. Republicans say Washington 
shouldn't interfere with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the defeats, Democrats believe they have the upper hand  
in the debate, which is as much about Year 2000 politics as it is 
about health policy. Neither side has been willing to budge, and 
President Clinton likely will veto the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the measures yet to be considered is one that would allow  
patients to sue their health maintenance organizations and collect 
damages when care has been denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would ensure, under certain conditions, that  
patients have access to ``cutting edge'' clinical trials and 
``medically necessary prescription drugs,'' said Dodd, the author. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said growing numbers of health plans are now refusing to  
pay the routine costs associated with an individual's participation 
in clinical health studies, and that his amendment would require 
coverage under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ought not to be a controversial proposal,'' Dodd said,  
adding that insurance companies would be required only to pay 
routine health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' effort to make HMOs pay for many treatments they do  
not now cover -- one of the most contentious issues -- failed on a 
52-48 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan would have made health insurance companies  
pay for care consistent with ``generally accepted principles of 
medical practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that the most common practices aren't  
always the best, and replaced the Democratic medical necessity 
provision with their own system allowing patients to appeal if care 
is denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Won adoption of a measure allowing self-employed people to  
deduct the full cost of their health insurance from their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defeated, 52-48, a Democratic measure that would let women  
designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care 
doctor. It also would have required that they be covered for 
hospitalization overnight after a mastectomy if a doctor 
recommended it. Republicans said they would soon offer a modified 
version of the same idea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adopted, 52-48, an amendment highlighting the cost of the  
Democratic bill. Under the amendment, the bill's provisions would 
be canceled if they increased costs by more than 1 percent. 
Congressional auditors estimate the Democratic provisions would 
raise insurance premiums 4.8 percent.

	Suspected Rail Killer Faces Hearing  
</P>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- The Mexican drifter suspected in eight  
murders will make another court appearance today after his attempt 
to plead guilty to a lesser charge was rebuffed. Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez surrendered to police yesterday, ending a six-week 
manhunt. He tried to enter a guilty plea to a burglary charge 
earlier this morning, but a judge said it was an inappropriate time 
for the plea. Resendez-Ramirez is charged with three murders and 
linked to five other slayings, all of them in Texas, Kentucky and 
Illinois, and was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.

	Wider Food Stamp Eligibility Sought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce today a series  
of steps intended to increase food stamp enrollment. The White 
House says only two of five working families eligible for food 
stamps actually apply for assistance and receive it. Fueled by a 
strong economy, welfare rolls have dropped from more than 5 million 
families in 1994 to just 2.7 million by the end of last year. 
However, studies show that many of the families still have trouble 
paying for food and other household bills. The president will 
simplify food stamp reporting rules which, the administration said, 
discourage recipients from going to work. 

</P>

	FCC Voting on Disabled Rule  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are prepared to approve new  
rules requiring the telecommunications industry to make pagers, 
cellular phones and other equipment and services easier for 
disabled individuals to use. The FCC will vote today on the rule. 
Changes would include voice-activated phones, talking Caller ID and 
phones with keypads that have large buttons or specific identifying 
marks would be more commonplace. Failure to comply with the rules 
could result in penalties or damage awards ranging from the 
thousands to the millions of dollars.

in the northern no-fly zone today after being fired on by Iraqi 
anti-aircraft artillery, the U.S. military said. Air Force F-16s 
and F-15s dropped laser-guided bombs on command and control sites 
west of Mosul, a city some 250 north of Baghdad. Baghdad does not 
recognize the no-fly zones and has been challenging the allied 
planes regularly since Dec. 28.

	Suspect Mistakenly Freed Surrenders

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- An Arizona murder suspect who was  
mistakenly released from jail in a paperwork mix-up has surrendered 
to authorities. Allen Brown, charged with stabbing his girlfriend 
more than 100 times, turned himself in to FBI and Kansas City, Mo., 
investigators yesterday, a week after he was let out of Pima County 
Jail. Brown's mother said she convinced him to turn himself in. 
Police said ``a communications breakdown'' resulted in the wrongful

	Girl Has Half Her Brain Removed  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Nebraska teen-ager plagued by seizures from a  
deadly neurological condition had surgeons remove half of her brain 
to stem the spread of the rare disease. The left side of Amber 
Ramirez' brain -- the side that controls speech and fine motor 
movements -- was removed at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Her 
condition was not immediately released. The surgery may leave the 
15-year-old without the ability to speak, but she didn't want to 
put up with the constant seizures, a symptom of Rasmussen's 
disease, any longer. Without surgery, the girl faced the 
possibility of mental retardation, paralysis and even death.

	Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level dipped 0.1  
percent in June, the first decrease since February, as declining 
prices for gasoline and new cars helped offset the biggest jump in 
beef prices in 12 years. The Labor Department said today that the 
decline in the Producer Price Index -- which measures inflation 
pressures before they reach the consumer -- followed a 0.2 percent 
increase in May and was the first decline since a 0.5 percent 
plunge in February. The tame inflation report should help to calm 
fears that the Federal Reserve might want to continue hiking 
interest rates to cool the economy.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires, at odds with owners  
since Roberto Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, voted 
Wednesday to resign Sept. 2 and not work the final month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a meeting of the Major League  
Umpires Association, amounted to the first blow in their latest 
dispute with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, meanwhile, seemed almost pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting and said they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. The other 11 were expected to announce their resignations 
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
Games resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually. The deal bars strikes, so 
the resignations are an attempt to get around that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1984 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained a court 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of the repeated threats, seem to have adopted an  
attitude that the umpires are replaceable. Alderson said the 
umpires' actions made him wonder if this would ``escalate this 
situation to the point were it might be irretrievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<P>
	Showers and storms darkened the Southwest and Southeast on  
Wednesday. It was pleasant over New England and the Great Lakes 
area, while the Pacific Northwest saw clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The most persistent shower activity continued across the eastern  
parts of North Carolina and Virginia into Maryland and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure remained in control over New England and the Great  
Lakes. Very pleasant conditions and clear to partly cloudy skies 
persisted throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the central and southern Plains were fair and  
pleasant with only a few scattered showers occurring along the Gulf 
in southeastern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest continued to be very wet with more flooding  
occurring across parts of the Desert Southwest as a result of the 
monsoonal flow in the region. Rain continued from Southern 
California and Arizona into Colorado and New Mexico, with flood 
advisories in effect for most of northern Arizona, western 
Colorado, and the southern two-thirds of the state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed a major trail in Grand Canyon National Park  
because of rock and mud slides as monsoon storms swept much of 
Arizona. Four people were injured by falling rocks, two of them 
suffering broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service said the Grand Canyon was hit by up to  
3 inches of rain, producing flash flooding that damaged Bright 
Angel Trail. It will be closed for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, storms dumped more than an inch of rain on Tucson and  
Phoenix, flooding streets and stranding vehicles. The storm also 
temporarily shut down Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers also extended farther north along the eastern edge of  
the Sierra Nevadas from Nevada into Oregon and southern Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, skies were clear to partly cloudy across most of  
the Pacific Northwest, although a frontal boundary moving through 
the region caused shower activity in western sections of Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 37 in  
Stampede Pass, Wash., to an early-afternon high of 92 in Phoenix. 
With the heat index, it felt like 99 in Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Team Plays Big Apple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A World Series welcome it wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no ticker-tape parade up the canyons of lower  
Manhattan. Instead, members of the U.S. women's soccer team 
celebrated their World Cup win with a small rally in midtown 
Manhattan on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just goes to show, despite a hard-core contingent of loyal  
followers, women in sports have yet to pump up their ``Girl Power'' 
enough to equal the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the team captured the Cup with a rousing victory  
over China before a crowd of 90,185 in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, 
Calif., the best-attended women's sporting event in history. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, team members welcomed a few hundred fans to 56th  
Street behind Niketown, where one or two in the crowd commented on 
the ``disappointing'' turnout. Particularly disappointing, perhaps, 
in comparison to the tens of thousands who have turned out for 
ticker-tape parades honoring world championships by the New York 
Yankees and New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were a fair number of children whose smiles  
couldn't be dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of ponytailed, soccer-playing girls -- complete with  
telltale scabs on their elbows and knees -- were thrilled as their 
heroes passed by. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether men's soccer could compete for her attention,  
13-year-old Caitlin Cittarelli said there was no question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows the women try harder,'' the Stratford, Conn.,  
girl said. ``It's great because, I mean, they represent our country 
so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Caroline Bishop, a 16-year-old from Malverne, N.Y., who has  
played soccer since kindergarten, said she favors the women's team 
``because they can actually win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players showed their gratitude by swapping jerseys with a  
handful of young fans who brought their own junior-sized uniform 
shirts to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the World Cup champs strip off their shirts for the  
swap was a bit reminiscent of their victory, which defender Brandi 
Chastain celebrated Saturday by yanking off her jersey the way 
men's players sometimes do. 
</P>
<P>
	The team donned white T-shirts beneath their uniforms Tuesday,  
but Chastain wasn't quite so shy during the game itself. 
Unforgettable photos show her kneeling on the field in a black 
sports bra with fists clinched. 
</P>
<P>
	The jersey swap at the rally gave Chastain's teammates a chance  
to tease about the earlier display. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to apologize for the beer belly on Brandi,''  
midfielder Julie Foudy quipped. ``I told her if she was going to 
take her top off, she had to have a better body than that.''

<HEADLINE> First Half Forgetful for Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Despite a strong start and fast finish, the  
first half of the season has been a total disaster for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, who have proven to be one of the worst teams money 
can buy so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to completely forget about the first half, to tell you  
the truth,'' said catcher Todd Hundley, one of the many 
disappointments on one of baseball's highest-paid teams through 86 
games. ``We're not worried about the total picture, we're worried 
about the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That comes Thursday night when the Dodgers return from the  
All-Star break to open a three-game interleague series at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodger hopes were high before the season, and understandably so.  
General manager Kevin Malone shelled out plenty of the Fox Group's 
money, much of it to Kevin Brown, to produce a winner, and there 
was even talk of a World Series appearance from a team that hasn't 
won a postseason game since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Mondesi hit two dramatic homers on opening day to trigger a  
5-1 start, and it appeared the Dodgers were on their way. However, 
they struggled soon thereafter and the four-game winning streak 
they took into the break wasn't enough to get them out of last 
place in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other teams are outperforming us,'' first-year manager  
Davey Johnson admitted. ``We need to change that. I think we're 
pressing, but all of us press when things don't go our way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been painful, no doubt.''  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's previous teams finished first or second in all 10  
years he managed a full season. That streak is in serious jeopardy, 
since the Dodgers (39-47) trail the NL West-leading San Francisco 
Giants by 10 games with 76 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics tell much of the story.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers are next-to-last in the NL in team batting average  
(.263), 12th in runs scored (397), and 14th in on-base percentage 
(.336). 
</P>
<P>
	That might be acceptable if the pitching was up to usual Dodger  
standards, but it's not even close. The team ERA of 4.58 ranks 10th 
in the NL, and would be the highest since the franchise moved to 
Los Angeles from Brooklyn 41 years ago if the season ended today. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the staff ERA has been over 4.00 just three times since  
the team moved -- 4.47 in 1958, 4.04 in 1961, and 4.17 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown (9-6, 3.53 ERA), who became baseball's first $100 million  
man when he signed a signed a seven-year, $105 million contract 
last December, and Ismael Valdes (7-7, 3.36 ERA) have pitched 
reasonably well. However, the other starters -- Darren Dreifort 
(7-8, 5.77 ERA), Chan Ho Park (5-7, 6.52 ERA) and Carlos Perez 
(2-9, 6.95 ERA) -- have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the fans are frustrated and the front office is  
frustrated, but there's no one more frustrated than we as 
players,'' said Hundley, who is hitting only .229 and has thrown 
out just 10 of 74 base-stealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to bounce back from reconstructive surgery on his  
throwing elbow, Hundley missed most of spring training and is still 
paying for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi got off to a great start, prompting comparisons to  
fellow Dominican Sammy Sosa. However, Mondesi has hit just one 
homer since finishing May with 18, and hasn't homered in his last 
102 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hollandsworth, a reserve, is one of the few accomplished  
left-handed hitters the Dodgers have, prompting recent trade talk 
involving first baseman Eric Karros, a right-handed batter. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if the Dodgers don't get back into the division race in  
the next few weeks, there's a good chance they'll try to make some 
deals to dump salaries and replenish the farm system before the 
July 31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at all our options,'' Malone said. ``Our first  
choice is we get on a roll and play winning baseball, and all the 
questions we have will have been answered.''

<HEADLINE> Astros' Dierker Returns to Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker returns to baseball with a  
peach-fuzz hairstyle, a nasty scar and a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, Dierker was carried out of the Astrodome, the  
victim of a grand mal seizure, and had an emergency operation to 
repair blood vessels in his brain. On Thursday night, he returns as 
manager of the Houston Astros against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans have been invited to wear brightly colored Hawaiian shirts  
-- Dierker's favorite -- to welcome him back. He wore a lei while 
speaking to reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be delighted, but I haven't been antsy to get back,''  
Dierker said. ``I don't feel anything but normal. I'd say at no 
point did I worry about my recovery. I had confidence that I would 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strangest thing is that time seems to have no meaning; I  
find myself out of touch with time,'' Dierker said. ``It's been a 
month since this happened and it seems like two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may still have a little sense of losing track of what time  
it is, but that's getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker won't be allowed to drive for another five months and  
that bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to drive is driving me up the wall,'' he said.  
``Every day I have the urge to get in the truck and drive 
somewhere. My wife has a busy life and she's going to get tired 
having to drive me everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros begin the second half of the season with a long  
injury list that includes third baseman Ken Caminiti and left 
fielder Moises Alou. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have Alou back than myself and I'd rather have Camy  
back than myself,'' Dierker said. ``But what we've gotten from the 
outfielders and third basemen we have wasn't so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's No. 49 jersey came down from the dugout where it has  
hung since his collapse in the eighth inning of a game against San 
Diego on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans no changes in his managing style.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has affected my intellect,'' Dierker said. ``I feel  
the same and my philosophy is the same. I know what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker checked out of Methodist Hospital on June 23 and has  
been recuperating at home. He has managed a few visits to the 
Astrodome and a few rounds of golf while convalescing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the energy for a stressful workout and I don't  
have permission to do it, so that doesn't matter,'' Dierker said. 
``I was able to play golf a few times and I was able to do that in 
the heat of the day so I feel pretty good about my condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Galante was the interim manager of the team, which was was  
13-14 in Dierker's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's condition was diagnosed as arteriovenous malformation.  
Dr. Rob Parrish, who performed the surgery, said a mass the size of 
a ``really big jalapeno'' was removed and Parrish forecast a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	First base coach Jose Cruz left the Astros on May 10 for  
treatment of an irregular heartbeat. He has since returned. Hitting 
coach Tom McCraw began treatment for prostate cancer on May 16 and 
hasn't returned.

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Tests Online Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the popularity of fax machines and e-mail  
grows, the U.S. Postal Service hopes to give ``snail mail'' a boost 
by allowing customers to buy stamps over the Internet and print the 
postage directly onto envelopes and labels. 
</P>
<P>
	PC Postage marks the Postal Service's first big step into  
electronic commerce. The program is being tested by a select number 
of small businesses in California and the Washington, D.C., area. 
It could be available nationwide by the end of summer, Patricia 
Gibert, the agency's vice president for retail sales, said during a 
demonstration Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than individual consumers, the program initially targets  
an estimated 8 million small business and home office customers who 
find stamps inconvenient, but don't want to buy or rent a mail 
metering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we make mail easier, people will stick with it longer,''  
Gibert said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't trying to stop the tide of e-mail and it shouldn't  
be done, but ease of use is a big cost factor. It's not just (the 
price of) postage. You've got to meet the customer where he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tests have been under way for more than a year. They are being  
conducted by E-Stamp Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif.; Stamps.com of 
Santa Monica, Calif.; and two makers of mechanical postage meters, 
Neopost Inc. of Hayward, Calif. and Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney 
Bowes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The systems require customers to purchase stamps in advance  
using a credit card or debit card. Service fees are expected to run 
about 10 percent. Customers can purchase stamps for first-class, 
priority and express mail. Customers can use their own printer to 
create a postmark and bar code in the envelope's upper right-hand 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, the software allows customers to do individual or  
mass mailings. The Web sites preserve a log of all mailings and a 
list of stamp prices. And as an option, companies provide digital 
scales that will weigh larger letters and tell the customer how 
much postage is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really been great. Now I'm not peeling and sticking  
stamps,'' said J. Wingate Greathouse, office manager at Bowles 
Kendrick &AMP; Lemanski Architects in San Francisco, one of the 
companies involved in the E-Stamp testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellington Wilson, whose Wellington E-Group is creating an  
online shopping mall, began testing the Stamps.com product in 
January. The system worked without a hitch in February, when he 
used it for a 500-letter mailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that I could just run the envelopes through the  
printer and fix the postage made it so convenient, the fact that I 
didn't have to go to the office and buy $200 worth of stamps,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Final testing has focused on ensuring that the systems offered  
by each company is secure against hackers and counterfeiting, 
Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the 1,200 customers involved in testing have purchased  
more than $75,000 worth of stamps to send 46,000 pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, at least, the system isn't suitable for big companies  
that send hundreds or thousands of pieces of mail per day. 
</P>
<P>
	For large projects, metering machines are faster and more  
efficient. Though that could change if private companies create new 
software and printers, there are currently no plans to expand the 
PC Postage market beyond small businesses, Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrepreneurs being who they are and with the opportunity to  
take an idea and expand it, we can see products that might work for 
larger customers,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Chris LeDoux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Chris LeDoux is the kind of fellow who  
takes his cowboy hat seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``This Cowboy's Hat,'' a song on the country singer's new  
``20 Greatest Hits'' album, a motorcyclist threatens to ``rip that 
hat right off your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux responds: ``You'll ride a black tornado across a Western  
sky. ... Bulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat. Long 
before you take this cowboy's hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a distinctly nonrugged white golf shirt during an  
interview at the offices of Capitol Nashville record company, the 
former rodeo champion exudes cowboy. He is ruggedly handsome, 
offers a firm handshake, looks you in the eye and is unfailingly 
polite. 
</P>
<P>
	One doesn't even consider messing with his hat, even if this day  
it's a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux, 50, is the genuine article, the world champion bareback  
bronco rider of 1976. He began writing and singing songs about the 
rodeo for his own amusement. He is still a working rancher, with 
about 200 cows on his Wyoming spread. 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux put out dozens of albums on his own small record label  
starting in 1972, selling to a strong cowboy subculture left behind 
by much of mainstream country music. In 1989, a new singer named 
Garth Brooks praised LeDoux in the lyrics of his first hit single 
``Much Too Young to Feel This Damn Old.'' Brooks sang: ``The 
worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze seem to 
be the only friends I've left at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has acknowledged an artistic debt to LeDoux, for his  
energetic stage show and the melding of country with 1970s rock 
influences. ``20 Greatest Hits'' includes LeDoux duets with Brooks 
(``Whatcha Gonna Do With a Cowboy''), Jon Bon Jovi, Toby Keith and 
Charlie Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux signed in 1991 with Capitol Nashville, which is also  
Brooks' record company, but he has not been supported by country 
music radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he continues to sell, especially in the West. ``20  
Greatest Hits'' has been selling around 10,000 copies a week, an 
amazing amount without any radio exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	1. You've had a slow-building career that has lasted an  
extraordinary long time. How have you managed that? 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux: It was this gradual uphill climb. We started out selling  
maybe 4,000 or 5,000 albums the first year. I didn't know if I was 
reaching anybody, and I was going down a long dark tunnel and there 
didn't seem to be a light at the end of it. I was really beginning 
to wonder. And then some guy came on the radio talking about a 
`worn-out Chris LeDoux tape.' That was really the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Let's get you in trouble. Is it true Garth Brooks basically  
stole your act? 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux (laughing): You are a troublemaker. Garth has often given  
me some credit for what he does, and I feel flattered that he says 
that. I think he was doing his thing before he saw us perform. I 
think maybe when he did see us, it kind of made him feel like it 
was OK to do that. You know, here's a guy that's a real cowboy and 
he's doing it so it's OK to go ahead and be whatever you want to 
be. I borrowed some stuff from Garth. I've borrowed from Charlie 
Daniels, so we all kind of borrow a little here and there from 
people we admire. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Your new album is called ``20 Greatest Hits,'' but really  
you've never had a ``hit.'' Why do you think radio stations 
continue to ignore you despite evidence that you have a substantial 
audience? 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux: No, we don't really have any hits according to radio or  
Billboard or whatever. But these are the hits of my fans, hard-core 
fans. ... It is frustrating that radio hasn't really picked up on 
the stuff. We have little pockets out West that play everything we 
send out as a single. If it weren't for those areas, I don't know 
if this thing would have worked at all. 
</P>
<P>
	I hate to really go into it too much, but radio is a business,  
and they've got to play what has worked in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You were among the first country acts to perform with the  
energy of an arena rock show. How did that evolve? 
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux: Somewhere in the '80s, I really started listening to a  
lot more music than just country. There was some old ZZ Top things, 
Charlie Daniels, the Eagles and just a wide variety of things. And 
my kids were listening to people like Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, AC/DC, 
all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	I hated to admit that I liked rock 'n' roll back in the '70s,  
but I did. Maybe because I was a cowboy and I thought cowboys 
aren't supposed to like rock 'n' roll. But I do. The groove, the 
energy, and then if they have a lyric to go along with it that sort 
of fits my lifestyle, then it's really good. Charlie Daniels is a 
great example of that. He can put a country lyric to a rock 'n' 
roll tune and it works. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How do you balance a music career with keeping a ranch going?  
</P>
<P>
	LeDoux: My father-in-law runs the ranch, my kids help, my wife  
helps, and when I'm home they save me some of the good chores. 
Musically, we do probably 100 dates a year, so that gives me a lot 
of time off and keeps me fresh, so when I do get back out on the 
road, we're ready and rocking. We're pretty small compared to most 
ranches. We have about 200 cows.

<HEADLINE> Congress Likely To OK Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress seems on the verge of giving itself a  
cost-of-living pay raise of more than $4,600, with both supporters 
and opponents saying they expect the proposal to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	The key vote is likely to occur Thursday, when leaders of both  
parties -- who support the 3.4 percent increase -- have agreed there 
will be debate and a House roll call on the issue. Most lawmakers 
now earn $136,700 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``People won't be able to say we slunk into this,'' said Rep.  
Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a senior Democrat and supporter of the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the increase occurs automatically every year unless  
Congress votes to block it. The Senate has already approved the 
Treasury Department spending bill that is the traditional vehicle 
for denying the increase -- without language preventing it and 
without any debate on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The House vote comes at a time when the country's economy is  
prospering, a three-decade string of budget deficits has melted 
into surpluses, and Congress' approval rating is at a healthy 56 
percent, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus ``takes away the argument some of us used in  
the past saying we shouldn't have any adjustment to our salaries 
until we take care of the deficit,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., 
author of the House version of the Treasury bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the favorable political climate, House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., 
have discussed the pay boost, as have other House leaders, to make 
sure neither side will use the proposal as a partisan issue against 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker supports the  
increase. ``All federal employees are getting a COLA,'' he said, 
using the shorthand for a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt offered the same justification.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way we treat government workers, and I think we ought  
to do this,'' he said in a brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said he does not oppose cost-of-living  
increases for lawmakers but believes this one is too generous. He 
said he would prefer an increase matching the one Social Security 
recipients receive, which this year was 1.3 percent, the lowest in 
a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think politically it will bite us,'' he said, if legislators  
get a higher increase than the 45 million elderly and disabled 
Americans who get Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic is Pete Sepp, spokesman for the conservative  
National Taxpayers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last thing Congress should be considering right  
now, especially since taxpayers haven't yet received a single penny 
of tax reduction this year, nor any assurances spending will be 
held in check,'' Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Souder and others on both sides of the issue said the  
proposed increase has not been contentious this year and will all 
but certainly take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``About none,'' Kolbe said when asked how much controversy the  
proposal has created, ``aside from a few media people trying to 
stir it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the 1990s, with huge federal deficits and an  
unpopular Congress, proposed pay raises often generated intense 
public opposition and became fodder for radio talk shows. Before 
last year, Congress had voted to block itself from getting a raise 
every year since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 most representatives' and senators' salaries rose to  
$136,700. Leaders get more, with Hastert earning $175,400, the same 
as Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 law established the current mechanism for lawmakers'  
annual automatic increase, reducing the number of politically 
sensitive votes they must take on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	It also created a formula making the size of their increases  
slightly smaller than the boosts that federal employees receive. 
President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
government workers next year, while lawmakers would get 3.4 
percent, or about $4,648.

<HEADLINE> Concert Ticket Prices Skyrocketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cathy Berkman paid $125 apiece for two tickets  
to Bob Dylan and Paul Simon's upcoming show at Madison Square 
Garden, a far cry from the cheap old days of concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City epidemiologist and her husband have ticket  
stubs from a Dylan concert with the Band in 1974 for $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do wish it were more affordable,'' she said Tuesday. ``If I  
were a college student now, I wouldn't be seeing Dylan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average concert ticket costs $38.56, up $5 in one year and  
$13 since 1996, according to a survey by the industry trade 
publication Pollstar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rolling Stones charged an average of $109.62 per seat at the  
34 shows the band performed in the United States this year. Opera 
star Luciano Pavarotti charged a $130.77 average at four shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The artists have really dropped the pretext that they are not  
doing it for the money,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, Pollstar editor. 
</P>
<P>
	For the hottest shows, fans don't seem to mind. Two concerts at  
Madison Square Garden by Latin sensation Ricky Martin -- with 
tickets priced between $38 and $78 -- sold out in 20 minutes on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to fans is usually several dollars higher than  
the ticket price, since many venues and ticket agencies add 
surcharges that weren't figured in Pollstar's average. 
</P>
<P>
	Concert tickets were undervalued for many years, judging by the  
stiff premiums that shady brokers were able to get for premium 
seats. Promoters saw how much people were willing to pay brokers, 
so they decided to charge more themselves, Bongiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ego and greed quickly became involved. When some musicians  
tested the waters with high prices, their competitors figured they 
deserved as much or more and raised their prices accordingly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixties-era rock fans now have more money and are willing to  
spend it on their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, if you were a rock 'n' roll star you had  
certain countercultural connections. You couldn't maintain that and 
charge a high level ticket price,'' Bongiovanni said. ``That's gone 
by the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three old favorites -- Neil Young, Elton John and Rod Stewart --  
were in Pollstar's top 10 list of most expensive tickets this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheapest average tickets among the 50 most lucrative tours  
this year were sold by the heavy metal double bill of Poison and 
Ratt, at $18.09. The Offspring charged an average of $18.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran concertgoer Berkman said that along with the high  
prices, concert venues do little to ensure that fans are 
comfortable, secure and enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like fans have an infinite tolerance to put up with  
this kind of abuse,'' she said. ``I wish there would be a 
boycott.''

	Russian physicists have created a new, super-heavy element that  
lasted a surprisingly long 30 seconds before disintegrating -- 
long-sought proof, they say, of the existence of an ``island of 
stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using an atom smasher to bombard plutonium with calcium ions,  
the physicists created an element with an atomic weight of 114. The 
newest addition to the periodic table has yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-four elements exist in nature. Scientists have spent 60  
years creating elements in the lab, registering 21 so far. But some 
of the more recent elements were so unstable that they 
disintegrated in milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, physicists have theorized the existence of  
super-heavy manmade elements with a much longer life. These 
elements would make up an ``island of stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, researchers at the  
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, reported 
creating two atoms of element 114 that lasted for as long as 30 
seconds before flickering out. This, they say, is proof the island 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, and more recent creations of even heavier  
elements, have no practical applications as far as today's 
scientists know. 
</P>
<P>
	But for academics, it's thrilling. The study of super-heavies  
could shed light on supernovas and origins of the universe. And 
chemists are interested in how they bond with compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The new manmade elements are numbered according to how many  
protons are in their nuclei, not by their order of discovery. 
Numbers 95 through 112 were created between 1944 and 1996. In the 
past year, scientists have created not just 114, but also 116 and 
118. The ones in between have not yet been created. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, scientists thought one isotope, or version, of  
element 114 -- with 114 protons and 184 neutrons -- would be very 
stable because its nucleus would have a full complement of neutrons 
and protons. No more could be squeezed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, the Dubna scientists made an isotope of element  
114 with 175 neutrons. In March, the lab created another 114 
isotope, but it had only 173 neutrons and was therefore less stable 
than the first one they created. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, another major lab trying to create elements, Lawrence  
Berkeley National Laboratory in California, forged the heaviest 
element yet, 118, and when it decayed, it morphed into element 116, 
then an isotope of 114 with even fewer neutrons than Dubna's. It 
lasted for milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
	These three types of 114 are just off the ``island of  
stability,'' scientists say, because they are all short of the 184 
neutrons needed. But physicists say they are in ``shallow water,'' 
and that's proof enough. 
</P>
<P>
	If they can create a 114 isotope with 184 neutrons, they would  
reach real stability: perhaps a life measured in years. 
</P>
<P>
	One physicist, Albert Ghiorso of Lawrence Berkeley, said he is  
skeptical the Russians really did create such an element. He said 
that with their setup, it is too difficult to pinpoint a single 
atom among all the collision byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Neil Rowley, of the Institute for Subatomic Research in  
France, is convinced the Dubna observations are real. ``Everything 
behaves the way it ought to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Said To Finish Sudan Oil Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's main state oil company has completed a  
refinery and pipeline in Sudan in its biggest overseas project to 
date, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muglad Oilfield project is part of aggressive overseas  
expansion by China National Petroleum Corp., which is looking for 
oil to fuel China's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is expected to produce up to 10 million tons of oil  
a year, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sudanese refinery built by CNPC will process 2.5 million  
tons of oil a year through a 940-mile pipeline that stretches from 
Heglid in southern Sudan to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	China until recently relied on its vast northeastern Daqing  
oilfield to fuel its energy needs, but output is declining and it 
has yet to find new large domestic supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	China plans to have an oil supply from abroad of 10 million tons  
a year by next year, and 50 million tons of oil and 50 billion 
cubic meters of gas by 2010, according to Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Contractors Implicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contractors hired as the ``first line of  
defense'' against Medicare fraud'' have their own integrity 
problems, including misuse of government funds, federal 
investigators report. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative agency,  
found that six of the contractors have paid at least $235 million 
in civil and criminal penalties since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	And the inspector general's office of the Health and Human  
Services Department found that contractors were ``misusing 
government funds and actively trying to conceal their actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two reports, submitted to a House Commerce subcommittee and  
obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday, accused Medicare 
officials of doing a poor job of monitoring the contractors. The 
GAO said the officials ``may have placed too much trust'' in the 
contractors' promises that their anti-fraud systems were working. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, had a more harsh view of findings he called ``deeply 
disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the contractors were able ``to dupe'' officials of the  
Health Care Financing Administration because the agency ``routinely 
gave them advance warning about the dates of any reviews and about 
the records the agency wanted to review.'' HCFA administers the 
insurance program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peacock, HCFA spokesman, responded that over the past two  
years, HCFA has cut the Medicare error rate in half, and, working 
with other agencies and officials, has returned $1.2 billion to the 
Medicare trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	HCFA has taken steps to cut down on Medicare fraud and toughen  
oversight on Medicare contractors, Peacock said. He said HCFA has 
asked Congress to pass legislation that would enable Medicare to 
impose stiffer penalties and make it easier to take work away from 
contractors who fail to protect Medicare funds, but Congress has 
not done so. 
</P>
<P>
	General Accounting Office official Leslie G. Aronovitz told the  
committee that the six contractors who were assessed the $235 
million in penalties were charged with numerous fraudulent 
practices, including improperly paying claims, destroying or 
deleting backlogged claims, failing to recoup money owed Medicare 
and manufacturing documentation to support claims payments that 
should have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The current and former contractors cited in the reports were  
hired ``to serve as Medicare's first line of defense against 
inappropriate and fraudulent claims made on Medicare funds,'' 
Aronovitz said. They work in the fee-for-service portion of the 
insurance program, and are responsible for paying providers for 
their Medicare services. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said the health care agency was able to identify only  
three of 17 contractors with ``integrity problems.'' The others 
were discovered through whistleblowers and federal investigators 
familiar with the contractor practices. 
</P>
<P>
	George F. Grob, deputy inspector general at HHS, reported that  
the contractors were ``misusing government funds and actively 
trying to conceal their actions, altering documents and falsifying 
statements that specific work was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, contractors prepared bogus documents to falsely  
demonstrate superior performance for which Medicare rewarded them 
with bonuses and additional contracts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grob said some contractors ``turned off'' processing systems  
designed to prevent inappropriate payments, ``resulting in misspent 
Medicare Trust Fund dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a review of 12 contractors found deficiencies at all of  
them in documenting the amount of money that providers owed 
Medicare, due to overpayments and claims that should have been paid 
by other insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, electronic security was so weak at 11 of the 12  
contractors that ``we were able to penetrate the security systems 
and obtain access to sensitive Medicare data,'' Grob reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his office's investigations resulted in nine civil  
settlements and two criminal convictions, while 21 former or 
current contractors remain under investigation.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Stadium Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A 480-foot crane being used to build the new  
home of the Milwaukee Brewers collapsed onto the stadium Wednesday, 
killing three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant crane fell while lifting a section of Miller Park's  
retractable roof. The wind was gusting about 30 mph at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Lawrence Gardner confirmed that the victims were  
workers, and said further checks were being made to ensure there 
were no other injured at the site. The victims' names weren't 
immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	A 64-year-old crane operator was in satisfactory condition with  
a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Brewers postponed Thursday night's scheduled game  
against the Kansas City Royals at County Stadium, which is adjacent 
to the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Trunzo, chairman of the board overseeing construction of  
the $400 million stadium, said contractors were cooperating with 
the police and sheriff's investigation into the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we have a death or serious injury, we treat it as a  
criminal investigation,'' Police Chief Arthur Jones said. ``It may 
not result in that, but that is how we treat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
collided with an aerial basket. A worker fell 60 feet from the 
retractable roof May 10 and was briefly hospitalized with multiple 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Geoff Leber from the nearby Veterans Administration hospital  
saw the crane after it fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see the whole structure inside the stadium,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Craig lives near the main entrance of County Stadium, the  
Brewer's current home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off. It was like two explosions,''  
Craig said. ``When I went outside I looked around and saw the 
helicopters hovering over the stadium and I could see that the 
crane was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the mayor's office, said there was  
significant damage to the stadium, ``but it would be pure 
speculation to estimate how long it would set the project back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof is being built by Mitsubishi. The crane was used to  
lift seven sections of a roof structure weighing a combined 12,000 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	With about half the sections in place, the roof had been  
expected to be completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43,000-seat ballpark is scheduled to open next season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Food Stamp Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Seeking to encourage the fast-moving shift of  
Americans from welfare to work, President Clinton took steps today 
to help low-income families with jobs receive food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there still is ``work to do to make sure that work pays.  
We are changing the rules so thousands of poor working families 
won't be denied food stamps, as they are today, just because they 
own a reliable car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the administration would streamline reporting  
rules for food stamp recipients and launch a national campaign ``to 
make sure that working people know there is no indignity in taking 
public assistance to help feed their children if they're out there 
working 40 hours a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of five working families eligible for food stamps  
actually apply for assistance and receive it, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke to the Democratic Leadership Council, the  
centrist political organization that he helped establish. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by the strongest economy in a generation and strict new  
work requirements and time limits, welfare rolls have dropped from 
more than 5 million families in 1994 to just 2.7 million by the end 
of last year. However, studies show that many of the families still 
have trouble paying for food and other household bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people are not getting assistance such as Medicaid, food  
stamps and child care subsidies that are available even after a 
family stops receiving case assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced steps allowing states to make it easier for  
working families to own a better car and still receive food stamps. 
Currently, working families receiving federal help such as child 
care lose food stamp eligibility if the value of their car exceeds 
$4,650. Clinton's order will allow states to use more generous 
asset tests, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the president ordered a simplification of food  
stamp reporting rules which, the administration said, discourage 
recipients from going to work, and give agencies a huge paperwork 
burden. For example, working families would be able now to report 
expected earnings every quarter instead of every month. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was to undertake  
a nationwide public education campaign to inform working families 
about food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit to Baltimore came on the heels of a daylong  
visit to the Miami area, where he raised up to $1 million for the 
state's Democratic Party and criticized Republican tax-cutting 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also harshly condemned the Coast Guard's tactics in trying to  
prevent six Cuban refugees from swimming to shore in Miami on June 
29. The refugees were blasted with high-pressure water aimed at 
their rowboat and one was doused with pepper spray.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Tallies HMO Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Holding firm for a second day, Senate  
Republicans refused to extend new HMO rules to all 161 million 
people with private health insurance on Wednesday. GOP leaders 
crafted alternatives to other Democratic proposals in an effort to 
blunt political damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of Republicans have defected in a series of votes  
this week over the details of new patient protections. That's 
partly because Republicans answered -- or promised to answer -- 
Democratic proposals on emergency room care, women's health and 
clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why people are sticking together, because they know we  
are going to deliver on the substance,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, 
R-Tenn., who is helping to lead the GOP effort. ``That's the 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate considered more than a half-dozen issues Wednesday,  
including clinical trials, breast cancer treatments, emergency room 
treatments, access to specialists and a new tax deduction for 
long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted, 52-48, to restrict many of the provisions to  
the 48 million Americans whose health plans fall outside state 
regulation. Democrats wanted to cover all 161 million people with 
private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also agreed to require health insurance companies to  
pay for overnight hospital stays when women are treated for breast 
cancer, if a doctor recommends it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on breast cancer came a day after Republicans rejected  
a similar, broader Democratic measure and promised to produce their 
own version. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, all 45 Democrats balked at the GOP breast  
cancer provision because it also eliminated a Democratic amendment 
that would have allowed easier access to experimental treatments. 
Democrats tried to get the Senate to include both provisions, but 
Republicans refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Republicans promised to produce their own amendment on  
experimental treatments by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll deliver,'' Frist said, promising to fold some ``very  
good'' Democratic ideas into the final GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major issue yet to be considered is the right to sue.  
Democrats want to give patients who are denied care the power to 
take their health plans to court. That issue was set for debate 
Thursday, when the Senate will take a final vote on the HMO 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Senate is virtually certain to approve the  
Republican plan, which President Clinton has signaled he will veto. 
With no compromise in sight, it is unlikely any of these rules will 
become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have legislation offering new  
federal rights for Americans in health maintenance organizations 
and other managed care plans. But the GOP plan is more modest than 
the Democratic bill on virtually every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Senate took a second vote concerning who is  
covered under the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It had considered the same issue Tuesday, but that vote was  
muddied because it was actually voting to replace the measure on 
coverage with one concerning taxes. The vote Wednesday vote was a 
direct referendum on who is covered by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is covered is among the most fundamental questions being  
debated this week, clearly demonstrating each party's approach to 
the role of government. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill would apply many of the new patient protections  
only to the 48 million Americans who are in health plans that are 
exempt from similar state regulations. Other people are covered by 
state law, and Republicans say states can adopt these rules if they 
want to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that the source of all wisdom when it comes to  
health care is in Washington, D.C.,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla. ``We don't have the philosophy that one size fits all ... 
that whatever the states have done is not good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to include all 161 million Americans who have  
private health insurance. This would assure that everyone gets the 
new rights, even if the states do not adopt them on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of the federal government is to step in when  
protections need to be everywhere in this country,'' said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who went to Capitol 
Hill to boost the Democrats' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans did extend some of their provisions beyond the  
core 48 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast cancer amendment, introduced by Sen. Olympia Snowe,  
R-Maine, covers everyone with private health insurance except state 
and local workers, or about 140 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	And the GOP would require all health plans to adopt appeals  
procedures, allowing patients to take denials of care to outside 
panels. The same goes for a ban on discrimination against people 
based on their genetic information. 
</P>
<P>
	No Democrat has voted with Republicans during this week's  
debate, and only a handful of Republicans have voted with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Those siding with Democrats at least once were GOP Sens. Spencer  
Abraham of Michigan, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Peter Fitzgerald 
of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania 
and John Warner of Virginia.

	ASUNCION, Paraguay, (AP) -- Amoroso and Rivaldo scored goals  
Wednesday night and Brazil beat Mexico 2-0 in a semifinal game in 
the Copa America soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay, which beat Chile 5-3 on penalty kicks after the teams  
finished 1-1 Tuesday night, plays Brazil in the championship game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected shootout between the tournament's two most potent  
attacks turned out to be one-sided, as the Brazilians shut down 
Mexico's Luis Hernandez and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's strategy of taking the fight to the Brazilians  
foundered on a tough defense and gave Ronaldo and teammates all the 
space they needed to unveil their repertoire of dribbles, no-looks 
and touch passes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 25th minute, Ze Roberto zoomed to the baseline and  
crossed to Rivaldo, who put a header on the post. The ball caromed 
out to Amoroso in the middle of the goal, and he tapped it in for a 
1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 44th minute, Rivaldo found Ronaldo at the top of the  
penalty area, where he was tripped. Rivaldo picked up the loose 
ball and fired it into the left corner to make it 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Ranger Helps Snare Elusive Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For Drew Carter, it was a pivotal moment made  
possible through long hours, dogged police work and something else: 
salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, the sergeant in the Texas Rangers had been building a  
relationship with the family of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. He was 
trying to do the improbable -- get a man accused of eight killings 
to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's hard work and personal touch paid off Tuesday when the  
39-year-old drifter, one of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted, quietly 
surrendered to the lawman after six weeks on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honesty's never hard. Sincerity is something people sense.  
That's what I did. I was honest with the family,'' Carter said, 
wearing the traditional hero's white hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunter and the hunted finally met on a remote bridge  
connecting Zaragosa, Mexico, with El Paso. Carter immediately 
recognized Resendez-Ramirez as he rode across the bridge in a 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a face that has just been shown all over the country  
for a long period of time now, and it's a face that I've been 
working on for the better part of six months,'' Carter said. ``So 
when I did see that face there was a little bit of excitement there 
because I finally said, `This is going to happen.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	First, there were pleasantries.  
</P>
<P>
	``He stuck out his hand, I stuck out my hand and we shook hands,  
and then I handcuffed him and he was in custody,'' the Texas Ranger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had been fishing in the Gulf of Mexico when he got a call  
Sunday from Resendez-Ramirez's sister, Manuela Maturino of 
Albuquerque, N.M. He dropped his fishing pole and jumped on a 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two days, the rookie member of Texas's most elite  
law enforcement agency brokered negotiations that led to one of the 
most high-profile arrests in Rangers history. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez is charged with three slayings and suspected in  
five more. Texas officials said the international manhunt might 
have continued if not for the relationship Carter cultivated with 
the suspect's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really, as far as we can tell, would not have happened  
without Ranger Carter,'' Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who became a ranger on Sept. 1, rejected sole credit for  
the arrest, citing assistance from the FBI, U.S. Marshals and other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that there were very personal one-on-one  
discussions with family members representing the subject and myself 
and other people that brought this about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service in El Paso has been  
under fire for letting Resendez-Ramirez slip through its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just six weeks ago, Resendez-Ramirez was in the custody of  
border agents who picked him up for illegally being in the country. 
Yet within hours, he was sent back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened even though he already was wanted by the FBI, and  
Houston police had told the INS they wanted him for questioning in 
a murder. Authorities believe he killed four people after the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, INS officers in El Paso were taking some solace in  
the fact that he was caught there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it makes up for it, but there were some  
lessons that were learned,'' said Luis Garcia, district director 
for the INS, parent agency of the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	C.G. Almengor, a supervisor at the Border Patrol processing  
facility where Resendez-Ramirez was taken in June, said the 
agency's computer system did not indicate he was a wanted man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our systems told us he was nothing of lookout material,''  
Almengor said. ``We really wish he had been in the system so we 
could have caught him before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key in Resendez-Ramirez's surrender was the acceptance of  
several conditions: The fugitive wanted promises for his safety 
while in jail, regular visiting rights and a psychological 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris County District Attorney John Holmes faxed the agreement  
to Albuquerque, where Ms. Maturino passed the offer on to a 
relative in Mexico on Monday. Before long, she was calling Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love their brother and their relative and they care for  
him deeply, but at the same time they have been cooperative in this 
investigation and are doing what they feel is the right thing,'' 
Carter said.

	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A man extradited from Mexico on a murder  
charge pleaded innocent Wednesday to killing a woman while her 
quadruplet toddlers were with her at home, leaving them to crawl in 
her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Luis Del Toro, a U.S. citizen, submitted a written plea and

<P>
	Mrs. Bellush, and the children covered in her blood, were found  
by her teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors persuaded Mexican officials to send Del Toro back to

Mexico does not have. Two men already are in prison for their roles

<HEADLINE> House GOP Pushes Adoption Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening a new front in the abortion wars,  
Republicans want family planning clinics to talk adoption when 
pregnant women look for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation being introduced today would require federally  
funded clinics to counsel women on adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't intend for it to force a woman to make one decision  
or another,'' said sponsoring Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. ``But when 
women know all the information, they'll choose a different 
alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeMint is co-sponsoring the bill with Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va.,  
chairman of the Commerce Committee and an adoptive father of two. 
Bliley has promised to move the bill through his committee quickly, 
DeMint said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, which receives much of  
this funding, said counselors already talk about adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anti-abortion forces would have everyone think that we  
force abortion, that you walk in for a Pap smear and they said, 
'Why not have an abortion instead?''' said Sandra Jordan of Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you call most of the clinics in the country, they already  
talk calmly and rationally about the options,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But DeMint said he thinks family planning clinics have a  
financial stake in encouraging abortions while they get nothing out 
of adoptions. He cited a study that found many women are never told 
about adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he hopes the bill will not be divisive.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this bill will bring a lot of these people together  
around an idea that gives women a good choice without forcing them 
or taking any of their rights away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also create a new $7 million grant  
program. National adoption organizations could apply for the money 
to train the staff of health centers on adoption counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the legislation passed, though, the program would still  
have to compete with other domestic programs for money.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves Disability Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The telecommunications industry must make  
pagers, cellular phones and other equipment and services easier for 
disabled people to use under new rules approved today by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules do not spell out specific standards. Instead, they  
require manufacturers to do all they can in designing products and 
services to address the needs of the disabled. The cost of 
implementing such features would be kept down by incorporating them 
early in the production process, said William E. Kennard, chairman 
of the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oftentimes, all it takes is just writing a different code in  
the software, or incorporating a small change in the design phase 
of a product early on,'' he said. ``Our rules grant a fair amount 
of flexibility to manufacturers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equipment such as voice-activated phones, talking Caller ID and  
phones with keypads that have large buttons or small identifying 
bumps on the ``5'' key would be more commonplace under the new 
rules. Also more widely available would be ``text telephones,'' 
usually referred to as TTY or TDD systems, and phones with volume 
controls or lower placement for people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules stem from a provision of a 1996 telecommunications law  
that instructed the FCC to take steps to give disabled people 
better access to telecommunications services and devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the FCC's action Wednesday ``represents the most  
significant opportunity for people with disabilities since the 
passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also should provide benefits to another group: aging baby  
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Vanderheiden, an industrial engineering professor at the  
University of Wisconsin-Madison, said consumers shouldn't view 
future technological features as those only intended to help the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we age, we find that disabilities and functional  
limitations increase,'' he said. ``When we're young, not many of us 
probably have disabilities but as we get older we're finding that 
they increase more and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of people affected by functional limitations --  
such as weakened hearing, eyesight and mobility -- increase with 
age. FCC officials said that 45 percent of people ages 65 to 69 are 
slowed by such disabilities, which affects 55 percent of those 70 
to 74. For people 75 and older, about 72 percent are affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the new rules are not intended to micromanage the  
design process of telecommunications products. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about making sure there is a meaningful good-faith  
dialogue between all the stakeholders here, the industry, the 
disability community and those of us here at the FCC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will enforce the rules through fines or damage awards  
from the thousands to the millions of dollars. Kennard, however, 
said he believes manufacturers won't have a problem meeting the 
rules because of the flexibility being granted to them. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that many products commonly used today -- such as  
the vibrating pager or closed-caption television sets -- were 
designed for people with disabilities, who account for roughly 54 
million Americans and a high number of the nation's unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bolnick, program manager for Microsoft Corp.'s  
Accessibility and Disabilities Group, said some of the changes can 
be as simple as slapping a piece of velcro on a cell phone so that 
a person in a wheelchair with limited hand mobility. Other features 
are already built into the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had to expose it,'' he said. The whole premise behind  
the rules, he added: ``It's the attitude.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blasts Handling of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Saying he was outraged by the Coast  
Guard's rough handling of Cuban refugees off the Florida coast, 
President Clinton is promising ``orderly, safe and legal'' entry 
into the United States for those fleeing Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the treatment was not authorized by anyone in  
Washington and did not reflect a shift in U.S. policy toward Cuban 
refugees. But he did say that policy is under review to determine 
whether it needs revision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look and see whether the policy we have is  
manageable, given the problems that we're facing,'' Clinton said. 
``I want you to know there will never be a time when any of us will 
willfully sanction the use of excessive or inhumane tactics in 
dealing with anybody coming into this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to recent incidents, many of them carried on  
television, in which the Coast Guard worked aggressively to keep 
Cuban refugees in boats from reaching the U.S. shore, including 
turning fire hoses on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke during a Florida Democratic Party  
fund-raiser Tuesday night at the Coral Gables home of sugar grower 
Alfonso Fanjul, a native of Cuba. He addressed the refugee issue at 
the Fanjul's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanjul said he wanted Clinton to clarify U.S. policy because  
most Cuban Americans were appalled to see refugees mistreated at 
the hands of the Coast Guard, which was widely credited with having 
``saved more Cuban lives than anybody at sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would appreciate if you would address the issue,'' Fanjul  
said. ``The Cuban American community, as well as most South 
Floridians, support a policy to keep migrations safe, legal and 
orderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed with Fanjul's assessment. ``We have to keep  
movement here orderly, safe and legal,'' he said. However, he said, 
the Coast Guard also finds itself trying to balance that policy 
with efforts to ``deal with a situation which, as you well remember 
from times past, spiraled out of hand,'' a reference to the 
flotillas that brought Cubans to the United States en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is further compounded, Clinton said, by the need to  
ensure that refugees are not being manipulated by Castro's 
government or smugglers who sneak aliens into the United States, 
then force them into unlawful labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coast Guard, in part I think, has tried to react more to  
try to cut down on alien smuggling,'' Clinton said. ``But what 
happened with the way those people were sprayed and all that is 
just outrageous. I want you to know it was not an authorized 
policy. ...We have taken vigorous steps to make sure it does not 
happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also voiced ``a continuing frustration'' with  
Cuba, the lone Communist government in the Western Hemisphere. He 
said tougher sanctions and increasing to 20,000 the number of visas 
issued to Cuban nationals have helped U.S. officials in coping with 
the refugee situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have tried to do is to be firm with the government of  
Cuba,'' Clinton said. ``One of the most difficult things has been 
how to handle the people that want to get away, particularly when 
you know well from time to time they've been used as a political 
weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the speech, the president flew back to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Hill Named Fordham Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Hill, who coached the New York Knicks and  
two other NBA teams, is returning to New York -- as coach of Fordham 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, fired by the San Antonio Spurs after a 3-15 start in 1997,  
signed a 10-year deal reportedly worth $4 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to learn about coaching, but I do have to find  
out the NCAA recruiting rules,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who coached at Indiana as well as with the Spurs and  
Knicks, was 257-212 in seven seasons with the Indiana Pacers, Spurs 
and Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``College is not a step backward,'' he said. ``I love coaching  
and don't consider it work. There is nothing we can't accomplish at 
Fordham and I feel that we can be competitive in the conference 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1990-93, he was head coach of the Pacers and went 113-108  
while making the playoffs all three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	His first season with the Spurs, in 1994, Hill led the team to a  
league-best 62-20 mark. He was fired after a 3-15 start in 1997 and 
has since worked as a consultant with the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 15 years since I did any recruiting and the game has  
changed in that respect,'' Hill said. ``I may not know the rules 
yet, but when I do, I'll be as enthusiastic about recruiting as I 
am about coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill succeeds Nick Macarchuk, who resigned after 12 seasons to  
take a coaching position at Stony Brook, which is moving up to 
Division 1 next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordham moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference from the Patriot  
League in 1995 and has had little success, losing 80 of 108 games 
in four seasons. The Rams have not played in the NCAA tournament 
since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Artist Works in Christian Theme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's 14 feet tall and looks as if he's pushing  
up the ceiling, but actually he's an Italian acrobat standing on 
his hands -- the artist has just turned her video upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Taylor-Wood is more a sculptor than a painter. She just  
carves in colored light rather than wood or stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Though her figure resembles the mythological Atlas holding up  
the world -- an Atlas in white shorts -- the work has a Christian 
meaning. She calls it `Noli me tangere'' - the Latin for ``Touch me 
not,'' the words of Jesus to Mary Magdalene as she approaches him 
after the Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been in Italy a lot, and it's an image you see in old  
Italian painting,'' explained Sydney Lawrence, spokesman for the 
Hirshhorn Museum. But Italian artists Titian, Corregio and Fra 
Angelico depicted the scene literally. 
</P>
<P>
	'' `Noli me tangere' suggests that to be touched would threaten  
Jesus' transitional state,'' the artist told curator Olga M. Viso. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this work I wanted to achieve the same threat -- of having  
the man standing there in a vulnerable state, so that touching him 
might totally shatter him,'' Taylor-Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British artist, 32, opens her first American museum exhibit  
on Thursday. ``Noli me tangere'' was done particularly for this 
show. It's the only item on view in a darkened room. She filmed the 
acrobat twice, front and back, so he can be seen from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	For 4 minutes and 26 seconds -- a long time to stand on one's  
hands -- he strains and grunts audibly in a wordless ``narrative.'' 
Then his feet seem to go up in the air. Actually, since the video 
is upside down, he's just standing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor-Wood's works, done in similarly unusual styles, strive  
for something different. ``Five Revolutionary Seconds'' is a series 
of panoramic photographs, each 25 feet long, so the viewer walking 
alongside them gets a feeling of time passing. Her film 
``Hysteria'' depicts a woman happy by day and consumed by grief at 
night from the loss of someone close. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Taylor-Wood won the Illy Cafe Prize in Venice for the  
most promising young artist, at the Biennale show. Last year she 
was short-listed for Britain's important Turner Prize, but lost out 
to painter Chris Ofili, known for using lumps of elephant dung in 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
	--------------	 

</P>
<P>
	``Directions-Sam Taylor-Wood'' will be at the Hirshhorn Museum  
through Oct. 17. Admission is free.

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Fred Durst, lead singer for the rap-metal  
band Limp Bizkit, was arrested for allegedly kicking a security 
guard in the head on stage during a concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Durst, 28, was taken into cusgtody but not charged Monday night  
after Limp Bizkit finished its performance. He was released on 
$50,000 bail. The case was referred to the city attorney's office 
for possible misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The security guard was treated for minor injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	``Durst was somewhat apologetic,'' said police spokesman Michael

his guy was getting beat up by two fans, and that's when he kicked 
the guy.''

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Head Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINDEN, Nev. (AP) -- The director of the Smithsonian  
Institution's National Air and Space Museum and an internationally 
recognized pilot died after their glider broke apart over the 
eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Engen, 75, head of the museum, and longtime friend  
William Ivans, 79, of La Jolla, Calif., were killed Tuesday when 
witnesses said Ivans' motorized glider broke apart at about 11,000 
feet and crashed into a field several miles east of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is a mecca for glider pilots because of wind conditions  
that allow for long, high-altitude flights. Larry Sanderson, 
president of the Soaring Society of America and a friend of both 
men, said it could also be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same conditions that produce world-class gliding can  
challenge you as well,'' he said, adding that ``it had to be a very 
unusual set of circumstances that stressed the aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another pilot who witnessed the crash told Sanderson that Ivans'  
Nimbus 4DM appeared to be ``nose down with the wings flexing 
greatly'' before breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no apparent weather disturbances at the time of the  
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen had been director of the museum in Washington, D.C., since  
1996. He also was administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration from 1984 to 1987, and served for two years on the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	A much-decorated Navy pilot, Engen retired as a vice admiral in  
1978. He also served as general manager of Piper Aircraft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as head of the museum after his predecessor, Martin  
Harwit, resigned in May 1995. Harwit left after some historians and 
veterans' groups complained that an exhibit on the dropping of the 
atomic bomb on Hiroshima was too sympathetic to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	Air and Space is one of 16 museums and galleries operated by the  
Smithsonian Institution, and is the most visited museum in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Engen and Ivans were top officers in the Soaring Society of  
America. Ivans was considered a soaring pioneer who had won awards 
for high-altitude flights. He was the former president of the 
International Gliding Commission.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Sugar Faces Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine sugar industry should  
prepare for greater competition from foreign producers in order to 
survive, a government official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Philippines and other countries lower trade barriers,  
foreign-produced sugar will flood the market and pressure local 
producers in the years to come, Agriculture Secretary Edgardo 
Angara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to face the reality that globalization is now the name  
of the game,'' Angara said in a statement to a conference of local 
and foreign sugar producers. ``The best we can do is to prepare for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar is the country's fourth most important crop, next to rice,  
coconut and corn. The Philippines used to be a major sugar 
producer, supplying about 10 percent of the world's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Angara, however, said years of government neglect and lack of  
initiative by local producers to modernize led to a gradual decay 
of the industry. The conversion of sugar plantations to other uses 
also hurt production, forcing the Philippines to become a net sugar 
importer today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his department is preparing a master plan to try to  
reverse the sugar industry's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also launched emergency measures, including a farm  
tractor loan program and the establishment of centers to develop 
and distribute disease-resistant and high-yielding cane varieties, 
Angara said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is trying to slow the pace of sugar tariff cuts  
pledged by past government trade negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Angara said efforts to protect local sugar producers are  
temporary and comply with the World Trade Organization's rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine sugar industry employs some 556,000 farmers and  
25,000 sugar mill workers, with up to 5 million other people 
directly or indirectly dependent on it.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Defend Limited HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, battling Democrats over  
patient rights, offered a series of modest alternatives on women's 
health, access to specialists, emergency room care and other 
popular proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding firm for a second day, only a handful of Republicans  
have defected in a series of votes on the details of new patient 
protections. That's partly because Republicans answered -- or 
promised to answer -- popular Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why people are sticking together, because they know we  
are going to deliver on the substance,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, 
R-Tenn., a surgeon who is helping to lead the GOP effort. ``That's 
the strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defeated, 53-47, a Democratic plan to require  
insurance companies to pay for needed specialists even if the 
specialists are outside a health plan's network. Republicans 
promised their own version, which would require ``timely'' 
specialist care, but would not give patients the right to go 
outside a network. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a day after defeating a Democratic measure on women's  
health, the Senate approved a GOP measure requiring health 
insurance companies to pay for overnight hospital stays when women 
are treated for breast cancer, if a doctor recommends it. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats support that idea, all 45 of them voted no  
because the GOP version eliminated a Democratic amendment that 
would have allowed easier access to experimental treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats tried to get the Senate to include both provisions,  
but Republicans refused. Instead, Republicans promised to produce 
their own amendment on experimental treatments by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll deliver,'' Frist said, promising to fold some ``very  
good'' Democratic ideas into the final GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., was working with a handful  
of Democrats to fashion a compromise that incorporates much of what 
Democrats want. His spokesman, Nicholas Graham, said Chafee had 
four Republicans on board and would need just one more to reach 50 
votes if all 45 Democrats went along. 
</P>
<P>
	On an issue that sharply divides the parties, the Senate refused  
to extend new HMO rules to all 161 million people with private 
health insurance on Wednesday. The 52-48 vote meant many of the 
provisions would only apply to the 48 million Americans whose 
health plans fall outside state regulation because their employers 
provide insurance plans that are federally regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major issue yet to be considered is the right to sue.  
Democrats want to give patients who are denied care the power to 
take their health plans to court. That issue was set for debate 
Thursday, when the Senate will take a final vote on the HMO 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Senate is likely to approve the Republican plan,  
which President Clinton has signaled he will veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have legislation offering new  
federal rights for Americans in health maintenance organizations 
and other managed care plans. But the GOP plan is more modest than 
the Democratic bill on virtually every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Republican proposals were first introduced  
Wednesday, after the GOP voted down the Democrats' version. 
</P>
<P>
	For example:  
</P>
<P>
	--On emergency room care: Republicans agreed that insurance  
companies should pay for care during an emergency -- and after a 
patient is medically stable, a retreat from their opening position. 
But Democrats said the plan had too many loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	--On women's health: Democrats would allow women to designate  
gynecologists as their primary care doctors; Republicans would not. 
But the GOP came closer to Democrats by allowing pregnant women to 
see obstetricians without prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is covered is among the most fundamental questions being  
debated this week, clearly demonstrating each party's approach to 
the role of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that the source of all wisdom when it comes to  
health care is in Washington, D.C.,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the new rights must apply nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
	``The role of the federal government is to step in when  
protections need to be everywhere in this country,'' said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who went to Capitol 
Hill to boost the Democrats' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans did extend some of their provisions beyond the  
core 48 million people. The breast cancer amendment, for instance, 
covers about 140 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	No Democrat has voted with Republicans during this week's  
debate, and only a handful of Republicans have voted with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Those siding with Democrats at least once were GOP Sens. Spencer  
Abraham of Michigan, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Peter Fitzgerald 
of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania 
and John Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee's spokesman said Fitzgerald, McCain and Specter were  
willing to support a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Upward; Dow Gains 19.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today, led by a late rally  
in technology stocks that was spurred by a strong earnings outlook 
from computer chip maker Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 19.31 at 11,194.33, offsetting much of its 26-point drop on 
Tuesday and pushing the blue-chip index within points of a new 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index was up 33.53 at 2,811.76 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 5.84 at 1,399.40. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech stocks rose on positive earnings news from Intel,  
which reported late Tuesday its second-quarter earnings jumped 49 
percent and that it expects a strong second half of 1999. Intel was 
up 2 1/2 at 67 7/8, the most active stock in Nasdaq trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also got a lift from reports that fund  
managers at Fidelity Investments were putting money back into the 
tech sector. The mutual fund company had backed off such stocks 
since February. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also supported by tame inflation news. The  
Labor Department reported the Producer Price Index -- which measures 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer -- fell a 
smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in June, the first decline in 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose just  
0.1 percent in June, a big slowdown from the May increase of 1.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports helped ease worries about a potential breakout of  
inflation, which could cause the Fed to raise rates again this year 
to slow U.S. economic growth and keep inflation contained. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were mostly higher in the last hour of trading,  
there was some weakness earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks fell as some investors took profits on the  
market's recent record-setting rise, which lifted the Dow to a new 
high -- its third in four sessions -- on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market came a long way in a short period of time and  
that's why we are seeing a little weakness today,'' said Alfred E. 
Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also were hurt by increasing fears about political  
tensions in Asia after the Chinese government accused Taiwanese 
President Lee Teng-hui of embarking on a doomed attempt to split 
his island from China. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also lingering concerns about Latin America's  
economic situation. The nervousness was set off Monday by comments 
from Argentina's presidential candidates, who hinted at a possible 
moratorium on repayment of the country's debt. That raised concerns 
on Wall Street that U.S. financial services companies would suffer 
losses because of unpaid loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plain and simple, the market turned a blind eye to the Latin  
American situation over the last seven or eight months,'' said 
Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
``Argentina has served as a reminder that they need to watch the 
situation in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.99 at  
655.63, and the American Stock Exchange composite index was down 
0.42 at 811.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by narrow margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 594.09 million shares, up from 594.91 
million shares on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Work Against Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration pledged Wednesday  
to make elimination of foreign barriers to American farm exports 
the centerpiece of upcoming world trade talks, despite strong 
European opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration witnesses before a Senate Finance subcommittee on  
trade said Europe's efforts to sidetrack the upcoming round of 
global trade talks with extraneous issues will not work. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, under secretary of commerce for international  
trade, called Europe's tactics the ``ABA strategy -- anything but 
agriculture,'' hoping to include so many issues for negotiators to 
tackle that nothing gets accomplished in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to reach a deal would preserve current European  
agriculture trade policies, which include high barriers blocking 
sales of many American farm products and trade-distorting 
production subsidies for their domestic crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make agriculture the centerpiece for progress in  
the round,'' Aaron told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said European  
farmers are the most protected in the world with EU programs 
accounting for 85 percent of total world spending on farm 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said U.S. negotiators will push for significant cuts in  
agricultural tariffs and the total elimination of export subsidies, 
which distort trade by driving down global prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the host for a meeting of trade ministers  
from the 134 nations that belong to the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO conference in Seattle in late November and early December 
is the expected formal launch of a new round of talks with a goal 
of further lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods, 
services and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said  
it was crucial to make agriculture a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and other committee members criticized the administration  
for its failure to push aggressively for the legislative authority 
it will need to complete the global trade talks, known as fast 
track authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hosting the meeting in November, yet the president of  
the United States is effectively without a seat at the table,'' 
Grassley said. ``Other countries won't have the confidence to 
negotiate an agreement with us if our president doesn't have fast 
track authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has been unable during the past two years to  
gain approval of fast track authority because of strong opposition 
from Democrats. Fisher told the committee the administration was 
engaged in consultations with Democrats and Republicans in the 
House and the Senate, trying to gain a consensus on fast track 
legislation that could be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, criticized the administration for  
a lack of leadership in the trade area. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration hasn't had the courage to push a fast  
track bill and push its own people to support it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm also criticized the administration for walking away in  
April from a good offer from the Chinese to open its markets to 
American exports in return for U.S. support of its membership in 
the WTO. Gramm said he feared ``we missed a golden opportunity'' 
that would have reaped significant benefits in increased sales for 
American farmers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher later told reporters that the trade talks with China  
probably would remain on hold until after an upcoming Chinese 
leadership meeting. While Japan and Australia recently completed 
their own WTO agreements with China, Fisher said those deals fell 
far short of the market-opening moves the administration will 
demand before it drops its objections to China's entry into the 
WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the Japanese have left it to us to do the  
heavy lifting'' in terms of getting meaningful trade concessions 
from the Chinese, Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Makes Awkward Slip-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. (AP) -- It was a poignant moment. In a  
discussion on gun violence, Hillary Rodham Clinton began addressing 
a woman whose son was injured in a 1994 shooting at the State 
University of New York at Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've really spent a lot of time in the years since your  
son's murder ....'' Mrs. Clinton told Alice McEnaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McEnaney interrupted her. ``He wasn't murdered,'' she said.  
``My son's alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God,'' said Mrs. Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton looked at the young man, who was among the 60  
people who had gathered at a middle school to discuss gun violence 
with the first lady. ``I support everything she does,'' he said of 
his mother's anti-gun work. ``It brings tears to my eyes that she's 
taken this on as her mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason McEnaney was shot in the groin when he disarmed a gunman  
holding 36 people hostage in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had met Mrs. McEnaney, but not Jason, prior to the  
forum. Before Mrs. Clinton spoke, Mrs. McEnaney had talked about 
the incident involving her son but did not specifically say he had 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion on gun violence was part of Mrs. Clinton's  
``listening tour'' of New York. She is traveling around the state 
as she considers a run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide poll released Wednesday said Rudolph Giuliani, the  
Republican mayor of New York City, had a slight lead in a 
head-to-head matchup against Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion,  
said Giuliani was the choice of 47 percent of voters questioned 
with Mrs. Clinton favored by 41 percent. Twelve percent were 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January and February, separate Marist polls had the first  
lady sporting an 11-point lead over the mayor. By April that had 
dwindled to a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hillary Clinton is on a listening tour, New Yorkers are not  
saying what she wants to hear,'' Marist pollster Lee Miringoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miringoff said the first lady is obviously concentrating her  
efforts initially where she needs the most help. 
</P>
<P>
	Among upstate voters, the poll found Giuliani was favored by 56  
percent while 30 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. In the suburbs, 
Giuliani led the first lady, 54 percent to 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Democrat-dominated New York City, Mrs. Clinton led, 61  
percent to 29 percent. Traditionally, if a Republican can draw 30 
percent of the New York City vote in a statewide race, the 
Democratic candidate is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third of voters said they had a great deal of concern that  
she is not from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have both formed Senate exploratory  
committees. Also considering a run at the Republican nomination is 
Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island. Mrs. Clinton led Lazio, 46 percent 
to 34 percent, the poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 515 registered voters was conducted Sunday  
and Monday and has a margin of error plus or minus 4.5 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary Clinton is listening to people, not polls,'' said  
Howard Wolfson, her committee spokesman.

<HEADLINE> British Open Course Could Be Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Rain fell on the Carnoustie Golf  
Links and a breeze stiffened as Tiger Woods, fresh off a helicopter 
ride through the clouds, sat safely inside a tent off the 18th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from St. Andrews across the Firth of Tay didn't faze  
him. Neither did the conditions that threaten to make the British 
Open course as cruel as it is long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' Woods said. ``I've always loved it. I grew up in  
Southern California where we had good weather every day. So it is 
always a challenge to play in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elements were back in play Tuesday, leaving the warm  
sunshine that greeted the start of the week as nothing more than a 
distant memory and reminding players of just how tough Carnoustie 
promises to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods could be excused for his optimism; he had played only four  
holes the day earlier and hadn't yet seen the course at its full 
7,361-yard self. 
</P>
<P>
	Others had, though, and it wasn't always a pretty sight.  
</P>
<P>
	With fairways that seem the width of cart paths, deep rough and  
long, long par-4s, Carnoustie would be tough under the best weather 
conditions. And seaside British Opens are rarely played in the best 
weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest course I've ever played,'' Bernhard Langer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make us look foolish if the wind blows real  
hard,'' said U.S. Open winner Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what happened in the third round last year at  
Royal Birkdale, when Brian Watts was the only one to break par and 
Woods shot himself out of serious contention with a 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkdale could pale in comparison, though, to a nasty day on the  
thin fairways of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might as well stick red hazard posts down the fairways,''  
Phil Mickelson said. ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as 
that for a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when the U.S. Open was played with little rough, the  
British Open more than makes up for it with tall, spindly grass 
that seems to grow out of everywhere on the links course. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the fairway is crucial. The problem, the course plays so  
long that most players will be forced to hit drivers off the tee on 
most par-4s. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Woods and a few others will have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will be able to hit say a 2-iron or 3-wood off the tee just  
as far as some of the guys can hit their drivers,'' Woods said. ``I 
believe that is a tremendous advantage in any tournament, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three of his last four tournaments and was in  
contention coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open, is the 
favorite of British oddsmakers to win his first major since the 
1997 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	His swing has evolved in the last year and he is playing with  
more consistency and patience. And, he learned a few things from 
Birkdale last year about the wind that may serve him well here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing, yes, but I learned I needed to control  
my ball flight a little more and be more efficient at it,'' Woods 
said. ``I needed to learn how to putt in the wind a little better, 
different techniques used in the wind. These are things you have to 
learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is back in the Open rotation for the first time since  
Tom Watson beat Jack Newton in an 18-hole playoff in 1975 to win 
the first of his five British Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The course is longer now and the fairways tighter. Bunkers were  
mostly all redone, and one was added on No. 6 to keep players from 
carving shots like Ben Hogan hit on the par-5 in 1953 on his way to 
a win there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the wind they are predicting for Thursday, you might  
see some real tears out there,'' said Watson, who is back at the 
age of 49 but not a serious contender this time. ``It may separate 
the field right away to the point where you have 10 or 15 players 
who will win the tournament out of that first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be a winner, no matter how hard the wind blows or  
how high the scores go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can complain about it as much as we like or want, but the  
simple fact is that the golf course is going to be there,'' said 
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal. ``It is going to be the same 
for everybody and someone will win.''

	WAUKEE, Iowa (AP) -- At a farmstead surrounded by corn fields but  
once used as a methamphetamine lab, Vice President Al Gore promised 
Wednesday an aggressive battle against rural drug use, without 
offering many details. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that when methamphetamines can strike a place like  
this, we've got to strike back hard in a determined way,'' Gore 
said as he campaigned for president with an anxious glance over his 
shoulder at Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was following the vice president into Iowa Wednesday  
night, popped up increasingly -- by thinly veiled implication -- in 
Gore's public remarks on this two-day swing. Aides said Gore soon 
will be attacking the Republican governor by name in order to 
sharpen their policy differences. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Gore only went so far as to speak of a  
``Republican opponent'' who was ``ready to move into the mansion 
before the election.'' From Waukee, he flew to eastern Iowa to 
court farmers in a 77-minute discussion of their struggle with 
record low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the American people stand to lose if we allow a  
short-term crisis to drive thousands of small family farmers into 
bankruptcy and off the farms,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	On drugs, Gore said he would, if elected, ask Congress for a  
sharp but unspecified increase in federal funds to hire 100 
additional Drug Enforcement Administration agents assigned to rural 
areas and trained to shut down methamphetamine labs. The Clinton 
administration budget for fiscal 2000 asks Congress for $20 million 
for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised his own administration would launch ``the most  
effective and comprehensive anticrime strategy that our nation has 
ever seen -- from our cities to our suburbs to our cherished rural 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke in front of the peeling white paint of the Waukee farm  
garage where police officers last year dismantled a makeshift lab 
cooking meth, also known as crank or speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the highly addictive drug, which Gore called ``a  
particularly insidious kind of threat,'' has soared in rural 
communities in recent years. Police seizures from clandestine meth 
labs in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Nebraska tripled 
between 1992 and 1996. Meth is also a growing problem in 
California, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare of cost estimates, Gore additionally promised to create  
anti-meth education programs in rural schools and launch a new 
multimedia campaign -- like the egg in the frying pan with the 
slogan ``This is your brain on drugs,'' but specially targeted to 
rural residents. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said he would up the ante by 50,000 on an old Bill  
Clinton campaign pledge to put 100,000 new cops on the beats in 
neighborhoods across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Gore proposed an anti-crime package focused  
at urban areas. He was using this trip across Iowa -- site of the 
nation's leadoff presidential nominating contest next year -- to 
focus on rural crime efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore campaigned in Iowa, the White House announced that  
President Clinton will begin raising money for Gore next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will begin his travels by meeting Gore in Little Rock,  
Ark. on Aug. 6, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He will 
attend a Gore fund-raiser there the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also will attend four Washington dinners on behalf  
of Gore 2000, two on Aug. 10 and two more Sept. 22, Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Asks Supporters To Stay Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Trailing his chief Republican opponent  
by a whopping $18 million in campaign funds, Vice President Al Gore 
is asking supporters to bear with his slower, steadier race focused 
on issues. Besides the money, he's also sharpening his attacks on 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush on abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore derided Bush, the man Gore could face in next year's  
general election for president, for his recent rejection of any 
``litmus test'' on the abortion issue and his signature on Texas 
legislation allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms and 
barring localities from suing gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a dinner with Iowa women Tuesday night about the GOP  
stand on abortion rights, Gore parroted language Bush used recently 
to say that, as president, he would not select Supreme Court 
nominees on the basis of their views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about it. There IS a litmus test in the  
Republican party,'' Gore insisted to some five dozen Des 
Moines-area women he was trying to recruit for his campaign 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I yield to no one in my support of women's rights,'' said  
Gore, who loses narrowly to Bush among women in current polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the vice president was closing a two-day Iowa swing with  
a deliberative expansion on his theme of the week: Crime. After a 
Monday speech in Boston on gun control and urban crime, the vice 
president was stopping this morning at the site of a 1998 drug bust 
-- the Waukee farmstead used as a lab making the highly addictive 
meth, or ``crank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the illegal drug in rural communities has soared in  
recent years. Police seizures from clandestine meth labs in 
Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Nebraska tripled between 
1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was using today's occasion to announce proposals ``to build  
in a significant way on the president's agenda'' cracking down on 
meth, spokesman Chris Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low on specifics and bare of cost estimates, Gore is proposing  
to add 100 Drug Enforcement Administration agents specially 
assigned to rural areas and trained to shut down meth labs. The 
Clinton administration budget for fiscal 2000 asks Congress for $20 
million for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would create anti-meth education programs in rural  
schools and launch a new multimedia campaign -- like the egg in the 
frying pan with the slogan ``This is your brain on drugs,'' but 
specially targeted to rural residents. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposes doubling the number of areas designated as high  
intensity drug trafficking, a designation that brings additional 
federal attention and funds for police. There are currently 20 such 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he would up the ante by 50,000 on an old Bill Clinton  
campaign pledge to put 100,000 new cops on the beats in 
neighborhoods across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his outward focus on laying out his own policy agenda,  
Gore, for the first time since Federal Election Commission reports 
two weeks ago showed Bush raised a record $36 million in campaign 
cash this year, vented some frustration as he plugged for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep our powder dry, conserve our resources,  
develop as much unity of purpose as we can,'' the Democratic 
presidential hopeful told local women activists here Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other side, the Republican side, has raised more money  
than anyone ever has,'' Gore said in dire-warning tones. ``They 
have raised all this money and they're not even slowing down.''

<HEADLINE> Bayer To Expand Calif. Biotech Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German chemicals and pharmaceuticals  
group Bayer AG plans to spend $340 million in expanding its 
California biotechnology center because of biotechnology's 
increasing importance in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer has already invested $300 million in facilities at the  
site in Berkeley, Calif., which is Bayer's global headquarters for 
research, development and production of biotechnology products. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the products produced there is the hemophilia treatment  
Factor VIII, or Kogenate. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional investment will be made over the next five years,  
starting with construction of a new $9 million central services 
building, due for completion next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act now to increase our capacities in order to  
continue to meet the challenges and requirements of the market in 
the future,'' said Michael Kamarck, senior vice president of Bayer 
Corp., the group's U.S. arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer said production capacity at the site could double by 2022  
and sees payrolls increasing by 600 from a current 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment is part of a 10-year, $15 billion U.S. expansion  
program that began in 1995, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux May Miss Friday Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux may miss Friday's court-imposed  
deadline to put together a $50 million offer to buy the Pittsburgh 
Penguins as he wrangles over terms with one key investor in his 
proposal, the Tribune-Review of Pittsburgh reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's lawyers were expected to ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  
Bernard Markovitz for an extension on the deadline, believing that 
the delay is only needed to work out some details. The move is not 
expected to threaten the Hall of Fame player's purchase of the 
team, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew from the start that it would take a while to put the  
deal together,'' said William Daly, NHL senior vice president for 
legal affairs. ``It's not at all unusual in a deal of this size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Lemieux's attorneys -- Chuck Greenberg and Douglas  
Campbell -- did not return telephone calls to The Associated Press 
on Wednesday, but sources involved in the sale told the 
Tribune-Review that negotiations are continuing with one key 
investor, Los Angeles supermarket executive Ronald Burkle. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle was expected to put up $20 million of the $50 million  
offer, but Greenberg refused to tell the newspaper how much Lemieux 
had received in commitments from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with issues as they come up,'' Campbell said.  
``So far, we haven't seen anything we can't solve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle, 46, is the former chairman of Fred Meyer Inc., based in  
Portland, Ore. It was the fifth-largest grocery store chain in the 
country when it merged with Kroger Corp. this spring. Burkle's 
personal worth has been estimated at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Burkle, Ari Swiller, said he did not know of any  
issues that would delay the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``All systems are go on this end,'' he said.

	Clinton Wants Stem Cell Research  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's top ethics advisers are  
close to recommending a change in federal law to allow the 
government to finance a certain type of human embryo research -- but 
the White House instead said today it will support a more 
conservative approach. The issue is over experiments with ``master 
cells,'' the building blocks of life that scientists can cull from 
human embryos. These embryonic stem cells are generating huge 
excitement because they could lead to new therapies for Alzheimer's 
and other devastating diseases. But the use of them has raised 
troubling ethical questions.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- At least three people were killed today when a  
480-foot crane used for building Miller Park collapsed onto the 
partially finished stadium. The crane apparently collapsed while 
trying to lift a section of the retractable roof. Strong winds in 
the area were gusting to about 30 mph at the time. A mayoral 
spokesman said the accident caused significant damage to the new 
43,000-seat ballpark for the Milwaukee Brewers, which is scheduled 
to open next season.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich of Ohio shelved his Oval  
Office dreams today and threw his support behind a ``soul 
brother,'' Texas Gov. George Bush. Crushed under the Bush financial 
steamroller -- Kasich raised $1.6 million compared with the 
front-runner's $36 million -- he was the second Republican 
presidential candidate to drop out of the race this week after Sen. 
Bob Smith. The nine-term congressman said he plans to work for 
Republicans across the country for the next year and a half, but 
that he would not run for re-election next year.

spreading the AIDS virus to their babies: a drug treatment that 
costs just $4 per mother and could save up to 1,000 newborns a day. 
The drug nevirapine already is widely sold around the world to 
treat AIDS. But the new study found it is 47 percent more effective 
than the therapy now recommended in developing countries for 
preventing mother-to-baby transmission of the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> Chang Begins Tennis Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APTOS, Calif. (AP) -- Far from the French Open clay on which he  
built his reputation a decade ago, Michael Chang began his comeback 
in a most unlikely spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang played his first match since May at a challenger  
tournament -- the hinterlands of tennis -- in a tiny sports club 
overlooking Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Children played in a sandbox a few feet away. Spectators munched  
on crab cakes and pasta salad, and wondered aloud whether they were 
allowed to cheer at tennis matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang overcame a few unforced errors at the start of the second  
set Tuesday to win 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) over Wade McGuire, ranked 472nd 
in the world. It was Chang's first match since losing in the first 
round of the French Open in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel right now I'm at a little bit of a crossroads, and I'll  
do what I have to do,'' he said. ``And that means playing at a 
challenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang was No. 2 in the world a couple of years ago and has won a  
singles title on the ATP Tour every year since 1988, the longest 
streak of any active player. He has won almost $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's trying to regain his touch in a tournament at which  
banners promote sponsors such as the Natural Neurology Center and 
Aegis Assisted Living. The winner of this week's challenger 
tournament gets $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	It's similar to Mark McGwire trying to get back his timing in  
Triple-A, or Tiger Woods working back into shape on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang is not the first player to take this route. Andre Agassi  
played in a couple of challenger tournaments in 1997 as he began a 
comeback that culminated recently with the No. 1 ranking in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang won the first seven points of Tuesday's match and  
dominated the first set against McGuire, an NCAA singles finalist 
in 1992 and 1993 for Georgia. Chang dropped the first three games 
of the second set, but rallied to force the tiebreaker and finished 
off the match with an overhead winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little bit rusty,'' he said. ``This was a great match  
for me, to get out there and play a lot of tough points. I don't 
think you can duplicate these matches in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang had not played in a challenger event since 1987, two years  
before he became the youngest man to win a Grand Slam tournament 
title when he captured the French Open as a 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	But this has been a difficult year for Chang. He has entered 14  
ATP Tour events and made it past the second round just once. After 
losing to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round of the French Open, 
he was bothered by back spasms and decided to skip the grass court 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ranked 59th, Chang hopes Tuesday's match will be the first  
step in a steady path toward the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like at this point, it's been a tough year for me, and  
to win matches is important,'' he said. ``If you don't win matches, 
you lack confidence going up against the top players. It's that 
mental toughness and confidence I need.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Refuses To Alter U.S. Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel today rejected an attempt to  
alter the formula for distributing foreign aid, keeping a system 
that has allowed Israel to get its money all at once while 
parceling it out to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	That system is ``stupid foreign policy,'' said Rep. Sonny  
Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee 
on foreign operations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his effort to change the formula to end the upfront  
payments to Israel was rejected by the subcommittee, which instead 
adopted by voice vote a proposal to revert to the older system. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of keeping the status quo said this was not the time  
to change the formula to Israel's disadvantage, particularly as the 
Mideast peace process seems to be getting back on track and 
Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, was on his way to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation in dealing with the Middle East to first  
do no harm,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate occurred on a $12.8 billion foreign aid bill, which  
the subcommittee later approved unanimously. The full 
Appropriations Committee will consider the legislation next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides $960 million in economic assistance and $1.9  
billion in military assistance for Israel in the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1. That compares to $1.1 billion in economic assistance 
and $1.9 billion in military assistance for Israel in the current 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Egypt, the bill provides $735 million in economic  
assistance, down from $775 million in the current year; and $1.3 
billion in military assistance, the same as now. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Israel gets its economic assistance up front, enabling  
it to put the money in an interest-bearing account. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan sought to change that formula, saying it made no sense  
to give Israel preferential treatment. Giving Israel its money up 
front also reduces any leverage the United States had over how the 
money is spent, he said. He blamed the ``Israel lobby'' for the 
existing formula, which has been in effect for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan removed the no-advance-payment provision from the  
legislation he presented to the subcommittee. But Reps. Joe 
Knollenberg, R-Mich., and Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., offered an 
amendment to restore it, and it was adopted by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the Appropriations  
Committee, proposed as a middle ground of adding $25 million to 
Egypt's accounts to help offset the imbalance. But Callahan 
protested that ``two wrongs don't make a right'' and Young withdrew 
his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill has drawn a veto threat from the administration  
because it is far below President Clinton's request for $14.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides $200 million in economic assistance and $125  
million in military assistance for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not include any of the $500 million Clinton requested to  
carry out the 1998 Wye River peace accords, nor does it provide any 
funds for reconstruction in the Balkans. And it provides $725 
million in aid to Russia and other former Soviet republics, some 
$307 million beneath Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it would withhold half the amount earmarked for  
Russia ``unless it ends nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation 
with Iran.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Apologizes for Belle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Baltimore Orioles fan who sent a written  
protest to team owner Peter Angelos about outfielder Albert Belle's 
on-the-field antics was invited to sit in Angelos' box at Camden 
Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos also apologized to Norm D. St. Landau, of University  
Park, who faxed his letter to the Orioles detailing lewd gestures 
he said Belle made to fans during a June 4 game at Camden Yards 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Landau said Belle gestured to fans in the bleachers with his  
middle finger and made other lewd displays after he was heckled for 
his slow chase of a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The season-ticket holder faxed his complaint to Angelos on June  
9, and within days received an invitation to watch the Orioles' 
June 22 game against the Boston Red Sox from the owner's box. 
Ironically, Belle won the game with a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle also ran afoul of team management after he shattered a  
clubhouse TV following a loss at Tropicana Field on April 21 and a 
shouting match with manager Ray Miller on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Foss, the Orioles chief operating officer, said this was  
``really the first time I was aware of any of Albert's actions 
being directed at our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When an athlete is angry after a game or breaks a TV, ``Those  
are internal matters club officials deal with,'' Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foss said the gesturing matter will be handled internally.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Landau's sister-in-law is Signe Wilkinson, Pulitzer  
Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson sketched Belle's pose and eventually submitted it for  
publication in last Friday's editions.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Resume Beef Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British beef producers are preparing to resume  
exports on Aug. 1, now that European regulators have ended a 
three-year ban imposed after an outbreak of ``mad cow'' disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The embargo had crippled Britain's beef industry, with lost  
sales estimated at more than $2.4 billion, and cattle farmers and 
industry executives welcomed the European Commission's decision 
Wednesday to let British beef back into overseas shops and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous day -- British beef will once again be  
able to leave these shores and be enjoyed on the dinner plates of 
the world,'' National Farmers' Union president Ben Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry still faces a long struggle to regain its  
reputation and rebuild overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous news, ... but unfortunately it's not the end  
of this sad story,'' said Welsh cattle farmer Peredur Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've now got to work very, very hard to get that market back  
because other people have stepped in to sell their beef. They will 
not be happy to give up their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brussels, Belgium-based European Commission, which enforces  
rules for the 15-member European Union, voted to clear British beef 
for export after it received final approval from EU veterinary 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ends a ban that the commission imposed after a 1996  
outbreak in Britain of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow 
disease, which medical researchers linked to a fatal human brain 
ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. 
</P>
<P>
	British beef still will be subject to strict precautions.  
</P>
<P>
	All meat for export must be de-boned and come from cattle born  
after Aug. 1, 1996, when a ban came into force on the feeding to 
animals of meat and bone-meal. Meat from cattle more than 30 months 
old will not be sold overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The embargo devastated Britain's beef industry. Domestic prices  
plunged by more than 50 percent as desperate farmers sold their 
meat in a glutted local market, and foreign competitors grabbed 
lucrative overseas orders. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler, speaking to the  
British Broadcasting Corp., said that results of scientific studies 
and inspections justified ending the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would not vote  
in favor to lift the ban,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it will take more than Fischler's imprimatur to win back  
Britain's lost market share. The Meat and Livestock Commission, a 
privately funded trade organization, expects beef exports this year 
to number no more than 5,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, British beef exports totaled 246,000 metric tons in  
1995, the last year before the ban. A metric ton is about 2,205 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long, hard struggle,'' said commission  
spokesman Jon Bullock. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to restore confidence, industry officials have  
adopted a subdued marketing strategy. They've given beef industry 
tours to 15 groups of journalists from continental Europe, but 
otherwise they have no plans to call attention to their product. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you called a product 'British beef,' you'd never launch it.  
Because of the problems over the past years, British beef has a 
poor reputation,'' said Terry Lee, who heads export marketing for 
The Meat and Livestock Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the mad cow furor, British beef was synonomous with high  
quality. Most of it came from cattle raised in grassy pastures 
rather than commercial feedlots, and chefs served the meat from 
France to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee expects cattlemen in France and Italy to pressure  
supermarkets not to buy British beef, and he anticipates that 
initial exports will be mostly to high-end restaurants and butcher 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The first, symbolic shipment of beef is destined for a  
restaurant in Lille, France. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle farmer Charles Smart said that exporters would probably  
have to offer big discounts to win back overseas customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't envy the men who are going to export this beef. I  
think they're going to lose a packet,'' said Smart, who owns 500 
head of cattle on a farm near Norfolk, 100 miles north of London. 
</P>
<P>
	For some producers, the embargo has ended too late. Gill, of the  
National Farmers' Union, suggested that many of Britain's 100,000 
cattle farms were irreparably damaged by the export ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a number of people who just packed it in,'' said  
Hughes, who raises 70 cattle on a farm near Llangefni in Wales, 250 
miles west of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was lucky, and resourceful. He staved off financial ruin  
by renting out some of his wind-swept pasture land to a company 
that erected 16 wind turbines to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal earns him nearly $50,000 a year, while he barely breaks  
even selling cattle.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Fined $6.8 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's executive  
Commission imposed $6.8 million in fines against British Airways on 
Wednesday for allegedly paying British travel agents to direct 
travelers onto its flights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Commission said it is investigating a series  
of complaints it has received in relation to commissions paid by 
airlines to travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is the result of a two-year inquiry triggered by two  
formal complaints from British Airways' arch-rival, Virgin 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin accused British Airways of offering travel agents extra  
commissions if they could demonstrate that its ticket sales were 
going up compared to rival carriers, particularly when selling to 
corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Branson's airline alleged that the program was designed  
to put pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest 
carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the EC warned British Airways the program was  
illegal, as European Union law prohibits the use of restrictive 
contracts to reinforce a dominant market position. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways then introduced a new ``performance rewards  
scheme,'' which triggered a second complaint from Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways is expected to appeal of the basis that it is  
being singled out for prosecution, as other leading European 
airlines operate similar incentive programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission runs the day-to-day affairs of the  
15-nation EU, proposes EU law, enforces its implementation across 
Europe, and represents EU governments in international trade talks.

<HEADLINE> Lost Mountain Runners Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHOE CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Sheriff's deputies rescued eight  
runners who were lost in the wilderness for 13 hours after they 
took a wrong turn during a rough-terrain race near Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers on foot and in four-wheel-drive vehicles combed the  
thick Sierra Nevada forest for the runners, who were found Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight were among 45 competitors in the Race Across  
California Enviro, an event that combines running, mountain and 
road biking and kayaking. The race ends Friday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 38 runners took a wrong turn, but most returned to the  
correct route while it was still light. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Team Schwab, from the stock brokerage in San  
Francisco, were apparently the first to take the wrong turn, 
leading others astray. Markings at the junction of a road and a 
trail confused the runners, sending them north instead of south. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have taken a compass,'' said Jeff McClanahan, one of  
the wrong-way runners. ``We should have never been out there in 
that kind of wilderness without being prepared.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Violence Alarms UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic attacks on Serbs and Gypsies  
must stop before justice can return to war-ravaged Kosovo, a top 
U.N. official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-old peace in Kosovo has been clouded by ethnic  
violence blamed largely on ethnic Albanians seeking vengeance for 
Serb forces' brutal campaign of killings and expulsions during 
NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killings, kidnappings, forced expulsions, house burnings and  
looting are daily occurrences. These are criminal acts,'' said 
Sergio Vieira de Mello, interim U.N. administrator for the 
province. ``They cannot be excused by the suffering that has been 
inflicted in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo's future must be built on justice, not vengeance,'' he  
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continuing ethnic strife, NATO's supreme commander  
for Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, said the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army was largely in compliance with demilitarization 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In the northern Serbian town of Subotica, 5,000 people  
gathered Wednesday to demand that the government of President 
Slobodan Milosevic step down. Government supporters hurled eggs at 
opposition leaders but police restored order, separating the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The town council in Becej, 30 miles south of Subotica, also  
urged Milosevic to step down, the private Beta news agency 
reported, becoming the fifth Serbian city or town to pass such a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Top U.N. war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour visited the site  
of a mass killing in the southwestern Kosovo village of Celine. 
Walking amid the shoes and clothing of children buried there, 
Arbour said she was ``profoundly moved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes investigators said they have exhumed 57 bodies so far  
from nine separate gravesites in the village, 9 miles northwest of 
Prizren. All the victims -- including 11 children -- were believed to 
have been shot by Serb forces in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NATO-led peacekeeping force KFOR arrived June 12,  
there have been scores of ethnic Albanian attacks on minority Serbs 
as well as Gypsies, or Roma, whom the Albanians say supported the 
Serbs. Many people have been forced from their homes, which often 
have been burned in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
	KFOR troops found bodies of Serbs and Roma who had allegedly  
been detained by the KLA at one site, and released three Serbs and 
four Roma at another, according to Manoel de Almeida e Silva, a 
U.N. spokesman. He did not specify the number of bodies found or 
give other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said both KFOR and the KLA ``expressed  
concern'' about reported criminal activity in the southwestern 
Djakovica area by ``well-armed Albanian gangs in KLA uniforms.'' It 
said KFOR troops have found nine bodies in the region over the last 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, KFOR sources said Serbs were apparently to blame  
for an attack the previous day in southeastern Kosovo in which four 
ethnic Albanians were killed and at least one wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
the four died when Serbs from Pasjane went on a shooting and 
looting spree as they drove through Mucibaba village, near 
Vlastica. U.S. peacekeepers were investigating but no further 
details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, arriving on a visit to review NATO forces in the  
province, held talks with KLA chief of staff Agim Ceku in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	He told journalists the KLA appears to be complying with a June  
21 agreement to put their weapons in storage and stand down from 
military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark also tried to allay fears by ethnic Albanians about the  
participation of Russian peacekeepers in KFOR. Villagers in the 
area around Orahovac presented him with a petition of 19,500 
signatures demanding the Russians not be stationed there. They say 
Russian mercenaries were involved in the killing of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark called the Russians ``very capable'' and said they are  
committed to the peacekeeping mission's goals. Some 700 Russians 
are in Kosovo as part of a NATO-dominated international 
peacekeeping force now totaling 32,400.

<HEADLINE> Judge Strikes Down Fish Symbol Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REPUBLIC, Mo. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Republic's  
use of a fish symbol on its municipal seal violates the U.S. 
Constitution's ban on establishment of an official religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republic resident Jean Webb, represented by the American  
Civil Liberties Union, sued the city last year claiming that the 
symbol -- known as an ichthus -- blurred the separation of church and 
state and created an uncomfortable environment for non-Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the purpose of placing the fish symbol on the city seal  
may not have been to endorse Christianity, the effect of the seal 
is to do so,'' U.S. District Judge Russell Clark wrote in a 
decision released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Doug Boatright said city leaders will seek citizen input  
when they decide whether to challenge the ruling. The city has 30 
days to appeal before it must begin replacing the seal that can be 
found on city vehicles, signs and stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is a practitioner of Wicca, or witchcraft. She moved to  
Republic in southwestern Missouri in 1995 and wrote an opinion 
piece in the city newspaper opposing the seal, saying the symbol 
suggested her religious practices would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	After her essay was published, Webb said she and her two  
children were harassed. She moved to Springfield after the lawsuit 
was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The ichthus, a historical symbol of Christianity, has appeared  
on Republic's seal since 1990. Resident Marilyn Schexsnayder 
designed the ichthus for a public competition and has said she 
thought the fish represented all religions.

<HEADLINE> China.com Makes Big Debut on Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Even with investors clamoring to enter China's  
potentially vast Internet market, the CEO of China.com was 
conspicuously shy Wednesday about the service provider's Wall 
Street debut. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com had an impressive initial public offering on the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq index -- rocketing from its launch at $20 a 
share to close Tuesday at $67.109 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading Wednesday, China.com gave up some of those  
gains, dropping 6.5 percent to $62.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sort of debut -- raising $84 million dollars, 40  
percent more than expected -- that would have had many executives 
crowing. 
</P>
<P>
	But after weeks of news stories on China.com's  
less-than-sterling track record, chief executive Peter Yip at the 
last minute barred reporters from a speech Wednesday at an Internet 
conference in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists who had received invitations to the event were  
denied entry at the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Yip specifically said he didn't want to talk to the media,  
explained Andrew Robinson, a representative from the conference 
organizer, Gavin Anderson &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com targets users in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  
But so far it is only a minor player in the mainland market, not 
even making the top 20 in some surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	It posted a loss last year of $8.5 million on revenue of $3.5  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Further concerns have been raised about censorship from the  
Chinese government, a major stakeholder though its Xinhua News 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rajeev Gupta, Asian Internet analyst at investment bank Goldman  
Sachs, said China.com attracted so many buyers in its stock debut 
because of big demand for ``a stock that provides both the Internet

<HEADLINE> Air Force Spent $270,000 on Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly $270,000 in kitchen renovations at the  
home of the superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy were made 
using money normally earmarked for day-to-day military operations 
and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenditure was not submitted for congressional approval,  
and critics in Congress have complained to the Air Force that the 
arrangement appeared to be an end run around congressional 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it. It looks like kind of a creative accounting  
setup,'' Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., chairman of the House Military 
Construction subcommittee, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force inspector general's office is looking into the  
kitchen project, Hefley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force arrangement is similar to one the Navy used to  
divert $5.5 million from its operating budget to renovate the 
official homes of three admirals, including the head of the U.S. 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the Navy and Air Force cases, military officials  
defended the repairs as necessary to maintain historic homes that 
are also used heavily for public functions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old Mediterranean-style home at the Air Force  
Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., got new kitchen cabinets, 
appliances and other improvements last year at a cost of $268,010. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go, `Wow! That's a lot of money''' for a kitchen,  
said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley. But the houses are 
old, and in many cases work has been put off for years, Quigley 
said. ``And if they're on the National Register of Historic 
Places,'' he said, ``it is our duty to maintain them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy reversed course last month and said it will pay for the  
work out of ordinary housing accounts, where the projects are 
subject to congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Navy came forward and said, `This is what happened. We  
don't think it's right, and we're going to change it,''' Navy 
spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Lydia Robertson said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Jay DeFrank said the Air Force is  
not making a similar decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our existing policy for using these funds is prudent, and no  
laws were broken,'' DeFrank said Tuesday. ``However, we are 
reviewing our procedures for notification when we intend to use 
these funds, including congressional notification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hefley said he and others in Congress also plan to change the  
way the military services ask for money for future renovation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	A House proposal would require that Congress be told of planned  
work on generals' or admirals' houses that costs more than $15,000. 
The provision also bans using any readiness money on the homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Pentagon leaders have decried a crisis in military readiness  
and have come hat-in-hand to Congress for money for new equipment, 
spare parts and training. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Air Force Academy did not return a telephone  
call requesting comment. The academy previously said Carlton House, 
home of the superintendent, Lt. Gen. Tad Oelstrom, is used for 
functions that entertain 300 people a month. President Clinton was 
at one after this year's graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all above board and approved. We followed appropriate  
guidance all along,'' academy spokesman Neil Talbott told The 
Gazette, the Colorado Springs newspaper that detailed the 
expenditure last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy annually spends $50,000 to $80,000 in readiness  
money to maintain the superintendent's and commandant of cadets' 
houses, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy plans to spend an additional $1.18 million over  
several years to remodel other sections of the superintendent's 
house, and some of that money also is to come from readiness funds, 
the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Sacks Catholic Gay Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Advocates for homosexuals rallied behind a  
priest and a nun ordered by the Vatican to end their longtime 
national ministry to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick on Tuesday  
were barred from ministering to homosexuals by the Vatican's 
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation said Nugent and Gramick ``have caused confusion  
among the Catholic people and have harmed the community of the 
church.'' It called their teachings ``erroneous and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent and Gramick founded the New Ways Ministry in Prince  
George's County in 1977 and have been under investigation by the 
church for years. They have repeatedly refused to condemn 
homosexuality as evil and instead strove for reconciliation for 
gays and lesbians with the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we have the Vatican trying to silence two people who are  
preaching tolerance, love and compassion,'' said Sister Maureen 
Fiedler, a friend. ``I think it's a total contradiction of the 
Gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Cox, executive director of Dignity USA, the nation's  
largest organization of gay Catholics, said Nugent and Gramick 
treated homosexuals with a rare sense of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to help people who are lesbian and gay  
understand that being gay does not preclude you from having a 
relationship with God,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington, D.C., the  
diocese where the New Ways Ministry is based, said the Vatican's 
decision was not made lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy See was very careful and very patient in undertaking  
such a serious action,'' Hickey said. ``Both were given numerous 
opportunities over the past 20 years to clarify their beliefs and 
to assent to the Church's full teaching on homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said he accepts the Vatican's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``It puzzles me because I have never questioned any dogma of the  
church,'' he said in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey ordered Gramick and Nugent in 1984 to break with their  
ministry. They were also told that any pastoral work with 
homosexuals must include ``the church's teaching regarding the 
intrinsic evil of homosexual acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent and Gramick persisted with their message, publishing  
``Building Bridges: Gay and Lesbian Reality and the Catholic 
Church'' in 1992 and ``Voices of Hope: A Collection of Positive 
Catholic Writings on Gay and Lesbian Issues'' in 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Limited Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's top ethics advisers are  
finalizing recommendations that federal law be changed to allow the 
government to finance a certain type of human embryo research, but 
the White House says it doesn't want to go that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the White House is opting for a more conservative  
approach advocated by the National Institutes of Health -- and in so 
doing, perhaps can avoid a fight with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is over experiments with embryonic stem cells, the  
``master cells'' that in early embryos generate all the other 
tissues of the body. Stem cells are causing huge excitement in the 
scientific community because researchers believe they can learn how 
to use the cells to make body parts or to find new therapies for 
Alzheimer's and other devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	But their use is raising troubling ethical questions, and has  
generated opposition from about 75 members of Congress. So Clinton 
ordered the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study how the 
nation should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded research involving human  
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics advisers met this week to put final touches on  
recommendations that would, among other things, urge a change to 
that law. Citing the great promise of stem cells, the draft 
recommendations would allow women who have leftover embryos after 
fertility treatments to donate those embryos to government-funded 
scientists, who would remove the stem cells for research. 
</P>
<P>
	That's further than the National Institutes of Health had  
proposed going. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists working last year with scarce private money succeeded  
in culling some stem cells from embryos -- a process that destroys 
the embryos -- and grew more cells for future research. 
</P>
<P>
	Because government-funded scientists didn't actually touch those  
embryos, NIH Director Harold Varmus says it is legal for government 
scientists to use the resulting lab-grown cells in an attempt to 
create new therapies. And he says there are enough lab-grown cells 
to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, the White House endorsed NIH's more  
cautious proposal instead of trying to get Congress to change the 
law of embryo research. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other legal actions are necessary at this time, because it  
appears that human embryonic stem cells will be available from the 
private sector,'' the White House statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much agree (with the ethics advisers) that stem cell  
research shows extraordinary promise for the future,'' added White 
House spokesman Barry Toiv. ``But we believe that it is not 
necessary at this time, given the current state of the private 
market, to urge a change in the law in order to provide sufficient 
stem cells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics commission members, in contrast, have said during their  
eight-month debate on the issue that more cells, culled from 
additional embryos, may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the ethics panel, Eric Meslin, was  
initially unaware of the White House position late Wednesday and 
had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Coal Power Faulted Over Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reliance on cheaper, coal-burning power plants  
by electric utilities because of price competition has 
substantially increased air pollution, two environmental groups 
charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16 percent increase in electricity production from  
coal-burning power plants from 1992 and 1997 produced an additional 
755,000 tons of smog-causing pollution annually, the 
environmentalists said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalist attributed the increase to competition in  
the electric utility industry, which has made increased use of 
cheaper, more polluting coal plants more attractive to power 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deregulation breathed new life into old creaky power plants,''  
maintained the report by U.S. Public Interest Research Group and 
the Environmental Working Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But utility spokesmen said that on a per-kilowatt-hour basis,  
smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions have declined and that 
competition probably had little impact on the numbers cited by the 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``You certainly can't say all that growth (in generation) is  
related to competition,'' said John Kinsman of the Edison Electric 
Institute, which represents investor-owned electric utilities. He 
said electricity generation from all plants has been going up 1.5 
percent to 2.5 percent a year because of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists long have been concerned that the new emphasis  
on price competition will give a cost advantage to utilities that 
rely heavily on cheaper, more polluting, coal-burning power plants, 
especially those in the Ohio Valley and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists' report said annual nitrogen oxide  
emission from 446 coal-burning power plants increased by 755,000 
tons between 1992 and 1998 because of increases in electricity 
generation from those plants. 
</P>
<P>
	That increase was equivalent to the nitrogen oxide pollution  
from 37 million cars, said Rebecca Stanfield of U.S.PIRG, one of 
the authors of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coequyt of EWG said, ``Switching from coal to cleaner fuels  
such as natural gas is the way to solve our smog and global warming 
problems. Instead the utilities are taking us in the opposite 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinsman, the utility industry spokesman, said the report  
``totally ignores all the emission reductions we're required to 
undertake starting in 2000'' as part of federal acid rain 
regulations and beginning in 2003 as part of additional federal 
controls on nitrogen oxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Eller, a spokesman for Southern Co., a utility that relies  
heavily on coal-burning power plants, said that while coal use has 
increased, emissions from coal-burning plants on a 
kilowatt-hour-basis have declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do a lot with numbers,'' said Eller.

<HEADLINE> Reagan's Health Still Declining </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Ronald Reagan's health continues to  
decline gradually, the nation should be reassured that the former 
president is comfortable and well-cared for, his doctor says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is gradually declining with respect to various  
functions,'' Dr. Ronald Petersen said on CNN's ``Larry King Live''

	Petersen, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said  
he visited with the Reagan family in Los Angeles in March and 
praised the care Nancy Reagan was providing for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is really comfortable and doing well in his environment,''  
Petersen said. ``The president is doing as well as he can given the 
situation of this particular disease.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Concert Ticket Prices Skyrocketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cathy Berkman paid $125 apiece for two tickets  
to Bob Dylan and Paul Simon's upcoming show at Madison Square 
Garden, a far cry from the cheap old days of concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City epidemiologist and her husband have ticket  
stubs from a Dylan concert with the Band in 1974 for $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do wish it were more affordable,'' she said Tuesday. ``If I  
were a college student now, I wouldn't be seeing Dylan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average concert ticket costs $38.56, up $5 in one year and  
$13 since 1996, according to a survey by the industry trade 
publication Pollstar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rolling Stones charged an average of $109.62 per seat at the  
34 shows the band performed in the United States this year. Opera 
star Luciano Pavarotti charged a $130.77 average at four shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The artists have really dropped the pretext that they are not  
doing it for the money,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, Pollstar editor. 
</P>
<P>
	For the hottest shows, fans don't seem to mind. Two concerts at  
Madison Square Garden by Latin sensation Ricky Martin -- with 
tickets priced between $38 and $78 -- sold out in 20 minutes on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to fans is usually several dollars higher than  
the ticket price, since many venues and ticket agencies add 
surcharges that weren't figured in Pollstar's average. 
</P>
<P>
	Concert tickets were undervalued for many years, judging by the  
stiff premiums that shady brokers were able to get for premium 
seats. Promoters saw how much people were willing to pay brokers, 
so they decided to charge more themselves, Bongiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ego and greed quickly became involved. When some musicians  
tested the waters with high prices, their competitors figured they 
deserved as much or more and raised their prices accordingly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixties-era rock fans now have more money and are willing to  
spend it on their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, if you were a rock 'n' roll star you had  
certain countercultural connections. You couldn't maintain that and 
charge a high level ticket price,'' Bongiovanni said. ``That's gone 
by the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three old favorites -- Neil Young, Elton John and Rod Stewart --  
were in Pollstar's top 10 list of most expensive tickets this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheapest average tickets among the 50 most lucrative tours  
this year were sold by the heavy metal double bill of Poison and 
Ratt, at $18.09. The Offspring charged an average of $18.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran concertgoer Berkman said that along with the high  
prices, concert venues do little to ensure that fans are 
comfortable, secure and enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like fans have an infinite tolerance to put up with  
this kind of abuse,'' she said. ``I wish there would be a 
boycott.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Hits 20-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures fell to fresh 20-year lows Wednesday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange after British officials appeared to reject 
suggestions they change their gold sale plans. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, copper futures rose sharply, while corn and  
soybeans moved high on the threat of hot, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures continued their slide after British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair defended his country's recent sale of 25 tons of its 
gold reserves. His comments suggested his government will continue 
to dispose of what will eventually be more than half its reserves 
despite widespread criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures have been in general decline for more than a year  
as the metal loses its traditional role as an investment hedge 
against economic or political turmoil, leaving it in demand mostly 
for making jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide steepened earlier this year after Britain announced it  
would join Australia, Canada, Belgium and other countries in 
selling reserves in favor of better-returning investments such as 
U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called Britain's gold sale plan especially flawed  
since the government essentially has told speculators when each 
auction would occur, allowing for price manipulation. Britain 
denied that occurred last week with its first sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposals by Switzerland and the International Monetary Fund to  
sell gold also have kept prices on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for August delivery fell $1.70 to $255 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  
moving higher for the first time in days, on market talk that 
producers are considering additional cutbacks to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures in recent weeks had experienced a price rebound  
as key producers moved to curtail the operations in the face of a 
global supply glut. But prices fell sharply on Tuesday after 
warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange reported a large 
increase, which led to ideas the glut would not ease quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices rebounded Wednesday on talk that Asarco Inc. or  
Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. would be the latest to voluntarily cut 
back mine production. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco declined comment, while Cyprus Amax denied the  
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	September high-grade copper rose 1.5 cents to 77.70 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade  
as hot, dry weather moved into Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were concerned about pockets of dryness across major  
growing areas, particularly in central Illinois, one of the 
nation's largest corn and soybean growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the region were expected to rise into the  
90s over the next few days, which could further drain moisture from 
the soil and lead to heat stress. That, in turn, could lead to 
reduced yields. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.60 1/2 a bushel; December corn  
rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.01 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 cent to 
$1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to $4.21 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart To Pay $6.4M to Hilfiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says it has hired  
an independent inspector to watch for counterfeit clothing after 
agreeing to a $6.4 million settlement with apparel-maker Tommy 
Hilfiger. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement Wednesday ends a five-year legal battle in which  
Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A Inc. had repeatedly accused the world's 
largest retailer of selling fake Hilfiger clothes under the guise 
of the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, Wal-Mart also agreed to donate its  
remaining counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger clothes to a charity selected 
by the clothing manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Hilfiger said the merchandise would be distributed in  
Third World countries and elsewhere, such as the Yugoslavian 
province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's new independent inspector will examine clothing for  
authenticity, the company said in a brief statement. The retailer 
said it also will require merchandise invoices to be tracked from 
the manufacturers to the sales floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart had said it purchased the Tommy Hilfiger merchandise  
from third-party distributors and believed it was authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart has no interest in carrying non-authentic products,''  
the Bentonville-based retailer said in a statement. ``Recently, we 
have made improvements in how local purchases are made, including 
additional training for our buyers and field operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Wal-Mart agreed to a permanent injunction against  
knowingly or intentionally infringing on Tommy Hilfiger's 
trademarks. But last fall, a federal judge held Wal-Mart in 
contempt of court for continuing to sell counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Hilfiger claimed Wal-Mart -- which had fiscal 1999 sales of  
$138 billion -- was selling fake Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts and socks 
over the Internet and selling counterfeit ladies T-shirts at Sam's 
Wholesale Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Horowitz, Hilfiger's chief executive officer, said the  
settlement should make the public aware that fake products are sold 
even beyond city sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people don't realize that counterfeiting exists not just  
at the level of the street vendor, but also in large retail 
chains,'' he said. ``We will continue to pursue, and are pursuing 
right now, other retailers who buy in the secondary market and look 
the other way while counterfeit goods are shipped into their 
stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not identify those retailers.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans continued to rack up  
victories on patients' rights legislation today, rejecting a 
Democratic proposal to extend protections to three times the number 
of people the GOP plan would cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 52-48 against the plan by Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the proposal would increase health care costs  
significantly and clash with regulatory efforts by the states, many 
of which have their own consumer health care protections in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our colleagues have decided that taxes are too low and that we  
don't have enough federal regulations,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Senate approved a GOP provision limiting many  
of the new rights it has proposed to the 48 million Americans now 
exempt from state regulations. Democrats wanted to cover some 161 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing more clearly demonstrates that the Republican bill is  
an industry protection act, not a patient protection act,'' Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans scored an earlier victory today, voting  
55-45, along party lines, to require health insurers to pay for 
doctor-prescribed hospital stays after mastectomies, a plan offered 
by Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, they defeated a similar, but broader amendment,  
backed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe said her plan would ensure that ``appropriate medical  
care'' dictates how long a woman remains hospitalized after breast 
surgery and ``not an insurer's bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats criticized Snowe's amendment because it was narrower  
than theirs and replaced another proposal being pushed by Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. It would have guaranteed insurance 
coverage of routine health care for dying people getting treatment 
through clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans balked, and charged that Dodd's plan would increase  
costs. They promised to come up with their own amendment on 
clinical trials later, though the details were not available. The 
GOP bill now only calls for a study of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put this new mandate on ... somebody's got to pay for  
it,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the chamber's only physician. 
``The federal government's not going to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to expand patients' rights against health  
maintenance organizations more than Republicans, who say the 
Democrats' approach would make insurance too expensive for many 
more Americans. The GOP is pushing a bill that would make more 
modest changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Final passage of the bill is possible Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	In a series of narrow votes mostly along party lines, the Senate  
on Tuesday defeated a Democratic plan that would have made insurers 
pay for what doctors say are medically necessary treatments. 
Democrats also lost on amendments to expand women's health and 
emergency room care. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, senators approved, 53-47, a GOP provision that  
would restrict many of the new rights to the 48 million Americans 
currently exempt from state regulation. This includes protections 
involving emergency room care, access to obstetrician-gynecologists 
and the right to keep a doctor during a course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to cover an additional 113 million people who  
already are under state regulations. Republicans say Washington 
shouldn't interfere with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the defeats, Democrats believe they have the upper hand  
in the debate, which is as much about year 2000 politics as it is 
about health policy. Neither side has been willing to budge, and 
President Clinton likely will veto the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigning Vice President Al Gore told Iowans today that  
the administration would not roll over if the GOP prevails. ``We 
won't be done with it. We're going to keep fighting for the bill of 
rights -- the real bill of rights -- until it becomes law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the measures yet to be considered is one that would allow  
patients to sue their health maintenance organizations and collect 
damages when care has been denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would ensure, under certain conditions, that  
patients have access to ``cutting edge'' clinical trials and 
``medically necessary prescription drugs,'' said Dodd, the author. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said growing numbers of health plans are now refusing to  
pay the routine costs associated with an individual's participation 
in clinical health studies, and that his amendment would require 
coverage under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ought not to be a controversial proposal,'' Dodd said,  
adding that insurance companies would be required only to pay 
routine health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' effort to make HMOs pay for many treatments they do  
not now cover -- one of the most contentious issues -- failed on a 
52-48 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan would have made health insurance companies  
pay for care consistent with ``generally accepted principles of 
medical practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that the most common practices aren't  
always the best, and replaced the Democratic medical necessity 
provision with their own system allowing patients to appeal if care 
is denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Won adoption of a measure allowing self-employed people to  
deduct the full cost of their health insurance from their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defeated, 52-48, a Democratic measure that would let women  
designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care 
doctor. It also would have required that they be covered for 
hospitalization overnight after a mastectomy if a doctor 
recommended it. Republicans said they would soon offer a modified 
version of the same idea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adopted, 52-48, an amendment highlighting the cost of the  
Democratic bill. Under the amendment, the bill's provisions would 
be canceled if they increased costs by more than 1 percent. 
Congressional auditors estimate the Democratic provisions would 
raise insurance premiums 4.8 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Having started the debate about  
whether players should be paid for taking part in the Ryder Cup, 
Mark O'Meara is getting a little touchy on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara and Tiger Woods both have come out in favor of payment  
while Tom Watson and Colin Montgomerie are firmly against. 
</P>
<P>
	When the subject was raised again on the eve of the British Open  
on Wednesday, O'Meara, a veteran of four Ryder Cups, didn't appear 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``My views have changed a little bit from the standpoint that  
the majority of players don't want to speak about it because 
they're going to maybe get crucified in the press,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the PGA of America and the European PGA Tour feel  
like the money is going back to further the game of golf or is 
going back to good charities, I have no problem not being paid. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NORMAN WARNING:* Facing a course he described as a ``brute'',  
two-time British Open champion Greg Norman warns that a winning 
score of something like 20 over par wouldn't be a great ad for 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The par-71 Carnoustie course, in use for an Open for the first  
time in 24 years, had been made tougher by long, thick rough and 
very narrow fairways. The expected strong winds could put many 
scores in the 80s or even 90s and the winner could collect the 
trophy with a score of 300 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope it doesn't backfire,'' Norman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pinehurst to me was the best U.S. Open I had ever played in,  
the way they set the golf course up. They did it to exactly how it 
was meant to be designed and look what happened -- an even par won 
it. It was a perfect job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're over here at the British Open, you get a lot more  
adverse weather conditions. But set the course up the way it is 
supposed to be. If the weather eases up they might get away with 
it,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BONNIE SCOTLAND:* Zane Scotland has been turning heads at  
Carnoustie by qualifying for the British Open at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't appear especially nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go and play a bit of golf and have a bit of  
fun,'' he said on the eve of the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's daunting at all. I just go out to play golf  
like I always do.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LATEST ODDS:* Tiger Woods remains the 5-1 favorite to win the  
British Open with David Duval second at 10-1 and home favorite 
Colin Montgomerie third at 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sergio Garcia is coming on. Bookmakers Ladbrokes have moved  
19-year-old Spanish sensation who won his first tournament 10 days 
ago in only his sixth event as a pro, up to 18-1 followed by Ernie 
Els, Vijay Singh, Lee Westwood, at 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Scotland, who turns 17 on Saturday, is rated among the  
500-1 outsiders while three-time champion Nick Faldo is 100-1, the 
longest odds he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLASSON WITHDRAWS:* Bill Glasson on Wednesday became the ninth  
American to withdraw from the British Open field, citing an elbow 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old, who has had 13 operations since he joined the  
tour in 1984, didn't travel to Scotland and said he is taking a 
five-week break from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be replaced in the 156-man field by England's Scott  
Watson, who won a five-man playoff to be first reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasson joins Jack Nicklaus, John Daly, Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw,  
Fred Couples, Steve Jones, Brad Faxon and Scott Hoch as Americans 
to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAKER-FINCH RETURNS:* British Open champion in 1991, Ian  
Baker-Finch went out to play the Carnoustie course more in fun than 
anything. Even at age 38, the Australian no longer competes and is 
here doing television work with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker-Finch gave up the game 18 months ago because he was no  
longer competitive. At the Open at Troon two years ago he returned 
a 92 in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker-Finch, who plans to enter the millennium British Open at  
St. Andrews on a one-off basis, had to get special permission from 
Royal and Ancient Club secretary Michael Bonallack to play a round 
at Carnoustie because he hadn't entered the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically Sir Michael allowed me to play the course as I am  
working as an announcer for ABC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am doing a little bit of homework but it is a little bit of  
therapy as well.''

<HEADLINE> EU Panel OKs British Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's executive  
Commission cleared the way today for resumption of British beef 
imports on Aug. 1, ending a three-year ban imposed after an 
outbreak of mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifting the trade blockade means most British beef can be  
exported again, and will trigger a major marketing campaign 
designed to regain lost sales estimated to have cost the industry 
$2.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission voted to clear British beef for export  
following final approval from EU veterinary experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has changed is very clear. First of all, we have got  
positive advice from our scientists,'' the EU's Agriculture 
Commissioner Franz Fischler said on the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secondly, we did a lot of inspections in the United Kingdom  
and the results are now all positive, so it is justified now to 
lift the ban. If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would 
not vote in favor to lift the ban,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain welcomed the EU decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important step to bringing British beef back to  
markets across the world,'' a spokeswoman for the British Ministry 
of Agriculture said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Gill, the president of the National Farmers' Union said  
``obviously we are enormously pleased at today's announcement as it 
means we can start work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But things will not happen overnight. This decision is long  
overdue but it is much needed when the industry is in the depths of 
depression. We must now work to restore confidence in British 
beef,'' Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	British beef will still be subject to strict precautions.  
</P>
<P>
	All meat for export must be de-boned and come from cattle born  
after Aug. 1, 1996, when a ban came into force on the feeding to 
animals of meat and bone-meal. Meat from cattle more than 30 months 
old will not be sold overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Irish beef exports were allowed to resume last year  
because the province has a sophisticated computerized cattle 
monitoring and checking system. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was imposed in March 1996 following an outbreak in  
Britain of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 
and after medical researchers cited evidence of a link between the 
disease and the fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jacob 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal is the only other European country still forbidden to  
export beef, a ban that was extended by the EC last week until 
August 2000. Portugal has complained that the ban is 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission runs the day-to-day affairs of the  
15-nation union, proposes EU law and enforces its implementation 
across Europe.

<HEADLINE> Plane Makes Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An American Airlines jet made an emergency landing  
at a naval station in the Florida Keys after the pilot said he 
smelled smoke aboard the Miami-to-Cancun flight with 162 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured, but passengers said flight attendants paced  
throughout the plane with fire extinguishers. Children wept and 
older passengers prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 2191 landed at about 2:45 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Key  
West Naval Air Station at Boca Chica Key, airline spokeswoman 
Martha Pantin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot and crew only smelled smoke and did not see it, Pantin  
said. Several passengers, who said the trouble began just as the 
crew started to serve food, saw a slight fog in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the worst anguish -- when they say we are going to  
land and you look out the window and you see the ocean,'' said Mayi 
Antillon, 38, of San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantin said another Boeing 757 was sent to the island to take  
the passengers to Cancun. The evacuated jet was to be taken to 
Miami International Airport to be inspected by airline maintenance 
workers.

<HEADLINE> Slower Growth Seen for Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health care spending is projected to grow more  
slowly in the next decade than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised projection is due largely to decreased Medicare  
spending last year and slower growth projections for both private 
and Medicare spending in the latter part of the next decade, 
according to a study released Tuesday by the Health Care Financing 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the downward revision, national health spending still is  
expected to double by 2008 to $2.2 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The new projections show the rate of annual growth slows to an  
average of 6.5 percent for the 1997-2007 decade. Last year's 
calculations had projected a 7 percent yearly average growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare spending is projected to grow just 4.5 percent a year  
over the 1997-2000 period, compared to 5.1 percent foreseen in last 
year's figures, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that national health spending growth will  
accelerate through 2000, due mostly to an acceleration in the 
private-sector. That reverses the current trend of higher public 
spending, and the reversal is expected to be more significant than 
anticipated last year.

<HEADLINE> IBM Pension Plan Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A controversial change in IBM's pension  
plan, which many employees complain robs older workers of benefits 
on which they had relied, is getting congressional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven members of Congress suggest that the company's pension  
changes amount to age discrimination and they asked the Internal 
Revenue Service this week to look into it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they are seeking review of all ``cash balance plans,''  
the congressmen were prompted by the changes at IBM, which took 
effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the serious and unresolved age discrimination questions  
that exist, the (Internal Revenue) Service should not bless these 
arrangements,'' Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., wrote in a letter 
signed by 10 others. ``To do so not only jeopardizes public law and 
policy, but also provides a taxpayer subsidy for possibly illegal 
conversions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fixed benefit plan, which IBM scrapped, provides a fixed  
monthly income based on how long a person works for a company. That 
is of greatest benefit to workers who have spent most of their 
career with the same company. They accrue their greatest benefits 
as they near retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cash balance plan, employers contribute a set percentage of  
employees' pay annually to individual accounts. The accounts grow 
as a worker stays with a company, but the employee can take the 
money when leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it opted for the new plan because so many workers in  
its industry now switch jobs so frequently. The cash balance plan 
is more attractive to such employees because they don't lose any 
benefits if they change jobs and they don't have to wait until the 
end of their careers for most of them to accrue, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new plan is designed to be more competitive in order to  
allow IBM to attract and keep a larger pool of talented people,'' 
spokesman Phillip Bergman said in a statement. ``This was necessary 
because of the changing demographics of the company and realities 
of the employment market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and others complain, however, that a cash  
balance plan actually hurts older workers because it provides them 
with less in benefits than the old defined benefit plan did. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM tried to accommodate those workers by allowing those closest  
to retirement to stay in the old plan and giving other experienced 
employees enhancements in the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressmen agree with the consumer groups and argue that it  
is the IRS's job to investigate. Until it does, the congressmen 
want the IRS to stop approving the tax benefits of cash balance 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``On its face, it seems to me that there is a real question  
about the legality of IBM's actions,'' Sanders sad. ``Older workers 
who have loyally served IBM for 20 or 25 years are clearly being 
discriminated against.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Votes To End School Busing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A generation after Boston erupted in violence over  
court-ordered busing to desegregate public schools, the school 
board voted Wednesday to end busing in a city where the vast 
majority of pupils are now minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying all of this is a dose of good old common sense that  
says `Let's move on. It's not the '70s. It's not the '80s. It's the 
end of the '90s,''' said Superintendent Thomas Payzant, flanked at 
an earlier news conference by three dozen parents, politicians and 
community leaders -- black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston school board voted 5-2 to end busing in a city where  
much has changed since the 1974 federal court order that forced the 
city to bus white students into black neighborhoods and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	The order sparked huge protests, staining the city's reputation  
as white parents hurled rocks and epithets at buses that brought 
black children into their neighborhoods, then refused to let their 
own attend black schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with whites having pulled out of the city in past years  
and a burgeoning immigrant population having moved in, the school 
system has become 85 percent minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a group of white parents filed a lawsuit alleging  
that the busing policy discriminates against their children by 
denying them access to their chosen schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal put forth by Payzant, Boston parents would  
still get to choose where they want to send their children to 
school. Race, however, will not be a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The school department would evaluate other criteria when  
deciding which students attend which schools: the proximity of the 
child's home to the school; whether he or she has any siblings 
there; and the results of a yearly school choice lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents and community leaders expressed anger at  
Wednesday's meeting because they believed the committee was giving 
up in the face of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are giving up only because we have a threat of losing a  
lawsuit, then shame on us,'' Rep. Gloria Fox, D-Boston said at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said racial issues have  
distracted the city from what should be its main goal: improving 
teaching and student learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy would take effect in the fall of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Busing in the transportation sense would still exist. There  
aren't enough neighborhood schools to allow every one of the city's 
63,000 students to walk, and some parents would opt to send their 
children to schools across town. 
</P>
<P>
	Menino has promised to build six new neighborhood schools in the  
most impoverished areas of the city that need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the proposed change would not significantly  
change the racial breakdown of the schools because the city's 
school population is now about 85 percent minority -- 49 percent 
black, 26 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few of the city's 129 schools would end up with a mostly  
white student body, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago, about 48 percent of the city's school  
children were minority. Back then, schools were either entirely 
white or black. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, who represents some of the city's  
predominantly black areas, said Boston still has much work to do in 
ensuring that all its schools are of equal caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said, the mere fact that blacks and whites were  
together endorsing the new proposal shows how much the city has 
changed over 25 years.

	``Underlying all of this is a dose of good old common sense that  
says `Let's move on. It's not the '70s. It's not the '80s. It's the 
end of the '90s,''' said Superintendent Thomas Payzant, flanked at 
a news conference by three dozen parents, politicians and community 
leaders -- black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	Much has changed since the 1974 federal court order that forced  
the city to bus white students into black neighborhoods and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	The order sparked huge protests, staining the city's reputation  
as white parents hurled rocks and epithets at buses that brought 
black children into their neighborhoods, then refused to let their 
own attend black schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with whites having pulled out of the city in past years  
and a burgeoning immigrant population having moved in, the school 
system has become 85 percent minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a group of white parents filed a lawsuit alleging  
that the busing policy discriminates against their children by 
denying them access to their chosen schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal put forth by Payzant, Boston parents would  
still get to choose where they want to send their children to 
school. Race, however, will not be a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The school department would evaluate other criteria when  
deciding which students attend which schools: the proximity of the 
child's home to the school; whether he or she has any siblings 
there; and the results of a yearly school choice lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said racial issues have distracted  
the city from what should be its main goal: improving teaching and 
student learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy would take effect in the fall of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Busing in the transportation sense would still exist. There  
aren't enough neighborhood schools to allow every one of the city's 
63,000 students to walk, and some parents would opt to send their 
children to schools across town. 
</P>
<P>
	Menino has promised to build six new neighborhood schools in the  
most impoverished areas of the city that need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the proposed change would not significantly  
change the racial breakdown of the schools because the city's 
school population is now about 85 percent minority -- 49 percent 
black, 26 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few of the city's 129 schools would end up with a mostly  
white student body, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago, about 48 percent of the city's school  
children were minority. Back then, schools were either entirely 
white or black. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, who represents some of the city's  
predominantly black areas, said Boston still has much work to do in 
ensuring that all its schools are of equal caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said, the mere fact that blacks and whites were  
together endorsing the new proposal shows how much the city has 
changed over 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Bonanno Attends TV Taping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Retired New York mob boss Joseph Bonanno  
attended a private showing of a TV series based on his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come here for the good people who come here to honor me,''  
the 94-year-old Bonanno said Monday night at a theater where 
several hundred friends and family members had gathered for an 
advance screening of ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a Showtime 
miniseries that will air July 25 and 26. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first publicized appearance in four years for the man  
who ruled one of New York's five Mafia families until he 
relinquished power in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 37 years in the top ranks of organized crime, Bonanno was  
never convicted of anything more serious than obstructing justice. 
That was in 1980 for obstructing a grand jury investigation of his 
sons, Bill and Joseph Jr. The elder Bonanno served less than 18 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, after his autobiography helped propel a federal  
investigation, a judge imprisoned Bonanno for nearly 14 months on a 
civil contempt charge for refusing to testify about the secret, 
national commission he helped create to resolve disputes between 
crime families.

<HEADLINE> Carnival Admits Sex Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carnival Cruise Lines has disclosed that its  
crew members were accused of sexual assault 62 times in a five-year 
span ending last summer -- or just about once per month, The New 
York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The number, included in court papers filed Tuesday in Miami, is  
the first such public disclosure by a cruise line, the newspaper 
said. Such ships are often registered abroad and safety figures 
aren't reported to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival, the world's largest cruise company, said it had  
investigated the 62 incidents, ending last August, but did not 
release details. The alleged attacks involved passengers and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the cruise line, a subsidiary of Carnival  
Corporation in Miami, said the accusations were taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any allegation would be taken seriously, but do these  
statistics suggest that Carnival ships are unsafe? Absolutely 
not,'' said Curtis Mase, the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Carnival responded to accusations that it covered  
up assault claims by saying it is ``at least 10 times more likely 
for a sexual assault to occur in a small town in America than on a 
cruise ship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accused crew members are sometimes put ashore at the next port  
with air fare to get home, the Times reported, and industry lawyers 
are flown to the ship to question accusers. The cruise lines 
aggressively contest lawsuits and insist on secrecy as a condition 
of settling. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also jurisdictional disputes and questions.  
</P>
<P>
	The papers are part of a lawsuit against the company by a former  
employee who said she was attacked by an officer aboard a Carnival 
ship last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The man has been indicted on aggravated sexual assault charges,  
the Times said, but he remains in Italy.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level unexpectedly  
declined last month while consumers' spending slowed dramatically. 
With more news like this, the Federal Reserve may be content to 
remain on the sidelines and not push interest rates higher this 
year,economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.1 percent decline in the Producer Price Index -- which  
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer -- was 
the first decline in four months and reflected a dip in energy 
prices, the Labor Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the tiny 0.1 percent June increase in retail sales, which  
accounts for one-third of total economic activity, followed a hefty 
1.2 percent gain in sales in May, the Commerce Department said in a 
separate report. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1 percent drop in sales of cars and trucks, the biggest  
decline in this area since March, was the main factor slowing 
overall retail sales in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of inflationary pressures at the wholesale level  
combined with the sharp slowing in consumer demand should ease 
concerns at the Federal Reserve that a runaway economy will push 
inflation higher, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By themselves the reports can be viewed as putting less  
pressure on the Fed to tighten further,'' said Mark Zandi, an 
economist with Regional Financial Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	But there will be additional economic data between now and the  
next Fed meeting on August 24 that could influence the central 
bank's decision making, including Thursday's closely watched report 
on the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation at the 
consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan has already  
done his work and pending tomorrow's CPI report might decide to 
take the rest of the summer off,'' said Oscar Gonzalez, an 
economist with John Hancock. Inflation at the wholesale level 
``remains as quiet as a sleepy child in a hammock on a lazy summer 
day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the other economic reports show a similar performance, ``the  
Fed can remain on hold'' at its August meeting, said Gerald Cohen, 
a Merrill Lynch economist, who called both government reports 
``market friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials went on alert two months ago when prices at both  
the wholesale level and the retail level posted huge increases 
reflecting big hikes in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve increased a key interest rate for the first  
time in two years on June 30, but at the time the Fed indicated 
that the quarter-point raise might be all that was needed to slow 
the economy enough to keep inflation contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, energy prices dipped 0.3 percent, reflecting a 1.9  
percent fall in gasoline prices. Energy prices retreated in May and 
June after a whopping 5.1 percent increase in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in auto sales dampened total retail sales, which rose  
to a seasonally adjusted $243.3 billion in June -- an increase of 
just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Taylor, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers  
Association, said the sales drop reflects a shift in consumer 
buying to cars with lower sticker prices and away from 
higher-priced sports utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	It also reflects big decreases in car prices stemming from  
foreign competition and efforts by dealers to clear showrooms for 
new models, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the so-called core rate of inflation at the wholesale  
level -- excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- fell 0.2 
percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in the core rate of inflation reflected a big, 1.3  
percent fall in the price of passenger cars, the biggest reversal 
since January's 1.4 percent dip, and a 0.7 percent decline in the 
category that includes sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs were up 0.4 in June led by a 8.2 percent increase in  
beef prices -- the biggest one-month jump since an 8.8 percent 
increase in October 1985. The big beef increase, however, was 
partially offset by a 5.2 percent drop in pork prices, the biggest 
decline in 11 months. Vegetable prices were up, while fruit prices 
went down.

<HEADLINE>  Hard-Liners Stage Rally in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Hard-line Iranian clerics  
mobilized tens of thousands of supporters at a rally today to 
counter six days of pro-democracy demonstrations and unrest on a 
scale unseen in Iran in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Iranian cleric said at the rally in Tehran that  
pro-reform protesters who damaged public property during the 
previous demonstrations would be tried as enemies of the state, a 
charge punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader who is  
allied with the hard-liners, has sought to deflect blame for the 
days of protests by accusing the United States and the ``mean and 
wretched enemies of Islam'' of fomenting trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's state-run television, monitored in Dubai, broadcast live  
pictures of today's rally in the Iranian capital and said about one 
million people took part. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure could not be independently confirmed, but pictures  
showed the area overflowing with people, including women in black 
Islamic robes, chanting slogans and waving Iran's flags. Their 
number appeared to be in the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said few in the crowd carried pictures of reformist  
President Mohammad Khatami. Authorities warned Tuesday that no 
other rallies would be allowed today other than the demonstration 
called by the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Iranian television said many people gathered inside the  
sprawling grounds of Tehran University to show solidarity with 
Khamenei and hear speeches by clerics. Thousands more, unable to 
squeeze in, stood in the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to America, death to hypocrites'' the demonstrators  
chanted. ``Our blood is our gift to our leader,'' others shouted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan Rowhani, the deputy chief of Iran's Supreme National  
Security Council, said ``those who destroyed public property and 
went on the rampage and committed aggression against the Islamic 
system will be tried in our courts as mohareb and mofsed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mohareb and mofsed are terms used to identify die-hard opponents  
of the republic. The punishment for anyone found to be mofsed, 
Farsi for corrupt on earth, is death. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally sent a signal that hard-liners are in no mood to give  
in to Khatami, a moderate clergyman and a hero of the student-led 
protesters demanding more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people held aloft pictures of Khamenei, but none of Khatami  
were seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-reform demonstrations, which have left two people dead  
and scores injured or arrested, mark the first time Iranians have 
taken to the streets en masse since the 1979 Islamic Revolution 
that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah and installed the clergy's 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest began when police without authorization stormed a  
Tehran University dormitory on Friday hours after students rallied 
against the banning of a liberal newspaper. One person was killed 
and 20 were injured; hard-line clerics apparently backed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The government fired two security chiefs and reprimanded a third  
but the punishments failed to appease protesters who have gathered 
every day in Tehran and at least seven other cities to vent anger. 
</P>
<P>
	One demand often heard at the protests has been that Khamenei,  
who has come to represent 20 years of strict and frustrating 
Islamic rule, step down and Khatami be allowed to carry on with his 
social and democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	One protest numbered an estimated 25,000; most have been about  
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the protesters rampaged after police dispersed them  
with tear gas. They burned empty buses, smashed shop windows and 
tried to burn down the offices of the hard-line Kayhan newspaper 
before they were stopped by police, witnesses said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Khamenei said ``a group of vicious people,  
supported by certain bankrupt political groups and encouraged by 
foreign enemies, have been engaged in ... destruction of people's 
properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``the mean and wretched enemies of Islam and the  
revolution'' think that Iranians would let them allow the 
``criminal United States'' to dominate Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	But security forces have been ``emphatically instructed to put  
down the corrupt and warring elements,'' he said in the statement 
released today by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, 
monitored in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami also has urged an end to the unrest, fearing that the  
protests will spin out of control and further set back his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami's May 1997 election held the promise of more freedom for  
Iranians, but he has faced an uphill battle in trying to overcome 
the hard-liners who control the armed forces, police, judiciary, 
Intelligence Ministry and broadcast network.

<HEADLINE> GOP Adds Drug Deduction to Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A tax deduction for the insurance that some  
Medicare recipients buy to cover prescription costs was added 
Wednesday to an $864 billion tax relief bill by House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	After fighting off Democratic attempts to add broader Medicare  
and Social Security measures, the House Ways and Means Committee 
then cleared the bill on a 23-13 vote Wednesday night for action by 
the full House, possibly as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would cut income taxes 10 percent across the board,  
reduce capital gains taxes, eventually abolish estate and 
alternative minimum taxes and give people new breaks for education 
and long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The House panel's 11 hours of debate was the latest skirmish  
over how to divide $2.9 trillion in projected budget surpluses 
between tax cuts, safeguarding the two big retirement programs and 
new government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can give tax relief. We can save Social Security. We can  
save Medicare,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the House 
committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	But its top Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, said the  
bill ``disproportionately benefits the most affluent Americans'' 
and is intended mainly as fodder for the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of fiscal responsibility, Republicans chose to make  
political points,'' he charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed tax deduction for insurance costs paid by some  
senior citizens to cover prescription drugs was the GOP's first 
official reaction to President Clinton's popular proposal to add a 
drug benefit to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican plan is contingent upon a passage later this  
year of an overall reform of Medicare -- including a direct drug 
subsidy for the poor -- which faces future insolvency as baby 
boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to miss this opportunity,'' said Rep. Bill  
Thomas, R-Calif. ``We've put this provision into the tax bill 
contingent upon other action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the measure was simply political cover for  
Republicans who fear being outflanked on Medicare as they push 
their huge tax cut, a bill Democrats say is a waste of time because 
Clinton has already pledged to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	They attempted to shave roughly $270 billion off the tax cut for  
a more direct Medicare prescription drug benefit, but that was 
defeated on a party-line 23-11 vote as important for its political 
symbolism as anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we give tax breaks to the richest 10 percent of  
Americans, we should be willing ... to give senior citizens help 
with some of these bills,'' said Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore on Wednesday, Clinton said the House GOP tax bill  
``could wreck our economy'' and would consume almost all of the 
non-Social Security surplus over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would require, as our economy grows, real cuts in  
education, defense, the environment, research, technology -- the 
kinds of things we have invested more in,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans insisted that the surplus was big enough to  
accommodate a large tax cut while fixing Social Security and 
Medicare and was the best way to prevent a new era of rampant 
federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
	On another symbolic party-line vote, Ways and Means Republicans  
turned back a Democratic effort to delay the entire tax cut until a 
long-term solution to Social Security is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the American people can see through this and it all  
boils down to one thing: who do you trust?'' said Rep. J. D. 
Hayworth, R-Ariz.

	Moderate Republicans on the committee were able to divert some  
money intended to cut capital gains taxes for corporations into two 
programs supported by Democrats. Both moves were opposed by Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., won approval of an amendment that  
would gradually raise the per capita cap on low income housing tax 
credits from $1.25 to $1.75 at a cost of $3.8 billion over 10 
years. A similar provision is expected in a Senate GOP tax measure.

	-- Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., amended the bill to extend  
welfare-to-work tax credits for six months longer than the measure 
originally intended, at a cost of $277 million over 10 years.

<P>
	In addition, the panel approved an amendment by Reps. Wes  
Watkins, R-Okla., and William Jefferson, D-La., for $389 million in 
tax breaks to benefit independent domestic oil producers suffering 
from economic distress.

<HEADLINE> Tension Increases Over Mexico Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Political tension appears to be intensifying  
in Mexico's Congress over a controversial bank bailout and results 
of an independent audit of bad loans transferred from banks to the 
government over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition legislators released a variety of documents this week  
linking campaign funding for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, to illegal bank operations. There also have been 
leaks of the audit's initial findings, claiming that up to $8 
billion of the loans transferred to the government are of illegal 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry has cited banking secrecy laws  
for its refusal to give auditors access to information on a series 
of loans made by Banco Union, a bankrupt bank taken over by the 
government in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies from the opposition National Action Party, or PAN,  
argue that the audit of Banco Union could clarify a series of 
illegal operations made by its former owner, Carlos Cabal Peniche, 
to fund PRI political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabal Peniche, who purchased Banco Union from the government in  
the early 1990s, is facing an extradition trial in Australia over 
an alleged $700 million fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, PAN legislators gave the auditors documents from a  
government probe into a PRI trust managed by Banco Union to fund 
the 1994 gubernatorial campaign of Roberto Madrazo in southern 
Tabasco state. Legislators said Banco Union also was involved in 
funding the campaign of President Ernesto Zedillo in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent auditors were hired by Mexico's Congress  
following 1998 legislation to consolidate about $65 billion in bad 
bank assets as public domestic debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Fauzi Hamdam, a PAN congressman who designed the bank rescue  
legislation, said Congress will present a formal complaint to 
Zedillo on the Finance Ministry's denial to open Banco Union's 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Zedillo supports the ministry's attempts to block access to  
the Banco Union files, then we will request the Supreme Court issue 
a constitutional ruling on the subject,'' Hamdam said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the congressional agreement, only loans of legal origin  
are to be assumed by the government's new bank deposit insurance 
agency, known as IPAB. Official results of the audit will be 
submitted to Congress on July 19. Public release of the probe is 
expected to take place July 23.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Wants Khmer Rogue Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Despite delays in sending U.N. legal  
experts to help set up a genocide tribunal for Khmer Rouge leaders, 
the top U.N. envoy to Cambodia insisted Wednesday that the world 
body still supports such a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurances follow missed deadlines for U.N. experts to help  
establish a controversial tribunal where Khmer Rouge leaders would 
be tried in Cambodia's chaotic, often corrupt courts, aided by 
foreign prosecutors and judges to ensure that international 
standards of justice are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy to  
Cambodia, said in a letter Wednesday in The Cambodia Daily that the 
legal mission would arrive by early August. They were originally 
supposed to arrive in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammarberg said the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs is still  
analyzing the implications of the so-called mixed trial, which is a 
compromise after Prime Minister Hun Sen refused to allow the 
creation of an independent U.N. tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 1.7 million  
people when they ruled Cambodia from 1975-79. The long guerrilla 
war they launched after being driven from power by a Vietnamese 
invasion ended last year with the surrender of their last fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for making peace, Hun Sen has allowed most of the  
surviving Khmer Rouge leaders to live freely, though he has said he 
would bring them to trial -- but only in Cambodian courts, which he 
has bent to his will in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammarberg said in his letter that the U.N. secretariat has  
given the go-ahead for negotiations with the Cambodian government 
to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a major step that the U.N. secretariat implicitly has  
declared its willingness to support such a trial -- if agreement can 
be reached on its more precise design,'' Hammarberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detractors fear a mixed tribunal will set a dangerous precedent  
and make it more difficult to create future international tribunals 
to judge war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Its supporters say that a trial in Cambodia is better than no  
trial at all.

<HEADLINE> CIA Reassesses Nerve Gas Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After eight years and more than $100 million,  
special Pentagon and CIA offices say they have done about all they 
can to find a cause for the mysterious Gulf War illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's special assistant on the issue told a presidential  
panel on Tuesday that new evidence shows the number of soldiers 
exposed to low levels of chemical agents in the 1991 conflict is 
much lower than estimates made two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the CIA investigator, Robert D. Walpole, and another key  
official in the quest for a cause, Pentagon special assistant 
Bernard Rostker, told the Special Oversight Board on Gulf War 
illness they expect no new sweeping conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 30,000 veterans of the war have complained of mysterious  
maladies such as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss they claim are 
related to their service in the Gulf, but several Pentagon and 
outside investigations have failed to pinpoint a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty close to closing the books,'' said Walpole. He  
said he expects three final CIA reports on exposure to chemical, 
biological or radiological agents in the Gulf to be completed by 
September or October, although intelligence assessments and 
examination of any new information would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've turned over all the biggest stones. Now we need help in  
determining when the stones get too small to turn over,'' said 
Rostker in an interview after Tuesday's panel hearing at which 
several veterans also appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gulf War Resource Center, which has been critical  
of Pentagon handling of the issue, called for Rostker's resignation 
but a continuation of his office's investigative work. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Sullivan, center executive director, told the panel that  
many veterans believe depleted uranium used in U.S. munitions 
caused their illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostker said there is no evidence of this and that depleted  
uranium shells saved lives in the Gulf by destroying Iraqi and 
protecting U.S. tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., board chairman, said that  
even if major aspects of the investigation have concluded without 
finding a cause, case studies and investigation of war data bases 
could still be conducted, and the issue is far from closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman also proposed investigation by the National Institutes of  
Health to settle a the debate over the danger of depleted uranium 
used in U.S. munitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA in 1997 estimated that 10,000 soldiers may have been  
exposed to low levels of nerve agent from inadvertent destruction 
of rockets at a site called Khamisiya Pit. The Pentagon at that 
time acknowledged that up to 100,000 soldiers may have been exposed 
to low levels of chemical agents during the war. In all instances, 
officials said, levels were too low to cause health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now estimate -- in most cases -- that less agent was  
released, primarily because more precise data is now available,'' 
said the CIA's Walpole. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smaller release ... would probably result in far fewer  
troops exposed compared to 1997 estimates,'' he said, giving no 
precise estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the CIA was never satisfied with its original analysis  
because it was made to meet a short deadline and based on limited 
data and worst-case scenarios. Environmental degradation of the 
chemicals, which were left over from the Iran-Iraq war, also could 
not be accurately calculated in 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest CIA analysis resulted from evidence provided by the  
U.N. Special Commission that oversaw troop activities during the 
war, Walpole said. Several sites were re-evaluated, including the 
Khamisiya Pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one-fourth of the originally estimated 500 rockets were  
found around the pit and explosives were placed less optimally than 
previously assumed, Walpole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigation at three other sites also showed no evidence of  
contamination of Western troops, he said.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Warns on Phone Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Motorola Inc. executives warned Wednesday that  
its troubled satellite phone investment could soon face bankruptcy 
or liquidation, causing shares in both companies to fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola president Christopher Growney advised Wall Street  
analysts that it would not continue to invest in Iridium World 
Communications Ltd. unless other backers also helped in its rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``With substantial participation of all significant parties, we  
believe Iridium LLC needs to, and can, deliver an achievable 
business plan based on the right financial restructuring 
solution,'' Growney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of the communications equipment maker support the  
global phone venture, but they also must consider the interests of 
Motorola's stockholders, Growney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse First Boston immediately lowered its  
recommendation on Iridium World Communications Ltd. to sell from 
hold. Iridium's shares fell $1.43 3/4, or 18 percent, to $6.75 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. Motorola's shares fell $1.62 1/2 to $95.87 1/2 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola owns an 18 percent stake in Iridium, has backed loans  
and is producing handsets for the venture. Its total financial 
exposure is $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola has built reserves to cover part of any potential loss  
and Growney said Iridium's fate should have no impact on Motorola's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company disclosed Tuesday it had taken a $126 million  
second-quarter charge to profits to write down the value on Iridium 
bonds that have lost much of their value. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major Iridium investors include Lockheed Martin Corp.,  
Raytheon Co., Sprint Corp. and American International Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	If an out-of-court restructuring does not take place in coming  
weeks, Iridium might be forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection or liquidation, Growney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors have given several extensions to Iridium as it falls  
well short of the number of subscribers it had promised by earlier 
this year. Its third extension since May on $800 million in loans 
expires Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Iridium's phones are too bulky and must have a  
line-of-sight connection to low-orbit satellites, making them 
difficult to operate indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Growney also told analysts that Motorola, based in Schaumburg,  
Ill., is on target to meet second-half fiscal expectations as it 
continues to see a rebound in sales of computer chips and digital 
handsets. The two products account for nearly 68 percent of total 
earnings.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A truck driver was fatally shot at a  
street barricade Wednesday, the ninth day of a strike by taxi, bus 
and truck drivers against a gasoline price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified men in a speeding car opened fire on strikers  
manning a barricade of taxis and trucks in the town of Guabo, 225 
miles southwest of Quito, killing 31-year-old Gruber Aguirre, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first death in the strike against a 13 percent  
government-decreed gasoline price increase. Gasoline is sold 
through the state-owned company Ecupetrol.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The United States and Nicaragua signed  
a $103.6 million aid agreement Wednesday to help the Central 
American country recover from the devastating damage caused by 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be used for health care, economic programs,  
rebuilding schools, repairing roads and other projects. Most of the 
aid is targeted for northeastern Nicaragua, the area most severely 
affected by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Mitch killed thousands and caused billions of dollars  
in damage when it struck Central America last fall. The United 
States has approved nearly $1 billion in aid to countries affected 
by that storm and by Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean 
last year.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Seven men were killed Wednesday in a shootout  
at a marijuana field in northern Mexico, authorities said. 
Traffickers removed harvested drugs before police arrived on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootout occurred in Higueras de Abuya, 55 miles south of  
Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were of men between the ages of 17 and 25, including  
two pairs of brothers, said Marcelo Arellano, the state attorney 
general's spokesman. 
</P>

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In the latest high profile case in Mexico  
City's crime wave, a major opposition party leader said he was 
kidnapped, held for three hours and forced to pay $1,175 ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Ortega, former secretary-general of the Democratic  
Revolution Party, said three men forced him into a taxi late Monday 
and ordered him to reveal the personal identification numbers for 
his credit cards. When he said he didn't know the numbers, they 
beat him and forced him to call his wife to arrange for the ransom 
payment. He was released early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said he does not believe the attack was related to his  
political activities.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In the first half of the year, 847  
Colombian civilians were killed in massacres, a 44 percent increase 
over the same period last year, a top human rights official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-wing paramilitary squads were responsible for most of the  
killings, said independent ombudsman Jose Fernando Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the war continues to escalate, the number of massacres will  
probably increase,'' Castro told a press conference in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The paramilitary groups -- originally funded by rich landowners  
and drug traffickers -- were formed in response to extortion and 
kidnappings by leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the rightist militias and guerrillas both regularly target  
civilians they accuse of collaborating with their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said the armed factions use mass killings as a tactic to  
drive people from their homes and gain control of their territory. 
Over 308,000 Colombians were displaced by violence in 1998.

<HEADLINE> GOP Questions PBS Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans on the House Commerce  
Committee have demanded a review of public broadcasting after 
learning that Boston's public television station gave its donor 
list to the Democratic Party earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee postponed a session today at which it had planned  
to debate a bill authorizing release of $525 million in new funds 
to public broadcasters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	At a subcommittee meeting Tuesday, a May 8 Boston Globe article  
about the list swap was circulated, and several Republican members 
immediately began lining up procedural maneuvers that could 
jeopardize the authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	WGBH-TV had previously admitted giving a list of donors' names  
to the Democratic National Committee, a possible violation of tax 
laws that prohibit public stations from playing political 
favorites. The station received, in turn, a comparable list of 
political contributors to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The name swap was discovered after a 4-year-old Massachusetts  
boy received a fund-raising pitch and ``agenda survey'' from the 
Democratic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellesley resident Sam Black, a fan of public TV's purple  
dinosaur Barney, began receiving mail from the Democratic National 
Committee after his mother, Jody Black, 38, donated $40 to WGBH 
last fall in gratitude for their children's programs. She made the 
donation in her name and Sam's. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at WGBH-TV said the station mistakenly gave a few  
thousand names to the committee in exchange for an equal number of 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was made by new employees who weren't aware of a  
station policy against sharing lists with political or religious 
groups, a WGBH spokewoman said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the list swap fed into old accusations that  
public broadcasting panders to the left.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Sugar Faces Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine sugar industry should  
prepare for greater competition from foreign producers in order to 
survive, a government official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Philippines and other countries lower trade barriers,  
foreign-produced sugar will flood the market and pressure local 
producers in the years to come, Agriculture Secretary Edgardo 
Angara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to face the reality that globalization is now the name  
of the game,'' Angara said in a statement to a conference of local 
and foreign sugar producers. ``The best we can do is to prepare for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar is the country's fourth most important crop, next to rice,  
coconut and corn. The Philippines used to be a major sugar 
producer, supplying about 10 percent of the world's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Angara, however, said years of government neglect and lack of  
initiative by local producers to modernize led to a gradual decay 
of the industry. The conversion of sugar plantations to other uses 
also hurt production, forcing the Philippines to become a net sugar 
importer today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his department is preparing a master plan to try to  
reverse the sugar industry's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also launched emergency measures, including a farm  
tractor loan program and the establishment of centers to develop 
and distribute disease-resistant and high-yielding cane varieties, 
Angara said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is trying to slow the pace of sugar tariff cuts  
pledged by past government trade negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Angara said efforts to protect local sugar producers are  
temporary and comply with the World Trade Organization's rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine sugar industry employs some 556,000 farmers and  
25,000 sugar mill workers, with up to 5 million other people 
directly or indirectly dependent on it.

<HEADLINE> Dole Downplays Poll Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole said Wednesday she hopes to  
keep raising enough money to remain a credible candidate for the 
Republican presidential nomination as one of her rivals, Ohio Rep. 
John Kasich, folded his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not able to raise the money, and that's his decision,''  
Dole said of Kasich and his subsequent endorsement of Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. ``I'm focused on what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased we led the rest of the candidates enough to be a  
credible candidate,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Dole walked through a street fair greeting voters and  
munching on fried dough and spinach pastry, there was the question 
whether she also may fall victim to the Bush steamroller. 
</P>
<P>
	In early May, Dole stood as the favorite candidate of 24 percent  
of polled Republicans, to Bush's 42 percent. She has since dropped 
to 8 percent -- good for second place -- while Bush has jumped to 59 
percent, according to the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Red Cross candidate and wife of the last Republican  
presidential nominee, Bob Dole, wouldn't discuss the falling

<HEADLINE> Royals Extend Muser's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals, who went into  
the All-Star break on a five-game losing streak and trail Cleveland 
by 21 games in the AL Central, on Wednesday gave manager Tony Muser 
a contract extension through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, all of the Royals' 1999 coaching staff was invited  
to return for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough fight and it's not an easy job to do,'' said  
Muser, whose Royals have shown improvement in every area except the 
bullpen, which has blown 21 saves and converted only 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if you want a challenge, this is a great place to be and a  
great place to work. I'm very glad to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Muser, 51, was hired off the staff of the Chicago Cubs during  
the 1997 All-Star break to replace Bob Boone, who had quarreled 
with the front office and become unpopular with fans and players 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals were 31-48 the rest of that season and 72-89 in 1998.  
This year, although they're averaging 5.55 runs per game, third in 
the AL behind only Cleveland and Seattle, they go into the second 
half of the season 35-52 and just a half-game out of last in the AL 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Herk Robinson said the club has seen progress in  
many young players, such as rookie center fielder Carlos Beltran 
and rookie second baseman Carlos Febles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony has done a great job molding the 1999 Royals,'' said  
Robinson. ``He and his coaches have worked hard and the results 
will continue to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony believes in our young players and those players will  
continue to improve. The majority of the team will be back next 
season and we want them to prosper under Tony's leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muser's contract extension was popular with the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are a young team and we are definitely getting better with  
the teaching we are getting from Tony and the coaches,'' said 
Beltran, a leading candidate for AL rookie of the year. ``It's good 
to know that Tony has been recognized for what he's doing. Our 
bullpen has been struggling a little bit, but we are improving as a 
team.''

<HEADLINE> Wider Food Stamp Eligibility Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to encourage the fast-moving shift of  
Americans from welfare to work, President Clinton is taking steps 
to help low-income families with jobs receive food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of five working families eligible for food stamps  
actually apply for assistance and receive it, the White House said. 
Clinton, in a speech today in Baltimore, was announcing a series of 
executive steps intended to increase food stamp enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was speaking to the Democratic Leadership Council,  
the centrist political organization that he helped establish. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by the strongest economy in a generation and strict new  
work requirements and time limits, welfare rolls have dropped from 
more than 5 million families in 1994 to just 2.7 million by the end 
of last year. However, studies show that many of the families still 
have trouble paying for food and other household bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people are not getting assistance such as Medicaid, food  
stamps and child care subsidies that are available even after a 
family stops receiving case assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Clinton would announce steps allowing  
states to make it easier for working families to own a better car 
and still receive food stamps. Currently, working families 
receiving federal help such as child care lose food stamp 
eligibility if the value of their car exceeds $4,650. Clinton's 
order will allow states to use more generous asset tests, the White 
House said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the president was to simplify food stamp reporting  
rules which, the administration said, discourage recipients from 
going to work, and give agencies a huge paperwork burden. For 
example, working families would be able now to report expected 
earnings every quarter instead of every month. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was to undertake  
a nationwide public education campaign to inform working families 
about food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit to Baltimore came on the heels of a daylong  
visit to the Miami area, where he raised up to $1 million for the 
state's Democratic Party and criticized Republican tax cutting 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also harshly condemned the Coast Guard's tactics in trying to  
prevent six Cuban refugees from swimming to shore in Miami on June 
29. They were blasted with high-pressure water aimed at their 
rowboat and one was doused with pepper spray.

<HEADLINE>  Ranger Helps Snare Elusive Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For Drew Carter, it was a pivotal moment made  
possible through long hours, dogged police work and something else: 
salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, the sergeant in the Texas Rangers had been building a  
relationship with the family of suspected serial killer Angel 
Maturino Resendez. He was trying to do the improbable -- get a man 
on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's hard work and personal touch paid off Tuesday when the  
39-year-old drifter who called himself Rafael Resendez-Ramirez 
quietly surrendered to the lawman after six weeks on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honesty's never hard. Sincerity is something people sense.  
That's what I did. I was honest with the family,'' Carter said, 
wearing a white cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunter and the hunted finally met on a remote bridge  
connecting Zaragosa, Mexico, with El Paso. Carter immediately 
recognized Maturino Resendez as he rode across the bridge in a 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a face that has just been shown all over the country  
for a long period of time now, and it's a face that I've been 
working on for the better part of six months,'' Carter said. ``So 
when I did see that face there was a little bit of excitement there 
because I finally said, `This is going to happen.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	First, there were pleasantries.  
</P>
<P>
	``He stuck out his hand, I stuck out my hand and we shook hands,  
and then I handcuffed him and he was in custody,'' the Texas Ranger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had been fishing in the Gulf of Mexico when he got a call  
Sunday from Maturino Resendez's sister, Manuela Maturino of 
Albuquerque, N.M. He dropped his fishing pole and jumped on a 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two days, the rookie member of Texas's most elite  
law enforcement agency brokered negotiations that led to one of the 
most high-profile arrests in Rangers history. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas officials said the international manhunt might have  
continued if not for the relationship Carter cultivated with the 
suspect's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really, as far as we can tell, would not have happened  
without Ranger Carter,'' Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Carter, who became a ranger on Sept. 1, rejected  
sole credit for the arrest, citing assistance from the FBI, U.S. 
Marshals and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that there were very personal one-on-one  
discussions with family members representing the subject and myself 
and other people that brought this about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service in El Paso has been  
under fire for letting Maturino Resendez slip through its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just six weeks ago, Maturino Resendez was in the custody of  
border agents who picked him up for illegally being in the country. 
Yet within hours, he was sent back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened even though he already was wanted by the FBI, and  
Houston police had told the INS they wanted him for questioning in 
a murder. Authorities believe he killed four people after the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, INS officers in El Paso were taking some solace in  
the fact that he was caught there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it makes up for it, but there were some  
lessons that were learned,'' said Luis Garcia, district director 
for the INS, parent agency of the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	C.G. Almengor, a supervisor at the Border Patrol processing  
facility where Maturino Resendez was taken in June, said the 
agency's computer system did not indicate he was a wanted man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our systems told us he was nothing of lookout material,''  
Almengor said. ``We really wish he had been in the system so we 
could have caught him before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key in Maturino Resendez's surrender was the acceptance of  
several conditions: The fugitive wanted promises for his safety 
while in jail, regular visiting rights and a psychological 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris County District Attorney John Holmes faxed the agreement  
to Albuquerque, where Ms. Maturino passed the offer on to a 
relative in Mexico on Monday. Before long, she was calling Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love their brother and their relative and they care for  
him deeply, but at the same time they have been cooperative in this 
investigation and are doing what they feel is the right thing,'' 
Carter said.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Seeks Port Chicago Pardons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP wants President Clinton to pardon  
surviving black sailors convicted in the so-called Port Chicago 
trial during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial centered on the Port Chicago Naval Ammunition base  
near San Francisco, where more than 300 sailors were killed in a 
July 1944 explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion caused the worst domestic loss of life during the  
war, but echoes of the subsequent trial, in which black sailors 
were court-martialed for mutiny, continue today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  
at the organization's convention here, passed a resolution Tuesday 
asking Clinton to ``pardon Port Chicago trial survivors, restore 
their benefits and make the survivor's benefits available to the 
widows of those convicted in the unfair trial of African American 
sailors in the aftermath of the Port Chicago explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed unanimously among the hundreds of NAACP  
delegates who held voting cards aloft to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, one of the survivors, Freddie Meeks, asked Clinton to  
clear his name and those of 49 other black sailors who were 
court-martialed for mutiny for refusing to return to the loading 
docks after the blast at the Port Chicago that killed 320 men. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, 79, is one of two known surviving members of the group of  
black sailors convicted and imprisoned three months after the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really deserve what we got, but we got it and we had  
to put up with it,'' Meeks said in May from his home near Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Meeks argued the military prosecution was racist and  
the punishment too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	The sailors defied white officers' orders to resume loading  
ships two weeks after the blast. Two-thirds of those killed were 
members of the all-black loading crews that stacked bombs and other 
explosives aboard Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Navy legal review concluded the black seamen faced racial  
prejudice but found no grounds to overturn their courts-martial. 
The review followed several years of congressional pressure aimed 
at clearing the sailors' names. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 black sailors initially refused to go back to the  
loading docks. Eventually, 208 were forced to return and were 
disciplined. The 50 who continued the boycott were court-martialed 
by an all-white jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks served less than two years of a 15-year sentence, then  
returned to active duty in the Navy to serve out the term of his 
draft.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Exhorts Black America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jesse Jackson beseeched black America to look  
beyond issues of race and help lead a crusade to ``save the 
nation'' with a renewed commitment to ending poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't just save the black room in a house if the whole  
house is on fire. We must save the nation and stop just reacting to 
the race gap between us,'' Jackson told 2,500 NAACP members at the 
group's annual national convention Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's message was that poverty and hopelessness aren't just  
black issues. He said a recent fact-finding trip on which he 
accompanied President Clinton to Appalachia and elsewhere was 
coordinated to ``help deracialize the debate'' on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	For Jackson, the appearance at the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People was akin to a homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech was frequently interrupted by standing ovations.  
Jackson praised the leadership of NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, 
saying, ``You have lifted this organization where it belongs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson called for greater inclusion of minorities and women in  
America's economic mainstream and cited the recent victory of the 
U.S. Women's Soccer team in the World Cup as a civil rights 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Title IX and without affirmative action, those women  
would not have been on the field,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong's Dr. Credits His Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The doctor who treated Lance Armstrong for cancer  
says the cyclist's startling success in the Tour de France is due 
more to ``spirit and dedication'' than medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had only a 50 percent to 60 percent chance of  
surviving when he came to Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, medical oncologist 
at the Indiana University Medical Center, with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat a large number of patients and we always hope and  
expect they'll be cured,'' Dr. Einhorn told The Associated Press by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to come back as a professional athlete, and to be in his  
form -- that is a result of Lance's spirit and dedication,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to recover and go back to work as an  
accountant,'' Einhorn said. ``But it is very, very difficult to 
perform as an athlete, after all the terrible fatigue you go 
through, and everything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But Lance is just a wonderful person, a great model for  
everything that's good in sports and in medicine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn cited one example of Armstrong's determination: Between  
draining rounds of chemotherapy -- he went through four of them, 
lasting five days each -- the 27-year-old Texan would ride his bike 
30 to 50 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn and another specialist contacted by the AP, Dr. Phil  
Kantoff of Harvard Medical School, said testicular cancer strikes 
young men most often, with no known cause. 
</P>
<P>
	They both strongly denied any link between testicular cancer and  
performance-enhancing drugs, as some European newspapers have 
hinted, without presenting any evidence, in regard to Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've read about these hints and they're ridiculous -- knowing  
Lance, and also knowing that drugs have absolutely no cause in the 
development of this cancer,'' Einhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is so clean-living, you wouldn't believe it,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 1996.  
He noticed swelling, began coughing blood and suffered dizziness 
and blurred vision. It turned out the cancer had spread to his 
lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After two operations and extensive chemotherapy, he began his  
comeback early last year. He now has only a tiny chance of the 
cancer returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 98 percent home free,'' Einhorn said. He said Armstrong's  
treatment is completely finished and he takes no medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong appeared on a postrace television show on Wednesday,  
after he had widened his overall lead to a commanding 7 minutes, 42 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about snide headlines in the French tabloid press.  
The headlines implied Armstrong couldn't achieve his stunning 
victory over European riders without extra help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stupefying Armstrong,'' was the headline of Wednesday's  
edition of France-Soir, referring to his victory Tuesday in the 
Alps -- and using the French word for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports newspaper L'Equipe's headline, above a picture of the  
rider, read: ``On Another Planet.'' Inside, another said: 
``Hallucinating Armstrong'' -- another play on words. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he was aware of the innuendo.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw today's headlines. Yes, they have many questions,'' he  
said. ``It's not true that I take banned substances, or that I've 
tested positive. It's incredible that they print this. Why do they 
print this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his success was a result of hard work, preparation and  
luck. Armstrong came to the mountains and practiced each stage 
months ago, something few if any riders have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gorski, general manager of the U.S. Postal Service Team,  
said the team was not overly upset about the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of junk that sells newspapers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Protects Newborns from AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists working in Uganda have discovered a  
dramatically more effective way to prevent pregnant women from 
spreading the AIDS virus to their babies: a drug treatment that 
costs just $4 per mother and could save up to 1,000 newborns a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug nevirapine already is widely sold around the world to  
treat AIDS. But the new study found it is 47 percent more effective 
than the therapy now recommended in developing countries for 
preventing mother-to-baby transmission of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, announced Wednesday by U.S. scientists, could  
finally boost AIDS prevention among the world's poorest countries 
because for the first time the nations most afflicted by the AIDS 
epidemic could afford to buy babies some protection.

	``You're talking about the possibility of preventing infection  
in up to 1,000 babies per day for a cost that is really very 
minor,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of 
Health, which funded the research. ``Now all of a sudden it falls, 
at least in some countries, within the realm of affordability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This research provides real hope that we may be able to  
protect many of Africa's next generation from the ravages of 
AIDS,'' said Uganda's health minister, Crispus Kiyonga, in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the greatest successes in the fight against AIDS is using  
the drug AZT to lower pregnant women's chances of spreading the 
deadly virus to their newborns. In the United States and other 
wealthy countries, infected mothers typically receive five months 
of AZT, a therapy that cuts in half their babies' risk of 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	But that treatment can cost more than $1,000, far beyond what  
developing countries can afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, scientists discovered that giving far fewer AZT  
doses, starting during labor, could protect newborns, although not 
as effectively as the treatment Americans get. But even that 
``short-course AZT therapy'' was too expensive for many countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevirapine is a cheaper AIDS drug. Although it works against the  
same viral target as AZT, it stays in the body for a longer time, 
crosses the placenta and even gets into breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. scientists, working with doctors in Uganda, studied 618  
mothers. Half got short-course AZT. The other half got a single 
dose of nevirapine during labor, and their babies got a single dose 
within three days of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists hoped nevirapine would prove as good as AZT -- but  
to their surprise, it worked far better. Just 13.1 percent of 
nevirapine-treated infants became infected with HIV, vs. 25.1 
percent of AZT-treated babies. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations estimates that 1,800 HIV-infected babies are  
born daily in developing countries. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, 
the region hardest-hit by AIDS, up to 30 percent of pregnant women 
are infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread use of nevirapine could prevent between 300,000 and  
400,000 babies a year from contracting HIV at birth, the NIH said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study has implications for American women, too: If a  
woman goes into labor without having had prenatal AZT treatment, 
doctors could consider giving her nevirapine, Fauci said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a study under way of U.S. and European women will  
attempt to determine whether adding nevirapine to the longer and 
more expensive AZT therapy that they now take also would work 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevirapine, sold in the United States under the brand name  
Viramune, appeared safe for infants. But scientists will follow the 
babies until they're 18 months old, both to look for possible 
long-term side effects -- and to see whether nevirapine also could 
protect against HIV in breast milk. Babies born healthy still can 
become infected through breast-feeding, something no drug so far 
has prevented. But early data are ``highly suggestive'' that 
nevirapine might prove beneficial in breast milk, Fauci said.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Has Stake in Sports Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Internet retailer Amazon.com is moving in yet  
another direction, revealing Wednesday that it holds a 49 percent 
stake in an online discount sporting-goods retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com sells books, music, videos and other products and has  
invested in online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop 
Pets.com and cyber supermarket HomeGrocer.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Its varied investments will help it develop a massive online  
shopping presence, said Jupiter Communications analyst Fiona 
Swerdlow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're incredibly well-capitalized, and if their goal is to  
become the online retailer of choice, then they need to be making 
these acquisitions now because the window of opportunity is not 
always going to be open,'' said Ms. Swerdlow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon.com, would not disclose the  
value of the investment or if Amazon.com will establish a link to 
Gear.com on its Web site, as it has for Drugstore.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Devenney, spokesman for Gear.com, said the partnership  
with Amazon.com is the start of a marketing effort by the sport 
products retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are creating a whole new distribution channel for close-out  
sporting goods,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com officials, seeking investment opportunities, review a  
potential partner's management, customer service record and a 
product or service that provides improved online shopping, Curry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly with Gear.com, they fire on all three pistons,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gear.com, in business less than a year, offers merchandise at 20  
percent to 90 percent off retail costs. The reduced prices are due 
to overproduction, changes in style or function and orders canceled 
by retailers. All merchandise is new and sold in original 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are based in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Jim Leyland Has Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland is recovering  
from surgery after doctors here removed a cyst the size of a grape 
from his right elbow on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't expecting that,'' Leyland said from his home in  
Pittsburgh, where he is recuperating. ``It was right in the groove 
of the nerve. It took a little longer than they expected, but there 
wasn't any problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland said he will wear a sling for several weeks but will be  
in uniform at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati on Thursday as Colorado 
resumes play after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland said he had been bothered by a loss of feeling in his  
hand since spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had planned to wait until after the season for  
surgery, but doctors told him he risked losing muscle control in 
his right hand if he waited.

</P>
<P>
	The departure of Gobrecht, 48, marks the association's fourth

</P>
<P>
	Ken Muscatel of Seattle, the sport's acting commissioner, will

<HEADLINE> Cemetery's Art Is Portal to History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In this Indianapolis history classroom you  
won't find books or desks. The lessons emerge from Crown Hill 
Cemetery's 555 park-like acres, where nearly 190,000 people are 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	From pioneers to a president, the rich and poor are side by  
side. Each has a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	The inscriptions and fine artwork adorning the monuments provide  
the cultural portal through which visitors can look back in time to 
learn not only about an individual, but how society viewed death 
and memorialization. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery, which opened in 1864 in what was then a rural area  
northwest of the city, got its name from the glacier-formed knoll 
considered at the time to be Marion County's ``crowning summit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shady grounds and large, grassy areas became a favorite  
place for visitors to stroll and even to picnic. 
</P>
<P>
	``People had a different relationship with death. It was a part  
of life; it wasn't scary,'' said associate professor Eleanor 
Weinel, who studies cemetery art and teaches architecture classes 
at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Victorian era, the sentimental attachments to people  
and places were intense. In the 20th century, we don't feel 
attached, so it starts to be a place that makes us nervous,'' she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's visitors pass through the same elaborate, three-arch  
stone gate that greeted those who entered near the 34th Street 
Waiting Station at the turn of the century. The tree-lined roads 
criss-cross burial sections that contain the graves of Civil War 
soldiers and such notables as President Benjamin Harrison, poet 
James Whitcomb Riley and bank robber John Dillinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the markers and monuments are as elaborate and unique as  
they are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not unusual for prominent families to have monuments  
designed by the area's leading artists and sculptors,'' said Crown 
Hill tour guide Tom Davis. ``People in the Victorian era generously 
decorated their memorials to their loved ones and used symbols to 
express the things that words alone could not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Davis walks between the rows of monuments, gently setting  
toppled stones back on their bases, he tells what he knows as fact 
and imagines what might have been. A broken column pays tribute to 
a life cut short, doves symbolize love and purity and the 
life-sized angels with outstretched wings direct the way to a 
heavenly afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Other symbols are more personal. While Indiana's climate has  
destroyed the luster of a white marble monument, there's no doubt 
an open Bible rests atop the stone pulpit of a minister. A 
painter's palette nearby suggests its owner found pleasure putting 
a brush to canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	Obelisks resembling the Washington Monument tower over some of  
the smaller memorials, but Davis said it's not known which statue 
or monument is the tallest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep wanting to get some trigonometry class out here to  
figure it out, but so far that hasn't happened,'' Davis quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Crown Hill officials consider the monument of  
turn-of-the-century Butler University professor Albertina Allen 
Forrest one of the cemetery's most beautiful works of art. The 
elaborate tribute contains a bronze statue of a woman in mourning 
that was created by noted Austrian sculptor Rudolf Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz also produced the ``War'' and ``Peace'' sculptures at  
the base of the Soldiers and Sailors monument on the Circle in 
downtown Indianapolis. The bronze portrayal of Indiana Governor 
Oliver Morton displayed on the east side of the Statehouse also is 
the work of Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of classical, Romanesque, Gothic, Egyptian and modern  
architecture are found in the cemetery's 57 family-owned 
mausoleums. The stately columns and intricate carvings draw the 
interest of even casual observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunlight streams through the colorful stained-glass windows  
inside many of the structures, but that's not apparent until 
visitors peek through the ornate doors that remain locked for 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exterior (of the mausoleum) is the object for the  
appreciation of other people; the interior is very private and for 
the family and people involved,'' Weinel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery's Gothic Chapel, patterned after a European  
cathedral, was designed by noted architect Diedrich A. Bohlen and 
was built in 1875. The chapel is still used for funerals. 
</P>
<P>
	One president, three vice presidents, 10 Indiana governors, 14  
U.S. senators and dozens of other famous politicians, poets, 
artists, musicians, and business owners lie within Crown Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take visitors to Crown Hill because it's a really beautiful  
spot and everyone who was anybody in Indianapolis history is buried 
there,'' said William Selm, an instructor at Herron School of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the memorials at Crown Hill are elaborate, but that  
doesn't lessen their significance or diminish the lives of those 
who lived in relative obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people go through life and aren't great people. They're  
born, live a life, do some things and die. Those markers are 
monuments for the regular guy,'' Selm added. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixture is what makes the cemetery an interesting place to  
visit and over the years, thousands have done just that. In 
mid-century, cemetery officials estimated as many people visited 
Crown Hill on Memorial Day as attended the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some cemeteries may have more historical significance, but not  
too many have the variety of Crown Hill,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Cable Sharing Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Leaders of a Florida county have  
become the nation's second local government to force a cable TV 
company to open its wires to competing Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broward County Commission voted 4-3 Tuesday to require  
MediaOne, which is being acquired by AT&AMP;T, to lease its cable TV 
lines to rival providers of high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second such setback in less than two months for AT&AMP;T,  
which has been buying and partnering with cable companies to create 
a national network for telephone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	In early June, a federal judge ruled that Tele-Communications  
Inc., which AT&AMP;T acquired in February, must share its Internet 
cable lines in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Broward County will be the long-term  
beneficiaries of this historic vote,'' said Greg Simon, co-director 
of the openNET Coalition, a group of companies battling for 
competition in high-speed cable access. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides hired high-powered lobbyists to wage their battle in  
Broward. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is purchasing MediaOne and other cable firms, fought  
the measure and hired more than a dozen lobbyists to kill the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spent thousands on television ads to encourage voters to  
call their commissioners. Its lobbyists even treated condominium 
residents and political leaders to a steak luncheon at a private 
Fort Lauderdale club. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE backed the proposal and obtained the services of a local  
lobbyist, a former state legislator with strong connections to the 
county's retiree population and the chairman of the Broward 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE lobbyists packed Tuesday's commission meeting with community  
leaders and even furnished several of them with scripts to read. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Norman Abramowitz said being courted by teams of  
lobbyists almost every day for a month was horrible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been as uncomfortable in my political life,'' said  
Abramowitz, who voted against AT&AMP;T. ``Who didn't they hire to lobby 
me?''

<HEADLINE> Ford Earns $2.48B in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., profiting from robust car  
and truck sales in the United States, reported Wednesday its 
second-quarter operating earnings rose 4 percent to $2.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world's second-largest automaker said it was still  
struggling in Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's operating earnings translated to $2 a share and compared  
with $2.38 billion, or $1.91 a share, during the same period a year 
ago. Sales came to $42.3 billion, up 13 percent from $37.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the numbers were quite strong,'' said analyst Gary  
Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``Obviously, it's all North 
America -- the North American results were better than people 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat the average estimate of $1.95 of analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had net earnings of $2.34 billion, or $1.89 a share,  
including a one-time profit reduction of $146 million related to 
its January acquisition of the car making unit of Sweden's Volvo 
AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its automotive operations earned just under $2 billion  
in North America, up 19 percent from the year-ago period. U.S. car 
and light truck sales are on track to break the 1986 industry 
record of nearly 16.1 million vehicles; in the first half, sales 
were running at an annual rate of 16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With a strong lineup of popular pickups and sport utility  
vehicles, Ford said it is well-positioned to continue profiting 
from the strong U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many positive factors at work in the U.S. economy  
right now,'' said Jac Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive. 
``We're confident vehicle sales will remain strong into 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News from overseas was not so bright.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating earnings in Europe totaled $214 million, down 31  
percent from the $310 million earned a year ago. In South America, 
Ford lost $120 million, compared with earnings of $14 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford did poorer than expected in Europe, while South America was  
a disaster, Lapidus said. Ford said its biggest problems were in 
Brazil, where industry sales declined 20 percent in the first half. 
W. Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman and chief financial officer, 
forecast no improvement before 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Booker said the addition of Volvo earnings did not affect its  
European results because the unit was ``about break-even.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings improvements in the highly competitive European market  
will be gradual over the very long term, Booker said. He 
acknowledged that without Volvo, Ford's European market share would 
have declined in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong initial sales of Ford's new Focus subcompact and a better  
performance by Jaguar were not enough to completely offset slower 
sales of the aging Fiesta subcompact and Mondeo compact sedans in 
Europe. Lapidus said the Ka minicar also has been selling more 
slowly than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the other manufacturers have been very aggressive with new  
product over the past two years, and Ford has not in Europe,'' 
Lapidus said. ``The Focus is doing fine, it's just not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford stock fell 56 cents to $52.94 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. So far this year, Ford's stock is down 7 percent, clearly 
a frustration to Ford management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had the answer to that,'' Booker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some on Wall Street complain that while they like Nasser's  
long-term strategy, they fear Ford doesn't have a clear short-term 
plan to improve results overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarter is a reminder that despite what is clearly a  
compelling vision to transform the company longer-term, there are 
some near-term challenges that Ford needs to address,'' said 
analyst John Casesa of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have questioned Nasser's long-term focus on expanding  
Ford into auto-related businesses, such as its recent acquisitions 
of the Kwik-Fit service chain in Europe and auto-parts recycling 
operations in the United States. Booker denied that Ford was paying 
less attention to its automotive business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it was making continued progress in cutting costs,  
which declined $300 million in the second quarter and $400 million 
for the entire first half. Ford's annual goal is $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half operating earnings totaled $4.32 billion, up 11  
percent from the $3.9 billion in the first six months of 1998. 
Revenues totaled $80.2 billion, up 8.5 percent from $73.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. plans to report its second-quarter results  
Tuesday, followed by DaimlerChrysler AG July 29.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Mining Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to uphold Clinton  
administration efforts to limit mining operations on federal lands, 
putting the chamber on a collision course with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In an issue pitting Western mining interests against  
environmentalists, the House voted 273-151 to require mining 
companies using public lands to heed a 1997 Interior Department 
ruling limiting the size of their waste dumps to five acres per 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats voted almost solidly for the limits, while more than  
one in three Republicans broke with their party to support acreage 
limits as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version of the legislation would let companies ignore  
that ruling, which was an interpretation of the 1872 law that still 
governs mining for gold and other hard-rock minerals on federal 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry supporters say the five-acre limitation on waste sites  
is too small for modern techniques, which use chemicals like 
cyanide on vast piles of rock from open-pit mines. Opponents say 
the provision is the only pro-environmental one in the entire 
127-year-old law, which lets companies purchase federal lands for 
$2.50 an acre or lease them for $100 annually per 20-acre claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public domain is a public trust, and there is an effort  
today to undermine that public trust,'' said Rep. Nick Rahall, 
D-W.Va., who sponsored the amendment with Reps. Christopher Shays, 
R-Conn., and Jay Inslee, D-Wash. ``It is a land grab, a land grab 
at public expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of the amendment said it was based on a  
misinterpretation of law by overzealous bureaucrats that would cost 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said the Interior  
Department has ``a proven track record of hostility toward mining'' 
and its officials are ``working feverishly to impose their 
unorthodox views on mining before they leave office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mining language was an amendment to a $14 billion measure  
financing the Interior Department and federal cultural programs 
next year. The bill contains well below what President Clinton has 
requested for purchasing land for federal and state parks, 
protecting Florida's Everglades, and energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House voted to trim $140 million from the  
legislation, part of a continuing effort by Republican leaders to 
satisfy conservatives demanding spending cuts. The reductions would 
come from clean coal and land acquisition programs plus a 0.48 
percent cut in the entire measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are what ``we have to do to get where we have to be,''  
said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chided Republicans for yielding to  
conservatives ``who detest government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other votes Wednesday, the House:  
</P>
<P>
	--Voted 243-180 to add $13 million to a program that helps  
low-income people insulate and otherwise winterize their homes, 
bringing it to $133 million, the same as this year. It also voted 
225-198 against eliminating a new requirement that states provide 
$1 for every $3 they receive from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	--By 217-207, rejected an attempt by Democrats and moderate  
Republicans to add $10 million each for the National Endowment for 
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The House 
also defeated a conservative effort to cut the arts endowment by $2 
million by 300-124. The bill would provide NEA with $98 million 
next year, the same as this year and $52 million less than Clinton 
wanted. The NEH would get $111 million, the same as this year and 
$39 million below Clinton's request.

<HEADLINE> AMD Reports 2nd-Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. president  
and chief operating officer S. Atiq Raza resigned Wednesday as the 
chipmaker released second-quarter losses, stemming from tough 
competition from Intel Corp. and low sales of a benchmark chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Raza cited personal reasons for his resignation, saying that his  
departure was not related to the company's financial problems. ``My 
decision to leave AMD was a difficult one,'' he said. ``I have 
enjoyed the challenges of helping to restore competition in the 
microprocessor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Raza's unexpected announcement came as AMD reported a loss of  
$162 million, or $1.10 per share, for the three months ended June 
27. The loss was less than the $1.26 predicted by industry analysts 
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, AMD lost $64.6 million, or 45 cents per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a one-time, after-tax gain of $259 million from the  
sale of its subsidiary Vantis, as well some charges, AMD recorded 
net income of $79.9 million for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues totaled $595 million, up from $526 million in  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, AMD warned that it would suffer a significant  
second-quarter loss because production problems with its most 
popular microprocessor, the K6, would hurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive  
officer of AMD, said the company's short-term future rested with 
its new Athlon processor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of Intel's intensifying aggression in the consumer  
sector of the PC market, where our AMD-K6-2 processor family ... 
has achieved substantial market share in both desktop and portable 
PCs, further gains in unit market share or revenue growth are 
unlikely,'' he said. ``The key to resuming growth and expanding 
margins is the recently introduced AMD Athlon processor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's first seventh-generation processor, Athlon is the  
highest-performance processor for PCs available. Initial shipments 
of Athlon processors, including 600-megahertz versions, began in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD ranks second in the microprocessor market in terms of market  
share, behind Silicon Valley rival Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AMD rose 93 3/4 cents per share to $18 in advance of the  
earnings report, which was released after the close of Wednesday's 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bookseller Urged To Amend Ad Slogan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Challenging Barnesandnoble.com's claim that ``If  
we don't have your book nobody does,'' a division of the Council of 
Better Business Bureaus has called for the online bookseller to 
discontinue or modify the slogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to interpret the slogan literally, it would  
discourage searches from other sources,'' Nicholas Vianna, 
advertising review specialist with the group's National Advertising 
Division, said Tuesday. ``In the book industry there are private 
books, local publishers, all kinds of books. Some of the 
independent sellers make their livelihood on that special niche 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, which filed a complaint  
last December, compiled a list of 100 out-of-print titles and found 
24 that were available only through competitors of 
Barnesandnoble.com. They included such obscure works as ``Cartels, 
Combines &AMP; Trusts in Post-War Germany'' and ``Studies in 
Machiavellianism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of independent booksellers complained because that  
slogan just wasn't accurate,'' said Richard Howorth, president of 
the ABA, whose membership consists overwhelmingly of independent 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Barnesandnoble.com agreed to comply with last week's  
decision, as of Tuesday the slogan still appeared on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagreed with the NAD's recommendation but chose to comply  
because we were moving away from that advertising slogan,'' said 
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokesperson for Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. ``We 
agreed to remove or modify the slogan over the next several 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vianna had hoped for a quicker response.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would hope the changes would happen as soon as possible,''  
Vianna said. ``The agreement calls for compliance within a 
reasonable period of time. And several months seems too long, 
especially in the case of a Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Advertising Division is a self-regulating body  
established by the advertising industry. Compliance with NAD 
decisions is voluntary, but some cases end up referred to the 
Federal Trade Commission.

	Railway Suspect Admits Burglary

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Police said today they have evidence linking a  
man suspected to have committed eight killings along railway 
stations in three states to a ninth murder. Angel Maturino 
Resendez, also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, admitted today he 
committed a burglary at one of the killing scenes. Police said 
palmprints found at the scene of the October killing of an elderly 
woman match those of Maturino Resendez, and that he will be charged 
in the death. Maturino Resendez surrendered yesterday, ending a

House Ways and Means Committee. Lawmakers provided no information 
on how much the plan would cost, but they said it would be paid for 
from projected federal surpluses. The tax plan, nearly half of 
which is a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income tax rates,

postponed a session today at which it had planned to debate a bill 
authorizing release of $525 million in new funds to public

	New Drug Protects Newborns from AIDS

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists in Uganda have discovered a drug  
that is cheaper and more efficient than AZT in helping to lower a 
pregnant woman's chance of spreading AIDS to her newborn. Using the 
drug nevirapine instead of AZT proved 47 percent better in 
protecting babies from AIDS, the U.S. National Institutes of Health 
announced today. Just 13.1 percent of the nevirapine-treated babies 
became infected with HIV, compared with 25.1 percent of the 
AZT-treated babies. The U.S. government funded the Ugandan study as 
part of a hunt for ways to reduce the cost of preventing AIDS in 
the world's poorest countries.

ailment. ``Symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hands are 
common in the general population,'' reported the authors of the 
Swedish study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical

developed countries with increasing computer-keyboard use, but the 
study shows that two problems are misdiagnosis and the lack of 
consensus on how to treat the condition.

	DECLINING NET WORTH: There have been plenty of warnings in  
recent years that Baby Boomers aren't saving enough for retirement. 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., which tracks Americans' financial 
health, says they also have too much debt and that's lowering their 
net worth. MetLife estimates that boomers outstanding debt is equal 
to 95 percent of their annual personal incomes, and that has 
contributed to a decline in net worth for people age 35 to 54 over 
the past 10 years. Sandra Timmerman, who studies the problems of 
older people for MetLife, attributes boomers' willingness to take 
on more debt to their high confidence in the U.S. economy.

	BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK: Worth magazine, which caters to the

next generation of high-tech toys for people willing to spend very 
big bucks for the very latest. On Worth's suggested shopping list 
is a new super CD player from Sony that will retail for about 
$5,000. If you want a pricey cell phone, Worth reports that Nokia 
has one that has a calendar, optional vibrating ringer and other 
features, and it'll be yours for $1,000. If it's a car with a hefty 
price tag you want, Worth notes that Aston Martin -- the make driven 
by James Bond -- has a new version of its DB7, able to accelerate 
from zero to 60 mph in under five seconds. That will come in handy 
for a dash to the electronics store when the CD players and cell 
phones go on sale.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Stadium Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A 480-foot crane being used to build the new  
home of the Milwaukee Brewers collapsed onto the stadium Wednesday, 
killing three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant crane fell while lifting a section of Miller Park's  
retractable roof. The wind was gusting about 30 mph at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	A 64-year-old crane operator was in satisfactory condition with  
a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear if others were injured or whether  
the dead were workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Lawrence Gardner said further checks were being made  
to ensure there were no other injured at the site. The victims' 
names weren't immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Trunzo, chairman of the board overseeing construction of  
the $400 million stadium, said contractors were cooperating with 
the police and sheriff's investigation into the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we have a death or serious injury, we treat it as a  
criminal investigation,'' Police Chief Arthur Jones said. ``It may 
not result in that, but that is how we treat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
collided with an aerial basket. A worker fell 60 feet from the 
retractable roof May 10 and was briefly hospitalized with multiple 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Geoff Leber from the nearby Veterans Administration hospital  
saw the crane after it fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see the whole structure inside the stadium,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the mayor's office, said there was  
significant damage to the stadium, ``but it would be pure 
speculation to estimate how long it would set the project back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof is being built by Mitsubishi. The crane was used to  
lift seven sections of a roof structure weighing a combined 12,000 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	With about half the sections in place, the roof had been  
expected to be completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43,000-seat ballpark is scheduled to open next season.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no word yet on whether the mishap would affect a  
Brewers homestand scheduled to open Thursday night at Milwaukee 
County Stadium adjacent to the building site.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Motorola Inc. benefited from a rebound in  
computer chip sales and its continuing rollout of new digital 
cellular phones in sharply boosting its second-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schaumburg, Ill.-based communications and equipment maker on  
Tuesday reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations as its 
retooling of its businesses began to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three-month period ending July 3, the company reported a  
profit from operations of $273 million, or 44 cents a share, 
compared with $6 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The current quarter included a charge of $94 million, reflecting  
a move to prop up its 18 percent investment in the Iridium 
go-anywhere satellite phone project. The year-ago quarter included 
a charge of $1.91 billion for restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations of 41 cents a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped 7 percent to $7.5 billion from $7 billion. As  
expected by analysts, Motorola's paging and wireless infrastructure 
segments remained sluggish, but the sales results reflected an 
overall improvement in Motorola's outlook and of the semiconductor 
industry in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. on Tuesday also reported a rebound in its  
computer-chip business, although its profits were below forecasts. 
The Semiconductor Industry Association reported last week that 
sales were up 11 percent in May as the Asian economy showed signs 
of a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	For Motorola, sales of semiconductors -- the chips in everything  
from phones to computers -- jumped 9 percent for the quarter to $2 
billion, while orders jumped 20 percent. That was helped by a boost 
in orders from all regions except Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	And after long delays in introducing digital wireless phones,  
the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company appeared to be gaining on 
competitors Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported orders jumped 21 percent in the quarter to  
$3.2 billion, helped in part by Bell Atlantic's purchase of 1 
million digital StarTac phones and accompanying accessories. Sales 
rose 17 percent to $2.8 billion for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news, however, was tempered by warnings the third  
quarter could be further affected by Motorola's Iridium 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those worries were reflected in a $2.25 a share decline in  
Motorola's stock price which was at $94.25 in afternoon trading 
today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled company has repeatedly received extensions from its  
creditors as it falls well short of the amount of subscribers it 
had promised would be on board by earlier this year. Motorola 
indicated it will play a major hand in Iridium's recent efforts to 
restructure its business, lower costs and bring in new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, operating earnings were  
$450 million, or 73 cents a share, compared to $147 million, or 25 
cents a share, the same period a year ago. Including charges, net 
income was $377 million, or 61 cents a share, compared to a net 
loss of $1.15 billion, or a loss of $1.92 a share.

<HEADLINE>  British Open Course Could Be Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Rain fell on the Carnoustie Golf  
Links and a breeze stiffened as Tiger Woods, fresh off a helicopter 
ride through the clouds, sat safely inside a tent off the 18th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from St. Andrews across the Firth of Tay didn't faze  
him. Neither did the conditions that threaten to make the British 
Open course as cruel as it is long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' Woods said. ``I've always loved it. I grew up in  
Southern California where we had good weather every day. So it is 
always a challenge to play in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elements were back in play Tuesday, leaving the warm  
sunshine that greeted the start of the week as nothing more than a 
distant memory and reminding players of just how tough Carnoustie 
promises to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods could be excused for his optimism; he had played only four  
holes the day earlier and hadn't yet seen the course at its full 
7,361-yard self. 
</P>
<P>
	Others had, though, and it wasn't always a pretty sight.  
</P>
<P>
	With fairways that seem the width of cart paths, deep rough and  
long, long par-4s, Carnoustie would be tough under the best weather 
conditions. And seaside British Opens are rarely played in the best 
weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest course I've ever played,'' Bernhard Langer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make us look foolish if the wind blows real  
hard,'' said U.S. Open winner Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what happened in the third round last year at  
Royal Birkdale, when Brian Watts was the only one to break par and 
Woods shot himself out of serious contention with a 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkdale could pale in comparison, though, to a nasty day on the  
thin fairways of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might as well stick red hazard posts down the fairways,''  
Phil Mickelson said. ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as 
that for a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when the U.S. Open was played with little rough, the  
British Open more than makes up for it with tall, spindly grass 
that seems to grow out of everywhere on the links course. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the fairway is crucial. The problem, the course plays so  
long that most players will be forced to hit drivers off the tee on 
most par-4s. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Woods and a few others will have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will be able to hit say a 2-iron or 3-wood off the tee just  
as far as some of the guys can hit their drivers,'' Woods said. ``I 
believe that is a tremendous advantage in any tournament, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three of his last four tournaments and was in  
contention coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open, is the 
favorite of British oddsmakers to win his first major since the 
1997 Masters. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  British Open Course Could Be Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Rain fell on the Carnoustie Golf  
Links and a breeze stiffened as Tiger Woods, fresh off a helicopter 
ride through the clouds, sat safely inside a tent off the 18th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from St. Andrews across the Firth of Tay didn't faze  
him. Neither did the conditions that threaten to make the British 
Open course as cruel as it is long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' Woods said. ``I've always loved it. I grew up in  
Southern California where we had good weather every day. So it is 
always a challenge to play in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elements were back in play Tuesday, leaving the warm  
sunshine that greeted the start of the week as nothing more than a 
distant memory and reminding players of just how tough Carnoustie 
promises to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods could be excused for his optimism; he had played only four  
holes the day earlier and hadn't yet seen the course at its full 
7,361-yard self. 
</P>
<P>
	Others had, though, and it wasn't always a pretty sight.  
</P>
<P>
	With fairways that seem the width of cart paths, deep rough and  
long, long par-4s, Carnoustie would be tough under the best weather 
conditions. And seaside British Opens are rarely played in the best 
weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest course I've ever played,'' Bernhard Langer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make us look foolish if the wind blows real  
hard,'' said U.S. Open winner Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what happened in the third round last year at  
Royal Birkdale, when Brian Watts was the only one to break par and 
Woods shot himself out of serious contention with a 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkdale could pale in comparison, though, to a nasty day on the  
thin fairways of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might as well stick red hazard posts down the fairways,''  
Phil Mickelson said. ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as 
that for a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when the U.S. Open was played with little rough, the  
British Open more than makes up for it with tall, spindly grass 
that seems to grow out of everywhere on the links course. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the fairway is crucial. The problem, the course plays so  
long that most players will be forced to hit drivers off the tee on 
most par-4s. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Woods and a few others will have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will be able to hit say a 2-iron or 3-wood off the tee just  
as far as some of the guys can hit their drivers,'' Woods said. ``I 
believe that is a tremendous advantage in any tournament, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three of his last four tournaments and was in  
contention coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open, is the 
favorite of British oddsmakers to win his first major since the 
1997 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	His swing has evolved in the last year and he is playing with  
more consistency and patience. And, he learned a few things from 
Birkdale last year about the wind that may serve him well here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing, yes, but I learned I needed to control  
my ball flight a little more and be more efficient at it,'' Woods 
said. ``I needed to learn how to putt in the wind a little better, 
different techniques used in the wind. These are things you have to 
learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is back in the Open rotation for the first time since  
Tom Watson beat Jack Newton in an 18-hole playoff in 1975 to win 
the first of his five British Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The course is longer now and the fairways tighter. Bunkers were  
mostly all redone, and one was added on No. 6 to keep players from 
carving shots like Ben Hogan hit on the par-5 in 1953 on his way to 
a win there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the wind they are predicting for Thursday, you might

the field right away to the point where you have 10 or 15 players

<HEADLINE> Guerini Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	L'ALPE D'HUEZ, France (AP) -- Italy's Giuseppe Guerini survived a  
last-minute collision with a photo-snapping spectator to win 
today's 10th stage of the Tour de France, while Lance Armstrong 
kept the yellow jersey and widened his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On the race's second day in the Alps, Guerini was holding a  
narrow lead with less than a mile to go when he crashed head on 
with the over-enthusiastic fan, who was standing in the middle of 
the road with his camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerini fell to the ground. The spectator picked him up and  
pushed him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Tonkov of Russia was second, 21 seconds behind. Spain's  
Fernando Escartin finished third for the second day in a row and 
Alex Zulle of Switzerland was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, I went from the most beautiful moment of my life to  
the worst,'' a grinning Guerini said. ``I thought I'd lost the 
race. But I saw I had a few seconds advantage over the others, so I 
went flat out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was too shocked to say anything to the spectator, and  
then had problems getting his foot back into his pedal. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished fifth but held the overall lead, widening it  
to seven minutes and 42 seconds over Spain's Abraham Olano. Zulle 
is in third place overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only objective today was to hold onto the yellow jersey,''  
Armstrong said on French television. ``The others were strong 
today: Guerini, Zulle. I was tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour headed back into France today after an overnight stop  
in Italy. The rain, which hampered racing the day before, stopped 
shortly before the start. Weathers conditions were good, with a 
cool breeze and thick cloud cover for much of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The race began with a tough climb to the super-category  
6,874-foot Col du Mont-Cenis, where the pack remained bunched. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the way down, two French riders -- Stephane Heulot and  
Thierry Bourgignon -- mounted the first breakaway of the day, and 
soon held a nine-minute lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Riders then climbed the Col de la Croix de Fer, or Iron Cross  
Pass, at a similar altitude, the longest climb on the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Heulot almost became a local hero -- by winning on Bastille Day --  
but he finally caved in on the punishing 21 hairpins on the Alpe 
d'Huez. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Armstrong silenced the critics who say he is not at  
his best in the mountains. He won the ninth stage to tighten his 
grip on cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan, making an astonishing recovery from  
testicular cancer, showed he is the man to beat. Not known as a top 
climber, he persevered on the punishing, rain-slicked slopes of the 
Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	His performance is all the more remarkable considering his  
cancer once spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable what he's doing,'' said American great Greg  
LeMond, a three-time Tour winner. ``I think he's even better than 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling authorities are trying to show they are being alert  
about the problem of doping, which nearly destroyed the event last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	At dawn today, the International Cycling Union carried out blood  
tests on 51 riders on 10 teams. Tour de France President Jean-Marie 
Leblanc said in a statement that all the cyclists were declared 
eligible to continue the race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time the UCI has ordered blood tests, the  
first coming before the prologue July 3.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticized for Teachers Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Math and science students whose teachers hold  
``emergency'' credentials do no worse on tests than students whose 
teachers are fully certified, all else being equal, say researchers 
critical of plans by President Clinton and some states to end such 
hires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is the last remaining field in America where people  
think you can boost quality by tightening the rules and multiplying 
the regulations,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the 
Thomas Fordham Foundation, a privately run school-reform research 
organization. The foundation on Wednesday released a collection of 
reports criticizing a slate of teacher hiring, training, and 
evaluation trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say students whose teachers have any kind of  
certification (standard, emergency or alternative) outperform 
students whose teachers have no certification or are certified in a 
different subject. Students whose teachers possess a bachelor's or 
master's degree in math outperform other students in math, they 
said, regardless of the teacher's certification. ``This result 
should cast doubt on assertions that standard certification should 
be required of all teachers,'' the reports concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 44 states require teachers to pass a test to earn a  
license. But the tests, which vary, grant teachers credentials 
based on a range of measures from basic skills to knowledge of a 
specific subject to teaching performance. States often fill 
classroom shortages by allowing teachers to use emergency 
certificates or alternatives. The Education Department is spending 
$1 million to study how states license teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn, a former Reagan administration Education Department  
official, said teacher hiring should be left to local school 
leaders, which he said contradicts the Clinton proposal, outlined 
in this year's State of the Union Address, to make states and 
school districts phase out emergency-certified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports say teachers have weak verbal and math skills and  
not nearly enough have a college major or minor in the subjects 
they teach. But even some standard state credentials fall short of 
putting better teachers in the classroom, they said. In California, 
Ohio, New York, and Minnesota, approved preparation programs tend 
to have very low entry requirements, no exit requirements and low 
subject content, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Licensure isn't a regulatory intrusion; it's a standard to  
protect children,'' said Bob Chase, president of the National 
Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union. ``It is 
critical for teachers to know the subject matter and content of 
what they are teaching -- and it is equally critical for them to 
understand how the brain works, how to instruct children with 
different skill levels, and how to keep a classroom full of kids in 
their seats so they can share their content knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the reports say, states such as Pennsylvania can  
maintain strong alternative certification programs while raising 
academic standards for teachers. Teachers there must take more 
academic courses and fewer education courses, and pass licensure 
exams with higher scores, but college graduates who pass the exams 
may teach under the mentorship of a principal or master teacher 
without attending a school of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education interest groups have pushed misguided regulatory  
schemes that will make it even harder for our public schools to 
attract strong teachers into their ranks,'' said Finn. 
</P>
<P>
	Also criticized is a Clinton-backed national program to  
credential ``master'' teachers. Danielle Dunne Wilcox, a researcher 
at Columbia University, says in her report there's no evidence that 
teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching 
Standards are superior to other teachers. Clinton, who wants to 
give the voluntary program another $18.5 million this year, has 
long sparred with congressional Republicans, who see this as a step 
toward mandatory national testing and a departure from local 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fordham report also takes on traditional teachers' colleges.  
Economists Dale Ballou and Michael Podgursky attack the oft-quoted 
analogy comparing education and medicine; if doctors can't treat 
patients without attending medical schools, why let teachers into 
classrooms without first sending them through education school? 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and education leaders who agree with their  
conclusions suggested alternatives that include: giving would-be 
teachers more access and fewer hurdles, allowing key personnel 
decisions to be made by schools, and judging teachers primarily by 
gains in student learning.

<HEADLINE> Stocks turn Lower; Dow Down 43.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower as concerns about economic  
and political uncertainty overseas outweighed news of strong 
earnings and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 43.70 at 1,1131.32, adding to its 26-point drop on Tuesday. 
The Dow had been up as much as 34 points in early trading today 
before retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also mostly lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell as some investors took profits on the market's  
recent record-setting rise, which lifted the Dow to a new high on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also were hurt down by lingering concerns about Latin  
America's economic situation. The nervousness was set off Monday by 
comments from Argentina's presidential candidates, who hinted at a 
possible moratorium on repayment of the country's debt. That raised 
concerns on Wall Street that U.S. financial services companies 
would suffer losses because of unpaid loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plain and simple, the market turned a blind eye to the Latin  
American situation over the last seven or eight months,'' said 
Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
``Argentina has served as a reminder that they need to watch the 
situation in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were also increasing concern about political tensions in  
Asia after the Chinese government accused Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui of embarking on a doomed attempt to split his island from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rose after the Labor Department reported the  
Producer Price Index -- which measures inflation pressures before 
they reach the consumer -- fell a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent 
in June, the first decline in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose just  
0.1 percent in June, a big slowdown from the May increase of 1.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports helped ease worries about a potential breakout of  
inflation, which could cause the Fed to raise rates again this year 
to slow U.S. economic growth and keep inflation contained. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stocks rose on positive earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Computer chip maker Intel reported late Tuesday its  
second-quarter earnings jumped 49 percent and the company said it 
expects a strong second half of this year. Intel was up 1 5/16 at 
66 11/16, the most active stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.26 at 1,389.30, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.62 at 2,780.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 329.37 million 
shares, down from 356.50 million shares on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.46 at 652.18, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.13 at 810.20.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Open $517 Million Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Finally, Seattle Mariners fans will get to see  
green grass and blue skies. And when the skies turn sodden, they 
get to watch the roof close over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field, a $517.6 million project featuring a retractable  
roof, kicks off a new era of major league baseball in the Pacific 
Northwest on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching their team play inside for 22 1/2 seasons in the  
tomblike and dingy Kingdome, the Mariners will begin play in their 
new home next to Puget Sound's Elliott Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four home games, including Thursday night's opener  
against the San Diego Padres, are sold out, and tickets for the 
other four games of the first homestand are selling fast. 
</P>
<P>
	When the roof is open, as it's expected to be this week, fans  
can view Seattle's scenic skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof was open for the Mariners' workout Wednesday afternoon,  
and Ken Griffey Jr. peppered home runs to all parts of the 
ballpark. Looking tired after playing in Tuesday night's All-Star 
game in Boston, Griffey waved off reporters who attempted to ask 
him questions about his new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Airplanes flew overhead and trains rumbled along the nearby  
tracks. This time, unlike in the Kingdome, there was no insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of loud,'' Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martinez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the Mariners will have a home field of  
grass, not AstroTurf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awesome place,'' said left-hander Jamie Moyer,  
Thursday night's scheduled starter. ``What an amazing place to be a 
part of. It's phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a difference from here and where we played,'' manager Lou  
Piniella said. ``I'll tell you what, when this place gets full, 
there's going to be excitement here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Griffey and the team's other sluggers will miss the  
carry and relatively short fences of the Kingdome is another story. 
</P>
<P>
	The park has bigger dimensions than the cozy Kingdome and the  
move across the street is expected to cut the Mariners' prolific 
home run numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inside the gaps, it's big,'' Martinez said. ``Plus, the ball  
doesn't travel that well. Left field and right field are OK, but 
the gaps are hard to hit them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the increased fan interest could provide the revenue to  
help keep Griffey and Alex Rodriguez in Seattle when they become 
free agents after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners feel they've got a 47,000-seat home now to match  
other recently built stadiums: Camden Yards in Baltimore, Coors 
Field in Denver, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Bank One Ballpark in 
Phoenix and The Ballpark in Arlington, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can pitch in the Kingdome and survive, I can pitch  
anywhere,'' Moyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium is drawing rave reviews. The fans like its features  
and the fact that they won't have to watch baseball indoors 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium's features range from excellent sight lines to its  
concession stands and large number of toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new stadium does comes with controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Some local fans and officials feel the Mariners' owners are  
trying to renege on their deal with taxpayers, trying for more tax 
revenue to cover $100 million in cost overruns on the ballpark, of 
which $379 million was covered by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-game series with the Padres, the Mariners will  
face the Arizona Diamondbacks and Randy Johnson, who is scheduled 
to pitch on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was an American League Cy Young Award winner, a 20-game  
winner and the author of a no-hitter for the Mariners before he was 
traded to Houston last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners will open at Safeco Field with a five-game losing  
streak and a team ERA of 6.02. They're three games under .500 and 
in third place in the AL West, six games behind first-place Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Could the new park raise morale?  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like being indoors all day,'' third baseman Russ  
Davis said. ``This is a beautiful part of the country and you 
should be able to enjoy the weather. I think the fans are going to 
enjoy it a lot more, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle had an outdoor park for its first major league team, the  
1969 Seattle Pilots, but Sicks Stadium was strictly a minor league 
ballpark. The team moved to Milwaukee to become the Brewers the 
following season.

<HEADLINE> US Military Conducts Huge Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- The Pentagon is finishing what is believed  
to be the largest-ever simultaneous test of computer systems to 
make sure Year 2000 problems won't prevent delivery to the troops 
of everything from bullets to toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said Tuesday it had identified, and quickly fixed,  
three minor glitches in its enormously complex computerized 
logistics network. The weeklong test was expected to conclude 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical experts built a duplicate network -- what they called a  
``parallel processing environment'' -- then rolled those computer 
clocks forward to simulate the week following Feb. 28, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is the ultimate in testing,'' said John  
Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Year 2000 commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department needs to watch how its systems behaved  
during the date rollover from 1999 to 2000, and it needs to make 
sure computers will recognize the next leap year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Goldstein, the department's director of logistics  
information systems, said the test will prevent officers on the 
battlefield from neglecting to request extra ammunition ``because 
your computer systems have the wrong date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test involved 44 military computer systems and more than  
1,000 people in 22 locations, including five Navy ships. None of 
the computers being tested this week was closer than 50 miles to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't take our systems offline to do a Y2K test,''  
Goldstein said. He compared the test to those being run by private 
corporations but added, ``If we don't do our job, our customers can 
be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Nyere, a consultant who coordinated the test, said it found  
only three minor problems. In two cases, the year on some supply 
requests incorrectly advanced from ``99'' to ``100'' instead of to 
``00,'' and in another instance, a system failed to recognize Feb. 
29, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyere called those problems ``easy to fix.''  
</P>
<P>
	The computer network being tested is a duplicate of the  
Pentagon's genuine supply system except for the volume of requests 
running across it, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software tools will simulate the enormous number of those  
requests -- roughly 2.5 billion annually -- to look for bottlenecks 
on the network that might have been caused inadvertently by Y2K 
repair efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to helping to identify potential problems, the test  
was also an important public-relations opportunity for the Defense 
Department, which invited reporters and TV camera crews to watch 
from the offices of a major defense contractor in northern 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials repeatedly stressed Tuesday that the test  
results show America's military will be prepared for battle even 
after Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has been sharply criticized over the pace of its  
computer repairs. A report last month from the Office of Management 
and Budget said 264 of the department's 2,096 most important 
computer systems still were not compliant -- more left to repair 
than any other federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And Congress' General Accounting Office said last week that  
Defense experts ``face significant problems'' and the department 
was ``far from successfully finishing its various Year 2000 
end-to-end test activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB said the Defense Department alone will spend $3.65  
billion on Y2K repairs, almost half the estimated $8 billion cost 
to the entire federal government.

<HEADLINE> Judge Your Garden by Its Worms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Many of us are mean to worms. We impale  
them on hooks to lure fish (to whom we're also cruel). And we make 
the worm a synonym for low and contemptible. But in our gardening 
lives, the soil-enriching worm rides high in esteem. 
</P>
<P>
	In my long-ago boyhood, I first got to know worms as the night  
crawlers we'd go looking for with flashlights on dewy lawns and 
drop them into bait cans. I likely couldn't have cared less to 
learn that their presence indicated soil fertility. 
</P>
<P>
	But when I grew up to garden I learned the earthworm had been  
celebrated from antiquity for its role in agriculture. Cleopatra 
made them sacred in 50 B.C. And big minds like Charles Darwin 
studied them minutely for their capacity to aerate and irrigate the 
soil and to carry nutrients from the surface to the roots of 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The worm has been called ``the gardener's unpaid helper.''  
</P>
<P>
	In my own garden, worms became a striking fertility indicator  
years ago when I began heavy mulching with dead leaves. I found the 
worm population multiplying dramatically as the leaves decomposed 
and the soil became a rich deep brown 
</P>
<P>
	Just to sink a spading fork lightly into this soil uncovers an  
eyeful of wriggling worms. And the castings -- or manure -- 
contributed by the worms themselves make up one of the richest of 
fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Worms are toothless, but their mouth muscles are strong. They  
drag leaves into their burrows and munch on them bits at a time. 
They also ingest soil and extract nutrients from it. Their 
incessant burrowing forms channels through which roots gets 
minerals and moisture from the subsoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthworms show up everywhere on Earth except in the coldest  
northern and southern latitudes. With its glacier background, 
Canada, for example, had none or few native earthworms; they 
eventually were brought in by early settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	They may be tiny or as long as several feet. Besides night  
crawlers, they're known in America as orchard worms, angle worms, 
field worms, rain worms and brandlings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other worms the gardener can do without, like the cutworm,  
which zaps seedlings, or the cabbage worm, which bores holes in 
cabbage leaves, or the dreadful-looking tomato hornworm, which 
feeds voraciously on tomato leaves and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're not satisfied with the number of earthworms in your  
garden, you can buy some or breed your own. The easiest way to do 
this is to put some worms into a wooden box known as a ``culture 
box'' filled with a wetted mixture of topsoil, ground peat moss, 
crumbled manure, cornmeal and coffee grounds. An excellent 
step-by-step account of this process is contained in Rodale's 
Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening, available in libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people raise worms for profit, selling them for bait as  
well as for gardening and agriculture. There are big worm farms in 
Washington, Oregon, California and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	I found the lore of the worm exciting. For example:  
</P>
<P>
	-- It can move a stone 50 times its own weight.  
</P>
<P>
	-- It can operate 12 feet below ground as well as the near the  
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Its predators include snakes, birds, moles, toads, beetles,  
centipedes, leeches, slugs. Even foxes eat them. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Some earthworms may live as long as eight years. They lose  
weight as they near the end of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In one day they can eat material up to one-third of their own  
body weight. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Their slimy look and feel come from the mucus they coat  
themselves with to lubricate their way through the soil. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  NASCAR Rookie Sees Error of Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Stewart's worst injury in his rookie season has been to his  
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he hopes the embarrassment he caused for himself by  
refusing to talk after a difficult loss in the Jiffy Lube 300 will 
quickly subside. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get that close to a major goal and something happens  
that's beyond your control, it's disappointing,'' he said Tuesday. 
``I just hope everybody is big enough not to be too upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upset was the best way to mildly describe Stewart after he ran  
out of gas on the 298th lap Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly gave people an article for Monday,'' he said,  
trying to make light of his snub of the media, a rarity in NASCAR -- 
where all drivers are expected to talk regardless of their standing 
in a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, perhaps the best rookie of the last two decades,  
dominated this one. But all he had to show for it was a 10th-place 
finish to a race he should have won. 
</P>
<P>
	A bad miscalculation on fuel consumption and perhaps some hard  
driving when a lighter touch was needed precluded him from getting 
his first career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I hadn't run out of there,'' Stewart said. ``I was so  
consumed with emotion after the race was over that I just didn't do 
the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart admits he has been testy with the media at times,  
particularly photographers. Last month at Pocono International 
Raceway he complained that an Associated Press photographer was 
taking too much time to set up a shot. The photographer said it 
took less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he didn't realize the seriousness of his actions  
Sunday until he was on the plane back to Charlotte, N.C. But by 
that time, it was too late for the former Indy Racing League 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's paying the price, with the media taking him to task for  
failing to stick around to explain his part in handing Jeff Burton 
his third straight victory in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken some grief over this, and I deserve it,'' Stewart  
said. ``I know I have to deal with the good days and the bad, and I 
just hope people will see the big picture, that sometimes you do or 
say things in the heat of battle that you wish you could take 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart knows he'll probably be asked about the snub at the next  
stop on the schedule, the Pennsylvania 500 on July 25. He will be 
ready to deal with it and the question of when he'll break through 
for the first of what most figure will be many victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't bother me,'' said Stewart, who most of the time  
as a rookie has been laid back and an easy interview. ``If you're 
in contention all the time, it'll come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the talent Stewart first displayed as a terror of the  
USAC short-track circuit and his 1997 IRL title, he is surprised to 
be sixth in points halfway through his first Winston Cup season. 
Jody Ridley, who finished seventh in 1980, is the only rookie ever 
to finish in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the competitiveness of the circuit, few figured  
Stewart would be much more than a middle-of-the-pack racer in his 
first season -- the driver included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have considered 20th to be a successful season,''  
Stewart said. ``I still would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the crashes and breakdowns expected of rookies haven't  
happened. He runs among the top five virtually every week, and has 
earned immense respect as a racer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Stewart is great,'' said Hall of Famer driver Buddy  
Baker, now a commentator for CBS, TBS and ESPN. ``He's also the 
bravest racer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Stewart is aware of what's being said about his  
ability, but doesn't want to lose perspective. Despite his meteoric 
rise, he still thinks of himself as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain lack of knowledge,'' he said. ``I still have  
some things to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What time to leave the track probably is no longer one of them.

<HEADLINE> Tick-Borne Illness Now in Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have for the first time detected in humans a certain  
tick-borne bacterial infection that was thought to sicken only 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gives no evidence to suggest that man's best friend is  
spreading the potentially deadly disease to people directly, 
through a bite or a lick. Instead, the researchers said ticks are 
biting both humans and dogs, and may be jumping from dog to master 
in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors found four human cases of the infection, all in  
Missouri, between 1996 and 1998, and four more cases during this 
tick season in Missouri, Tennessee and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, examined a little-known, yet emerging disease called 
ehrlichiosis, which is similar to Lyme disease. Both diseases are 
transmitted by ticks and exist primarily in New England and the 
upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Two forms of ehrlichiosis have previously been documented in  
people since 1986, when the disease was first found in the United 
States. Since then, approximately 1,200 cases have been reported, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was the first time researchers found cases of the type  
of ehrlichiosis that previously had been identified only in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter which form of bacteria causes the infection, an  
antibiotic can essentially cure it, both in humans and dogs. In the 
study, all four patients from 1996-98 were treated successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease have some symptoms in common --  
headache, nausea, chills, fever, malaise and fatigue -- but 
typically, ehrlichiosis doesn't usually come with a rash and can be 
fatal if left untreated. Up to 5 percent of cases result in death. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a much more acute and rapidly progressing disease that  
can be much more serious because it can be fatal in the most severe 
cases,'' said study co-author Dr. Gregory A. Storch of the St. 
Louis Children's Hospital. ``Lyme disease is not fatal. It can 
become chronic and can produce some significant and annoying 
manifestations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christopher Paddock of the CDC stressed that ehrlichiosis  
can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aware that if you're out in areas where there are ticks,  
and this can be hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, you should 
always check yourself and remove any crawling or attached ticks as 
quickly as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> McKesson HBOC Restates Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After months of turmoil and a shakeup in  
top-level management, McKesson HBOC Inc. on Wednesday revised 
downward its income for the past three fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
	The restatement reduced the company's net income Wednesday by  
$152.2 million or 53 cents per share for the fiscal year ended 
March 31, 1999, $25.8 million and 9 cents for 1998, and $13.5 
million and 5 cents per share for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment follows an exhaustive audit of HBOC's accounting  
for the past three years, which were suspected to be in error 
because of improperly reported software sales. McKesson, a major 
wholesaler of drugs and medical supplies, acquired HBOC in January. 
HBOC, a medical software company, is now known as Healthcare 
Information Technology Business, or ITB. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's board of directors last month fired Chairman Charles  
W. McCall, who was seen as most responsible for the incorrect 
earnings statements. McCall was chairman of HBO &AMP; Co. before 
McKesson bought it. Mark A. Pulido, president and chief executive 
of the merged company, and Chief Financial Officer Richard H. 
Hawkins were allowed to resign effective July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for fiscal year 1999 was $84.9 million and earnings  
were 31 cents per share on revised revenues of $30.4 billion 
compared to net income of $304.6 million and earnings of $1.10 per 
share on revised revenues of $22.4 billion for the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for fiscal year 1997 was $212.1 million and revised  
earnings were 80 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the disclosures today, and our commitment to new  
procedures and policies that aim to prevent this from happening 
again at McKessonHBOC, we can begin the process of rebuilding our 
relationships with investors and restoring credibility with the 
financial community, customers and employees,'' said John H. 
Hammergren and David L. Mahoney, newly named co-chief executive 
officers at McKesson HBOC, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of slowed growth in ITB's revenues, which the company  
attributed to an industrywide slowdown, McKesson HBOC warned its 
earnings for the first quarter ended June 30, 1999 will fall 
substantially short of a First Call survey of analysts projection 
of 49 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson HBOC also said Wednesday the U.S. Attorney's Office for  
the Northern District of California and the San Francisco District 
Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun 
investigations in connection with the earnings restatements. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson HBOC fell nearly 50 percent when it announced  
on April 28 it would have to restate some of its earnings reports. 
McKesson has been unable to recover. On Wednesday, shares of the 
San Francisco-based company fell $2.06 1/4 to $31 a share in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange, well off their 52-week high of 
$89.75.

<HEADLINE> Postal Service $1B in Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The post office is $1 billion in the black  
three-fourths of the way through its fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	With that cushion, the agency should finish the year close to  
its planned $200 million profit, reports Richard M. Porras, chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs traditionally outrun income in the fourth quarter for the  
agency. Last year the post office was $900 million in the red for 
the last three months of its fiscal year, which ends in September, 
spokesman Norm Scherstrom said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the third quarter, May 21, the Postal Service had  
expenses of $43.1 billion and income of $44.2 billion for a net of 
$1.062 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office raised the price of stamps a penny to 33 cents  
in January in anticipation of rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the post office reported that 94 percent of local  
mail was delivered on time in the spring quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On-time delivery was measured through a series of test letters  
sent by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in 465 ZIP codes 
covering about 80 percent of First Class mail delivery. The company 
measured the percentage of letters delivered overnight in 85 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Top performers at 96 percent were Billings, Mont.; Omaha, Neb.;  
Wichita, Kan.; Sioux Falls, S.D. and Springfield, Mass.

surgery for a broken wrist on Friday in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A review of his original X-rays following continued swelling  
on his left wrist led doctors to determine he does have a fracture 
of a small bone in his left wrist,'' Mercy spokesman Joe Wade Plunk 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be released from Mercy Hospital in the morning. But he  
is going in for surgery Friday at Methodist Hospital in 
Indianapolis,'' Plunk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, who transferred to Arizona after last season, severely  
lacerated his left ear in the three-vehicle accident Saturday night 
that killed the driver of the car Recker was in. Recker's 
girlfriend, Kelly Craig, 19, and her brother, Jason Craig, 17, both 
of Jasper, Ind., were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk said Recker seemed in good spirits during a visit  
Wednesday, but ``his main concern is his girlfriend, who is in the 
hospital in Farmington, New Mexico. He more or less feels helpless 
to help her, and now he's going back to Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just so scared -- scared for my girlfriend and  
her brother,'' Recker told The Durango Herald on Wednesday. ``Once 
I get healthy and Kelly and Jason are healthy, I'll be anxious to 
get back on the court. But right now, it's not the most important 
thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Craig, who suffered a spinal fracture and partial  
paralysis, remained in serious condition at San Juan Regional 
Medical Center in Farmington, while Jason Craig remained critical 
with a head injury, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were injured in the accident near  
Durango, in southwestern Colorado. Recker was a passenger in a 
vehicle driven by John Hollberg, 23, of Senoia, Ga., who was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the pickup who allegedly caused the accident, Bob  
Hardwick, 21, of Durango, was being held on $50,000 bond for 
investigation of vehicular homicide, reckless driving, driving 
under the influence, careless driving resulting in bodily injury 
and vehicular assault.

<HEADLINE> Fraser To Be Thrashers' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers have players. Now, they  
have someone to coach them. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL expansion team called a news conference today to  
introduce Curt Fraser as their first coach, The Associated Press 
learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, who led Orlando to the International Hockey League  
finals twice in the last four years, was chosen from a short list 
that also included former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan and ex-Edmonton 
coach Ron Low. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of Fraser was confirmed by a source close to the  
team, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of the 41-year-old Fraser was not a surprise.  
During his first two seasons in Orlando, the Solar Bears' general 
manager was Don Waddell, who now holds the same post with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of a coach was Waddell's last major move before the  
inaugural season begins in October. The team selected its players 
last month in expansion and entry drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell and Fraser produced an IHL expansion team that reached  
the Turner Cup finals in 1995-96. The Solar Bears were swept by 
Utah in the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando returned to the finals this season after becoming the  
first team in IHL history to overcome a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 
series. After rallying to beat Detroit for the Eastern Conference 
title, the Solar Bears lost a seven-game series to Houston for the 
league championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser had a record of 192-111-25 in Orlando, the league's  
second-best mark during that four-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers announced an agreement in February to use Orlando  
as their top minor league team and will probably conduct part of 
their first training camp in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Solar Bears, Fraser spent four seasons with  
the IHL's Milwaukee Admirals -- two as an assistant, two as coach -- 
and one season as coach of the American Hockey League's Syracuse 
Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser had a 12-year playing career in the NHL after being  
drafted in the second round by Vancouver in 1978. The left-winger 
scored 193 goals and racked up 1,306 penalty minutes during a 
career that also included stints with Chicago and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Mixed in Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The benchmark Tokyo stock index fell slightly  
Thursday morning on profit-taking in the high-technology sector. 
The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 64.23 points, or 0.35  
percent, to 18,293.63 points at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the average gained 176.77 points, or 0.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.61 yen, down 0.51 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo but marginally above its late New York level of 120.59 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors locked in profits following the  
market's recent high-technology share rally. Concerns about the 
rapid rate of the recent share price increases were also capping 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buying centered on high-technology shares from the opening,  
but the rally peaked at about 10 a.m. on profit-taking,'' said 
Kazuhiro Nomura, head of trading at Paribas Capital Markets. 
``There is also some strong concern that values are too high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High-technology issues got an early boost after the  
technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 39.91, or 1.4 percent, 
to end at 2,818.14 in New York on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer chipmaker Intel Corp.'s forecast that its profit  
margins would expand in the second half of this year lifted the 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 4.62 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,501.69. The 
TOPIX closed up 13.38 points, or 0.90 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher from its level in  
New York on fears of more intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs,  
Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters Thursday morning that his ministry 
is ``always prepared to take proper actions in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has sold yen and bought dollars several times  
in recent weeks in order to keep export prices low and help sustain 
the country's fragile economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.22 yen, down  
from 123.34 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6300 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6600 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.48 yen from 101.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Is Clue To Appetite Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have moved closer to discovering how an  
appetite-stimulating hormone works in the brain, a finding that may 
help them develop drugs to fight obesity and eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers knew melanin-concentrating hormone is one of many  
compounds that control how much someone eats. They also knew MCH 
needs a place to attach itself in the brain, called a receptor. 
Until now, they had not located it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,  
two groups working separately identified the receptor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it an exciting discovery because it opens a new  
hope for the treatment of food-consumption disorders,'' said 
Olivier Civelli, head of one of the groups, at the University of 
California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group is at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals in  
England. It has already started the search for compounds to block 
MCH from binding to the receptor. Scientists hope that would curb a 
person's appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a drug is found, it will be at least a decade before it  
reaches the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The body produces several compounds in the brain that control  
appetite, and scientists don't know how big a role MCH plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we would argue that it's more important than the  
others,'' said Shelagh Wilson, SmithKline's associate director of 
vascular biology. ``Yes, it may be one small part, but it may be 
the one small part that actually tips the balance and works for an 
obese patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection was identified by trial-and-error: matching all  
of the compounds produced by the brain to a previously identified 
receptor whose purpose was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests that MCH may play a role in other forms  
of behavior, said Gary Schwartz, a Johns Hopkins University 
professor who was not involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The receptor to which MCH hitches appears in many regions of the  
brain, not just those controlling appetite. So MCH could also 
affect movement, grooming and other activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Whipped Cream in Can Inventor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reddi-wip founder Aaron ``Bunny'' Lapin, who  
put whipped cream in a spray can, has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin, who had homes in New York City, Miami and Los Angeles,  
died Saturday of heart failure at a Los Angeles hospital, Hillside 
Memorial Park said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Reddi-wip was first sold in 1948 by St. Louis milkmen.  
Distribution quickly expanded throughout the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	One out of every two cans of aerosol topping now purchased in  
the United States each year is Reddi-wip. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to packaging Reddi-wip, Lapin's Clayton Corp. made  
and sold its own valves for the whipped cream enterprise. Clayton 
was one of the first companies to put shaving cream in an aerosol 
can, but Lapin decided not to market the product because he didn't 
want to compete with shaving cream makers who might buy his valves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton and its subsidiaries make industrial valves and  
closures, caulk, adhesives and foamed plastic products such as 
insulation and cushioning materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Louis on Jan. 5, 1914, Lapin was educated at the  
University of Missouri and attended Washington University School of 
Law in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin lost control of Clayton and sold his interest in  
Reddi-wip, which is now made by Beatrice Foods Inc. in Waukesha, 
Wis. Beatrice is a subsidiary of ConAgra, the Omaha, Neb.-based 
food maker.

<HEADLINE> 57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A majority of major league umpires, looking  
to take the first step in a labor confrontation with owners, said 
they would resign Sept. 2 and not work the final 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced following a sometimes raucous meeting of  
the Major League Umpires Association at a Philadelphia hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been angry since NL president Len Coleman said on  
July 2 he was suspending umpire Tom Hallion for three days for 
bumping a player, the first suspension of an umpire for on-field 
conduct that baseball officials can remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tension is much greater than it's ever been,'' umpires'  
union head Richie Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a labor contract that runs through this season,  
and bars strikes, so the resignations are an attempt to get around 
that. Phillips said 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven umpires will announce their resignations in the next few  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the 57 umpires attending the meeting originally  
voted to go on strike immediately before changing their vote to 
instead resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' Phillips said. ``We wanted to come here to address 
those grievances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners were taken by surprise with the decision, which came one  
day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1985 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Roberto Alomar  
was suspended for just five games for spitting at umpire John 
Hirschbeck. When umpires attempted to strike the postseason, owners 
obtained an injunction in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that the union would not urge a strike in light of  
the collective bargaining agreement and in the interest of the fans 
so the season could go on in an uninterrupted fashion,'' Phillips 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of the umpires' repeated threats, seem to have  
adopted an attitude that they are replaceable. Phillips has attempt 
to organize minor league umpires in recent months, and if a 
replacements were needed, owners could hire college and high school 
umpires, as they did in previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires would form a new corporation on Sept. 3,  
and said the AL and NL would have to contract for umpires' services 
with the new body, and that umpires would supervise themselves and 
make their own schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the umpires' current contract calls for resigning  
umpires to collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most 
senior umpires would get $400,000 under the severance pay; baseball 
would have until early January to pay the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires  
from the leagues to the commissioner's office. He originally wanted 
to make the shift before this season, but was blocked by Phillips, 
who demanded severance pay if the leagues were no longer the 
umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is in a state of chaos,' Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Woman's Deportation Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court blocked the deportation  
of an African woman who sought asylum out of fear her tribe would 
mutilate her genitals or kill her for losing her virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Adelaide  
Abankwah's fears were credible and that U.S. immigration officials 
should not have denied her request. The case now returns to the 
Board of Immigration Appeals, which is expected to issue a ruling 
in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah, 29, was detained in New York in 1997 after fleeing  
her 400-member tribe in Ghana. She told immigration officials that 
she feared village leaders would order her genitals mutilated or 
kill her because she had lost her virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigration judge denied her request for asylum, saying her  
testimony was not detailed enough. But the appeals court said her 
claims were ``compelling in light of the general conditions present 
in Ghana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted that although Ghana outlawed genital mutilation  
in 1994, there have been only seven arrests since then and Ghanaian 
women continue to be forced to undergo the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah's lawyer, Jonathan Rauchway, said he will petition  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to release her 
immediately. He said his client also hopes to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've sent her pictures of what New York City looks like -- the  
New York skyline, the Statue of Liberty, views of midtown and the 
World Trade Center. She was pretty amazed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends 1978 Campaign Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush says his claim of serving in the Air Force is legitimate, 
based on time he spent training and on alert while a member of the 
Texas Air National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his service as he arrived in Washington Tuesday  
night, Bush said, ``I don't want to get into a semantical 
discussion. ... I served 600 days active duty. I flew F-102 
fighters and I was proud of my service. ... The facts are I served 
600 days in the Air Force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner already has faced  
questions about whether he received preferential treatment when he 
joined the Guard during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his statements that he was in the Air Force are being  
examined. Bush started saying he had Air Force service a couple of 
decades ago in issue papers and ads during a congressional race he 
lost in West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A pullout ad from The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal of May 4, 1978,  
shows a huge picture of Bush with a ``Bush for Congress'' logo on 
the front. On the back, a synopsis of his career says he served 
``in the U.S. Air Force and the Texas Air National Guard where he 
piloted the F-102 aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether the literature was misleading, Bush  
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Tuesday that it was all ``accurate.'' 
She said that while Bush was attending flight school from November 
1968 to November 1969, he was considered to be on active duty for 
the U.S. Air Force. Several times when he was serving in the Guard, 
he was placed on alert and was considered to be on active duty as 
well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked 607 days of active duty service during the training  
and alerts, according to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Semantics probably are at the heart of the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says Air National Guard members are considered  
'guardsmen on active duty' while receiving pilot training. They get 
active-duty pay, which is more than their Guard pay, during pilot 
training. They are not, however, counted as members of the overall 
active-duty force. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, local bases say they don't really differentiate.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Teet, a spokesman at one of the bases where the Air Force  
teaches pilots to fly jets, said Guard and Reservist officers 
working to get their wings are considered part of the full-time 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Reservists and Guard going through training all the  
time, and they're considered active duty,'' Teet said from Laughlin 
Air Force Base at Del Rio, Texas. ``This is a 12 hour-a-day school 
and they would have to be considered active duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of his campaign, Bush's service in the Guard  
has been a contentious point for the former fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Political rival Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has joked that as a  
prisoner of war in North Vietnam he slept more soundly knowing that 
Bush was defending the shores of Texas from invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush hasn't been alone in defending Guard service. As  
running mate to Bush's father, former President Bush, Dan Quayle 
had to defend himself against charges that he joined the Indiana 
National Guard to avoid service in Vietnam. Quayle is now seeking 
the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bush campaign should be afforded the opportunity to  
explain in detail Governor Bush's military record and 
achievements,'' said Jonathan Baron, Quayle's spokesman. ``Mr. 
Quayle has always described his service as National Guard time. 
I've heard him say he served in the National Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Bush's military credibility has been questioned, so has the  
1995 sale of his Dallas house. 
</P>
<P>
	The home had a restrictive covenant that said the premises  
``shall be used for private dwelling purposes only and by white 
persons only, not excluding bona fide servants of any race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hughes said Bush had no idea the covenant existed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The governor did not know. The subject never came up,'' he  
said. ``The broker who was at the closing confirmed that it never 
came up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broker Steve Collins helped Bush sell the house and has helped  
sell about 20 others like it on the block. He said the subdivision 
of 52 homes was platted in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time there were restrictive covenants that prohibited  
minorities from living in the main dwelling,'' he said. ``These 
kind of restrictive covenants were not exclusive to this block. 
There are old deeds all over Dallas and I would say all over Texas 
and other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said the language was not included in the deed that Bush  
received when he bought the house in 1988, but in the platting 
documents, which homeowners rarely see. 
</P>
<P>
	To delete the wording, a homeowner would have to collect  
signatures from at least 75 percent of the subdivision's residents 
and go through a lengthy, cumbersome and potentially expensive 
process, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would someone volunteer for that when they don't need  
to?'' Collins said. ``You don't gain anything by doing it. They 
don't mean anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of how the plats read, the state's property code was  
modified on Jan. 1, 1984, to void restrictive covenants.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level dipped an  
unexpected 0.1 percent in June, the first decline in four months, 
while falling auto sales dramatically slowed the retail sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in the Producer Price Index -- which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer -- reflected 
retreating energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The modest 0.1 percent rise in retail sales, which accounts for  
one-third of total economic activity, reflected a 1 percent drop in 
sales of new cars, the biggest setback in this area since March. 
Sales rose 1.2 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the combination of an absence of inflationary  
pressures at the wholesale level and the sharp slowing in consumer 
demand should ease concerns at the Federal Reserve that a runaway 
economy will push inflation higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers are the types the Fed would be hoping for. They  
are suggesting there is a slowdown with absolutely no signs of 
inflation,'' said William Cheney, economist at John Hancock 
Financial Services in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials went on alert two months ago when prices at both  
the wholesale level and the retail level posted huge increases 
reflecting big hikes in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve increased a key interest rate for the first  
time in two years on June 30, but at the time the Fed indicated 
that the quarter-point raise might be all that was needed to slow 
the economy enough to keep inflation contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderation in wholesale prices, if matched at the retail  
level, will likely boost the confidence of Fed officials that they 
do not need to move quickly to raise interest rates and slow 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will report on consumer prices Thursday. Analysts  
are predicting a tiny increase of around 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, wholesale prices have  
been increasing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Wholesale prices 
had shown no increase at all for all of 1998, but that good 
performance reflected the impacts of the global financial crisis, 
which depressed demand and prices for many commodities including 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, energy prices rose at an  
annual rate of 13.5 percent, a sharp turnaround from a 9.1 percent 
rate of decline in the final six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But in both May and June, energy prices moderated after a huge,  
5.1 percent spurt in April. Energy prices dipped 0.3 percent in 
June, reflecting a 1.9 percent fall in gasoline prices. Gasoline 
costs had been down an even bigger 2.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	While rising demand during the summer driving season has pushed  
gasoline pump prices back up in recent weeks, analysts said they 
were not looking for further huge increases in the months ahead as 
supplies should remain plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs were up 0.4 percent at the wholesale level in June, a  
slight moderation after a 0.5 percent rise in May. Beef prices 
soared 8.2 percent in June, the biggest one-month jump since an 8.8 
percent increase in October 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The big increase in beef was offset somewhat by a 5.2 percent  
decline in pork prices, the biggest decrease in this category in 11 
months. Vegetable prices were up 14.5 percent with the gains led by 
big jumps in the price of cauliflower, tomatoes, broccoli and 
celery. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit prices, however, fell by 9.2 percent as the prices of  
peaches, blueberries, cantaloupes and citrus all declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core  
rate of inflation at the wholesale level fell 0.2 percent in June, 
the first decline since 0.2 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in the core rate of inflation reflected a big, 1.3  
percent fall in the price of passenger cars, the biggest reversal 
since January's 1.4 percent dip, and a 0.7 percent decline in the 
category that includes sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these gains reflected price changes in the finished-goods  
category. Even earlier in the production line, prices of 
intermediate goods were up 0.4 percent in June and prices of crude 
materials were up 1.4 percent, a significant moderation from a 5.5 
percent spurt in crude-material prices in May.

<HEADLINE> Former Deputy Charged in Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former sheriff's deputy has been charged in  
a colleague's 1985 slaying after DNA tests showed a match with 
genetic material the killer left near his victim. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant charges Ted Kirby, 54, with capital murder in  
sheriff's Sgt. George Arthur's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	A manhunt was under way for Kirby, who moved to Spokane, Wash.,  
in 1996 after retiring. Kirby's wife has told investigators she 
hasn't seen her husband since he left their Spokane home June 30. 
That was shortly after investigators contacted Kirby at his home 
and took a court-ordered saliva sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNA sample obtained from Ted Kirby was found to match the  
DNA sample left near the crime scene by the murderer,'' police 
Capt. Jim Tatreau said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby is considered armed and dangerous, said Spokane County  
sheriff's Deputy David Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives believe Kirby was lying in wait in Arthur's van when  
the sergeant left Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles the 
night of June 1, 1985, Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur was fatally shot after the van had traveled a few blocks.  
Witnesses described a bleeding man fleeing the wreck, and 
investigators were able to gather biological evidence from the 
scene, Tatreau said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Los Angeles police and sheriff's deputies reopened the  
case and reinterviewed witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives were looking into the possibility that Kirby and  
Arthur were involved with the same woman, the Los Angeles Times 
said, citing unidentified sources.

<HEADLINE> Girl Recovering After Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A girl who had half her brain removed to  
prevent the spread of a deadly neurological disease should be able 
to live a normal life, free of the seizures that plagued her, 
doctors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Ramirez, 15, was moving and able to murmur unintelligibly  
Wednesday after surgeons at Johns Hopkins Medical Center removed 
the left half of her brain Tuesday during a nine-hour operation. 
She was listed in fair condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln, Neb., girl suffered from Rasmussen's syndrome, a  
rare disease that eats away at the brain tissue. A hemispherectomy, 
removing the damaged half, is often the only means of eliminating 
the seizures caused by the syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was a risk she would lose her ability to speak.  
Doctors say it appears she will be OK, and that the right half of 
her brain should take over most of the functions lost by the 
removal of the left, including speech and fine motor movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that she will be able to speak and eventually  
live a quite normal life,'' said her surgeon, Dr. Benjamin Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's disease began with a limp in 1993, when she was 9. Two  
months later, she began to have seizures, often one every hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived most of my life with seizures,'' she said before  
the surgery. ``I'm tired of putting up with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said he expects Amber will be ready to begin  
rehabilitation within two weeks, and will be able to walk within a 
year. Rehabilitation could last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Sheri Ramirez, said the recovery shouldn't be a  
problem for Amber. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a determined kid.'' Ms. Ramirez said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  British Open Course Could Be Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Rain fell on the Carnoustie Golf  
Links and a breeze stiffened as Tiger Woods, fresh off a helicopter 
ride through the clouds, sat safely inside a tent off the 18th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from St. Andrews across the Firth of Tay didn't faze  
him. Neither did the conditions that threaten to make the British 
Open course as cruel as it is long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' Woods said. ``I've always loved it. I grew up in  
Southern California where we had good weather every day. So it is 
always a challenge to play in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elements were back in play Tuesday, leaving the warm  
sunshine that greeted the start of the week as nothing more than a 
distant memory and reminding players of just how tough Carnoustie 
promises to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods could be excused for his optimism; he had played only four  
holes the day earlier and hadn't yet seen the course at its full 
7,361-yard self. 
</P>
<P>
	Others had, though, and it wasn't always a pretty sight.  
</P>
<P>
	With fairways that seem the width of cart paths, deep rough and  
long, long par-4s, Carnoustie would be tough under the best weather 
conditions. And seaside British Opens are rarely played in the best 
weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest course I've ever played,'' Bernhard Langer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make us look foolish if the wind blows real  
hard,'' said U.S. Open winner Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what happened in the third round last year at  
Royal Birkdale, when Brian Watts was the only one to break par and 
Woods shot himself out of serious contention with a 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkdale could pale in comparison, though, to a nasty day on the  
thin fairways of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might as well stick red hazard posts down the fairways,''  
Phil Mickelson said. ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as 
that for a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when the U.S. Open was played with little rough, the  
British Open more than makes up for it with tall, spindly grass 
that seems to grow out of everywhere on the links course. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the fairway is crucial. The problem, the course plays so  
long that most players will be forced to hit drivers off the tee on 
most par-4s. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Woods and a few others will have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will be able to hit say a 2-iron or 3-wood off the tee just  
as far as some of the guys can hit their drivers,'' Woods said. ``I 
believe that is a tremendous advantage in any tournament, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three of his last four tournaments and was in  
contention coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open, is the 
favorite of British oddsmakers to win his first major since the 
1997 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	His swing has evolved in the last year and he is playing with  
more consistency and patience. And, he learned a few things from 
Birkdale last year about the wind that may serve him well here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing, yes, but I learned I needed to control  
my ball flight a little more and be more efficient at it,'' Woods 
said. ``I needed to learn how to putt in the wind a little better, 
different techniques used in the wind. These are things you have to 
learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is back in the Open rotation for the first time since  
Tom Watson beat Jack Newton in an 18-hole playoff in 1975 to win 
the first of his five British Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The course is longer now and the fairways tighter. Bunkers were  
mostly all redone, and one was added on No. 6 to keep players from 
carving shots like Ben Hogan hit on the par-5 in 1953 on his way to 
a win there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the wind they are predicting for Thursday, you might  
see some real tears out there,'' said Watson, who is back at the 
age of 49 but not a serious contender this time. ``It may separate 
the field right away to the point where you have 10 or 15 players 
who will win the tournament out of that first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be a winner, no matter how hard the wind blows or  
how high the scores go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can complain about it as much as we like or want, but the  
simple fact is that the golf course is going to be there,'' said 
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal. ``It is going to be the same 
for everybody and someone will win.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Current Account Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's broadest measure of trade declined 23.7  
percent in May, the Finance Ministry announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus in the current account decreased to a seasonally  
unadjusted $8.71 billion (1.054 trillion yen) from the same month 
last year, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,  
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the 
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against 
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fall, the figure was higher than the $7.38 billion  
(892.5 billion yen) estimate from Tokyo-based economists surveyed 
by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus had fallen 16.5 percent in April  
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus rose 17.6 percent in fiscal year 1998 to a record  
high of $127 billion (15.227 trillion yen) for the 12 months to 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record was $123 billion (15.033 trillion yen) set  
in fiscal 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge surplus has been a constant source of friction with the  
United States and other trading partners. They have been urging 
Japan to boost its economy to stimulate imports.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 26.92 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq composite  
index to a new closing high Wednesday as a tame inflation report 
and an upbeat outlook from Intel raised Wall Street's optimism 
about computers and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the record-setting pace didn't spill over to blue-chip  
stocks, which struggled through most of the day due to 
profit-taking and nervousness about economic and political 
uncertainty overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite rose 39.90 to 2,818.13, topping the record  
close it set last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.92 to 11,148.10, adding  
to its 26-point drop on Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 4.61 at 1,398.17. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech stocks rose on positive earnings news from chip maker  
Intel, which reported late Tuesday its second-quarter earnings 
jumped 49 percent and that it expects a strong second half of 1999. 
Intel rose 2 5/8 at 68 and was the most active stock in Nasdaq trading 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also got a lift from reports that fund  
managers at Fidelity Investments were putting money back into the 
tech sector. The mutual fund company had backed off such stocks 
since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-tech gainers included Amazon.com, up 8 7/8 to 135, Apple  
Computer, up 2 1/4 at 55 15/16 and Microsoft, up 1 5/16 at 94 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology stocks usually march to their own drum and today  
they were marching up,'' said A.C. Moore, chief investment 
strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``There 
was a very positive tone in the tech sector generally today and 
that benefited much of the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also supported by news of stable inflation.  
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, which measures 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, fell a 
smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in June, the first decline in 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose  
just 0.1 percent in June, a big slowdown from May's increase of 1.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports helped ease worries about a potential breakout of  
inflation, which could cause the Fed to raise rates again this year 
to slow U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks came under selling pressure as some investors  
took profits on the market's recent rise, which lifted the Dow to 
three closing highs in four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic news has been favorable for the market, but  
conversely, sellers have used that opportunity to take profits'' on 
the market's recent climb, said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also were hurt by increasing fears about political  
tensions in Asia after the Chinese government accused Taiwanese 
President Lee Teng-hui of trying to split his island from China. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also lingering concerns about Latin America's  
economic situation. The nervousness was set off Monday by comments 
from Argentina's presidential candidates, who hinted at a possible 
moratorium on repayment of the country's debt. That raised concerns 
on Wall Street that U.S. financial services companies would suffer 
losses because of unpaid loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plain and simple, the market turned a blind eye to the Latin  
American situation over the last seven or eight months,'' said 
Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
``Argentina has served as a reminder that they need to watch the 
situation in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,536 up, 1,398 down and 602 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Composite NYSE volume totaled 918.59 million shares, up from  
896.43 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.26 at 654.90, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.67 at 813.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 3.35 at  
461.46.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Exits Race, Endorses Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich of Ohio shelved his Oval  
Office dreams Wednesday and threw his support behind a ``soul 
brother,'' Texas Gov. George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Crushed under the Bush financial steamroller -- Kasich raised  
$1.6 million compared with the front-runner's $36 million -- he was 
the second Republican presidential candidate to drop out of the 
race this week. Sen. Bob Smith abandoned his GOP campaign for the 
White House and said he would run as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Bush at a news conference, Kasich conceded he  
couldn't compete and said, ``I think you have to be man enough to 
take the good along with those things that are disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-term congressman said he plans to work for Republicans  
across the country for the next year and a half, but that he would 
not run for re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time does come when you know it's time to go,'' he said.  
``I accomplished everything I ever set out to accomplish in the 
House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich heads the House Budget Committee, but would have to  
relinquish that position after 2000 because of chairmanship term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Kasich declared themselves philosophically compatible.  
Bush playfully encouraged speculation about Kasich as a vice 
presidential prospect and said ``he's going to fit perfectly on my 
team.'' Kasich pledged to campaign for Bush, saying ``I can't find 
any issues that I have problems with him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're soul brothers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kasich had devoted more than a year to his presidential  
aspiration, but by last month his exploratory campaign was being 
kept afloat only by the excess money in his congressional 
re-election account. 
</P>
<P>
	With the other hopefuls getting ready to pull out all stops in  
the Iowa straw poll, the campaign reached a financial crossroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton, Iowa, supporter Marianne Vidal said she was sorry to  
see Kasich drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be a down-to-earth person and that's what the  
American public needs,'' she said. ``I think with maturity and 
people getting to know him more, he will have a good chance the 
next time around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich said he's planning thank-you visits to Iowa and New  
Hampshire, where he had thrown himself into grass-roots politics, 
making the rounds of living rooms, diners, backroads and bowling 
alleys. 
</P>
<P>
	He competed in a sled-dog race, played baseball on the famous  
``field of dreams,'' and shook hands at town dumps because that's 
where people congregate on Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had probably the greatest experience of my life,'' Kasich  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was vague about his plans for life after Congress. Kasich has  
worked for the government -- first as a legislative aide, then state 
senator, then congressman -- his entire adult life. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has in mind some sort of public service work that  
wasn't a government job. He'll also learn about fatherhood; his 
wife Karen is expecting their first baby in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Smith, Kasich had been unable to break out of single-digit  
showings in recent polls, and Kasich had maintained from the start 
that he would not put his name on the ballot unless he managed to 
get a bankroll of at least $18.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think John's always been realistic about this thing,  
realistic about his fund raising,'' said Robert Bennett, chairman 
of the Ohio Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Kasich is known for exuberance, tenacity and  
love of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the major authors of the budget-balancing plan  
agreed to in 1997 -- perhaps the high water mark of his 
congressional career. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent years trying to kill the B-2 bomber, and managed to  
limit production but not end it. 
</P>
<P>
	He also placed himself at the front of an effort to eliminate  
several business subsidies, a stance that led to arguments with 
fellow Republicans over word play -- some objected to calling the 
subsidies ``corporate welfare'' -- and which allowed him to build an 
unlikely alliance with consumer advocate Ralph Nader.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV Boosts Time Warner Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner posted net earnings Wednesday of  
$593 million in the second quarter as a large gain from cable 
television deals boosted profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, which were equivalent to 43 cents per share,  
compared to net profits of $101 million, or 2 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Revenues slipped to $3.57 billion from 
$3.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's net figures for the second quarter reflected  
several one-time gains, mainly a $771 million profit from various 
sales and exchanges of cable television properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined operating income at Time Warner and its subsidiary Time  
Warner Entertainment rose 4 percent in the quarter to $1.13 billion 
from $1.09 billion in the same period a year ago, not counting 
one-time gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings in most of Time Warner's business areas -- publishing,  
cable, and entertainment -- posted gains except for the WB broadcast 
network, which recorded a wider loss as the fledgling network 
continued to absorb startup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's publishing business had an 11 percent rise in  
operating earnings, which the company attributed to advertising 
gains at several of its major magazines, including Sports 
Illustrated, InStyle, Money and Teen People. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's main movie studio, Warner Bros., posted gains  
thanks to the box office success of ``The Matrix,'' which has taken 
in $307 million so far. Time Warner's boutique studio New Line also 
did well with the release of the ``Austin Powers'' sequel. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's cable networks CNN, TNT, TBS and HBO all posted  
advances during the quarter. The company's cable delivery systems 
also had large gains, due largely to $771 million in gains from 
selling and exchanging cable systems with other companies. Even 
without the one-time gains, earnings from the cable subcriber 
business rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses at the WB network, a new and successful network aimed at  
kids and young adults, widened to $30 million from $23 million in 
the same period a year ago due to higher startup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's shares rose $1.56 1/4 cents to $77.31 1/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Time Warner posted net earnings  
of $731 million compared to $39 million. Operating earnings, 
excluding one-time gains and other non-recurring factors, rose to 
$2.17 billion from $1.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month revenues rose to $6.84 billion from $6.81 billion.

<HEADLINE> Intel Restructures Business Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- To increase its focus on Internet  
opportunities, Intel announced Wednesday it would restructure 
several of its business groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Communications Products Group will emerge from the  
combination of related hardware, software and support groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel is organizing around Internet opportunities in four key  
areas,'' said Intel chief executive officer Craig R. Barrett. ``The 
addition of the (CPG) segments our network infrastructure 
activities along systems and components.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CPG will bring together the Communications and Internet  
Server Division, the Dialogic subsidiary, the Network Systems 
Division and the Systems Management Division. The new group will be 
headed by John H.F. Miner, an Intel vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Intel formed the Platform Components Group by  
combining the Platform Components Division, Graphics Components 
Division, Platform Driver Division and the Intel Architechture 
Business Group. The PCG is headed by Intel vice president and 
general manager Louis J. Burns.

<HEADLINE>  Railway Suspect Appears in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man suspected in a terrifying series of  
slayings along railroad tracks in three states admitted today he 
committed a burglary at one of the killing scenes and indicated he 
is willing to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said today they had evidence linking him to a ninth  
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge William Harmon told Angel Maturino  
Resendez, also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, of the burglary 
charge and asked if he had any questions. The 39-year-old Mexican 
drifter replied through a translator: ``Can all this be done very 
quickly so I can say I am guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was to set bond and assign Maturino Resendez an  
attorney, so the admission of guilt was not an official plea, 
prosecutors said. Maturino Resendez had made a similar attempt 
earlier today to plead guilty to the burglary, the only count 
brought against him so far in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In both brief court appearances, his calm request to plead  
guilty came after a prosecutor described the bloody scene of the 
killing from which the burglary charge stems. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez, who was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted  
List after he was named as a suspect in eight killings, surrendered 
Tuesday at a border checkpoint after an intense manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	When he gave his name to the judge, he explained that  
Resendez-Ramirez was an alias. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said  
Maturino Resendez was charged with burglary at the home of Dr. 
Claudia Benton in the Houston enclave of West University Place. Ms. 
Benton was killed in her home on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said Maturino Resendez's fingerprints were found on  
Ms. Benton's stolen car and that there was possibly DNA evidence 
linking him to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it hard to deny you're the one who did it,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said Maturino Resendez could be charged with  
capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we've got him and I'm assuming we're going to keep him  
until we're done,'' she said. ``You can only mess up a slam-dunk, 
but it's a good case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said the decision on whether to bring the capital  
murder charge would be up to her boss, District Attorney Johnny 
Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a charge of capital murder can usually only be filed  
when there is evidence that a murder occurred during the commission 
of certain felonies, including burglary. Even if he tried to plead 
guilty to murder as he attempted to do in the burglary charge, 
Texas law requires a jury trial to hear all death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez is charged with three killings in Illinois and  
Kentucky and had been suspected in five more in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Texas authorities linked him to a sixth killing, in  
Hughes Springs. Houston Police Lt. Ron Walker said a palm print 
found last October at the home of 87-year-old slaying victim Leffie 
Mason matches Maturino Resendez's. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most intense manhunts in years ended Tuesday with a  
simple handshake between a Texas Ranger and Maturino Resendez at an 
El Paso border station. The surrender was aided by family members 
who were in contact with the ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear why the elusive man chose to turn himself in  
with the possibility of facing the death penalty for brutal 
slayings that began nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman, said he  
thought the suspect might have feared bounty hunters. A $125,000 
reward had been offered for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the best news in Weimar since the end of World  
War II,'' said Bernie Kosler, mayor of the tiny south Texas town 
where Rev. Norman Sirnic, his wife, Karen, and 73-year-old 
Josephine Konvicka were fatally bludgeoned earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of Tuesday's surrender, Maturino Resendez was flown  
to Houston where he was interrogated for nearly eight hours about 
two slayings: Ms. Benton's and that of Noemi Dominguez, a 
26-year-old schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez's surrender agreement included assurances of  
family visits, a psychological evaluation and promises that he 
would be safe in jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement does not shield him from the death penalty. Mexico  
has refused to return suspects to countries where they may face a 
death penalty, which Mexico does not have. 
</P>
<P>
	And Maturino Resendez surrendered himself to the state that has  
executed more people -- 180 -- that any other since the death penalty 
was declared constitutional in 1976. Harris County prosecutors have 
sent more killers to death row than any other in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest capped a massive six-week international manhunt by  
thousands of investigators and railroad authorities. The fugitive 
was thought to have traveled by hopping freight trains, finding 
victims living near the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the  
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail of terror started with the Aug. 29, 1997, slaying of a  
21-year-old college student in Kentucky who was attacked while 
walking with his girlfriend along railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the killings have come since September. The most  
recent were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old 
daughter, found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez slipped through U.S. hands and was released by  
border agents to Mexico on June 2 even though he was wanted for 
questioning in a murder. Investigators believe he went on to kill 
four more people.

<HEADLINE> FCC Voting on Disabled Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are prepared to approve new  
rules requiring the telecommunications industry to make pagers, 
cellular phones and other equipment and services easier for 
disabled individuals to use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission was scheduled to vote  
today on the rule, which will ``represent the most significant 
opportunity for people with disabilities since the passage of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990,'' said FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing that has been done since that time that is  
more significant in insuring access for persons with 
disabilities,'' he said Tuesday, adding later: ``We're writing the 
ADA for the information age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without going into specifics, Kennard said the rules would  
require manufacturers to do all they can to address the needs of 
the disabled during the design phase of products and services. The 
costs of implementing such features would be kept down by 
incorporating them early in the production process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rule, such equipment as voice-activated phones,  
talking Caller ID and phones with keypads that have large buttons 
or specific identifying marks would be more commonplace. Also more 
widely available would be ``text telephones,'' usually referred to 
as TTY or TDD systems, and phones with volume controls or headsets. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule stems from a provision of a 1996 telecommunications  
law, which instructed the FCC to take steps to give disabled people 
better access to telecommunications services and devices that suit 
their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said commissioners do not intend to micromanage the  
design process of telecommunications products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just telling the manufacturing community that we're most  
interested in the ends, not the means,'' he said. ``Make your 
products more accessible for people with disabilities and do it 
early on in the design of the products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to comply with the rules could result in penalties or  
damage awards ranging from the thousands to the millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's our hope that by giving the manufacturers some  
flexibility ... we'll really accomplish a lot, not only for people 
with disabilities but for our whole society,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that many products commonly used today -- such as  
the vibrating pager or closed-caption television sets -- were 
designed for people with disabilities, who account for roughly 54 
million Americans and a high number of the nation's unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fontes, senior vice president of the Cellular  
Telecommunications Industry Association, called the new rule an 
important step. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said many in the industry have come up with ways to make  
telecommunications equipment more usable by the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wireless industry has been committed not only to the  
letter of the law, but the spirit of the law, even before access to 
telecommunications service was part of the Telecom Act,'' he said. 
``We were working on issues such as hearing aid compatibility on 
wireless phones before 1996.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Tests Online Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Postal Service plans to allow  
customers to buy stamps over the Internet and print them directly 
onto envelopes and mailing labels in a campaign to increase sales 
among small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	PC Postage marks the Postal Service's first big step into  
electronic commerce. The program is being tested by a select number 
of small businesses in California and the Washington, D.C., area. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be available nationwide by the end of summer, Patricia  
Gibert, the agency's vice president for retail sales, said during a 
demonstration Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than individual consumers, the program initially targets  
an estimated 8 million small business and home office customers who 
find stamps inconvenient, but don't want to buy or rent a mail 
metering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we make mail easier, people will stick with it longer,''  
Gibert said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't trying to stop the tide of e-mail and it shouldn't  
be done, but ease of use is a big cost factor,'' she said. ``You've 
got to meet the customer where he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tests have been under way for more than a year. They are being  
conducted by E-Stamp Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif.; Stamps.com of 
Santa Monica, Calif.; and two makers of mechanical postage meters, 
Neopost Inc. of Hayward, Calif. and Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney 
Bowes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The systems require customers to purchase stamps in advance  
using a credit card or debit card. Service fees are expected to run 
about 10 percent. Customers can purchase stamps for first-class, 
priority and express mail. Customers can use their own printer to 
create a postmark and bar code in the envelope's upper right-hand 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, the software allows customers to do individual or  
mass mailings. The Web sites preserve a log of all mailings and a 
list of stamp prices. And as an option, companies provide digital 
scales that will weigh larger letters and tell the customer how 
much postage is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really been great. Now I'm not peeling and sticking  
stamps,'' said J. Wingate Greathouse, office manager at Bowles 
Kendrick &AMP; Lemanski Architects in San Francisco, one of the 
companies involved in the E-Stamp testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellington Wilson, whose Wellington E-Group is creating an  
online shopping mall, began testing the Stamps.com product in 
January. The system worked without a hitch in February, when he 
used it for a 500-letter mailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that I could just run the envelopes through the  
printer and fix the postage made it so convenient, the fact that I 
didn't have to go to the office and buy $200 worth of stamps,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Final testing has focused on ensuring that the systems offered  
by each company is secure against hackers and counterfeiting, 
Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the 1,200 customers involved in testing have purchased  
more than $75,000 worth of stamps to send 46,000 pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, at least, the system isn't suitable for big companies  
that send hundreds or thousands of pieces of mail per day. 
</P>
<P>
	For large projects, metering machines are faster and more  
efficient. Though that could change if private companies create new 
software and printers, there are currently no plans to expand the 
PC Postage market beyond small businesses, Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrepreneurs being who they are and with the opportunity to  
take an idea and expand it, we can see products that might work for 
larger customers,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tick-Borne Illness Now in Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have for the first time detected in humans a  
tick-borne bacterial infection that was thought to sicken only 
dogs, according to a study in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gives no evidence to suggest that man's best friend is  
spreading the potentially deadly disease to people directly, 
through a bite or a lick. Instead, the researchers said ticks are 
biting both humans and dogs, and may be jumping from dog to master 
in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors found four human cases of the infection, all in  
Missouri, between 1996 and 1998, and four more cases during this 
tick season in Missouri, Tennessee and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined a little-known disease called ehrlichiosis,  
which is similar to Lyme disease. Both diseases are transmitted by 
ticks and exist primarily in New England and the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Two forms of ehrlichiosis have previously been documented in  
people since 1986, when the disease was first found in the United 
States. Since then, approximately 1,200 cases have been reported, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was the first time researchers found cases of the type  
of ehrlichiosis that previously had been identified only in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter which form of bacteria causes the infection, an  
antibiotic can essentially cure it, both in humans and dogs. In the 
study, all four patients from 1996-98 were treated successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease have some symptoms in common --  
headache, nausea, chills, fever, malaise and fatigue -- but 
typically, ehrlichiosis doesn't usually come with a rash and can be 
fatal if left untreated. Up to 5 percent of cases result in death. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a much more acute and rapidly progressing disease that  
can be much more serious because it can be fatal in the most severe 
cases,'' said study co-author Dr. Gregory Storch of the St. Louis 
Children's Hospital. ``Lyme disease is not fatal. It can become 
chronic and can produce some significant and annoying 
manifestations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christopher Paddock of the CDC stressed that ehrlichiosis  
can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aware that if you're out in areas where there are ticks,  
and this can be hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, you should 
always check yourself and remove any crawling or attached ticks as 
quickly as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Railway Suspect Appears in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man suspected in a terrifying series of  
slayings along railroad tracks in three states admitted today he 
committed a burglary at one of the killing scenes and indicated he 
is willing to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said today they had evidence linking him to a ninth  
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge William Harmon told Angel Maturino  
Resendez, also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, of the burglary 
charge and asked if he had any questions. The 39-year-old Mexican 
drifter replied through a translator: ``Can all this be done very 
quickly so I can say I am guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was to set bond and assign Maturino Resendez an  
attorney, so the admission of guilt was not an official plea, 
prosecutors said. Maturino Resendez had made a similar attempt 
earlier today to plead guilty to the burglary, the only count 
brought against him so far in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In both brief court appearances, his calm request to plead  
guilty came after a prosecutor described the bloody scene of the 
killing from which the burglary charge stems. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez, who was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted  
List after he was named as a suspect in eight killings, surrendered 
Tuesday at a border checkpoint after an intense manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	When he gave his name to the judge, he explained that  
Resendez-Ramirez was an alias. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said  
Maturino Resendez was charged with burglary at the home of Dr. 
Claudia Benton in the Houston enclave of West University Place. Ms. 
Benton was killed in her home on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said Maturino Resendez's fingerprints were found on  
Ms. Benton's stolen car and that there was possibly DNA evidence 
linking him to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it hard to deny you're the one who did it,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said Maturino Resendez could be charged with  
capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we've got him and I'm assuming we're going to keep him  
until we're done,'' she said. ``You can only mess up a slam-dunk, 
but it's a good case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said the decision on whether to bring the capital  
murder charge would be up to her boss, District Attorney Johnny 
Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a charge of capital murder can usually only be filed  
when there is evidence that a murder occurred during the commission 
of certain felonies, including burglary. Even if he tried to plead 
guilty to murder as he attempted to do in the burglary charge, 
Texas law requires a jury trial to hear all death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez is charged with three killings in Illinois and  
Kentucky and had been suspected in five more in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Texas authorities linked him to a sixth killing, in  
Hughes Springs. Houston Police Lt. Ron Walker said a palm print 
found last October at the home of 87-year-old slaying victim Leffie 
Mason matches Maturino Resendez's. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most intense manhunts in years ended Tuesday with a  
simple handshake between a Texas Ranger and Maturino Resendez at an 
El Paso border station. The surrender was aided by family members 
who were in contact with the ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear why the elusive man chose to turn himself in  
with the possibility of facing the death penalty for brutal 
slayings that began nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman, said he  
thought the suspect might have feared bounty hunters. A $125,000 
reward had been offered for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the best news in Weimar since the end of World  
War II,'' said Bernie Kosler, mayor of the tiny south Texas town 
where Rev. Norman Sirnic, his wife, Karen, and 73-year-old 
Josephine Konvicka were fatally bludgeoned earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of Tuesday's surrender, Maturino Resendez was flown  
to Houston where he was interrogated for nearly eight hours about 
two slayings: Ms. Benton's and that of Noemi Dominguez, a 
26-year-old schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez's surrender agreement included assurances of  
family visits, a psychological evaluation and promises that he 
would be safe in jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement does not shield him from the death penalty. Mexico  
has refused to return suspects to countries where they may face a 
death penalty, which Mexico does not have. 
</P>
<P>
	And Maturino Resendez surrendered himself to the state that has  
executed more people -- 180 -- that any other since the death penalty 
was declared constitutional in 1976. Harris County prosecutors have 
sent more killers to death row than any other in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest capped a massive six-week international manhunt by  
thousands of investigators and railroad authorities. The fugitive 
was thought to have traveled by hopping freight trains, finding 
victims living near the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the  
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail of terror started with the Aug. 29, 1997, slaying of a  
21-year-old college student in Kentucky who was attacked while 
walking with his girlfriend along railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the killings have come since September. The most  
recent were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old 
daughter, found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez slipped through U.S. hands and was released by  
border agents to Mexico on June 2 even though he was wanted for 
questioning in a murder. Investigators believe he went on to kill 
four more people.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams Gets All-Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tears flooded Ted Williams' eyes, and the biggest,  
toughest players in baseball got choked up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	They formed a huge mass around him on the mound at Fenway Park  
before the All-Star game Tuesday night. No one wanted to leave his 
side. No one cared if his opening pitch or the game was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a baseball love-fest, the stars of the night and the  
stars of the century swarming around Williams, gazing at him in 
awe, reaching over each other to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a chance to meet one of the best hitters in the  
game, and you see tears running down his eyes for the appreciation 
the fans and all of us gave him, it's quite a special time,'' Mark 
McGwire said. ``I'm just happy he knows who I am, and he talked to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Williams, his balance and health so precarious  
now after two strokes and a broken hip, wanted to reach out to all 
of them. He wanted to swap baseball stories through the night, stay 
there on the field where he once played and soak in the cheers that 
he refused to acknowledge during his storied career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a scene reminiscent of Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic  
torch at the start of the 1996 Atlanta Games -- Ali shaking, the 
crowd cheering wildly, the greatest athletes in the world staring 
at him in awe. When Ali later made the rounds of the games, even 
athletes like Michael Jordan fawned over him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it was with these all-stars and Williams, an  
all-star himself for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He rode out in a green golf cart from center field after  
everyone had been introduced -- Aaron and Mays, Feller and Musial 
from summers past, McGwire and Sosa, Ripken and Griffey from the 
night's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Players watched as the adoring crowd stood and cheered him, the  
roar almost as loud as the jets that buzzed Fenway after the 
national anthem. And they watched Williams respond by waving his 
cap, a gesture he never made as a player, even after he homered in 
his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gods don't answer letters,'' John Updike wrote of that moment  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, a baseball god did.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was often booed by Fenway fans during his playing days,  
but now no one is more popular in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell, I haven't had a base hit in 30 years, and I'm a better  
hitter now than I've ever been in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams waved all the way down the right field line as the golf  
cart proceeded toward the mound. Even the policemen ringing the 
field applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, spontaneously, the players, young and old, closed  
ranks on him, moving in to be as near as possible to the last man 
to hit .400 -- .406 in 1941 -- and who is arguably the greatest 
hitter in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's Sammy?'' Williams bellowed, calling for Sosa, then  
shaking his hand. Williams wore a big smile and seemed to want to 
reach out to all of them. He grabbed Mark McGwire's shoulder and 
spoke with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward Williams recounted what he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted me to meet (Don) Mattingly when he was going good,  
and (Wade) Boggs. And we went to this high-class restaurant and 
we're talking about hitting, the intimate part of hitting, where 
you put your foot, everything like that. Finally, I said, 'Did you 
guys ever smell the wood when you foul one real hard?' 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked at one another, like what's this guy smoking now?  
And I said I could smell it quite a few times, and it smelled like 
wood burning. I said the next time I see Willie Mays, the next time 
I see Cepeda, the next time I see Reggie Jackson, I'm going to ask 
them. They said, `Oh, sure, we've smelled it, too.' So I asked 
McGwire the same thing, and he said he could smell it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the time,'' McGwire told him.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams wanted to keep talking, but time and his own emotions  
wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to talk baseball with everybody out there,'' McGwire  
said, adding that a lot of players got choked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker of the Rockies was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tears were coming out of Ted's eyes,'' Walker said. ``I had to  
turn away because tears were coming out my eyes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the players backed away and Williams took the ball to  
throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Carlton Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is he?'' Williams asked. His vision, once the best in  
the game, has suffered, too, and he can't see well outside a narrow 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn pointed him toward Fisk and held him steady.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got you,'' Gwynn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams joked a bit, then tossed a soft pitch to Fisk, inside  
but all the way to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk jogged to the mound to hug him.  
</P>
<P>
	Other players came back to crowd around Williams, and after a  
few minutes the public address announcer pleaded with the players 
to return to the dugout. The game was running about 15 minutes 
late, but no one wanted this moment to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of funny,'' Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra  
said. ``When the announcer asked everybody to go back to the 
dugout, everybody said no. It didn't matter. What time was the 
first pitch? Nobody cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rafael Palmeiro: ``That's the chance of a lifetime. The  
game can wait ... We had chills all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, the players expressed a sense of reverence about the  
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meeting Ted Williams was probably the greatest thrill of my  
career,'' Cleveland's Jim Thome said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Williams was helped back into the cart, and the crowd  
roared again until he made his way to his box seat along the first 
base line with commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it great!'' Williams said. ``I can only describe it as  
great. It didn't surprise me all that much because I know how these 
fans are here in Boston. They love this game as much as any players 
and Boston's lucky to have the faithful Red Sox fans. They're the 
best.''

<HEADLINE> Folksy Gore Loosens Stiff Reputation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Scuffing the linoleum of the Soul City  
Cafe with the turned-up toes of his shiny cowboy boots, Al Gore 
claps the shoulder of a man he is trying to recruit for campaign 
work. ``You da man!'' Gore tells him. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away the microphone and lectern, and this presidential  
candidate isn't as stiff as his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	On a two-day swing through Iowa, a state crowded with  
presidential candidates this week, Gore left his vice presidential 
props behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The dress shirt and necktie are gone, replaced by sport shirts --  
all in shades of green -- that show off the muscles of a man who 
lifts weights with his 16-year-old son and is training for a 
marathon. A bronze Chevy Suburban replaces his usual limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing George W. Bush in many polls and raising just half of  
what the Texas governor did for the first half of the year, Gore 
drew parallels Wednesday between his 2000 presidential race to Iowa 
Gov. Tom Vilsack's 1998 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when he was 20 points behind in the polls and  
there were people who said he couldn't win, right? Hmmmm,'' he 
reminded Democratic activists at Java Joe's coffeehouse with a 
theatrical stroke of his chin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He developed -- what was it? -- momentum and ideas while his  
Republican opponent was ready to move into the mansion before the 
election. I don't know, maybe it's deja vu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Gore has an increasingly formidable Democratic  
primary opponent, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, on his 
heels. Gore only once, and then vaguely, appeared to acknowledge 
the coming primary fight when he appealed to Democrats here to show 
``unity of purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Java Joe's, he peeled off his navy sportcoat and jauntily  
tossed it across the room to a surprised aide. He prompted a 
toddler to give him a ``high five'' slap. And, with campaign aides 
chatting among themselves while he began to answer a voter's 
question on domestic violence, Gore flashed real irritation: 
``Could I have your attention in the back? Thank you! This is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a commanding, 90-minute dialogue with about 50 Iowa women  
on issues from gun control to abortion rights, Gore asked them to 
indulge his ``punch line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an ``Aw, shucks'' slump of his shoulders, shuffle of his  
feet, he said: ``I would like you to stand for me in the 
caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's caucuses, likely to be held early February, will kick off  
the nation's presidential nominating contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Ellingsen, a Council Bluffs railway worker, was impressed  
with what he saw as a mastery of issues and a smooth, genuine 
performance by Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he's done a lot of practicing for this to have  
happened,'' observed the yet-undecided Ellingsen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be more common-like,'' agreed Gerrit Vander  
Meiden, an elderly Pella, Iowa, family farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore can showcase this side to only a handful of voters at a  
time. His crowds at each stop number in the dozens and peaked on 
this trip at around 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lighter tone, Gore's campaigning can still feel  
canned and hit-or-miss when it comes to connecting with people. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do they want to hear from me?'' he quizzed an adviser  
before stepping inside Soul City for a barbecue-and-greens dinner 
with 16 local black organizers. And so methodical was he shaking 
hands around the table that he blew right past Iowa first lady 
Christie Vilsack as she waited to introduce him to camera-cute 
cousins Danielle Hill, 13, and Daniel Turner, 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure you get to meet him later,'' Mrs. Vilsack  
apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	The message that Gore is not Bill Clinton -- and in fact, would  
like people to see him as better than Clinton -- is subtle but 
pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
	At a school safety forum with 200 Council Bluffs residents,  
campaign aides positioned the ``Stronger Values'' and ``Stronger 
Families'' banners so that they appeared just over Gore's shoulder 
in news photographs. The ``Safer Schools'' poster was hung clear 
across the Kirn Junior High gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	To women, Gore griped that Republicans are gunning for him,  
amassing millions in campaign dollars because ``they don't like a 
lot of the changes that you and I have brought about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No mention of Clinton, the man whose signature was on the bills  
and executive orders actually making those changes.

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Prescription Tax Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans proposed tax deductions to help  
some Medicare recipients pay for prescription drugs as they resumed 
pushing their $864 billion, 10-year tax cut through the House Ways 
and Means Committee today. 
</P>
<P>
	Details were vague, with lawmakers and aides providing no  
information on how much the plan would cost or precisely how it 
would work. But they said it would be paid for from projected 
federal surpluses, and not take effect until an overall Medicare 
overhaul is enacted in later legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was the first piece of a GOP response to President  
Clinton's plan to add voluntary prescription drug coverage to 
Medicare, which has proven popular with the public. House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters that the tax break would be 
just one part of the Republican prescription drug plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax plan, nearly half of which is a 10 percent  
across-the-board cut in income tax rates, would be phased in slowly 
from 1999 to 2009. In fact, its cost over the first five years is 
only a combined $199.9 billion, ballooning to $203.3 billion in 
2009 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the House Ways and  
Means Committee in a letter Tuesday that such huge revenue losses 
would eat up money that could go to help shore up Social Security 
or Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of the proposed tax cuts would explode beyond the  
10-year budget window,'' Summers wrote. ``This would pose even 
greater risks for the future, just as the first wave of the baby 
boom generation is retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee today planned to begin voting on  
amendments to the measure, which Summers again said President 
Clinton would certainly veto. Democrats say that makes the bill 
little more than a campaign slogan for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans contended the surplus projections don't take into  
account the dynamic effects a tax cut could have on economic growth 
or federal government savings as people no longer need such 
government services as Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax bills create wealth,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.  
``They help people live better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's chairman, Republican Bill Archer of Texas, brushed  
off veto threats and insisted his bill properly ensures that all 
taxpayers receive a refund from the surplus they have created. The 
income tax cuts don't go to everyone because some 40 percent of 
Americans now pay none at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very difficult to give an income tax cut to people  
who pay no income tax,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech in Miami, Clinton urged Republicans to reconsider  
the tax cut and focus budget surpluses on Social Security and 
Medicare while not forgetting key spending programs such as defense 
and education. Democrats appear willing to accept a tax cut of 
perhaps $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I ask again the Republican leaders in Congress, for the  
sake of saving Medicare and strengthening our future, to reduce the 
size of your tax cut and join us in putting first things first,'' 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some early Republican grumbling as well. A letter to  
Archer from about 50 House conservatives complained that provisions 
to fix the ``marriage penalty'' were too meager, although the 
lawmakers did not threaten to vote against the overall bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this bill doesn't go far enough in providing relief  
to families,'' said the group, which is led by Rep. David McIntosh, 
R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the plan, which would be the largest tax cut since  
President Reagan's in 1981, was released piecemeal last week. These 
previously known provisions include the 10 percent cut in all 
income tax rates over 10 years, an immediate reduction in the top 
capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent, gradual 
elimination of estate taxes and new breaks for education and health 
care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The finalized plan included several new items:  
</P>
<P>
	--Fixing the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of two-income  
couples by allowing them a standard deduction of $8,600, instead of 
$7,200 in current law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phasing out the alternative minimum tax, which was created to  
ensure the wealthy don't escape taxes through legitimate tax moves 
but which has increasingly affected middle-class taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibiting taxes on the first $400 in savings interest for a  
married couple, $200 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cutting capital gains taxes for corporations from 35 percent to  
25 percent over nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several small business provisions, including the restoration of  
the deductibility of business meals to 80 percent from 50 percent 
and allowing health insurance premiums to be fully deductible for 
the self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans are developing a competing proposal that  
costs roughly $792 billion over 10 years and attempts to target 
more tax cuts at the middle class. That bill will be considered by 
the Finance Committee next week.

<HEADLINE> Walgreen Chairman Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Walgreen Co. chief executive Daniel  
Jorndt on Wednesday was named chairman of the drug store chain's 
board, replacing Charles R. Walgreen III. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorndt, who began his career at the company in 1963 as a  
pharmacist, has been chief executive of the fast-growing nationwide 
chain since January 1998. Before that, he was president and chief 
operating officer. He will retain his position as CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen joined the company founded by his grandfather in 1952  
as a stock clerk; he held various positions before becoming 
chairman of the board in 1976. He will remain a member of the board 
as chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreens operates 2,755 stores in 37 states and Puerto Rico. It  
had sales of $15.3 billion in fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Champs Plan Exhibition Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	First the Victory Tour, now the Great Soccer Exhibition Tour for  
the U.S. women's World Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and Julie Foudy, along with the  
rest of the team, will regroup in October for a three-month indoor 
soccer exhibition tour, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will compete against a world all-star team in 11  
matches starting Oct. 22 in Pittsburgh and ending Dec. 12 in 
Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Berke, a vice president with the sports marketing firm SFX  
Sports Group, which helped organize the tour, said it will allow 
the players to earn money from soccer, stay close to their fans and 
demonstrate the viability of a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a number of sponsors, including beverage, financial  
services and packaged goods companies, have expressed interest in 
the tour. He said talks are under way about producing a TV special 
during the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players' plans, though, conflict with recently  
announced plans by the U.S. Soccer Federation to send the women's 
team on a tour of South Africa, Egypt and Australia from late 
October through December. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is expected to be discussed next week when the players  
meet with the USSF to negotiate a new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported that each player is guaranteed  
$41,250 for playing in the 11 games, with the possibility of 
earning more if other games are added. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pittsburgh and Tacoma, the team will make stops  
in Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, 
Raleigh, N.C., San Jose, Calif., and Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team captured the World Cup with a 5-4 penalty-kicks  
victory over China in the title game at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Kelly a Work in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Kevin Kelly is a work in progress.  
</P>
<P>
	After just three amateur bouts and a tough start as a pro, the  
29-year-old Australian has advanced to a shot at a world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he's advanced enough to become a world champion will be  
determined Saturday night when he challenges WBA super welterweight 
champion David Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long trip for Kelly, both in miles from Australia  
and in hard knocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly (24-5-3, 11 knockouts) lost four of his first 10 fights.  
</P>
<P>
	``He only had three amateur fights,'' said trainer George Reno.  
``So virtually he was serving an apprenticeship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last 10 fight, all wins, the former British Commonwealth  
champion has scored seven knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've sort of come along,'' Kelly said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Most boxing observers don't believe Kelly has come along far  
enough to beat Reid in the fight at the Boardwalk Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look past anybody,'' said Reid (12-0, seven  
knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
	Plans, however, already call for him to make a title defense  
against Keith Mullings in late August. And there is a possible 
lucrative fight against IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando 
Vargas next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas will defend his title against Raul Marquez Saturday night  
at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	So Reid has a lot at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	As for the challenger, he said, ``I've come here to fight the  
fight of my life. This fight will determine how I live the rest of 
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid will be making the first defense of the 154-pound  
championship he won with a clear-cut decision over Laurent 
Boudouani of France March 6 at the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	While the champion from Philadelphia will be fighting for only  
the 13th time as a pro, he was schooled long and well as an amateur 
career in which he won gold medals at the 1996 Olympics and 1995 
Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The FX telecast will start at 10 p.m. EDT, with the main event  
set for 11 p.m. Also to be televised will be a 10-round lightweight 
bout between John John Molina, a former IBF junior lightweight 
champion from Puerto Rico and James Crayton of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 10-round will match junior welterweights Hector Camacho  
Jr. of Puerto Rico and Mike Cooley of Omaha, Neb.

<HEADLINE>  Tagliabue Warns Phillips on Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips, the troubled running back who  
revived his career in Europe, was told Wednesday by commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue that he will be fined for past misdeeds if he signs 
with an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who became the first running back to gain more than  
1,000 yards in the NFL Europe's eight-game season, met for an hour 
with Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard to meet my responsibilities in NFL Europe this  
spring and I'm determined to do the same in the NFL starting this 
summer,'' Phillips said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The league later said in a statement that Tagliabue told  
Phillips ``that as a result of past misconduct, he will be subject 
to a substantial fine this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the amount will be determined later,  
presumably depending on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips pleaded no contest to beating a former girlfriend while  
at Nebraska, then left the school after his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams chose Phillips as the sixth overall pick of  
the 1996 draft, but he was arrested on drunken driving charges and 
spent 23 days in jail during 19 months with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was subsequently signed by the Miami Dolphins, but played  
little. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cut by the team at the beginning of last season after  
being arrested on charges of hitting a woman who refused to dance 
with him at a nightclub. He pleaded guilty to battery and received 
six months' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips revived his career in Europe, gaining 1,021 yards and  
scoring 14 touchdowns as he led Barcelona to the league 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a number of teams are interested in him, including  
Baltimore, Green Bay, San Francisco and Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Audience Eager for Kubrick's Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A comic ballet of aeronautic copulation  
between an Air Force bomber and a refueling plane. A middle-aged 
man preying on a lonely widow so he can get close to her pubescent 
daughter. A grinning, ax-toting Jack Nicholson chopping through a 
door and maniacally announcing, ``Here's Johnny!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick was never one to spare audiences from disturbing  
ideas and images, as these scenes from his ``Dr. Strangelove,'' 
``Lolita'' and ``The Shining'' attest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, audiences will see his last foray into the unsettling  
with the opening of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' an examination of sexual 
obsession starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Some expect it to 
be highbrow soft porn. Kubrick enthusiasts anticipate a final 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most anticipated movie of the year was `Star Wars,' but  
for me, this is it,'' said Rick Curnutte, a contributing editor to 
a Web site on Kubrick. ``I'll be taking off work to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. viewers will see a slightly altered version. To fend off an  
NC-17 rating, Kubrick digitally added clothed orgy-goers to block 
some particularly explicit sex scenes during 65 seconds of footage, 
earning the movie an R rating. The racier version will be shown 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the buzz, plus the star power of Cruise and Kidman,  
``Eyes Wide Shut'' almost certainly will be Kubrick's 
highest-grossing film and has a good shot at topping $100 million, 
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., 
which tracks ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's previous best was an estimated $50 million for ``2001:  
A Space Odyssey,'' followed by ``Full Metal Jacket'' at $46 million 
and ``The Shining'' at $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' had two things going for it: the  
lure of real-life husband and wife Cruise and Kidman, and the fact 
that Kubrick had not released a movie since ``Full Metal Jacket'' 
12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's death March 7 heightened the film's intrigue in much  
the way artists' deaths can boost the value of their works. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a cloak of mystery and measured marketing by Warner Bros.,  
which has kept the movie under tight wraps per Kubrick's wishes, 
and ``Eyes Wide Shut'' probably ranks as the year's second 
most-talked-about film after the ``Star Wars'' installment. 
</P>
<P>
	Days before the movie's release, Warner remained coy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever you're expecting, it's not that,'' said studio  
spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner insists the hush-hush marketing was exactly how Kubrick  
wanted it. The day before Kubrick died, he talked by phone with 
Warner chairman Terry Semel and gave specific instructions about 
the first trailer, the ad campaign and the initial footage to 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio limited advance media screenings. The trailer and ads  
feature erotic images of Cruise and Kidman mixed with otherworldly 
shots of masked and cloaked revelers at an orgy. A few snippets of 
dialogue in the ads portend something dark and potentially 
murderous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warner has really created an aura of mystery around this movie  
that makes people want to see it,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you can't take Cruise and Kidman out of the equation,'' he  
said. ``If this was a no-name cast, all the mystery in the world 
might create a want-to-see feeling among some film fans but not the 
general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curnutte said that from what he has read about ``Eyes Wide  
Shut'' and his knowledge of Kubrick, he is expecting a serious 
movie about sex that may disappoint viewers expecting a porn film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people respect Kubrick as an artist and that he's  
going to do it in a special way,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. As for 
Cruise and Kidman, ``the odds are they're not going to do something 
sleazy or in bad taste.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Sign Top Picks Terry, Bowdler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks signed their two first-round  
draft choices Wednesday -- Jason Terry, the point guard from Arizona 
who is expected to replace the traded Mookie Blaylock, and 
little-known forward-center Cal Bowdler of Old Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry was taken with the 10th overall pick in the June NBA  
draft. Bowdler was the 17th player chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Both rookies signed three-year guaranteed contracts with a team  
option for a fourth year. Terry's agent, Larry Fox, would not 
confirm the terms of his deal, but it was believed to be about 
$4.73 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason and I feel comfortable with the contract,'' said Fox.  
</P>
<P>
	Bowdler's agent, William Pollak, said the 6-foot-10 rookie will  
receive $3.3 million over his three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks' other first-round pick, Dion Glover of Georgia Tech,  
remains unsigned. He was the 20th player chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry averaged 21.9 points per game last season and was named a  
first-team All-American and Pac-10 player of the year. He led the 
Pac-10 in scoring, assists (5.5) and steals (2.8) and is the only 
player in Arizona history to finish his career with more than 1,000 
points and 200 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowdler averaged 14.7 points per game as a senior at Old  
Dominion and led the Colonial Athletic Association in both 
rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry is a leading candidate to replace the departed Blaylock,  
who was traded to the Golden State Warriors just before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Lenny Wilkens said Terry would battle veterans Anthony  
Johnson and Bimbo Coles for a starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason plays an up-tempo game,'' Wilkens said. ``Certainly,  
he'll have good support around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Pete Babcock said Bowdler can play both center  
and strong forward, giving the Hawks more flexibility on the bench.

<HEADLINE> USDA Moves on Dairy Price Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is going forward with a farmer  
referendum on overhauling of the way milk is priced, despite 
widespread opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's proposal is intended to soften  
regional pricing disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	While it could hurt many producers outside the upper Midwest,  
the plan is expected to be approved nationwide because milk prices 
would otherwise be deregulated as of Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee voted 32-15 earlier this month  
to block the USDA plan and implement an alternative proposal that 
is closer to the current pricing system. The legislation is 
sponsored by more than 220 lawmakers, a majority of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA announced Wednesday that farmers will vote from Aug. 2 to  
Aug. 6 on its plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is outrageous that the USDA insists on pushing their agenda  
on unwilling dairy farmers who will end up in a Catch-22 when they 
will be forced to choose between a bad plan and no plan at all,'' 
said Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  
for fluid milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the 
South and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, 
because the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, 
Wis. The Depression-era system was designed to spur production in 
areas where it had been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress set the system for elimination and ordered  
USDA to come up with a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote in favor of USDA's proposal doesn't mean farmers like it,  
said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a vote in favor of the lesser of two evils. It should in  
no way prevent Congress from moving forward with the legislative 
changes they are considering,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances for the alternative plan are less certain in the Senate.  
The Agriculture Committee has not scheduled a hearing on the 
measure, and Senate rules would give senators from the upper 
Midwest more leverage to stop it if it is offered as an amendment 
to another bill.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leaf Coach Quinn Also To Be GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Coach Pat Quinn of the Toronto Maple Leafs has  
added the general manager's job to his duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn, who at one time held the dual role in Vancouver, replaces  
Ken Dryden, the team's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were fifth overall in the league and reached the  
final four,'' Dryden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we still have a long way to go. I think Pat is the one who  
can see us through the next difficult steps and get us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said his priority would still be coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I'm still the coach and that's my prime responsibility.  
It's just that my focus on that job changes a little bit,'' he 
said. ``I hope to be able to still have my coach's hat and when the 
opportunity for a bigger picture of the organization comes into 
place I hope to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job became open when Dryden didn't rehire associate GM Mike  
Smith last month. Dryden had the GM title but Smith had been the de 
facto general manager, making all personnel moves.

	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has tested 12  
vehicles in severe driving maneuvers using the computer to execute 
turns at speeds up to 60 mph. One compact pickup, a 1997 Ford 
Ranger, tipped so far to the side during two tests that it was 
caught by the metal outriggers on its sides that are designed to 
prevent it from rolling over and hurting the driver, according to 
an agency report on the tests to be made public today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the vehicles -- nearly all light trucks such as pickups  
or sport-utility vehicles -- tipped to the side, lifting two wheels 
off the ground, during at least one of the tests, the 117-page 
report said. Only one car had two wheels lift off the ground 
slightly during a test. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA officials say they planned to propose a federal rollover  
test later this year to provide consumers with information on the 
relative likelihood of rollover for cars and light trucks -- pickup 
trucks, SUVs and vans. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be a big step for the agency, since it has tried  
unsuccessfully to come up with a reliable rollover test in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway crash data shows that pickups and sport-utility  
vehicles, which have a higher center of gravity, roll over more 
than cars. But developing a test to assess rollover propensity has 
long been controversial among automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry argues such tests are not reliable since a driver  
cannot duplicate how sharp his turns are for each vehicle he 
maneuvers, even if he is driving around set cones, among other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NHTSA officials said in the report that their driving  
tests on a dozen vehicles show they can reliably repeat the 
maneuvers with the aid of the computer that makes the turns for the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in light trucks result  
from rollover, the agency said. By comparison, 22 percent of car 
deaths involve rollovers. More than 9,400 people died in rollover 
crashes in 1997, the latest year for which statistics were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller pickups and SUVs have higher rollover rates than their  
larger counterparts. Earlier this year, the agency required all new 
SUVs with wheelbases less than 110 inches to have a warning label 
saying they had a higher rollover risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the agency's rollover tests, the Ranger pickup tipped  
sharply after suddenly making a large turn while traveling 48 mph, 
then turning back even farther in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the vehicles tested that tipped did so during this type  
of maneuver, known as a fishhook. 
</P>
<P>
	In another test, the Ranger tipped up when a single large turn  
was made, similar to getting on a cloverleaf ramp, at 52 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no outriggers were present, the vehicle might well have  
rolled over,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ranger and a 1998 Chevrolet Tracker sport-utility also  
tipped up on two wheels by more than 2 inches in a test similar to 
the cloverleaf ramp that involved some braking by the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal test researchers cautioned against comparing the vehicle  
test results to draw conclusions about any individual vehicle since 
so few vehicles have been tested and officials were still deciding 
on the best test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results cannot be used to draw meaningful comparisons  
about the stability of specific models,'' an agency memo said. 
However, the report did say the Ranger ``exhibited the highest 
rollover propensity in this study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the company could not  
comment on the Ranger's performance ``until we've had a chance to 
look at the specific test results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at General Motors, which makes the Tracker, said the  
outrigger adds weight to the vehicles and skews test results. NHTSA 
also is reviewing alternative rollover tests suggested by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Three vehicles -- a 1998 Ford Explorer SUV, the Ranger pickup and  
a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina -- had tires that broke their seals and 
deflated in maneuvering the test corners, dropping the wheel rims 
onto the pavement. An agency document said when the tire was ripped 
from part of the rim, the vehicle was difficult to control and was 
more likely to slide sideways, also ``increasing the risk of 
rollover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven vehicles tipped up on two wheels only slightly, 1 to 2  
inches, in some of the tests: a 1998 Ford E-150 Club Wagon van; a 
1998 Chevrolet Astro van; the 1998 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV; a 1998 
Chevrolet Lumina car; and the Explorer, Tracker and Ranger.

<HEADLINE> Colorado's Secretary of State Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Secretary of State Victoria Buckley, who became  
the nation's highest-ranking black female Republican in a statewide 
office, has died of cardiac arrest. She was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Buckley, who had been hospitalized in January for an  
irregular heartbeat, suffered severe brain damage with no chance of 
recovery, said her cardiologist Dr. Jeb Burchenal. She died 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She overcame many challenges in life and achieved high office  
in our state through determination and hard work,'' GOP Gov. Bill 
Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman Mark Udall agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was tenacious and displayed courage in dealing with tough  
issues. Vikki will be greatly missed,'' Udall, a Colorado Democrat, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Denver in 1947, Ms. Buckley graduated from East High  
School, and attended both the University of Colorado at Denver and 
Metropolitan State College. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a deputy in the secretary of state's elections division  
for 20 years before taking the top post in 1994, becoming the first 
black woman in Colorado to hold a statewide office. At the time, 
Ms. Buckley was a single mother on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her accomplishments was returning $9 million to the state  
treasury from office fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a dedicated public servant who put the needs of others  
ahead of her own, and her sensitivity on local and national issues 
will be sorely missed,'' Rep. J. C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., said in a 
statement. ``This is not just a tragic loss for Colorado, but for 
all of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell called her rise heroic and evidence  
the American dream still works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her story is a model for those wanting to climb out of poverty  
and improve their lives,'' the Colorado Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Buckley's two terms were not without controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	She won re-election in November following a bitter battle over  
complaints that her office was in disarray because of ballot 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, a Legislative committee decided it would not  
challenge her for hiring a former campaign manager and close friend 
as a $250-an-hour consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Buckley's survivors include her parents, sister and three  
sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services were pending.

<HEADLINE> Free Speech Uproar in Berkeley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- A radio show host was thrown off the air  
and later arrested amid protests over the management of the 
venerable public radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Bernstein, host of KPFA's public affairs program  
``Flashpoints,'' was placed on administrative leave Tuesday night 
for reporting about conflict with the station's parent 
organization, the Pacifica Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted that I would be pulled from the air ... by  
people who founded the station to stand as a bastion of free 
speech,'' Bernstein said. ``This is an absolute case of 
censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was one of at least 40 protesters arrested Tuesday  
night for trespassing after they refused to leave the 50-year-old 
station. Seven other employees also were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley-based foundation took over programming, replacing  
it with taped shows, Pacifica spokeswoman Elan Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime staffers maintain that Pacifica's board wants to give  
KPFA a more mainstream image so that it can attract corporate 
donations. KPFA executive director Lynn Chadwick had earlier 
ordered the staff not to discuss or report on the conflict, Fabbri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bernstein ran segments of a news conference Tuesday by  
14 protesters who were arraigned on civil disobedience charges for 
demonstrating in an earlier protest against changes at the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I heard was Dennis Bernstein speaking. He was at the press  
conference, he was talking about the labor dispute. It was in full 
violation. It was his voice,'' Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bernstein said he ``categorically'' denies being at the  
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a staff meeting with 20 people, including the  
executive director of Pacifica, when the press conference was 
held,'' Bernstein said today. 
</P>
<P>
	When news reporters told listeners that Bernstein had been  
placed on administrative leave, the newscast was cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Since April, four people have been fired for denouncing  
management policies on the air and station manager Nicole Sawaya's 
contract was not renewed.

<HEADLINE> Texas Wants Credit for Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- FBI agent Don Clark offered a terse answer when  
asked if any single law enforcement agency led the way in the 
capture of the man suspected of being the railroad killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Clark, the agent in charge of the FBI's Houston office,  
replied at a news conference Tuesday after discussing the long 
hours his task force worked and the thousands of tips, mostly 
dead-end, it received. 
</P>
<P>
	By all other accounts, however, the man most responsible for  
brokering the remarkable surrender Tuesday of Angel Maturino 
Resendez was rookie Sgt. Drew Carter of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they didn't complain publicly, Texas authorities were  
annoyed by Clark's failure to acknowledge Carter's work and by the 
FBI's decision to circumvent the Rangers and almost instantly 
announce the arrest in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, spokesman for the Rangers' parent agency, the  
Department of Public Safety, said state officials were ``aware, of 
course, that an arrest probably was imminent and we were preparing 
to announce that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we had not done so yet because we here at the Austin  
headquarters had not received word yet Ramirez was taken into 
custody,'' he said. ``Suddenly, we began getting calls from media 
hearing that Ramirez was taken into custody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was quick to add that the DPS and FBI enjoy a close  
relationship. ``The FBI has tremendous resources and has helped us 
over the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rangers Capt. Earl Pearson, Carter's boss, said  
disagreements are part of any team law enforcement effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had established a rapport with Maturino Resendez's sister  
in Albuquerque, N.M. She persuaded her brother to walk from 
neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and surrender in El Paso on 
Tuesday. Carter met him on the bridge with a handshake, then 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark insisted that the FBI was not trying to steal the  
spotlight from the DPS, which has had jurisdictional friction with 
Washington in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the FBI -- not the DPS -- that mounted an assault on the  
Branch Davidian compound near Waco in 1993 after a bungled Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raid resulted in a deadly shootout 
and 51-day standoff. The FBI siege ended with a fire that destroyed 
the compound and left cult leader David Koresh and about 80 
followers dead.

<HEADLINE> Bush Visits Northern Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush visited  
northern Virginia's booming high-technology region Wednesday, 
collecting $400,000 for his presidential campaign and touring a 
summer camp to train youngsters for computer careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was the front-running Republican's second to Virginia  
in less than a month and attracted high-tech luminaries such as 
America Online's chairman and chief executive, Steve Case, as well 
as executives from Network Solutions and Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush's aides touted the event as an overwhelming show of  
support for Bush from northern Virginia's high-tech leaders, some 
of those in attendance were there to simply meet and hear Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Case declined to say afterward whether he supports Bush, and a  
list of donors did not include his name. ``It's early in the 
process,'' Case said as he hurried to elude a reporter at the Ritz 
Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, at a Washington news conference, Bush received the  
endorsement of former Republican presidential rival John Kasich, 
who dropped out of the race Wednesday. ``I feel as though I have a 
soul brother,'' Kasich said, wearing a Bush campaign cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting the Ohio congressman support, Bush responded, ``People  
in this country want a campaign that is positive and hopeful and 
inclusive, a campaign that attracts new faces and new voices; a 
campaign that will speak to our better angels, not our darker 
impulses; a campaign that will give America a fresh start after a 
season of cynicism. That's exactly the kind of campaign John Kasich 
was running. He's going to fit perfectly on my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich accompanied Bush to a campaign appearance in Baltimore,  
where they toured a center that teaches carpentry skills to the 
unemployed and remodels inner city homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tysons Corner, Bush addressed about 500 at the hotel in the  
heart of Virginia's ``high-tech heaven'' and repeated his campaign 
themes of cutting taxes, reducing government regulation of 
business, free trade, and improving the military and education. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took a slap at the Democratic presidential front-runner,  
Vice President Al Gore, by saying that America's current prosperity 
is not due to the Clinton-Gore administration's policies. ``They no 
more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not say whether he supports efforts by states to impose  
taxes on Internet commerce, a topic of great interest in the 
high-tech community. Business representatives, meeting in 
Williamsburg last month, said they adamantly oppose any tax that 
singles out the Internet, such as a charge on World Wide Web 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said the candidate will await the recommendation of a  
congressional commission headed by Gov. James Gilmore, who is 
endorsing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore introduced Bush at the fund-raiser and accompanied him  
on a visit to a summer computer program at Alexandria's Thomas A. 
Edison High School, where a student demonstrated a computer program 
to design houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for a new house,'' Bush quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	At the fund-raiser, Gilmore said Bush understands northern  
Virginia's high-tech needs because of his work to promote the 
growth of technology growth in Texas. Gilmore drew laughs by 
introducing Bush as the next ``webmaster of www.whitehouse.gov.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Joe Howe said he has yet to choose a  
candidate. ``I think we would all like to get to know a little more 
about this man,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, about 30 protesters chanted ``Virginia is not for  
sale'' and held signs reading ``stand up for gun safety.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Has 25 Years As Street Vendor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- It's been 25 years since Lois Bodoky's  
beauty shop burned down and she turned to selling hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodoky, known to many in Burlington simply as ``the hot dog  
lady,'' was one of the first vendors on Church Street, long before 
the three blocks dotted with restaurants and stores were blocked 
off to traffic and turned into a pedestrian mall. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, she and her husband would push their wooden maple  
cart down one side of the street and up the other during lunch hour 
as cars streamed by. 
</P>
<P>
	She now commands a place in the middle of Church Street -- a  
prime spot during the holiday shopping time in December -- and just 
below the building where she used to do hair. 
</P>
<P>
	She turned 77 on Fourth of July and plans to sell hot dogs for  
as long as she can. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of fun,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	On the busy brick-paved street, Bodoky stands out among nearly  
20 vendors. She still favors the silver cats-eye glasses, dotted 
with rhinestones, that she's worn since the 1950s. Nowadays, 
they're hard to find, and she orders hers from France. 
</P>
<P>
	She works amidst a young, casually dressed crowd, but Bodoky  
wears her white hair pinned in curls on top of her head. Her thin 
eyebrows are penciled to a pronounced curve, the skin below covered 
in a sheen of blue and then pink. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly Bodoky is known for selling hot dogs.  
</P>
<P>
	She has always used local McKenzie hot dogs and Bouyea-Fassetts  
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the price nor the menu has changed much over the years.  
A plain hot dog sells for $1, while one topped with sauerkraut, 
chili and onions, or all of the above, goes for a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lois believes in volume more than price,'' said her husband,  
John. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodoky has loyal customers, including men in suits or in  
construction clothes who down a fast lunch on a nice day, and the 
young and the unemployed who roam Church Street and appreciate a 
bargain meal. 
</P>
<P>
	But never on Sunday. And no longer during January, February and  
March. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Bodoky and her husband take a break and get away for  
their anniversary. In recent years, they've gone to Niagara Falls 
and to Plymouth, Mass., after Bodoky said she discovered she was a 
descendant of Miles Standish. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the year they're happy to be on Church Street.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bodokys' day starts around 9:30 a.m. at their home downtown.  
There, they chop onions, concoct chili and load cans of sauerkraut, 
rolls and hot dogs into the aluminum cart. 
</P>
<P>
	At around 11 a.m., they head to Church Street, towing the cart  
in a trailer behind their car. During the day, John sits behind 
Lois in a portable chair, on call to fetch more rolls or sauerkraut 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
	He drove trucks until they moved from California to Vermont in  
1971. They wanted to be near their son who lived in in New York 
City, but didn't want to live there. 
</P>
<P>
	They settled in Burlington ``and fell in love with the place,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened Lojo's, a second-floor beauty parlor on Church  
Street. But when it burned down in 1974, she had to find a new 
space. And she knew it had to be on Church Street. She looked and 
looked but never found a place that suited her or that she could 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she started thinking about hot dogs. She loved stopping at  
a hot dog stand in Brooklyn near the home of her son, now 51. 
</P>
<P>
	So she proposed the idea to John. He thought she was crazy, she  
says, but she persevered. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she loves the changes she's seen on Church Street, with  
new stores opening and more vending carts. It's what's she's 
dreamed of for Burlington and for her business. She's always had a 
vision of carts topped with beautiful umbrellas lining the street, 
just as in European cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Her most famous customer is U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who  
started campaigning for the Senate the same year she started 
selling hot dogs. Leahy has stopped by so many times over the years 
for a hot dog and a chat that the two of them have gotten to know 
each other. Leahy put a salute to Bodoky in the May 24, 1999, 
Congressional Record, to mark her 25th year in business. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Discovery Channel did a piece about Burlington, it  
featured two local landmarks: Lois Bodoky and Shelburne Farms, a 
scenic estate on Lake Champlain that has been turned into an inn 
and educational farm.

<HEADLINE> Audience Eager for Kubrick's Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A comic ballet of aeronautic copulation  
between an Air Force bomber and a refueling plane. A middle-aged 
man preying on a lonely widow so he can get close to her pubescent 
daughter. A grinning, ax-toting Jack Nicholson chopping through a 
door and maniacally announcing, ``Here's Johnny!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick was never one to spare audiences from disturbing  
ideas and images, as these scenes from his ``Dr. Strangelove,'' 
``Lolita'' and ``The Shining'' attest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, audiences will see his last foray into the unsettling  
with the opening of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' an examination of sexual 
obsession starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Some expect it to 
be highbrow soft porn. Kubrick enthusiasts anticipate a final 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most anticipated movie of the year was `Star Wars,' but  
for me, this is it,'' said Rick Curnutte, a contributing editor to 
a Web site on Kubrick. ``I'll be taking off work to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. viewers will see a slightly altered version. To fend off an  
NC-17 rating, Kubrick digitally added clothed orgy-goers to block 
some particularly explicit sex scenes during 65 seconds of footage, 
earning the movie an R rating. The racier version will be shown 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the buzz, plus the star power of Cruise and Kidman,  
``Eyes Wide Shut'' almost certainly will be Kubrick's 
highest-grossing film and has a good shot at topping $100 million, 
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., 
which tracks ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's previous best was an estimated $50 million for ``2001:  
A Space Odyssey,'' followed by ``Full Metal Jacket'' at $46 million 
and ``The Shining'' at $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' had two things going for it: the  
lure of real-life husband and wife Cruise and Kidman, and the fact 
that Kubrick had not released a movie since ``Full Metal Jacket'' 
12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's death March 7 heightened the film's intrigue in much  
the way artists' deaths can boost the value of their works. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a cloak of mystery and measured marketing by Warner Bros.,  
which has kept the movie under tight wraps per Kubrick's wishes, 
and ``Eyes Wide Shut'' probably ranks as the year's second 
most-talked-about film after the ``Star Wars'' installment. 
</P>
<P>
	Days before the movie's release, Warner remained coy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever you're expecting, it's not that,'' said studio  
spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner insists the hush-hush marketing was exactly how Kubrick  
wanted it. The day before Kubrick died, he talked by phone with 
Warner chairman Terry Semel and gave specific instructions about 
the first trailer, the ad campaign and the initial footage to 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio limited advance media screenings. The trailer and ads  
feature erotic images of Cruise and Kidman mixed with otherworldly 
shots of masked and cloaked revelers at an orgy. A few snippets of 
dialogue in the ads portend something dark and potentially 
murderous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warner has really created an aura of mystery around this movie  
that makes people want to see it,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you can't take Cruise and Kidman out of the equation,'' he  
said. ``If this was a no-name cast, all the mystery in the world 
might create a want-to-see feeling among some film fans but not the 
general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curnutte said that from what he has read about ``Eyes Wide  
Shut'' and his knowledge of Kubrick, he is expecting a serious 
movie about sex that may disappoint viewers expecting a porn film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people respect Kubrick as an artist and that he's  
going to do it in a special way,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. As for 
Cruise and Kidman, ``the odds are they're not going to do something 
sleazy or in bad taste.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rejects Disability Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has rejected federal charges that  
it unfairly withdrew job offers to applicants it believed had 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, the  
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused the aerospace 
manufacturer of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act in 
the cases of four Boeing job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said Tuesday it complied with the statute, while also  
ensuring its employees were not placed in dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boeing feels confident the decisions it made were right,  
appropriate and lawful,'' the company said in a statement released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a duty to see that individuals are not placed  
in jobs that would put them at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the government filed the charges last Tuesday Boeing  
initially declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks an injunction, back pay, penalties and  
possibly jobs for the applicants. It does not name a dollar amount.

<HEADLINE> No Signature on Yzerman Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- If Steve Yzerman has agreed to a long-term  
contract with the Detroit Red Wings, as reported, he is yet to make 
it formal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't signed it, the deal's not done yet,'' Red Wings  
spokesman John Hahn said Wednesday, adding he couldn't anticipate 
when it would be finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said Red Wings general manager Ken Holland and Larry Kelly,  
Yzerman's agent, continued to work on the contract's details. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Yzerman has already agreed to the major details of a  
four-year deal. Holland earlier told newspapers that although 
nothing had been signed, the deal was all but done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've agreed to everything but can't seem to get it in  
writing,'' he told The Oakland Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland and Kelly reached agreement last week on the language  
for Yzerman's marketing rights -- the last minor holdup in the 
contract -- after several revisions, Booth Newspapers reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the contract, which has been in a holding pattern since  
February, Yzerman would receive a $1.5 million signing bonus for 
the 1999-2000 season, which would boost his salary to $6.618 
million. He would make $8 million in each of the following three 
seasons, The Detroit News, the Oakland Press and Booth reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman, 34, led the Red Wings with 74 points and 13 power-play  
goals last season and followed that with nine goals in 10 playoff 
games. He enters this season with career totals of 592 goals and 
891 assists.

<HEADLINE> `Chicago,' Continues To Flourish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What makes ``Chicago'' run and run and run?  
</P>
<P>
	Not only run but flourish, retaining its wicked sense of fun and  
musical-comedy buoyancy. Its sassy, cynical tale of an 
opportunistic chorine and her triumph over the American justice 
system has never seemed fresher. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival of the Kander and Ebb musical, still ensconced at  
Broadway's Shubert Theater after more than two years, has had a 
major reshuffling of players, starting with the actresses who play 
its murderous leading ladies, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte d'Amboise is no stranger to the role of Roxie. She  
played it for quite a while in one of the touring companies. Her 
experience shows. On Broadway, the lithe d'Amboise is even better, 
more sexily confident, particularly in the new moves that have been 
inserted into the musical to show off her dance expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	As the equally avaricious Velma Kelly, Ruthie Henshall is a  
revelation. If Bebe Neuwirth, the original Velma, was all icy 
perfection and Ute Lemper, her successor, all exotic eccentricity, 
Henshall exudes a a brash yet winning confidence that is the 
essence of all good musical theater performers. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress, better known in her native England than here, is a  
show biz triple-threat. Her singing, dancing and sense of comedic 
timing are first-rate. Henshall is a bit of a vocal chameleon, too, 
able to belt when necessary, or wistfully sing her heart out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Barrett brings a smooth matinee idol charm -- not to  
mention a booming voice -- to the role of lawyer Billy Flynn. Roz 
Ryan is a worthy successor to the inimitable Marcia Lewis as matron 
Mama Morton, the Sophie Tucker-like keeper of the keys at the Cook 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Benjamin earns genuine sympathy as Amos, Roxie's hapless  
husband, a man ill-used by just about everyone on stage. As 
newspaper sob sister Mary Sunshine, R. Bean turns caricature into 
more than camp and comes up with a genuinely funny comic portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the astonishments of ``Chicago'' is that its musical  
pleasures never let up. The music by John Kander and Fred Ebb's 
lyrics don't so much mimic vaudeville's boisterous style as 
celebrate it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Fosse, who directed, choreographed and co-created the  
musical in 1975, drove the original with an energy that 
complemented its jaunty score. 
</P>
<P>
	And Walter Bobbie and Ann Reinking, director and choreographer  
of the revival, have done the same. They don't let the current 
ensemble slacken either. The chorus is an important part of this 
show, and several new faces in the crowd don't diminish its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many musicals make a big deal of its orchestra, but in  
``Chicago'' it is right there on stage. Band members, expertly led 
by conductor Rob Bowman, are part of the action. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, ``Chicago'' is the one show on Broadway where the  
audience lingers after the actors have taken their final bows and 
the band on stage wails its way through ``Mr. Cellophane,'' the 
show's most persistent melody. Even after more than 1,000 
performances, you can't get too much of a good thing called 
``Chicago.''

<HEADLINE> All-Star Ratings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite being played in the cozy confines of  
Fenway Park, the final baseball All-Star game of the century had 
few runs -- and the second-lowest television rating in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's 4-1 victory by the American League on Fox posted  
a 12.0 national rating and a 22 share, 9 percent lower than last 
season's NBC telecast that had a 13.3 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest rating in the game's history, a 11.8 and 21, came in  
1997, Fox's first broadcast of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in Cleveland, who showed their support by stuffing the  
ballot box and voting in four of their hometown Indians, watched 
more than any other market in the country with a 27.8 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for other major cities were Boston (25.1), St. Louis  
(19.8), Hartford (17.3) and Providence, R.I. (16.6). 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 37 million people and 11.9 million households  
watched at least part of the game, according to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the game didn't offer much excitement, the pregame  
festivities were quite a show. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, in which Boston Hall of Famer Ted Williams was  
surrounded by current and former All-Stars before he threw out the 
first pitch, was the highest-rated pregame (10.5) since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's replay of the Americans' victory over China in the  
Women's World Cup final, which was aired opposite the All-Star 
game, posted a .9 cable rating and drew 658,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game audience peaked from 9:30-10 p.m. EDT with a  
14.1 rating and stayed above 12.0 until 11 p.m. Once most of the 
starters were replaced, the rating then dropped to a 9.9 from 
11-11:30 p.m., and a 7.7 from 11:30-midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's coverage of the Home Run Derby also slipped from a 7.7  
cable rating last season to a 7.5 on Tuesday night. It was the 
second consecutive year that the cable network aired the 
competition live after showing it on tape the first five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Run Derby was the third most-watched show ever on ESPN  
with 5.7 million viewers, trailing Mark McGwire's record-breaking 
62nd home run game and the Chicago Cubs-San Francisco Giants 
one-game playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
Each cable point represents 766,000 homes on ESPN. The share is the 
percentage tuned to a program among televisions in use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Mostly Unchanged / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices drifted lower Wednesday despite two  
economic reports that appeared to reduce the likelihood that the 
Federal Reserve would increase interest rates again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the government's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond  
fell 3/32 percent, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value, as its 
yield rose to 5.91 percent from 5.90 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate reports Wednesday, the government said prices at the  
wholesale level unexpectedly declined last month while consumers' 
spending slowed dramatically. Such reports indicate the U.S. 
economy could be cooling down and thus reduce the need for an 
interest rate increase on top of last month's modest move to higher 
rates by the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation erodes the value of fixed-rate securities, such as  
Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders were awaiting Thursday report of inflation at the  
consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
fell 3/32 percent and intermediate securities fell 1/8 point to 3/16 
point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.70 percent while  
the discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.58 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.67 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.50 percent. One-year yields rose to 
4.96 percent as the discount rose 0.01 percent to 4.72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.00 percent from 4.94 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 119 3/8. The average yield to 
maturity was also unchanged at 5.51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Playboy To Cover Up Name of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A judge has sided with the owners of the popular  
``Tomb Raider'' computer game who are trying to keep the name of 
sexy heroine Lara Croft off the cover of Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, High Court Judge Humphrey Lloyd granted an  
injunction brought by Core Design Ltd. and ordered that stickers be 
placed over the Lara Croft and ``Tomb Raider'' names on the cover 
of 20,000 copies of the August edition circulated in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy connected the names to a nude layout of model Nell  
McAndrew, said by the magazine to be real-life incarnation of the 
Lara Croft character. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had been told by George Hamer, attorney for Core  
Design Ltd., that Lara's ``squeaky-clean image'' would be 
``tarnished for all time'' by any association with Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
	Core Design, because of practical considerations, did not seek  
injunctions blanking out the photo feature on two inside pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does not apply to copies of the magazine circulated  
outside Britain.

	Cohen Seeks To Repair US-Greek Ties  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen sought today to  
repair relations between the United States and Greece still bruised 
from a sharp disagreement over Kosovo policy. In talks with Greek 
Premier Costas Simitas, Cohen discussed the renewal of cooperation 
between Greece and the United States in Kosovo now that the 11-week 
NATO bombing campaign is over. Greece, with historic religious, 
ethnic and geographic ties to the Yugoslav Serb population, 
strongly opposed the NATO bombing campaign, although it stopped 
short of using its power as an alliance member to veto the effort.

	Israeli Premier To Make 1st Visit to D.C.  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- On the eve of his first visit to Washington as  
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak said the United States should 
scale back its role as ``policeman and judge'' in Mideast 
peacemaking. Barak also said that while he would resume an Israeli 
troop pullback in the West Bank suspended by his hard-line 
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, he would not stick to the tight 
timetable stipulated by the U.S.-brokered Wye River 
land-for-security agreement. Under the accord signed in October, 
the Palestinians were to assume full or partial control of 40 
percent of the West Bank before heading into talks on a permanent 
peace agreement with Israel. 

</P>
<P>
	Thais Protest at U.S. Embassy  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- More than 100 Thai environmentalists  
gathered at the U.S. embassy today to demand that the United States 
take responsibility for cleaning up some toxic Vietnam-War chemical 
defoliants recently discovered at a provincial airport. They 
presented an embassy official with two sacks of dirt which they 
said was contaminated soil. Drums of buried chemicals were found by 
workers expanding a runway at a provincial airport, near the 
seaside resort of Hua Hin. The workers renovating the runway fell 
ill, and fears arose that the chemical might be Agent Orange dumped 
by U.S. military units who were stationed there in the 1960s and 
70s.

</P>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the Mexican  
drifter suspected of killing eight people as he hopped freight 
trains around the country, turned himself in Tuesday in a deal 
brokered by his sister. Ending a six-week manhunt, the 39-year-old 
Resendez-Ramirez walked with a brother across the bridge from 
Mexico to El Paso where he was arrested. The tattooed ex-convict -- 
who is charged with three murders and linked to five other 
slayings, all of them in Texas, Kentucky and Illinois -- was on the 
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List and had been in Mexico for an 
undetermined amount of time, investigators said. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Promises To Repay Kazakstan  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia agreed today to pay off its $115 million  
debt to Kazakstan for use of the Baikonur launch pad, in an 
apparent effort to persuade Kazakstan to lift a launch ban in time 
to send a cargo ship to the Mir space station. Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Ilya Klebanov reached a debt deal with Kazak officials in 
emergency meetings in Astana, the capital of the Central Asian 
nation, said a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency. The Kazak 
government banned all launches from Baikonur on July 6.

	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Indian reconnaissance flights have  
spotted cement bunkers in a disputed Kashmir border region and 
airstrikes appear imminent, an intelligence officer said today. The 
three bunkers are near the Siachen glacier, outside the area where 
Indian forces have been battling an infiltration by Pakistan-based 
fighters for two months. Airstrikes around the town of Turtuk seem 
imminent, an intelligence officer, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press.

for a rally of their own, Iranian moderate leaders vowed that six 
days of protests on a scale unseen since the 1979 Islamic 
revolution will be brought to an end today. The huge 
demonstrations, which have left two people dead and scores injured 
or arrested, mark the first time Iranians have taken to the streets 
in such numbers to demand more freedoms in a nation hard-liners 
seek to firmly regulate.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Moments after Ted Williams threw out the first  
ball, Pedro Martinez pitched himself into the All-Star game record 
book last night. Martinez struck out five in two innings, leading 
the American League over the Nationals 4-1 for its third straight 
win. Martinez became the first pitcher to strike out the first 
three hitters in an All-Star game, fanning Barry Larkin, Larry 
Walker and Sammy Sosa.

	BOSTON (AP) -- The smoke had barely cleared from one of his  
fastballs, and already Pedro Martinez was talking about getting 
back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes home, and I have to get back to work,'' he said

4-1 win at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	There are postseason berths to secure, disappointments to make

leading the divisions, and Boston heading the wild-card race.

	Surprises, however, abound in the National League. While Atlanta  
has a five-game lead in the East and seems on track to its eighth 
straight division title, surprising Cincinnati is one percentage 
point ahead of Houston in the Central, San Francisco is 2 1/2 games up 
on Arizona in the West, and the Astros and New York Mets are 
bunched up in the wild-card standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knows the Yankees can be beat,'' the Rangers'  
Rafael Palmeiro said, ``but everyone still knows they're the team 
to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had baseball's best record in the first half, going  
56-31, and no other team in the AL Central is over .500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees (52-34), while not the invincible machine that won  
an AL record 114 games last year, hold a four-game lead in the East 
over Boston (49-39), with Toronto (47-43) three games behind the 
Red Sox, who sputtered when Nomar Garciaparra missed the final nine 
games of the first half with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, Texas (48-39) is five games ahead of Oakland  
(43-44), six in front of Seattle (42-45) and 6 1/2 in front of Anaheim 
(41-45). 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's focus will be on Seattle on Thursday night when the  
Mariners move into Safeco Field, at $517 million the most expensive 
ballpark ever. After that, attention in the AL West will shift to 
the Angels, who have gone 11-7 since the return of shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina and will try to make up for a dismal start, caused partly 
by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say we miss this guy or that guy, that doesn't go on  
here,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``There is more being made of 
our first half because expectations going into spring training were 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Los Angeles in baseball's biggest underachiever, the  
Los Angeles Dodgers. With a $79.2 million opening-day payroll, big 
thing were expected of the Dodgers. But Kevin Brown, baseball's 
first $100 million man, is just 9-6 and Los Angeles is last at 
39-47, 10 games behind the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to completely forget about the first half, to tell you  
the truth,'' catcher Todd Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Dodgers have hopes they can make a run. Not so for  
Baltimore (36-51), 16 1/2 games out despite the third-highest payroll 
on opening day ($78.5 million). A dozen of baseball's low-payroll 
franchise also have little hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the game starts, payrolls are out the window,'' Minnesota  
All-Star Ron Coomer said. ``If the ball's over the plate, if you 
put good wood on it, it doesn't matter if you're making the minimum 
or $50 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At $33.2 million, Cincinnati has the smallest-opening day  
payroll among the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning teams are teams that work together,'' Scott Williamson  
said. ``You don't have to have the big money to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But before starting the second half, players were still savoring  
Ted Williams' dramatic appearance on the field before the All-Star 
game, and Martinez's four straight strikeouts. He had five in all -- 
Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Jeff 
Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's attempt to become the first 30-game winner in more  
than three decades will be a hot topic in the second half. He was 
buzzing about all the attention Boston fans gave him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know Boston was going to be so much on top of the  
All-Star game,'' he said. ``What happened with Boston? Do the 
people eat baseball and drink baseball? It's unbelievable.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Close To Passing HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans kept their promise to  
produce alternatives to a slew of defeated Democratic proposals on 
patients' rights, moving closer to passing their version of the 
politically popular legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats remained largely unsatisfied Wednesday following  
two days of voting on amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans stayed the course and refused on a 52-48 vote to  
extend new rules for health maintenance organizations to some 161 
million people with private insurance regulated by the states. The 
result is that many of the new Senate provisions would apply only 
to the 48 million people covered by federally regulated insurance 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point ... is that the states have acted. They've acted  
without any mandate or prod from Washington and they've acted in a 
way to tailor their laws to their marketplace,'' said Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine. ``One size does not fit all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats disagreed. ``On every single amendment the people lose  
and the HMOs win,'' complained Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician who is helping to lead the  
GOP effort, said some ``very good'' Democratic ideas would be 
folded into the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll deliver,'' he told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Final passage was expected today, after further debate and votes  
on several amendments, including a Democratic proposal to give 
patients the right to sue their HMOs and collect damages when care 
has been denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Senate rejected, 53-47, a Democratic  
proposal that would have required HMOs to pay for treatment by 
specialists, even those outside of a plan's network. The GOP 
version would require ``timely'' specialist care, but not from 
outside doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	It also approved, 55-45, a GOP measure requiring coverage of  
doctor-recommended overnight hospitalization for women treated for 
breast cancer. Democrats support the idea, but voted against the 
proposal because it eliminated one of their provisions easing 
access to clinical trials for the dying or seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to pass the GOP plan, which President  
Clinton has signaled he would veto. The House has yet to consider 
patients' rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., was working with a handful  
of Democrats to fashion a compromise more to their liking, said his 
spokesman, Nicholas Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee has support from three Republican colleagues and needs a  
fourth to reach 50 votes, assuming all 45 Democrats went along, 
Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a single Democrat has crossed party lines during the debate,  
but a handful of Republicans have sided with Democrats at times. 
They include Chafee, Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Peter Fitzgerald 
of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania 
and John Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald, McCain and Specter also were willing to compromise,  
Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have offered new federal rights for patients in  
HMOs or other managed care plans, but Republicans are more modest 
on virtually every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accuse Republicans of turning their backs on millions  
of Americans who are frustrated by how their health care is 
delivered; Republicans argue that Democrats would increase costs so 
much that even more people would be forced to go without health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the GOP proposals were first introduced Wednesday, after  
a series of votes over two days in which they voted down the 
Democrats' version: 
</P>
<P>
	--On emergency room care: Republicans agreed that insurers should  
pay for care during an emergency -- and after a patient is medically 
stable, a retreat from their opening position. But Democrats said 
the plan still had too many loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	--On women's health: Democrats would let women choose  
gynecologists as their primary care doctors; Republicans would not. 
But the GOP moved closer to the Democrats by allowing pregnant 
women to see obstetricians without prior approval.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Speak at Gore Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Outgunned in fund raising by Republican George  
W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore is rolling out his biggest 
artillery in the battle over campaign cash: President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the master of fund raising, will headline a Gore  
reception Aug. 7 at the Statehouse Convention Center in Little 
Rock, Ark. That will be followed by four Washington dinners, two on 
Aug. 10 and two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, they mark Clinton's debut in raising money for  
Gore's drive to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore's 
campaign could not provide an estimate of how much they hoped to 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton fund-raising puts Gore in the awkward position of  
relying on the president at the same time Gore is trying to 
establish his own political identity and separate himself from 
doubt's about Clinton's moral leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's help was  
not prompted by Bush's collection of a record-shattering $36 
million in the first six months of the year, about double what Gore 
raised. Adding to Gore's troubles, Democratic rival Bill Bradley 
showed surprisingly strong fundraising strength, collecting $11.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president stands ready to help in whatever way he can, and  
this is certainly one important way he can help the vice 
president,'' Lockhart said. He said Clinton had always planned to 
help Gore, and that there had been discussions about fund raising 
as early as the beginning of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said reports of strain between Clinton and Gore were  
just ``senseless chatter that's going on in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the White House declined to adopt Gore's proposal to  
require a photo license for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton believes the idea has merit but that it  
does not have a chance of being approved in the current Congress. 
``As far as the president is concerned,'' Lockhart said, ``these 
are issues for down the road because with this Congress, we're not 
going anyplace on issues like that.''

<HEADLINE>  Alleged Railway Killer Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- One of the most intense manhunts in the history  
of the Southwest ended with a simple handshake between a Texas 
Ranger and a tattooed Mexican drifter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, suspected in a terrifying series of  
killings along railways in three states, took himself off the FBI's 
10 Most Wanted list Tuesday by surrendering at an El Paso border 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a puzzling move for an elusive man who could face the  
death penalty for brutal slayings that began nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez, 39, who faced a court appearance today, is  
charged with three killings and suspected in five more. His 
surrender was aided by family members in contact with a rookie 
Texas Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the best news in Weimar since the end of World  
War II,'' said Bernie Kosler, mayor of the tiny south Texas town 
where Rev. Norman Sirnic, his wife, Karen, and 73-year-old 
Josephine Konvicka were bludgeoned to death earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of his surrender, Resendez-Ramirez was flown to  
Houston where authorities interrogated him for nearly eight hours 
about the slayings of two area women: Noemi Dominguez, a 
26-year-old school teacher, and Dr. Claudia Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	Police booked the man -- whose real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes  
Resendis -- on a burglary charge linked to Benton's death on Dec. 
17, 1998. At a hearing early today, he tried to enter a guilty plea 
but was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is linked to five Texas slayings and charged in  
three others in Kentucky and Illinois, many expect him to face 
prosecution first in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be tried first in Harris County, believe me,'' said  
prosecutor Ted Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a charge of capital murder can only be filed when  
there is evidence that a murder occurred during the commission of a 
select group of felonies. Burglary is included in that group. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez's surrender agreement included assurances of  
family visits, a psychological evaluation and promises that he 
would be safe in jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement does not shield him from the death penalty. Mexico  
has refused to return suspects to countries where they may face a 
death penalty, which Mexico does not have. 
</P>
<P>
	And Resendez-Ramirez surrendered himself to the state that has  
executed more people -- 180 -- that any other since the death penalty 
was declared constitutional in 1976. Harris County prosecutors have 
sent more killers to death row than any other in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety,  
said he thought the suspect might have feared bounty hunters in 
both Mexico and the United States. A $125,000 reward had been 
offered for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez's arrest capped a massive six-week  
international manhunt by thousands of investigators and railroad 
authorities. The fugitive was thought to have traveled by hopping 
freight trains, finding victims living near the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad communities were terrified.  
</P>
<P>
	``The stores around here sold out of pistols,'' Kosler said.  
``That worried me, thinking that some innocent person might get 
hurt. We're used to walking up to everyone's house. Now, you better 
call ahead or you may get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Resendez-Ramirez's alleged victims were bludgeoned to  
death, and fingerprints linked him to at least some of the crimes. 
Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail of terror started with the Aug. 29, 1997, slaying of a  
21-year-old college student in Kentucky who was attacked along with 
his girlfriend while walking along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the killings have come since September. The most  
recent were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old 
daughter, found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez slipped through U.S. hands and was released by  
border agents to Mexico on June 2 even though he was wanted for 
questioning in a murder. Investigators believe he went on to kill 
four more people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping that everybody can start sleeping again, because  
there have been a lot of people who were not sleeping well,'' said 
the Rev. Ralph Ludwig, who took over as interim pastor at Weimar 
United Church after Sirnic and his wife were found dead on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The case broke over the weekend when Texas Ranger Drew Carter,  
who had been cultivating a relationship with the suspect's 
relatives, received a call from the suspect's sister, Manuela 
Maturino, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M. Talks eventually led to 
one of the most high-profile arrests in Rangers' history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stuck out his hand, I stuck out my hand and we shook hands,  
and then I handcuffed him and he was in custody,'' Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firm To Pay $21M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Japanese chemical company Nippon Goshei  
agreed today to plead guilty and pay a $21 million criminal fine 
for participating in a 17-year international conspiracy to fix the 
price of food preservatives known as sorbates, the Justice 
Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a former Nippon Goshei executive agreed to plead  
guilty and pay a $350,000 fine, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Goshei will become the third company to plead guilty and  
cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the department's 
antitrust division of the plot it says affected nearly $1 billion 
of sales in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Eastman Chemical Co., a U.S. sorbate producer,  
pleaded guilty and was fined $11 million. Last month, the German 
pharmaceutical giant Hoechst AG also pleaded guilty and was fined 
$36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorbates are used to preserve cheese and baked goods, or other  
high-moisture or high-sugar, dairy and processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-count criminal information was filed in U.S. District  
Court in San Francisco charging the company and the executive with 
conspiring the raise and fix prices and allocate market shares 
between competitors in the sale of sorbates from 1979 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an incredibly long-lived international conspiracy,''  
said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gary R. Spratling, the 
antitrust division's enforcement chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive is Hiromi Ito, former marketing and sales director  
of Nippon Goshei's Fine Chemicals Business Department. He also has 
agreed to cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The department will continue to seek out and prosecute all  
international conspiracies that defraud American consumers and 
unfairly restrain free and open competition in our markets,'' said 
Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The court document charged the company and Ito violated the  
Sherman Act by meeting with competitors to raise and set prices for 
sorbates sold in this country and abroad, allocate market shares 
and exchange price data to police the agreements.

<HEADLINE> No Sweat in San Juan for NBA Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Fittingly, the Tournament of the  
Americas pre-Olympic qualifying tournament began Wednesday with a 
day off for the United States and its NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	There should be a lot of days off, competitively speaking, as  
the American players embark on this mid-July vacation, otherwise 
known as qualifications for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opens Thursday against Uruguay, one of the  
lesser-known and lowest-regarded teams in the 10-nation field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it starts with a `U' and ends with a `Y','' said Allan  
Houston of the New York Knicks. ``And I would guess they are 
probably perimeter oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The international style of play, with its premium on outside  
shooting and its aversion to physical play, does not exactly inject 
fear into the hearts of the fourth U.S. national team made up of 
professional players. 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the second time the United States has had to  
qualify for the Olympics in men's basketball. The other time was 
1992, when the original Dream Team won the Tournament of the 
Americas in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying became necessary last summer when the U.S. failed to  
win the world championships in Athens, Greece, after a league 
lockout forced NBA players from the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Grouped with the United States in the opening round are Cuba,  
Argentina, Canada and Uruguay. Group `B' consists of Puerto Rico, 
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In first round games Wednesday, Uruguay defeated Cuba 87-84 in  
overtime and Canada beat Argentina 77-70. In late games, it was 
Puerto Rico-Venezuela and Brazil-Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players insist they are not overlooking the  
competition.

	``I don't put anything past anybody in the game of basketball,''  
Vin Baker of the Seattle SuperSonics said. ``As confident as we are 
and as good as we are, anything can happen. It can snow in San 
Juan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team is relatively young, with only three players --  
Steve Smith of Atlanta, Tim Hardaway of Miami and Gary Payton of 
Seattle -- older than 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine NBA veterans -- Houston, Baker, Smith, Hardaway, Payton,  
Jason Kidd, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Tom Gugliotta -- will also 
have spots on the Olympic roster next summer. The other three 
roster spots on the qualifying team are held by three rookies -- 
Wally Szczerbiak of Minnesota, Richard Hamilton of Washington and 
Elton Brand of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta broke his nose and Hamilton sprained his ankle  
Wednesday as the U.S. team held its final practice. Both are 
expected to be available Thursday when the U.S. plays Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta was elbowed in the nose by Kidd, while  
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton sprained his right ankle while stepping off the  
practice court. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no true center on the American team, although Duncan,  
Garnett and Baker are tall enough and adept enough to play the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see zone defenses, and they are going to make  
us work for 30 seconds when we're on defense,'' Kidd said. 
``They'll use a lot of the shot clock, and while we're used to 
keeping it inside, they'll throw it inside to set something up 
outside for one of their shooters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of NBA players are scattered across the rosters  
of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Nash of Dallas and Todd MacCullough of Philadelphia are  
playing for Canada, and Felipe Lopez of Vancouver is playing for 
the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Jackson of Indiana plans to join the Dominican team for the  
second round, which begins Monday. Four of the five teams in each 
group advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The American players are mindful of the reputations of the NBA  
teams that preceded them, including the 1992 team that won the gold 
medal in Barcelona, the 1996 team that won in Atlanta, and the 1994 
team that won the world championships in Toronto but was more 
remembered for its in-your-face style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys tend to get on the U.S. about playing flamboyant, but  
you've got to understand the other teams are doing the same thing. 
You just don't understand what they're saying,'' Garnett said. 
``Rude in their country might be to give you an elbow. Rude in our 
country is to stick your finger up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball part of it is about trying to win. That's the  
way you've got to look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After playing Uruguay, the Americans play Canada on Friday,  
Argentina on Saturday and Cuba on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important games will be the semifinals a week from  
Saturday. The winners of those two games earn berths at the Sydney 
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams Gets All-Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tears flooded Ted Williams' eyes, and the biggest,  
toughest players in baseball got choked up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	They formed a huge mass around him on the mound at Fenway Park  
before the All-Star game Tuesday night. No one wanted to leave his 
side. No one cared if his opening pitch or the game was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a baseball love-fest, the stars of the night and the  
stars of the century swarming around Williams, gazing at him in 
awe, reaching over each other to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a chance to meet one of the best hitters in the  
game, and you see tears running down his eyes for the appreciation 
the fans and all of us gave him, it's quite a special time,'' Mark 
McGwire said. ``I'm just happy he knows who I am, and he talked to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Williams, his balance and health so precarious  
now after two strokes and a broken hip, wanted to reach out to all 
of them. He wanted to swap baseball stories through the night, stay 
there on the field where he once played and soak in the cheers that 
he refused to acknowledge during his storied career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a scene reminiscent of Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic  
torch at the start of the 1996 Atlanta Games -- Ali shaking, the 
crowd cheering wildly, the greatest athletes in the world staring 
at him in awe. When Ali later made the rounds of the games, even 
athletes like Michael Jordan fawned over him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it was with these all-stars and Williams, an  
all-star himself for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He rode out in a green golf cart from center field after  
everyone had been introduced -- Aaron and Mays, Feller and Musial 
from summers past, McGwire and Sosa, Ripken and Griffey from the 
night's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Players watched as the adoring crowd stood and cheered him, the  
roar almost as loud as the jets that buzzed Fenway after the 
national anthem. And they watched Williams respond by waving his 
cap, a gesture he never made as a player, even after he homered in 
his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gods don't answer letters,'' John Updike wrote of that moment  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, a baseball god did.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was often booed by Fenway fans during his playing days,  
but now no one is more popular in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell, I haven't had a base hit in 30 years, and I'm a better  
hitter now than I've ever been in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams waved all the way down the right field line as the golf  
cart proceeded toward the mound. Even the policemen ringing the 
field applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, spontaneously, the players, young and old, closed  
ranks on him, moving in to be as near as possible to the last man 
to hit .400 -- .406 in 1941 -- and who is arguably the greatest 
hitter in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's Sammy?'' Williams bellowed, calling for Sosa, then  
shaking his hand. Williams wore a big smile and seemed to want to 
reach out to all of them. He grabbed Mark McGwire's shoulder and 
spoke with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward Williams recounted what he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted me to meet (Don) Mattingly when he was going good,  
and (Wade) Boggs. And we went to this high-class restaurant and 
we're talking about hitting, the intimate part of hitting, where 
you put your foot, everything like that. Finally, I said, 'Did you 
guys ever smell the wood when you foul one real hard?' 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked at one another, like what's this guy smoking now?  
And I said I could smell it quite a few times, and it smelled like 
wood burning. I said the next time I see Willie Mays, the next time 
I see Cepeda, the next time I see Reggie Jackson, I'm going to ask 
them. They said, `Oh, sure, we've smelled it, too.' So I asked 
McGwire the same thing, and he said he could smell it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the time,'' McGwire told him.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams wanted to keep talking, but time and his own emotions  
wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to talk baseball with everybody out there,'' McGwire  
said, adding that a lot of players got choked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker of the Rockies was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tears were coming out of Ted's eyes,'' Walker said. ``I had to  
turn away because tears were coming out my eyes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the players backed away and Williams took the ball to  
throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Carlton Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is he?'' Williams asked. His vision, once the best in  
the game, has suffered, too, and he can't see well outside a narrow 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn pointed him toward Fisk and held him steady.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got you,'' Gwynn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams joked a bit, then tossed a soft pitch to Fisk, inside  
but all the way to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk jogged to the mound to hug him.  
</P>
<P>
	Other players came back to crowd around Williams, and after a  
few minutes the public address announcer pleaded with the players 
to return to the dugout. The game was running about 15 minutes 
late, but no one wanted this moment to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of funny,'' Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra  
said. ``When the announcer asked everybody to go back to the 
dugout, everybody said no. It didn't matter. What time was the 
first pitch? Nobody cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rafael Palmeiro: ``That's the chance of a lifetime. The  
game can wait ... We had chills all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, the players expressed a sense of reverence about the  
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meeting Ted Williams was probably the greatest thrill of my  
career,'' Cleveland's Jim Thome said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Williams was helped back into the cart, and the crowd  
roared again until he made his way to his box seat along the first 
base line with commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it great!'' Williams said. ``I can only describe it as  
great. It didn't surprise me all that much because I know how these 
fans are here in Boston. They love this game as much as any players 
and Boston's lucky to have the faithful Red Sox fans. They're the 
best.''

<HEADLINE> La Nina To Continue Through Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government researchers are predicting the  
current La Nina climate episode will last through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	That means continued dry conditions along the East Coast --  
except for areas affected by more frequent hurricanes -- and 
continued wet weather in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration's National Centers for Environmental Prediction said 
that while La Nina's strength has diminished from last winter, it 
will continue to influence weather around the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is characterized by unusually cold sea-surface  
temperatures in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific, which 
trigger atmospheric patterns that influence weather around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Pacific Northwest, that means wetter-than-normal  
conditions. Along the southern tier, states typically experience 
drier, warmer conditions. And years with a La Nina usually have 
more Atlantic hurricanes than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	While a recent weakening of the easterly trade winds in the  
eastern and central equatorial Pacific increased sea surface 
temperatures slightly, the overall upper ocean temperature still 
indicates La Nina conditions will continue, said Dr. Louis 
Uccellini, director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction.

<HEADLINE> Hill Agrees To Race One More Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVERSTONE, England (AP) -- Former world drivers' champion Damon  
Hill ended speculation of retirement and announced today he would 
race for the remainder of the season for the Jordan Formula One 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Briton had threatened to quit after crashing out  
of last month's French Grand Prix, but a fifth-place finish at last 
Sunday's British GP -- expected to be his last race -- enticed him to 
continue racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to helping the Jordan team achieve its  
highest-ever constructors' championship position,'' Hill said in a 
statement released by the Silverstone-based team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team chief Eddie Jordan said Hill's decision to finish the year  
was a major boost for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``His contribution to this massive team effort is invaluable and  
we are all eagerly anticipating the last eight races,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, currently on vacation with his family in Spain, will  
rejoin the team this week for testing at Monza, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is currently third in the constructors' championship.  
</P>
<P>
	Hill, the 1996 world drivers' champion, cited poor form and a  
lack of enthusiasm for his desire to quit racing following the 
French GP, which was won by his teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a week of intense speculation, Hill agreed to race at  
Silverstone to bid farewell to his fans but didn't make any 
statement about his future.

<HEADLINE> House To Debate Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House wants to spend $30 million to help  
states buy land for parks, though lawmakers would still provide far 
less than President Clinton wants for such purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The House hoped to complete its debate today on a $14.1 billion  
measure financing the Interior Department and federal cultural 
programs. On Tuesday, lawmakers voted 213-202 to amend it by 
requiring that $30 million be spent for grants to all 50 states 
from the now-dormant land and water conservation fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund has not distributed money to the states since 1994. It  
collects $900 million annually from offshore oil and gas drilling 
leases. Sixty percent of the money is to be used for state grants 
and the rest for federal land acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, states receiving the federal grants must  
provide an equal amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was sponsored by Reps. James McGovern, D-Mass.; Tom  
Campbell, R-Calif.; Joseph Hoeffel, D-Pa.; and Rush Holt, D-N.J. It 
was supported 157-45 by Democrats and opposed 157-55 by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sponsors' victory, the bill provides less than  
one-third of the near $800 million Clinton requested for federal 
and state land purchases under his so-called ``lands legacy'' 
proposal. And the amendment's fate is uncertain because the Senate 
version of the bill contains no such language. 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million would come from cutting coal research and other  
programs in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same measure, the House rejected an effort by Rep. Tom  
Coburn, R-Okla., to cut $2 million from the Fish and Wildlife 
Service's $711 million resource management program. The 287-131 
vote marked a setback for ongoing conservative efforts to trim 
spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Interior measure contains nearly $200 million less  
than this year's bill and nearly $1.2 billion less than Clinton has 
requested. The House planned to continue debating the bill on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also provide less than Clinton wants for land and  
water conservation, restoration of Florida's Everglades and energy 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also approved an $8.4 billion measure financing  
construction at U.S. military bases in the United States and abroad 
for the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Unveils Light Beam Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A technology using light beams to carry data  
through the air offers a new way to meet Internet demand in cities 
where digging up streets for cables is too costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent Technologies, the former research and equipment arm of  
AT&AMP;T, unveiled the OpticAir system Wednesday, saying it transmits 
data 65 times faster than the next-fastest wireless system, which 
uses radio waves. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-pack sized transmitters could provide a powerful new  
way for operators of Internet ``backbones'' -- networks of 
fiber-optic cables that carry data around the world -- to handle an 
ever-increasing torrent of business traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent said it expects to offer the technology for sale within a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	OpticAir converts data, voice and video information into a laser  
beam, shooting it through a two-inch wide lens. The signal travels 
between roof-tops or office windows and is then passed back to a 
fiber-optic cable for the rest of its journey. 
</P>
<P>
	There are drawbacks like those encountered with a microwave  
system: The laser signal can't travel more than three miles and a 
direct line-of-sight is required between transmitter and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	And much like a wireless microwave system, OpticAir is not a  
practical alternative for individual consumers. The equipment 
involved with either system carries too high a price and far too 
much data for most people to afford or need. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, demand for new capacity has been doubling every three  
or four months at Uunet, a unit of MCI WorldCom that's one of the 
biggest backbone operators in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that growth is coming from businesses, although  
consumers are adding to the demand by subscribing to new high-speed 
services being offered through cable TV wires and so-called digital 
subscriber lines using regular copper phone wires. 
</P>
<P>
	While the new technology doesn't offer nearly as much capacity  
as fiber-optic cables, it does provide a lower-cost alternative to 
the often-complex task of installing new underground lines in urban 
areas -- where demand is growing fastest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, there's no more capacity in the ground and no  
more right of way, especially in older metropolitan areas,'' said 
Lisa Pierce, an industry analyst for Giga Information Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless transmission ``is a lot a cheaper than going the ground  
route,'' said Pierce. Even if a landlord charged exorbitant rates 
to put wireless equipment on a rooftop, it would still be cheaper 
than putting new cable in the ground, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OpticAir system can simultaneously transmit at different  
wavelengths -- or colors -- of light, each carrying distinct streams 
of information. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, a company that has been building and buying  
fiber-optic systems to create a global network, will be the first 
company to test the OpticAir system, starting in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity provided by the new technology ``could offer a  
breakthrough method to help our global customers bypass local 
bottlenecks and offer leading-edge services,'' said Wally Dawson, a 
Global Crossing executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said other applications for  
OpticAir might include sending data across a corporate or college 
campus, as well as for temporary data links during special events 
such as live broadcasts of concerts.

<HEADLINE> Tagliabue Warns Phillips on Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips, the troubled running back who  
revived his career in Europe, was told Wednesday by commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue that he will be fined for past misdeeds if he signs 
with an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who became the first running back to gain more than  
1,000 yards in the NFL Europe's eight-game season, met for an hour 
with Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard to meet my responsibilities in NFL Europe this  
spring and I'm determined to do the same in the NFL starting this 
summer,'' Phillips said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The league later said in a statement that Tagliabue told  
Phillips ``that as a result of past misconduct, he will be subject 
to a substantial fine this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the amount will be determined later,  
presumably depending on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips pleaded no contest to beating a former girlfriend while  
at Nebraska, then left the school after his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams chose Phillips as the sixth overall pick of  
the 1996 draft, but he was arrested on drunken driving charges and 
spent 23 days in jail during 19 months with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was subsequently signed by the Miami Dolphins, but played  
little. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cut by the team at the beginning of last season after  
being arrested on charges of hitting a woman who refused to dance 
with him at a nightclub. He pleaded guilty to battery and received 
six months' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips revived his career in Europe, gaining 1,021 yards and  
scoring 14 touchdowns as he led Barcelona to the league 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a number of teams are interested in him, including  
Baltimore, Green Bay, San Francisco and Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Doc Faces Sex Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The surgeon who reshaped Paula Jones' nose has  
been sued by his office assistant, who claims he demanded sex as a 
condition for keeping her job. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Sabia said in court papers that immediately after Dr.  
Thomas W. Loeb did Mrs. Jones' surgery in July 1998, he went into 
his office, dropped his pants and demanded oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabia, 36, also said Loeb had planned to videotape Mrs. Jones'  
surgery and sell it to the highest-bidding tabloid. The suit did 
not say whether the videotape was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb admitted he had an affair with Sabia but said it was brief,  
consensual and initiated by her. Loeb said he ended the affair and 
Sabia has been demanding money ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest thing to do would have been to pay her off, but I  
was not willing to be extorted,'' Loeb said Tuesday. ``I trust in 
our legal system and I'm sure I'll be vindicated in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabia said in papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court  
that she submitted to Loeb for nearly nine months because she 
needed the salary. Her lawsuit asks for unspecified damages and 
attorneys' fees.

<HEADLINE> Frankel Targeted Southern States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Martin Frankel, the fugitive suspected  
of bilking insurance companies out of hundreds of millions of 
dollars, was smart to do business in the South, where experts say 
there is often little state oversight of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question about it. He took advantage of small states that  
don't have the horses to keep up with what he was doing,'' said Bob 
Hunter, insurance director for the Consumer Federation of America 
and former Texas insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a Greenwich, Conn., money manager who vanished in May,  
is suspected of embezzling at least $215 million -- and perhaps as 
much as $915 million -- from seven insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Six were in the South -- three in Mississippi, and one each in  
Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma -- and one was a Southern border 
state, Missouri, which was known in the '80s for its lax industry 
regulations. The insurers' parent company was Tennessee-based 
Thunor Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Southern states have reputations for tight insurance  
regulations -- Texas and Florida -- but most others ``are 
understaffed and don't have the funds to chase around a 
billion-dollar industry,'' said Brendan Bridgeland of the Center 
for Insurance Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's insurance department's budget ranks near the bottom.  
It amounts to 0.04 percent of the premiums state residents pay, 
compared with 0.17 percent for Florida, according to the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 Money magazine story on insurance regulation included a  
list of states where insurers have strong influence over state 
regulators and lawmakers. Ten of the top 12 were in the South. The 
others were Missouri and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
Franklin businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling 
insurance companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any 
wrongdoing and said he is a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in the affected states say they should be applauded  
for discovering what was happening before the problem got any 
worse. Before he fled, Frankel reportedly was pursuing deals that 
would have vastly enlarged his insurance empire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennessee department examiners began to ask questions as far  
back as last year about some of the things that were bothersome to 
them,'' said Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually if an insurance company is in financial difficulty,  
the red flags are going to be consumer complaints, slowness in 
paying claims. That wasn't the case here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were potential red flags. One was extremely heavy  
trading and remarkable returns as high as 20 percent that the 
insurers believed they were earning on investments of U.S. Treasury 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma regulators noticed something strange during a 1997  
review of one of Frankel's companies, Insurance Commissioner 
Carroll Fisher said. Farmers and Ranchers Life Insurance Co. of 
Oklahoma City had made a large number of securities transactions 
with Liberty National. Examiners traced the trades and were 
satisfied they were legal. 
</P>
<P>
	If they had taken their probe one step further, they might have  
made a startling discovery, Carroll conceded: Frankel wasn't 
allowed to run a brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission had stripped his license  
several years earlier, and Liberty National was an unlicensed 
brokerage. It took the same name as a licensed Michigan firm that 
had nowhere near the assets to handle such heavy trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee regulators say they kept a close eye on Thunor Trust  
and its one in-state insurer, Franklin American Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	State examiners questioned unusually heavy trading of Franklin  
American bonds, but they received copies of financial statements 
that appeared to back them up, so no action was taken, said Marilyn 
Elam, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Commerce and 
Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until Franklin American and Liberty National  
flagrantly violated a state law that regulators took action. 
</P>
<P>
	The state requires an insurance company's assets be kept in a  
bank, but Liberty National had control of them. The state ordered 
the company to place the bonds in a bank, which was done, but then 
regulators discovered the bonds had been removed again. 
</P>
<P>
	They ordered the money placed in another bank. When Frankel  
fled, the state seized $57 million from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam dismissed critics who say Tennessee does not aggressively  
regulate insurers. She said Tennessee is a ``free enterprise 
state'' that wants to protect policyholders without being ``so 
heavy-footed that we squash the rights of businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, John Summers, a Nashville lawyer and lobbyist who often  
battles the insurance industry, said the relationship between the 
state and the insurance industry is too cozy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's virtually no regulation,'' he said. ``What you have is  
the fox guarding the henhouse.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank Rescue Funds Still Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Big bond issues not enough to replenish Thai bank rescue fund    	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- More money will likely have to be  
raised for Thailand's rescue fund for failing financial 
institutions, the central bank's governor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatu Mongol Sonakul told reporters that $13.5 billion in bond  
issues to date has been insufficient to cover losses by the 
nation's financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling rescue fund illustrates the difficulties still  
facing the financial system two years after the country was knocked 
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatu Mongol did not say whether he had proposed any means to  
replenish the rescue fund, nor did he say whether he has discussed 
the matter with the Finance Ministry, the lead player in restoring 
the country's economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the fund spent about $27 billion to shore up weak  
financial institutions, with much of the money borrowed from the 
domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 56 non-bank finance companies have been shut down by  
the government and seven commercial banks have been nationalized by 
the central bank. The fund is the largest creditor to all of these 
failed institutions.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Earnings Up 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Sweeping reorganization, cost  
cutting and shifts to some higher-profit products helped 
AlliedSignal Inc. post a 13 percent jump in second-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from continuing operations was up 12 percent, on sharply  
higher profits in the aerospace systems, turbine technologies and 
transportation products divisions within AlliedSignal, which is 
awaiting shareholder approval of its planned merger with Honeywell 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal, which also makes automotive products, chemicals  
and advanced materials, reported net income for the April-June 
quarter totaling $395 million, or 70 cents per share, matching 
estimates from analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, AlliedSignal earned $350 million, or 61  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $400 million, or 71 cents per share, including  
one-time pretax charges of $258 million, primarily for severance 
pay and reorganization in its aerospace business. AlliedSignal also 
recorded a pretax gain of $268 million from selling its stock in 
Harrisburg, Pa.-based AMP after AlliedSignal failed in its hostile 
takeover bid last year of the world's largest maker of electrical 
and electronic interconnection systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the second quarter slipped to $3.82 billion from $3.87  
billion, hurt by double-digit declines in sales of performance 
polymers and specialty chemicals and electronic solutions. 
Excluding company divestitures, sales were up 5 percent, 
AlliedSignal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``AlliedSignal is in the midst of an extensive and accelerating  
business transformation'' unprecedented in the company, said 
Lawrence A. Bossidy, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes a companywide program to increase productivity and  
customer satisfaction, layoffs related to the Honeywell merger, and 
a new business plan including use of the Internet for sales, 
finding cheaper sources of raw materials, and receiving prototype 
designs for products customers want. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal said it will hold a special shareholders meeting on  
Sept. 1 for approval of its merger with Minneapolis-based 
Honeywell. Under the proposed deal, AlliedSignal would buy 
Honeywell for about $15 billion in stock, creating a $24 billion 
industrial powerhouse that makes everything from aircraft landing 
systems to home thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would keep Honeywell's better-known name, but  
use Morris Township as its headquarters. The companies said they 
will cut 4,500 jobs while combining their work forces of 120,000 
people in more than 95 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AlliedSignal rose $1.25 to $66.25 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Sahara Turned From Grass to Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rains stopped coming, the temperature rose  
and the great grasslands of North Africa turned to desert a few 
thousand years ago -- changes that may have helped spur development 
of civilization in the Nile Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The change to today's arid climate was not gradual, but occurred  
in two episodes -- the first 6,700 to 5,500 years ago and the second 
4,000 to 3,600 years ago, according to a paper published today by 
the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latter was very severe, ruining ancient civilizations and  
socio-economic systems,'' the researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of researchers headed by Martin Claussen of Germany's  
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research analyzed computer 
models of climate over the past several thousand years. 
</P>
<P>
	They concluded that the change to today's desert climate in the  
Sahara was triggered by changes in the Earth's orbit and the tilt 
of Earth's axis. Some 9,000 years ago, Earth's tilt was 24.14 
degrees, compared with the current 23.45 degrees, and the point in 
the Earth's orbit that is closest to the sun occurred at the end of 
July, as compared with early January now. At that time, the 
Northern Hemisphere received more summer sunlight, which amplified 
the African and Indian summer monsoon, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While the changes in Earth's orbit occurred gradually, the  
switch in North Africa's climate and vegetation was abrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Sahara, ``we find an abrupt decrease in vegetation from a  
green Sahara to a desert shrubland within a few hundred years,'' 
the scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer were grasses and other plants collecting water and  
releasing it back into the atmosphere; now sand baked in the 
stronger sun and rivers and streams dried up. 
</P>
<P>
	This event devastated ancient civilizations in the moist desert,  
now remembered only by rock paintings. The change may have spurred 
them to move to the Nile Valley and other river valleys where great 
civilizations developed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The migration of people from the Sahara to the Nile is a  
hypothesis,'' Claussen said in response to questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not this migration was the stimulus for the high  
civilization there is not yet known. ... For me it seems 
plausible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claussen and his team used computer models of climate to  
calculate the impact of weather, oceans and vegetation separately 
and in various combinations. They concluded that oceans played only 
a minor role in the Sahara's desertification. 
</P>
<P>
	The research also suggested that land use practices of humans  
who lived in and cultivated the Sahara were not significant causes 
of the desertification. 
</P>
<P>
	Claussen noted that changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt will  
continue to occur in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	As to their effects, he said: ``What will happen in the future,  
frankly, we can only speculate.''

<HEADLINE>  Peru Captures Guerrilla Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The last remaining commander of one of Latin  
America's most violent rebel movements was captured today after an 
army patrol spotted him in a jungle gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	Shining Path guerrilla leader Oscar Ramirez Durand was detained  
along with three female rebels early this morning in Huancayo, 125 
miles east of Lima, as he tried to escape through the rugged 
highland region, President Alberto Fujimori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez Durand, 46, who goes by the nom de guerre ``Comrade  
Feliciano,'' was the last national leader of the insurgency still 
at large. He took control of the movement in 1992 after the capture 
of its founder and leader Abimael Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori did not say if Ramirez Durand was wounded when he was  
taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 army commandos had been in pursuit of Ramirez  
Durand in a region east of Lima where the highland jungle butts up 
against the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
	The army took up the chase at dawn Tuesday, when soldiers  
spotted the rebel leader from just 300 yards away. He managed to 
escape across a river and disappear into the jungle, prompting the 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori, speaking from a military base in Jauja, near where the  
guerrilla leader was captured, said the detainees would be taken to 
Lima and held at a high-security prison at a naval base in Callao, 
Lima's port. Guzman is serving a life sentence at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori said Ramirez Durand would be submitted to a secret  
military trial and then spend the rest of his life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez Durand, the Shining Path's top military strategist under  
Guzman, escaped capture after Guzman and other leaders were taken 
prisoner in Lima hideouts. He pulled back into remote jungle 
regions on the eastern slopes of the Andes and worked to reorganize 
the decimated guerrilla band. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts on the Maoist rebellion said the capture was another  
hard blow to the guerrilla movement, known in Spanish as Sendero 
Luminoso, but it did not mean the death of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez Durand's capture ``would have a great impact on Sendero  
but not like that of Abimael. It would not be the end of Sendero,'' 
said Carlos Tapia, who has studied the Shining Path since its 
inception and authored a book about the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is much easier to replace Feliciano in a new terrorist  
leadership than it was to replace Abimael Guzman,'' Tapia said 
hours before the capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Guzman's arrest in 1992, the rebel movement had the  
Peruvian government on the ropes, killing village authorities, 
ambushing army patrols and unleashing deadly waves of car-bomb 
attacks in Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shining Path had as many as 10,000 armed fighters in the  
early 1990s, but is now believed to have fewer than 1,000 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 people, including soldiers, rebels and  
noncombatants, have died in political violence in Peru since the 
Shining Path took up arms in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent years the death toll has dropped off to a few  
hundred a year as the rebels withdrew into unpopulated areas of the 
jungle hundreds of miles east and north of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez did not enjoy the stature Guzman had among Sendero  
followers, but he had acquired a reputation for slipping through 
the hands of military patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas Guzman, 64, is an intellectual, a former university  
professor who never took part in guerrilla attacks, Ramirez Durand 
is a man of action. 
</P>
<P>
	Followers captured in recent years described him as violent and  
easy to anger. They said he did not hesitate to kill rebels he 
suspected of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez Durand's father, retired army general Oscar Ramirez  
Martinez, said hours before the capture that he thought his son 
would never let himself be taken alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer to see him dead than in prison, and I say it as  
a father,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez Martinez asked forgiveness for the death and destruction  
his son has caused, but he said he respected him for his 
willingness to die for what he believed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a coward nor a traitor to his principles, no matter  
how mistaken they are,'' his father said.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Struggles for Solid Footing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The discount airline formerly known as  
ValuJet has a new name, a new logo and a new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But AirTran has struggled to gain solid financial footing three  
years after ValuJet Flight 592 plunged into the Everglades, killing 
all 110 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the airline lost nearly $41 million and blamed its  
unprofitability on predatory pricing by competitors. It faced labor 
problems from its flight attendants and temporarily laid off dozens 
of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are signs things are improving.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after state prosecutors charged ValuJet's maintenance  
contractor with murder and manslaughter for its role in the May 
1996 crash, AirTran reported Wednesday its most profitable quarter 
since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTran said second-quarter income rose 74 percent from the  
previous year. AirTran reported second-quarter profits of $15 
million, or 22 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline had profits of $8.6 million, or 13 cents per share  
during the same quarter last year. Sales increased to $140 million 
from $124 million during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock price also is on an upswing at just under $7 after  
falling to $2.14 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney analyst Brian Harris attributed AirTran's  
turnaround to its competitive prices for business class passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant sign of improvement,'' Harris said of the  
latest earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, more than a year after the crash, ValuJet shed its  
name, critter cartoon logo and Atlanta headquarters when it took 
over the smaller, Orlando-based AirTran. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pall of the tragedy still hovers over the airline.  
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors Tuesday charged SabreTech Inc. with murder and  
manslaughter for illegally packaging oxygen canisters blamed for 
sparking a fire that caused the ValuJet DC-9 to crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury also indicted three SabreTech employees on  
charges of conspiracy, making false statements and mislabeling and 
mishandling hazardous material. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech said prosecutors ignored findings by the National  
Transportation Safety Board, which spread the blame among 
SabreTech, ValuJet and the Federal Aviation Administration for lax 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTran said it was cooperating with state and federal  
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully confident that the government will bring to  
justice those it believes are responsible,'' AirTran chairman and 
CEO Joe Leonard said in a statement.

	At a time when air travel is booming and other airlines' profits  
are soaring, AirTran has struggled. It furloughed dozens of workers 
in October but brought them back in December. Flight attendants 
threatened to walk out before a new contract was reached last year. 
The airline, with 280 daily departures to 31 cities, flew most of 
last year at only about 60 percent capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTran officials are optimistic about the future. The airline  
plans to start introducing 50 new Boeing 717s into its fleet in 
September. The new planes will offer more overhead bin space, 
better temperature control and greater fuel efficiency.

<HEADLINE> 160 Children Get Sick at W.Va. Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Scores of children at a summer camp  
became violently ill with vomiting and diarrhea, and investigators 
are trying to determine what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 children got severely sick at the Emma Kaufmann Camp  
in Stewartstown on July 5, and on Wednesday another 60 had fallen 
ill, Monongalia County Health Department Administrator Ed Phillips 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are recovering and officials asked parents to leave their  
children at the camp to help contain the outbreak and identify its 
source. Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control are 
helping officials determine the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been confined to the camp with the exception of  
a few children who went home and passed the illness to their 
families, leading health officials to believe the outbreak is a 
virus nor passed on through food, Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Dry Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as hot, dry weather moved into Midwest 
growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were concerned about pockets of dryness across major  
growing areas, particularly in central Illinois, one of the 
nation's largest corn and soybean growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the region were expected to rise into the  
90s over the next few days, which could further drain moisture from 
the soil and lead to heat stress. That, in turn, could lead to 
reduced yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.60 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.01 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 
cent to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to $4.21 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .53 cent to 63.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .28 cent to 77.25 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 1.53 cents to 45.95 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
fell .32 cent to 32.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> US Military Conducts Huge Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- The Pentagon is finishing what is believed  
to be the largest-ever simultaneous test of computer systems to 
make sure Year 2000 problems won't prevent delivery to the troops 
of everything from bullets to toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said Tuesday it had identified, and quickly fixed,  
three minor glitches in its enormously complex computerized 
logistics network. The weeklong test was expected to conclude 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical experts built a duplicate network -- what they called a  
``parallel processing environment'' -- then rolled those computer 
clocks forward to simulate the week following Feb. 28, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is the ultimate in testing,'' said John  
Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Year 2000 commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department needs to watch how its systems behaved  
during the date rollover from 1999 to 2000, and it needs to make 
sure computers will recognize the next leap year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Goldstein, the department's director of logistics  
information systems, said the test will prevent officers on the 
battlefield from neglecting to request extra ammunition ``because 
your computer systems have the wrong date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test involved 44 military computer systems and more than  
1,000 people in 22 locations, including five Navy ships. None of 
the computers being tested this week was closer than 50 miles to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't take our systems offline to do a Y2K test,''  
Goldstein said. He compared the test to those being run by private 
corporations but added, ``If we don't do our job, our customers can 
be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Nyere, a consultant who coordinated the test, said it found  
only three minor problems. In two cases, the year on some supply 
requests incorrectly advanced from ``99'' to ``100'' instead of to 
``00,'' and in another instance, a system failed to recognize Feb. 
29, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyere called those problems ``easy to fix.''  
</P>
<P>
	The computer network being tested is a duplicate of the  
Pentagon's genuine supply system except for the volume of requests 
running across it, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software tools will simulate the enormous number of those  
requests -- roughly 2.5 billion annually -- to look for bottlenecks 
on the network that might have been caused inadvertently by Y2K 
repair efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to helping to identify potential problems, the test  
was also an important public-relations opportunity for the Defense 
Department, which invited reporters and TV camera crews to watch 
from the offices of a major defense contractor in northern 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials repeatedly stressed Tuesday that the test  
results show America's military will be prepared for battle even 
after Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has been sharply criticized over the pace of its  
computer repairs. A report last month from the Office of Management 
and Budget said 264 of the department's 2,096 most important 
computer systems still were not compliant -- more left to repair 
than any other federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And Congress' General Accounting Office said last week that  
Defense experts ``face significant problems'' and the department 
was ``far from successfully finishing its various Year 2000 
end-to-end test activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB said the Defense Department alone will spend $3.65  
billion on Y2K repairs, almost half the estimated $8 billion cost 
to the entire federal government.

<HEADLINE> Owens, Niners Near Long-Term Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Terrell Owens expects his agent and the  
San Francisco 49ers to wrap up talks on a long-term contract for 
the wide receiver over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Wednesday from a Palo Alto clinic where he underwent  
laser eye surgery the day before, Owens said his agent, David 
Joseph, was scheduled to meet with general manager Bill Walsh and 
director of football operations John McVay on Thursday and Friday 
to finalize the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who had a team-high 14 touchdown catches while surpassing  
Jerry Rice as the 49ers' go-to receiver, is signed to a one-year, 
$3.5 million contract, which currently counts against the team's 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have discussed a six-year extension. It would give  
Owens more money up front while allowing the 49ers to spread the 
economic impact of the deal over the life of the contract and lower 
this year's player payroll by up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers need the additional cap room to sign their eight draft  
picks and another running back because of the uncertain future of 
Garrison Hearst. They are close to a deal with free agent running 
back Charlie Garner and also have shown interest in Lawrence 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst is battling career-threatening complications that have  
clouded his recovery from a broken lower left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, meanwhile, said he came away fine from Tuesday's elective  
eye procedure permanently correcting near-sightedness that had 
required him to wear glasses or contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went great. I woke up this morning and I was seeing a lot  
better,'' Owens said. ``It's something I did because of the 
convenience. In practice or games, my contacts could get knocked 
out and I think this will eliminate that.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Press Pet Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans still have a lot of  
loose ends on foreign policy and defense they want to tie as 
election season intensifies, many of them perennial causes, some of 
them probably lost causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The perennials range from demanding that the U.S. Embassy in  
Israel be moved to Jerusalem -- something that a would-be New York 
senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, now is also espousing -- to scaling 
back U.S. support for the United Nations, denouncing Cuba's Fidel 
Castro and decrying human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Debates over these issues -- and many more -- are looming in the  
days ahead as the House and Senate move toward completion of a 
variety of spending and authorization bills, and as the annual 
renewal of China's trade status heads toward a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential hopeful Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire scolded his  
now former fellow Republicans for not being true to their ideals or 
the party platform in announcing Tuesday that he was changing 
political stripes and becoming an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's put out there so suckers like me and maybe suckers like  
you can read it,'' he said of the party platform in a floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But, GOP lawmakers have still been managing to slip bits and  
splinters of GOP dogma into a variety of amendments and 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The House later this week, for instance, is due to debate a  
State Department bill that would, among other things, pay roughly 
$1 billion in U.S. debt to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected to follow the Senate's lead in including a  
cutback in the U.S. contribution to the U.N.'s regular operating 
budget of 25 percent to 20 percent. Such a reduction has not been 
approved by other U.N. members. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, either on the House floor or later in a  
conference with Senate negotiators on the State Department bill, 
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., is expected to push once more for 
an anti-abortion amendment. His measure would deny U.S. support for 
international family planning programs that support abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years in a row, such a provision has drawn a veto from  
President Clinton, and likely would again. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department bill, which goes before the House Thursday,  
also contains nonbinding language advocating moving the U.S. 
Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	That's another perennial favorite, not only of Republicans but  
of many Democrats as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton joined the move-the-embassy bandwagon as she tested  
the waters of New York for a possible Senate bid, even though 
Clinton administration policy continues to say the city's future 
must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Monday approved a nonbinding resolution urging the  
United States to boycott this week's U.N. meeting in Geneva to look 
into whether Israel violated international law in building 
settlements on Arab-claimed land. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar resolutions -- which do not carry the force of law -- have  
been passed to reaffirm U.S. policy toward Taiwan, to denounce 
China's human rights record and to voice support for U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress keeps trying to pare support for a program that  
provides fuel oil to North Korea -- in hopes of dissuading that 
communist regime from expanding its nuclear program. And the Senate 
has voted to ban all foreign aid to Russia if it doesn't obey NATO 
commanders in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also keep trying to fan dying embers of inquiries  
into Democratic fund raising and Chinese nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	When Attorney General Janet Reno appeared at a House hearing on  
Tuesday to talk about technology export controls, Rep. Steven 
Buyer, R-Ind., went out of his way to praise FBI Director Louis 
Freeh -- as he sat next to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Freeh for good judgment in recommending an  
independent counsel on campaign fund raising, a course of action 
she rejected. Looking straight at Reno, Buyer apologized that he 
couldn't spread the praise ``around the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., hinted the House might revive a  
dormant threat to hold Reno in contempt if she continued to 
withhold parts of a Justice Department memo Weldon suggested was 
relevant to the inquiry into whether technology transfers to China 
were influenced by Chinese campaign contributions to Clinton's 
re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, in a tight voice, told Weldon the department had provided  
Congress ``with everything we could under the law.'' Holding her in 
contempt, she noted dryly, ``wouldn't change the law.''

<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners sent  
100,000 people into the streets of Tehran to make it clear they 
will not cave in to student-led demands for reforms. The hard-line 
backlash jeopardizes the standing of President Mohammad Khatami, a

``state-to-state'' and not as part of China, told Washington on 
Wednesday he's not seeking formal independence that could prompt 
China to go to war. Lee said his new definition of the delicate 
Taiwan-China relationship merely clarifies the political reality 
that has emerged 50 years after the island separated from China, 
when the communists gained control of the mainland.

	Senate GOP Tallies HMO Victories

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans refused to extend new HMO  
rules to all 161 million people with private health insurance 
today. GOP leaders crafted alternatives to other Democratic 
proposals in an effort to blunt political damage. Only a handful of 
Republicans have defected in a series of votes this week over the

Republicans answered -- or promised to answer -- Democratic proposals 
on emergency room care, women's health and clinical trials.

government to finance a certain type of human embryo research. The 
issue is over experiments with ``master cells,'' the building 
blocks for other tissues in the body that scientists can cull from 
human embryos. These embryonic stem cells are generating huge 
excitement because they could lead to new therapies for Alzheimer's 
and other devastating diseases. But the use of them has raised 
troubling ethical questions, and is generating opposition from 
anti-abortion forces and some members of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America To Go Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bank of America customers next year will  
be able to do their banking with mobile phones, electronic 
organizers and other handheld, Internet-connected, wireless 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte-based Bank of America on Wednesday announced a deal  
with Toronto-based 724 Solutions Inc. The technology company will 
provide software to let Bank of America's 30 million U.S. customers 
to accomplish banking transactions with wireless communication 
devices, including cellular phones, hand-held organizers and 
``smart phones,'' which are a hybrid of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America says it will be the first major U.S. financial  
institution to offer wireless banking. Currently, customers who 
want to do online or Internet-based banking have to use a personal 
computer or a television set-top device, which run through 
telephone or cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales of wireless communication devices are growing. Nearly  
12.2 million non-PC Internet-access devices will be sold next year, 
nearly matching personal computer sales, according to International 
Data Corp. Last year, there were 64.4 million mobile phones in use 
in the United States; by 2003 that will have risen to 118 million, 
said Callie Pottorf, research analyst with International Data. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many of today's mobile phones connect to the Internet. But  
by the end of this year, there may be more than 30 models that 
will, Pottorf said. And Jupiter Communications predicts more than 
10 million mobile phones will be capable of accessing Internet data 
by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Bank of Montreal signed a similar agreement with 724  
Solutions. But Bank of America will have a ``more substantial'' 
rollout of the service, said Greg Wolfond, 724 founder and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen how many bank customers will want to do  
routine banking so often that they will use a handheld, wireless 
device. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a regular consumer with a regular bank account, a PC  
is sufficient to keep on top of your (account) balances,'' said 
Bruce Kasrel, senior analyst with Forrester Research. Active stock 
traders are more likely users of the technology, he said.

<HEADLINE> TV Carts Recalled for Tip-Over Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 100,000 television carts, some up to 7  
years old, are being recalled because they can tip over, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer, Bush Industries, has received two reports of  
tipping carts, one resulting in a minor injury, the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ready-to-assemble carts are laminated in black or brown and  
were sold in discount, home and furniture stores nationwide from 
June 1992 to August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should remove their televisions and VCRs from the  
carts immediately, the commission warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush Industries asks consumers to call 800-950-4782 to receive a  
free repair kit to help prevent cart tip-over.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Holland Meets Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Virginia athletic director Terry Holland flew  
to Minneapolis on Wednesday amid reports he's on the verge of 
becoming Clem Haskins' replacement as basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest Sports Channel said Holland would probably be offered a  
seven-year contract worth about $1 million a season to replace 
Haskins, who resigned in wake of a massive academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Press of Newport News, citing unidentified sources,  
reported in its early Thursday editions that Holland met with 
Virginia vice president Leonard Sandridge on Monday after receiving 
the Minnesota offer. The paper said Minnesota could announce 
Holland's hiring as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	WAVY-TV in Norfolk, Va., also citing unidentified sources at the  
Charlottesville, Va., school, said Holland had already accepted a 
five-year deal worth about $800,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left at Holland's office Wednesday night  
weren't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, as has been its policy, had no comment other than to  
indicate no deal had been brokered. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls athletic director Mark Dienhart's office were directed to  
sports information director Marc Ryan, who said he couldn't say 
whether Holland was even in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all of our search processes, we don't confirm or deny that  
anybody is a potential candidate,'' Ryan said. ``That's 
counterproductive to what we're trying to do. We've had 50-plus 
names mentioned and that is our policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to get the best possible coach as quickly as  
possible,'' Ryan said. ``If it's a permanent head coach, that's our 
first choice. If not, we go the interim route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, 57, had a 418-216 record in 21 seasons as coach at  
Davidson and Virginia, holding the latter job from 1975 through 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland comes highly recommended. Among those pushing Holland  
for the job are Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany, Wake Forest coach 
Dave Odom and Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	If Holland, one of the highest-paid athletic directors in the  
country at about $250,000 a year, turns down the Gophers, Jim 
Crews, a former Indiana assistant and coach at Evansville the past 
13 years, is said to be next on the list.

<HEADLINE> Wrigley Field: Shrine Amid Glitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Looking for big, glitzy scoreboards that can  
flash statistics and launch fireworks? Go somewhere else. Ditto for 
those sound systems that blare Britney Spears or whatever else 
passes for hip these days. 
</P>
<P>
	And those jumbo ads that are everywhere at other ballparks? Not  
at Wrigley Field. Vendors hawking hot dogs and beer are about as 
distracting as things get. 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball's oldest ballparks close their gates, their  
nostalgia outdone by luxury boxes, and covered superstructures take 
their place, Wrigley Field remains a time capsule. A monument to 
the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
	It looks the same as it did on that day in 1932 when Babe Ruth  
called his famous home run and will stay that way well into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great stuff,'' Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said, a  
smile crossing his face as he looked around the park. ``We haven't 
gone into the next millennium here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retro ballparks may be all the rage these days, but Wrigley  
Field is the real thing. Tucked into a neighborhood on Chicago's 
North Side, it is surrounded by brownstones and neighborhood bars. 
Fans gather on rooftops overlooking right and left field to watch 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The brick walls surrounding the field are covered by ivy, not  
billboards. The scoreboard is still changed by hand. Games are 
played almost exclusively during the day, and fans fill the park no 
matter how the Cubs are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Interactive entertainment means fans tossing opponents' home  
runs back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a great feeling there,'' San Francisco's Barry  
Bonds said. ``It's in a great location. You just know people love 
baseball there. I think it's just the atmosphere -- the people 
sitting on the buildings, the bleacher bums, all the bikinis 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox, ``It's always been my  
favorite place to go to. Always. Forever. ... It's the head of the 
class for some reason. I can't put my finger on it. It just seems 
like it should never be touched. It's too much of a treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1914, Wrigley is the third-oldest park in the majors.  
Only Tiger Stadium and Fenway Park, which both opened on April 20, 
1912, are older. But Tiger Stadium, which has been crumbling for 
years, will close at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway, which played host to the All-Star game, is the smallest  
stadium in the majors, with 33,871 seats and narrow aisles. The Red 
Sox say they can't generate the money to compete these days and 
want to build a $545 million park with about 100 luxury boxes. It 
would be built across the way from the current Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest state-of-the-art addition is Seattle's Safeco Field,  
one more piece of evidence testifying to Wrigley's distinctiveness. 
The stadium, which opens Thursday for a Mariners-Padres game, has a 
retractable roof and cost $517 million, the most expensive ballpark 
ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley, meanwhile, isn't going anywhere. Let other teams put up  
fancy new ballparks or make massive renovations. The Cubs and the 
Tribune Co., the team's owner, don't want them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone that I have met within the Tribune Co., from the very  
top on down, is keenly aware of what they have here in Wrigley 
Field and is anxious to do what we can to maintain it as a special 
place,'' said Andy MacPhail, the team's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, there have been some alterations over the years. The  
current scoreboard and bleachers were built in 1937 when the 
outfield was renovated. The clubhouses have been redone. Mezzanine 
boxes were added in 1989, but they were tucked under the upper deck 
and don't stand out like most luxury boxes. And, after much debate, 
lights were added in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wrigley looks and feels the same as it always has, and the  
team spends millions each year to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is like a cathedral. It's the baseball version of  
St. Patrick's Cathedral,'' said Ed Lynch, the team's general 
manager and a former Cubs pitcher. ``It's something people have 
seen and been to and have been associated with for not only their 
lifetime but their parents' lifetimes, too. You just cannot replace 
this type of ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs take Wrigley's pristine image so seriously they refuse  
to blemish it with advertising. Advertising -- and the extra money 
it brings -- has become a way of life in baseball. There are ads on 
outfield walls, behind home plate and on the dugouts, and companies 
shell out millions to put their name on a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of money can make a big difference. Bank One Ballpark,  
which has more ads than a small-town tourist spot, is a cash cow 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks. One ad alone last year brought in 
$459,000. The Diamondbacks have used that money to boost their 
payroll and, in just their second season, are in contention for the 
NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really interested in putting up some jumbo sign in  
right field to get an extra $2 million to devote to the payroll,'' 
MacPhail said. ``I don't think we have to do that to win, and I 
think if you do that, you lessen the uniqueness of Wrigley Field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the stadium alone is enough to draw fans -- and money.  
The Cubs draw at or near their capacity of 38,957 for almost every 
game. People come from all over the country so they can see a game 
in the park where Ernie Banks hit his 500th home run and Billy 
Williams once roamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even opposing players like coming to Wrigley.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lore about the ballpark,'' the Mets' Mike Piazza  
said. ``You hear certain things and you've seen certain things on 
tape that it is kind of neat to actually get to play there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while other teams build their high-tech ballparks and put up  
another billboard, the Cubs are content to keep Wrigley Field a 
shrine to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's baseball,'' the Cardinals' Eric Davis said. ``That's  
about as good as it gets.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Leads at Admiral's Cup Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COWES, Isle of Wight (AP) -- Britain took a lead in the Admiral's  
Cup on Wednesday after an opening day filled with chaos and 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the weather had a chance to take its toll off the  
Isle of Wight coast, France quit the competition and then rejoined 
with a smaller team to add high drama to the unofficial world 
championship of off-shore racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, defending titlist, shared fifth-place with  
Australia in the aggregate standings after a day described by 
American skipper Ken Read as ``the strangest day on the water I've 
ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Admiral's Cup commenced with behind the scenes wrangling  
which forced France to initially withdraw in a row over an illegal 
mast on one of its three boats. 
</P>
<P>
	France rejoined the competition with its remaining two boats,  
resulting in several difficult clashes for the three-boat U.S. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Read, helmsman on the biggest American boat 'Idler' - which has  
a crew containing six America's Cup sailors - said he was stunned 
by some of the events during a testing day on the water. 
</P>
<P>
	'Idler' was involved in a crunching collision with Dutch boat  
'Innovision' in the second race of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had just turned on the mark and the Dutch boat was coming  
towards us,'' he said. ``She tried to jibe away but they got their 
turn wrong and hit us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily it was a glancing blow - it's a miracle no-one was  
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idler finished sixth in the first race, won by Innovision, but  
grabbed second place in the afternoon race while the Dutch boat 
finished fifth.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Champs Plan Exhibition Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	First the Victory Tour, now the Great Soccer Exhibition Tour for  
the U.S. women's World Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and Julie Foudy, along with the  
rest of the team, will regroup in October for a three-month indoor 
soccer exhibition tour, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will compete against a world all-star team in 11  
matches starting Oct. 22 in Pittsburgh and ending Dec. 12 in 
Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Berke, a vice president with the sports marketing firm SFX  
Sports Group, which helped organize the tour, said it will allow 
the players to earn money from soccer, stay close to their fans and 
demonstrate the viability of a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a number of sponsors, including beverage, financial  
services and packaged goods companies, have expressed interest in 
the tour. He said talks are under way about producing a TV special 
during the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players' plans, though, conflict with recently  
announced plans by the U.S. Soccer Federation to send the women's 
team on a tour of South Africa, Egypt and Australia from late 
October through December. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is expected to be discussed next week when the players  
meet with the USSF to negotiate a new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported that each player is guaranteed  
$41,250 for playing in the 11 games, with the possibility of 
earning more if other games are added. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pittsburgh and Tacoma, the team will make stops  
in Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, 
Raleigh, N.C., San Jose, Calif., and Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team captured the World Cup with a 5-4 penalty-kicks  
victory over China in the title game at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Energy Official Discusses Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department official in charge of  
nuclear weapons programs said Wednesday he felt ``out of the loop'' 
about a three-year espionage investigation at the Los Alamos lab 
and only learned the identity of the key suspect from the 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Reis, who recently submitted his resignation as assistant  
secretary for defense programs, said he knew of concerns being 
raised by DOE security officials about the weapons labs, but felt 
the problems were being addressed by others in the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis conceded that perhaps he ``could have pressed harder'' in  
addressing the security issue, but he said he understood that 
``people recognized there was a growing problem'' and were dealing 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought people in charge of that were doing it well, doing  
it well enough,'' he told a hearing of the House Armed Services 
Committee in response to a question about the investigation into 
the alleged loss of nuclear secrets to China from the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Reis' first public comments on the China espionage and  
security flap that has prompted a growing number of lawmakers to 
demand sweeping changes at the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis appeared before the House committee to argue for creation  
of a largely autonomous nuclear agency within the department, a 
position that has put him into conflict with Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson. Reis said he will leave the department at the end of 
the month because of the disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Reis acknowledged he had been briefed  
sporadically by Notra Trulock, the intelligence officer who was 
most vocal in raising concerns as early as 1995 about the apparent 
loss of secrets from the Los Alamos lab. He said he knew 
``something was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My reading on this was, `Hey, the FBI's involved, the FBI is a  
very professional organization. Do I have a need to know?'' said 
Reis after Wednesday's hearing. ``My understanding was it was under 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, beginning in 1996, focused on Los Alamos and one of its  
computer scientists, Taiwan-born Wen Ho Lee, in its investigation 
into the possible loss to China of nuclear warhead secrets in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``theoretically the labs worked for me I didn't know the  
gentleman's name until I read it in the newspaper,'' Reis said, 
referring to Lee, who whose name surfaced publicly in March when he 
was fired for security violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who continues to be under investigation, has not been  
charged with a crime and has denied providing secrets to China or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal Energy Department investigation into the handling of  
the Los Alamos espionage investigation, and particularly why Lee 
was not removed much earlier from his security sensitive job, is 
expected to be completed within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said that a number of DOE and Los Alamos  
officials will be disciplined and some face dismissal. Department 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said that Reis is 
among the officials whose actions were being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis, who has been head of defense programs since 1993, said  
Wednesday he has been ``given no indication whatsoever'' that he 
will be singled out for criticism in the upcoming DOE inspector 
general's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Contending he had been largely kept ``out of the loop'' on  
details of the Lee case and the Los Alamos security concerns, Reis 
said, ``I was sort of the landlord of the laboratories. Does a 
landlord know what all the tenants are doing? I should have been in 
charge. I was not in charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some DOE security officials said Reis was briefed to a point  
where he should have expressed greater alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was interested in the science and not the security. He  
distanced himself from the issue whenever he could,'' maintained 
Edward McCallum, director of DOE's Office of Safeguards and 
Security. ``He took advantage of the structure to dodge and move. 
We told him in grueling detail about the (security) problem and he 
did not react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCallum, who is under investigation at DOE and has temporarily  
been suspended from his job, sat in the hearing room as Reis 
testified. Lawmakers alluded to both Reis and McCallum as 
``heroes'' as well as ``victims'' in the security and espionage 
brouhaha.

<HEADLINE> Girl With Brain Partially Removed OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A teen-ager plagued by seizures caused by a  
deadly neurological condition was moving and starting to open her 
eyes today after surgeons removed half of her brain to block the 
spread of her rare disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Ramirez was in fair condition at Johns Hopkins Medical  
Center, said her surgeon, Dr. Benjamin Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Scar tissue from previous operations slowed the surgery that  
lasted nine hours Tuesday, but there were ``no real 
complications,'' Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation removed the left side of Amber's brain -- the side  
that controls speech and fine motor movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived all my life with seizures,'' Amber said before the  
operation. ``I'm tired of having to put up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery could leave 15-year-old Amber without the ability to  
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber, who was diagnosed with Rasmussen's disease, was making  
some sounds and was starting to open her eyes, and she grabbed his 
hand when she was stimulated, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also moved her left arm and leg when stimulated, said Dr.  
John Freeman, director of the pediatric epilepsy program at 
Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate she will be able to use her arm, not for fine  
movement, but as a helper hand,'' Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the surgery, the Lincoln, Neb., girl faced the  
possibility of mental retardation, paralysis and even death as the 
disease gradually attacked her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rasmussen's syndrome eats away at one side of the brain like a  
PAC Man,'' Freeman said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber and her mother, Sheri Ramirez, knew that the girl was  
considered old for the procedure. But Carson said he was confident 
the procedure will work, though she will need years of 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a bit older than most patients who had a hemispherectomy  
but she's certainly not the oldest patient we've operated on,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's disease began with a limp in 1993, when she was 9. She  
couldn't remember getting hurt, but her right foot ached. She was 
in a wheelchair two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the seizures began, one each hour, pulling on her right leg  
and arm until she wanted to scream from the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	She was eventually diagnosed with Rasmussen's syndrome, which  
affects about 1,000 people worldwide. Medication and surgery to 
remove diseased snippets of brain tissue slowed the disease but 
could not stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's doctors say the remaining portion of her brain will try  
to compensate for the tissue removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a hemispherectomy, the other side of the brain picks up  
a lot of function,'' Freeman said. ``Intelligence and memory 
remain, but the patient will walk with a limp and will not be able 
to use their opposite hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ramirez said she and her daughter understood that the  
rehabilitation would be long and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought a lot about the future when making our decision. We  
thought about Amber maybe being able to leave home and being 
independent,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ``Amber wanted to get rid of her 
seizures, to not have to have somebody walk two steps behind her 
all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Sergio Garcia Has Identity Crisis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Move over Seve, here comes Sergio.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Sergio Garcia took the title of Spain's most exciting  
golfer from Seve Ballesteros. Now, he wants to be known mostly by 
his first name, just like his idol. 
</P>
<P>
	If he has his way, he may soon have something else in common  
with Ballesteros -- his name on the list of British Open champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inside of me I feel it's going to be a great Open  
championship,'' the 19-year-old said. ``Let's see if I can have 
another good week this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the hottest pro start since Tiger Woods a few years  
back, Garcia finds himself a center of attention at the Carnoustie 
Golf Links in just his third British Open and his first as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Large crowds followed him and Ballesteros during a practice  
pairing Wednesday and youngsters thrust programs and hats at him to 
sign as he walked between holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough of them called the teen-age sensation ``Mr. Garcia'' to  
prompt Garcia to address the media on the subject of his name 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't mind, I like you to call me Sergio in the media  
if it is possible, because I feel much better than Garcia,'' he 
said. ``You know, it is how I like all the people to call me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean, Garcia tried to clarify later, that he wants  
to be known only by one name, like some Brazilian soccer star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to be recognized as Sergio or Sergio Garcia, but not as  
Garcia, just,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he's called, Garcia is about as hot as Woods as he tees  
off in his first major tournament as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing as low amateur at the Masters, Garcia turned pro  
and promptly shot a 67 in his first round. He's had two 62s 
already, one when he finished third at the GTE Byron Nelson, and is 
coming off his first win two weeks ago at the Irish Open followed 
by a second last week at Loch Lomond. 
</P>
<P>
	He hits the ball long and putts very well. More importantly,  
he's got great imagination, as he showed on the 15th hole Wednesday 
by turning around and playing a sand wedge left handed to avoid 
having to stand deep in a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been preparing for this for three or four years,'' Garcia  
said. ``Now I realize I can win some tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who has yet to get either a high school diploma or a  
driver's license, is an 18-1 pick by British bookies who are so 
taken with the young sensation that they put up a separate ``El 
Nino Performance'' index that bettors can wager on. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be El Nino, a nickname he picked up while playing in  
European tour events beginning at the age of 15, but he's been 
playing awfully big. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get off to a good start at a young age, you're very  
confident,'' said Woods, who should know. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Open at Birkdale, Garcia was just one of three  
amateurs who were getting some attention. He was soon eclipsed by 
England's Justin Rose, a 17-year-old who won over the home fans 
with a fourth place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Rose turned pro and went on to miss 22 straight cuts,  
Garcia waited until he got some more seasoning. He finally made his 
move after finishing in a tie for 38th at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kind of like to Europe what Tiger was in the United  
States,'' said Greg Norman. ``He's the new wave, the breath of 
fresh air that is always needed in the game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman saw that early when, as a 16-year-old, Garcia shot  
76-73, only to miss the cut in the British Open that Lehman ended 
up winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia spent the weekend following Lehman around, then  
approached him as he held the Claret Jug that goes to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someday, you will win this,'' Lehman said, handing Garcia the  
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lehman is right, that day could arrive very soon.

<HEADLINE> Officials Start Ga. Quail Program / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- In the 1950s, Georgia was known as the quail  
capital of the world. The bobwhite quail thrived in weeds and 
shrubs around the edges of fields and found plenty of 
muscle-building bugs to eat. Quail hunting was a tradition in many 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	All that began to change in the 1960s. Urban sprawl and new  
farming techniques, including more reliance on pesticides, reduced 
the bird's habitat and food supply. As a result, Georgia's quail 
population has declined more than 70 percent in the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials hope they can reverse the trend this fall  
when they kick off a pilot program known as ``Georgia's Bobwhite 
Quail Initiative.'' It will offer incentives and cost-sharing 
payments to landowners who agree to provide quail habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Landowners will have to develop management plans and compete for  
acceptance into the program, which includes counties in eastern, 
central and southwestern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The quail is a type of small bird that belongs to the same  
family as pheasants and partridges. The best known in North America 
is the bobwhite, which is heavily camouflaged to protect it from 
predators. Young and adult quail eat insects and seed. During the 
fall and winter, quail live in groups known as coveys. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a number of reasons we should be concerned about  
quail,'' said Reggie Thaxton, a senior wildlife biologist with the 
Georgia Department of National Resources Wildlife Resources 
Division in Forsyth. ``It's part of our heritage. We know there are 
a lot of people who like quail who aren't hunters. They enjoy 
hearing and seeing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, quail are considered an indicator species -- a barometer of  
the ecosystem, Thaxton said. 
</P>
<P>
	When quail have problems, other creatures that share their  
habitat have problems. Those creatures include songbirds such as 
the prairie warbler, the Bachman's sparrow and the loggerhead 
shrike. 
</P>
<P>
	The habitat they need is called ``early succession'' habitat,  
which includes such weeds as beggerweed and ragweed, shrubs such as 
plum and native grasses. The vegetation is generally less than 
knee-high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quail and these early succession songbirds have been declining  
quite drastically since the '60s,'' said Thaxton, who will 
coordinate the initiative. ``This is a pro-active approach to 
trying to restore early succession habitat and thereby stop the 
decline before they reach critically low levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landowners will be encouraged to create hedgerows and field  
boarders. Besides providing quail habitat, these areas help reduce 
soil erosion and stop the flow of sediment that can degrade water 
quality.

<HEADLINE> Slow Growth Seen for Health Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National health care spending is projected to  
grow more slowly than had been expected in the next decade, the 
government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised projection is due largely to decreased Medicare  
spending last year and slower growth projections for both private 
and Medicare spending in the latter part of the next decade, 
according to a study by the Health Care Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the downward revision, national health spending still is  
expected to double by 2008 to $2.2 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The new projections show the rate of annual growth slows to an  
average of 6.5 percent for the 1997-2007 decade. Last year's 
calculations had projected a 7 percent yearly average growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``These figures show that our efforts, such as waste, fraud and  
abuse initiatives, have helped control health care costs in the 
United States,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare spending is projected to grow just 4.5 percent a year  
over the 1997-2000 period, compared to 5.1 percent foreseen in last 
year's figures, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that national health spending growth will  
accelerate through 2000, due mostly to an acceleration in the 
private-sector. That reverses the current trend of higher public 
spending, and the reversal is expected to be more significant than 
anticipated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual private-sector growth had been projected at 6.7 percent  
over 1997-2000 in last year's survey. The revised report forecasts 
a 7.3 percent annual growth in that time period, due largely to 
higher health insurance premiums and faster projected growth of 
drug spending. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2001 through 2008, both public and private-sector spending  
growth is projected to be slower than the levels projected last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Guerini Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	L'ALPE D'HUEZ, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong was a mountain man  
for another day, extending his lead in the Tour de France while 
questions of drug use shadowed his astonishing run. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong performance by the 27-year-old Texan on Wednesday  
came as Italy's Giuseppe Guerini recovered from a crash with a 
photo-snapping fan to capture the 10th stage of cycling's premier 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that last summer's drug scandal still haunts cycling,  
Armstrong was subjected to innuendo in the French press regarding 
his great success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stupefying Armstrong,'' was the headline of Wednesday's  
France-Soir tabloid, referring to Armstrong's emphatic victory in 
the Alps the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports newspaper L'Equipe's headline, above a picture of  
Armstrong, read: ``On Another Planet.'' Inside, another said: 
``Hallucinating Armstrong'' -- another play on words, because the 
French word also means ``great'' or ``fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a drug scandal brought the race to a temporary halt  
and enveloped the sport. Fifty-one riders took blood tests 
Wednesday, and all were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who has made a remarkable recovery from testicular  
cancer, said Wednesday he was aware of the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw today's headlines. Yes, they have many questions,'' he  
said after the race, in which he ended fifth, extending his lead to 
7 minutes, 42 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its incredible that they print this. Why do they print this?''  
he said of reports he's tested positive for drugs. ``They don't 
print the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his success was a result of hard work, preparation and  
luck. For instance, he came to the mountains and tested each stage 
-- something few other riders have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's doctor in the United States, Dr. Lawrence Einhorn,  
told The Associated Press: ``This guy is so clean-living, you 
wouldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's stage was 138 miles, full of steep climbs between  
Sestrieres in Italy to Alpe d'Huez in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Tonkov of Russia came in second, 21 seconds behind  
Guerini. Spain's Fernando Escartin finished third for the second 
straight day and Alex Zulle of Switzerland came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, Guerini smashed into a fan who was trying to get a  
close-up photograph of the rider from the middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, I went from the most beautiful moment of my life to  
the worst,'' a grinning Guerini said. ``I thought I'd lost the 
race. But I saw I had a few seconds advantage over the others, so I 
went flat out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was too shocked to say anything to the spectator, and  
then had problems getting his foot back into his pedal. He went on 
to win by 21 seconds. He said there should have been barriers to 
stop encroaching fans, many of whom run alongside riders, cheering 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Armstrong in the overall standings is Spain's Abraham  
Olano. Zulle is third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only objective today was to hold onto the yellow jersey,''  
Armstrong said. ``The others were strong today: Guerini, Zulle. I 
was tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rain, which hampered racing the day before, stopped shortly  
before the start. The weather was good, with a cool breeze and 
thick clouds for much of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The race began with a tough climb to the 6,874-foot Col du  
Mont-Cenis, where the pack remained bunched. But on the way down, 
two French riders -- Stephane Heulot and Thierry Bourgignon -- 
mounted the first breakaway of the day, and soon held a nine-minute 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders then climbed the Col de la Croix de Fer, or Iron  
Cross Pass, at a similar altitude, the longest climb on the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Heulot almost became a local hero -- by winning on Bastille Day --  
but he finally caved in on the punishing 21 hairpins on the Alpe 
d'Huez.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Terrorist Threats Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An anthrax release in Boston, a North Korean  
sale of nuclear bombs and an Iraqi nerve-agent attack on U.S. 
troops were among the potential threats to Americans cited 
Wednesday by a commission urging government action to combat such 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are woefully unprepared, and we would like to see something  
done before some incident occurs,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, the 
commission's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, R-Pa., said he would introduce legislation Thursday to  
tighten export controls on items that might be used to manufacture 
heavily destructive weaponry and wants to have all worldwide 
transactions recorded electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	The main proposals of the 12-member panel, headed by former CIA  
Director John Deutch and including a wide range of government and 
private nonproliferation experts, were disclosed in interviews last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the commission's report contained ``a  
number of interesting recommendations and observations that deserve 
serious consideration.'' He directed his national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, to coordinate an interagency assessment of the 
recommendations and to report back within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission on Wednesday released 265 pages of report and  
documentation that spells out fears of potential doomsday weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	The material also details a plan to give the vice president the  
lead role in preventing and dealing with the threat of weapons of 
mass destruction, which the commission says has increased markedly 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the country needs to be better protected,'' Deutch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission concludes that the top levels of government are  
``not effectively organized to combat proliferation'' and 
recommends the president appoint a ``national director to combat 
proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director would coordinate diplomatic steps to stop the  
spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The director 
also would oversee a special government panel, made up of assistant 
secretaries from various agencies, that would seek to prevent the 
targeting of Americans and to respond to any catastrophic attack at 
home or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch said placing the government's nonproliferation efforts  
under a single budget and director would help in preparing to deal 
with ``a calamitous eventuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One commission member, former Democratic Sen. James Exon of  
Nebraska, dissenting from the report's main recommendation, urged 
greater Cabinet-level involvement and a nonproliferation director 
who would report directly to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been crafted, in may opinion, is another lower-level  
'working group,''' Exon said. He agreed with the extent of the 
threat and proposed an even more aggressive response. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal already has received a cool response at the  
Pentagon. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said last week that 
the existing lines of authority are sufficiently clear and do not 
require the appointment of a special coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the scenarios outlined in the report by the Commission to  
Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the 
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: 
</P>
<P>
	--Anthrax is released in a Boston subway station during rush  
hour, sending 6,000 people to hospital emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Analysts estimate that North Korean scientists have assembled  
10 nuclear weapons, and intelligence reports say North Korea is 
planning to sell two. 
</P>
<P>
	--Iraqi President Saddam Hussein orders Scud missiles carrying  
nerve agents fired upon U.S. troops in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	--A disgruntled Russian scientist at Ozersk acquires 44 pounds of  
highly enriched uranium and sells it to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Sparky Anderson Needs Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Sparky Anderson, the former Detroit and  
Cincinnati manager, will undergo heart bypass surgery in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests conducted at Henry Ford Hospital on Tuesday revealed that  
Anderson has coronary artery blockage, the hospital said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 65, became ill before a celebrity golf tournament and  
was hospitalized Tuesday for testing. Anderson, his wife Carol and 
his doctors decided Wednesday on the elective treatment, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson lives in Thousand Oaks, Calif., but was visiting  
Michigan to play in a golf tournament put on by Bo Schembechler, a 
former Michigan football coach and Tigers president. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will be transferred to a hospital in the Los Angeles  
area in the next several days to undergo the surgery. The hospital 
said he prefers to be close to his three children and 14 
grandchildren during the surgery and subsequent recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson managed the Cincinnati Reds from 1970-78, winning the  
World Series in 1975-76 with the team known as the ``Big Red 
Machine.'' He then managed the Detroit Tigers for 17 years, 
resigning after the 1995 season with a team-record 1,331 victories 
and a World Series title in 1984.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Steve Yzerman has agreed to a three-year, $25.5  
million contract extension with the Detroit Red Wings, according to 
published reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there was no immediate confirmation by team officials,  
the Booth Newspapers said the extension was finalized last week 
when general manager Ken Holland and Yzerman's agent, Larry Kelly, 
reached agreement on the language for the Red Wings captain's

season, will receive a $1.5 million signing bonus and $8 million in 
each of the following three seasons, The Detroit News and Booth 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman, 34, led the Red Wings with 74 points and 13 power-play

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National health care spending is projected to  
grow more slowly than had been expected in the next decade, the

</P>
<P>
	The revised projection is due largely to decreased Medicare

<HEADLINE> Internet 'Voyeur Dorm' Loses Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The city is cracking down on Voyeur Dorm, a  
house where young women are filmed day and night by a battery of 
live Internet cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's Variance Review Board ruled Tuesday that the house is  
not a home, but a business in the same category as strip clubs and 
requires an adult occupational license to continue its activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``These women are basically taking their clothes off for  
profit,'' review board member Ana Wallrapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Web surfers pay $34 per month to view the site, which provides  
images from more than 30 cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The college students receive free room and board, tuition and a  
stipend in return for living in the house, but are not required to 
perform for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site says the cameras are all around the house,  
including the bathroom. ``Nothing is off limits. There are no 
taboos,'' it says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the women, who identified herself only as Alex, said the  
arrangement means her mother doesn't have to pay her college 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a neat concept,'' she said. ``I don't know  
why people are making such a big deal out of nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voyeur Dorm is a partnership of Dan Marshlack, owner of the  
house, and Internet Entertainment Group of Seattle, which runs 
numerous Web sex sites. The owners plan to appeal, said their 
lawyer, Mark Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the owners lose in court, Dolan said, Voyeur Dorm won't  
go away. It may end up in a studio or some other commercial 
location. More than 5,000 customers nationwide watch the site, 
Dolan said.

barracks fight may have been killed because others thought he was 
gay, two gay-rights groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lesbian and Gay Coalition for Justice and the Servicemembers  
Legal Defense Network said Monday that they questioned several 
people on and off the base about the death of Pfc. Barry L. 
Winchell, 21, of Kansas City, Mo., and were told that he was killed

that Winchell may have been killed because he was gay or perceived 
to be gay. They declined to discuss whether they were pursuing the 
possibility.

	``We have the one soldier in custody who has been charged with  
premeditated murder,'' said Maj. Pamela Hart, a Fort Campbell

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Seeks Gov't Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines has asked to meet  
with U.S. Justice Department lawyers this month about the 
government's claim that the nation's second-largest air carrier 
tried to drive small, startup airlines out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	American also is trying to schedule a meeting with Justice  
attorneys later this month in hopes of getting a court date set 
soon on the government's lawsuit claiming American saturated 
lower-cost competitor Vanguard Airlines' routes with additional 
flights and cutting fares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice lawsuit, which is the first predatory-practices case  
brought since airlines were deregulated in 1978, alleges that 
American monopolized airline passenger service to and from 
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the nation's third 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said American increased its prices  
between Dallas-Fort Worth and Wichita by 50 percent after it forced 
Vanguard Airlines out of that route. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as the attorneys' meeting, American filed a response to  
the Justice Department charge Tuesday requesting that Judge J. 
Thomas Marten schedule a pretrial conference in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said in its response that it is ``well within the  
law'' in its scheduling practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also yesterday, American Airlines won dismissal of a passenger  
lawsuit alleging that the carrier was predatory in its pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Wilkie D. Ferguson of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,  
dismissed the claims that American cost passengers more money for 
tickets by driving low-fare airlines out of markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer Matthew Zifrony had alleged in the lawsuit that  
American helped force Pan American Airlines out of Miami and 
Vanguard Airlines Inc. out of routes to Dallas-Fort Worth. Zifrony 
could not be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., is  
still contending with about a half-dozen similar civil lawsuits 
filed in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately we think all of these civil lawsuits will be  
dismissed because they're without merit,'' said airline spokesman 
Chris Chiames. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissed Florida lawsuit, which had requested the judge to  
bar American's allegedly anticompetitive conduct, was filed shortly 
before the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Unveils Light Beam Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Using light beams instead of radio waves, a new  
wireless technology makes it easier to handle growing Internet 
traffic without digging up city streets to add fiber-optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
	The OpticAir system developed by Lucent Technologies can  
transmit data 65 times faster than wireless systems that rely on 
radio waves to carry a signal between rooftops or windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, the former research and equipment arm of AT&AMP;T, said  
Wednesday it expects to begin selling backpack-sized transmitters 
using the new technology within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In urban areas where it's impractical, if not impossible, to put  
more cables in the ground, Lucent's system may provide a powerful 
option for adding capacity to the ``backbone'' networks that carry 
the world's Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, there's no more capacity in the ground and no  
more right of way, especially in older metropolitan areas,'' said 
Lisa Pierce, an industry analyst for Giga Information Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless transmission ``is a lot a cheaper than going the ground  
route,'' even if a landlord charged exorbitant rates to put 
wireless equipment on a rooftop, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are drawbacks, however, like those with radio-based  
systems: The laser signal can't travel more than three miles and a 
direct line-of-sight is required between transmitter and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	And much like a wireless microwave system, OpticAir is not a  
practical alternative for individual consumers. The equipment 
involved with either system carries too high a price and far too 
much data for most people to afford or need. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, demand for Internet capacity has been doubling every  
three or four months at Uunet, a unit of MCI WorldCom that's one of 
the biggest backbone operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that growth is coming from businesses, although  
consumers are adding to the demand by subscribing to new high-speed 
services being offered through cable TV wires and so-called digital 
subscriber lines using regular copper phone wires. 
</P>
<P>
	OpticAir converts data, voice and video information into a laser  
beam, shooting it through a two-inch wide lens. The signal travels 
between rooftops or office windows and is then passed back to a 
fiber-optic cable for the rest of its journey. The system can 
simultaneously transmit at different wavelengths -- or colors -- of 
light, each carrying distinct streams of information. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, a company that has been building and buying  
fiber-optic systems to create a global network, will be the first 
company to test the OpticAir system, starting in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity provided by the new technology ``could offer a  
breakthrough method to help our global customers bypass local 
bottlenecks and offer leading-edge services,'' said Wally Dawson, a 
Global Crossing executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said other applications for  
OpticAir might include sending data across a corporate or college 
campus, as well as for temporary data links during special events 
such as live broadcasts of concerts.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Press Pet Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans still have a lot of  
loose ends on foreign policy and defense they want to tie as 
election season intensifies, many of them perennial causes, some of 
them probably lost causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The perennials range from demanding that the U.S. Embassy in  
Israel be moved to Jerusalem -- something that a would-be New York 
senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, now is also espousing -- to scaling 
back U.S. support for the United Nations, denouncing Cuba's Fidel 
Castro and decrying human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Debates over these issues -- and many more -- are looming in the  
days ahead as the House and Senate move toward completion of a 
variety of spending and authorization bills, and as the annual 
renewal of China's trade status heads toward a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential hopeful Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire scolded his  
now former fellow Republicans for not being true to their ideals or 
the party platform in announcing Tuesday that he was changing 
political stripes and becoming an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's put out there so suckers like me and maybe suckers like  
you can read it,'' he said of the party platform in a floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But, GOP lawmakers have still been managing to slip bits and  
splinters of GOP dogma into a variety of amendments and 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The House later this week, for instance, is due to debate a  
State Department bill that would, among other things, pay roughly 
$1 billion in U.S. debt to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected to follow the Senate's lead in including a  
cutback in the U.S. contribution to the U.N.'s regular operating 
budget of 25 percent to 20 percent. Such a reduction has not been 
approved by other U.N. members. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, either on the House floor or later in a  
conference with Senate negotiators on the State Department bill, 
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., is expected to push once more for 
an anti-abortion amendment. His measure would deny U.S. support for 
international family planning programs that support abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years in a row, such a provision has drawn a veto from  
President Clinton, and likely would again. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department bill, which goes before the House Thursday,  
also contains nonbinding language advocating moving the U.S. 
Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	That's another perennial favorite, not only of Republicans but  
of many Democrats as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton joined the move-the-embassy bandwagon as she tested  
the waters of New York for a possible Senate bid, even though 
Clinton administration policy continues to say the city's future 
must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Monday approved a nonbinding resolution urging the  
United States to boycott this week's U.N. meeting in Geneva to look 
into whether Israel violated international law in building 
settlements on Arab-claimed land. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar resolutions -- which do not carry the force of law -- have  
been passed to reaffirm U.S. policy toward Taiwan, to denounce 
China's human rights record and to voice support for U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress keeps trying to pare support for a program that  
provides fuel oil to North Korea -- in hopes of dissuading that 
communist regime from expanding its nuclear program. And the Senate 
has voted to ban all foreign aid to Russia if it doesn't obey NATO 
commanders in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also keep trying to fan dying embers of inquiries  
into Democratic fund raising and Chinese nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	When Attorney General Janet Reno appeared at a House hearing on  
Tuesday to talk about technology export controls, Rep. Steven 
Buyer, R-Ind., went out of his way to praise FBI Director Louis 
Freeh -- as he sat next to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Freeh for good judgment in recommending an  
independent counsel on campaign fund raising, a course of action 
she rejected. Looking straight at Reno, Buyer apologized that he 
couldn't spread the praise ``around the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., hinted the House might revive a  
dormant threat to hold Reno in contempt if she continued to 
withhold parts of a Justice Department memo Weldon suggested was 
relevant to the inquiry into whether technology transfers to China 
were influenced by Chinese campaign contributions to Clinton's 
re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, in a tight voice, told Weldon the department had provided  
Congress ``with everything we could under the law.'' Holding her in 
contempt, she noted dryly, ``wouldn't change the law.''

<HEADLINE> Free Speech Uproar in Berkeley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- A radio show host was thrown off the air  
and later arrested amid protests over the management of the 
nation's oldest public radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Bernstein, host of KPFA's public affairs program  
``Flashpoints,'' was placed on administrative leave Tuesday night 
for reporting about conflict with the station's parent 
organization, the Pacifica Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted that I would be pulled from the air ... by  
people who founded the station to stand as a bastion of free 
speech,'' Bernstein said. ``This is an absolute case of 
censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was one of at least 40 protesters arrested Tuesday  
night for trespassing after they refused to leave the 50-year-old 
station. Seven other employees also were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley-based foundation took over programming, replacing  
it with taped shows, Pacifica spokeswoman Elan Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime staffers maintain that Pacifica's board wants to give  
KPFA a more mainstream image so that it can attract corporate 
donations. KPFA executive director Lynn Chadwick had earlier 
ordered the staff not to discuss or report on the conflict, Fabbri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bernstein ran segments of a news conference Tuesday by  
14 protesters who were arraigned on civil disobedience charges for 
demonstrating in an earlier protest against changes at the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I heard was Dennis Bernstein speaking. He was at the press  
conference, he was talking about the labor dispute. It was in full 
violation. It was his voice,'' Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	When news reporters told listeners that Bernstein had been  
placed on administrative leave, the newscast was cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Since April, four people have been fired for denouncing  
management policies on the air and station manager Nicole Sawaya's 
contract was not renewed.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Fans Swarm Golf Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Soccer jerseys and ponytails replaced  
knit shirts and sun visors Wednesday as preteen girls swarmed 
across a tony country club to see stars from the champion U.S. 
women's soccer team try their luck at golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Brandi Chastain, all members of the  
team that beat China for the World Cup on Saturday, played an 
exuberant 18 holes at the Wykagyl County Club, bantering with fans 
and insulting each other across the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chastain got more sod than ball on one shot, Foudy shouted,  
``I hate when that happens.'' And when Chastain was asked to reveal 
her handicap, she said, ``Julie's my handicap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer stars played with pros Meg Mallon and Karrie Webb in  
the best-ball pro-am tournament of the Japan Airlines Big Apple 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before they teed off, the soccer players attracted uncommon  
early morning attention as they warmed up on the club's driving 
range. Among the scores of youngsters was Allison Kowalski, 6, of 
Wayne, N.J., who sneaked inside the spectator ropes and got her 
jersey -- already labeled with Hamm's name and number -- autographed 
by all three stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Staci Whinfield and Allison Farina, both 11 from Cheshire,  
Conn., staked out a spot alongside the cart path between the 
driving range and the first tee, hoping for a chat with Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't figured out what to say yet,'' said Staci.  
``Probably just `Hi' and `You're my hero.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hamm and Foudy teed off before a crowd of 200, the starter  
announced that he'd never seen that many people at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, as Chastain was about to swing, she seemed  
put off by the usual hush among golf fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``In soccer we have noise,'' she said. ``So don't be afraid. I'm  
serious.'' The gallery took up chants of ``USA!'' and ``Go for the 
goal.'' Satisfied, she hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome that included Hamm and Foudy was just ahead of the  
one that included Chastain, and they managed to rib each other 
whenever they were close enough. Just as Chastain was about to hit 
a tee shot, Foudy shouted from the fairway of the next hole, ``Head 
down! Watch your knees!'' And Hamm added, ``Breathe through your 
eyelids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, as Chastain was sizing up a putt, a fan shouted, ``Kick  
it!.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be better if I did,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm poked fun at Chastain's outfit, shouting, ``You look good,  
except for that one long sock.'' Chastain, who at the moment of 
victory on Saturday tore off her jersey and revealed her bra, kept 
her sleeveless shirt on but did doff a gray sweater she wore during 
warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer champs were asked by officials not to delay the  
tourney by signing autographs, but Chastain broke the rule a couple 
of times and when the women had finished their 18 holes, they sat 
and signed autographs for 40 minutes on balls, magazine covers, 
jerseys and even faces. 
</P>
<P>
	As they ran out of time, adults were asked to leave the line,  
then older children, leaving just the smiling, adoring youngest 
fans.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Mistakenly Freed Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- An Arizona murder suspect who was  
mistakenly released from jail in a paperwork mix-up has surrendered 
to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Brown, 37, charged with stabbing his girlfriend more than  
100 times, turned himself in to FBI and Kansas City, Mo., 
investigators Tuesday, a week after he was let out of Pima County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 37, was indicted on July 2 on a charge of first-degree  
murder in the May 22 death of Carol Buvik-Arnold, 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's mother in Kansas City told investigators Tuesday she  
wanted to help her son turn himself in. Later in the day, his 
Tucson attorney, Richard Lougee, met with authorities here to 
negotiate his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Sharion Beaver, then took investigators to where  
Brown was staying. He hugged his mother and then was taken into 
custody, said Pima County sheriff's Sgt. Brad Foust. 
</P>
<P>
	Lougee said he expects Brown will waive an extradition hearing  
and be returned to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Foust said ``a communications breakdown'' resulted in the  
wrongful release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Superior Court Clerk Patricia Noland said three copies of  
the indictment had been sent to the jail.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Head Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINDEN, Nev. (AP) -- When Donald Engen was appointed director of  
the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, he 
considered it a wonderful reward for a lifetime dedicated to 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This job is a payback for 54 years of flying,'' Engen said in  
1996 when he took over the Washington, D.C., institution and the 
most visited museum in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen and longtime friend William Ivans of La Jolla, Calif.,  
were killed Tuesday when Ivans' glider broke apart and crashed into 
a field several miles east of Lake Tahoe. Engen was 75, Ivans 79. 
</P>
<P>
	``They died together doing what they were doing when they first  
met,'' said Larry Sanderson, president of the Soaring Society of 
America and a friend of the men. The two had started flying 
together in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen was appointed by Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman.  
Air and Space is the most popular of the 16 museums and galleries 
operated by the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Navy test pilot took over from Martin Harwit, who  
resigned in May 1995 after some historians and veterans' groups 
complained that an exhibit on the dropping of the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima was too sympathetic to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen defended a toned-down version of the Enola Gay exhibit  
against other historians who said it uncritically accepted the view 
that the bombing saved countless lives by hastening Japan's 
surrender without a costly U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Engen was working to raise $130 million to help  
build new exhibit space near Washington Dulles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles Center of the Air and Space Museum is designed to  
offer state-of-the art restoration facilities and house air and 
space vehicles simply too large or numerous to fit in the present 
museum on the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits are to include the sleek SR-71 Blackbird, still the  
fastest aircraft ever built, and the giant Space Shuttle 
``Enterprise'' used as a test vehicle in the 1980s. The aim is to 
open the new center on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the 
Wright Brothers' first flight. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Enola Gay, Engen said during a tour of the museum's  
preservation warehouse this year that he hoped to reassemble the 
B-29 Superfortress after the Dulles Center is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will sit front and center in the aircraft hall,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A much-decorated Navy pilot, Engen retired as a vice admiral in  
1978. He was administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
from 1984 to 1987, and served for two years on the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	At the FAA, Engen levied a series of fines against airlines,  
including a $9.5 million penalty against Eastern Airlines for 
alleged safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen also revised the way the FAA kept track of near-collision  
reports to make it more accurate. But critics said that under 
Engen, the FAA continued to react to safety issues instead of being 
on top of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen left the FAA amid reports of a stormy relationship with  
then-Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole, who is now seeking 
the Republican nomination for the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen later told a Senate panel that while he headed FAA, the  
Transportation Department sometimes added months to the time his 
agency needed to implement new air safety regulations. The FAA is a 
branch of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen, who lived in Arlington, Va., was married and had four  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Is Clue To Appetite Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have moved closer to discovering how an  
appetite-stimulating hormone works in the brain, which may help 
them develop drugs to fight obesity and eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers knew the melanin-concentrating hormone is one of  
many compounds that control how much someone eats. They also knew 
MCH needs a place to attach itself in the brain, called a receptor. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, they had not located it. But according to a report in  
today's issue of the journal Nature, two groups working separately 
have identified the receptor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it an exciting discovery because it opens a new  
hope for the treatment of food-consumption disorders,'' said 
Olivier Civelli, head of one of the groups, at the University of 
California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group is at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals in  
England. It has already started the search for compounds to block 
MCH from binding to the receptor. Scientists hope that would curb a 
person's appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a drug is found, it will be at least a decade before it  
reaches the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The body produces several compounds in the brain that control  
appetite, and scientists don't know how big a role MCH plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we would argue that it's more important than the  
others,'' said Shelagh Wilson, SmithKline's associate director of 
vascular biology. ``Yes, it may be one small part, but it may be 
the one small part that actually tips the balance and works for an 
obese patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection was identified by trial-and-error: matching all  
of the compounds produced by the brain to a previously identified 
receptor whose purpose was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests that MCH may play a role in other forms  
of behavior, said Gary Schwartz, a Johns Hopkins University 
professor who was not involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The receptor to which MCH hitches appears in many regions of the  
brain, not just those controlling appetite. So MCH could also 
affect movement, grooming and other activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Speak at Gore Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Outgunned in fund raising by Republican George  
W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore is rolling out his biggest 
artillery in the battle over campaign cash: President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the master of fund raising, will headline a Gore  
reception Aug. 7 at the Statehouse Convention Center in Little 
Rock, Ark. That will be followed by four Washington dinners, two on 
Aug. 10 and two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, they mark Clinton's debut in raising money for  
Gore's drive to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore's 
campaign could not provide an estimate of how much it hoped to 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton fund-raising puts Gore in the awkward position of  
relying on the president at the same time the vice president is 
trying to establish his own political identity and separate himself 
from doubts about Clinton's moral leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in an interview, denied there was any breach with Clinton.  
``I'm just being myself. There's naturally a difference between 
speaking as a vice president in support of the president's 
initiatives and priorities every single day, and then stepping out 
on your own and saying, `I'm a candidate for president, here are my 
ideas and my proposals.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president said there were ``no fights'' with Clinton.  
He spoke in an interview with American Urban Radio Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's help was  
not prompted by Bush's collection of a record-shattering $36 
million in the first six months of the year, about double what Gore 
raised. Adding to Gore's troubles, Democratic rival Bill Bradley 
showed surprisingly strong fund-raising strength, collecting $11.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president stands ready to help in whatever way he can, and  
this is certainly one important way he can help the vice 
president,'' Lockhart said. He said Clinton had always planned to 
help Gore, and that there had been discussions about fund raising 
as early as the beginning of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said reports of strain between Clinton and Gore were  
just ``senseless chatter that's going on in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the White House declined to adopt Gore's proposal to  
require a photo license for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton believes the idea has merit but that it  
does not have a chance of being approved in the current Congress. 
``As far as the president is concerned,'' Lockhart said, ``these 
are issues for down the road because with this Congress, we're not 
going anyplace on issues like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton touted Gore's license proposal Wednesday night to  
the College Democrats of America and trumpeted the vice president's 
other initiatives on crime prevention and the environment. He urged 
the youths to focus on ideas rather than rhetoric in the coming 
months.

<HEADLINE> Union Trusts Can't Sue Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Union trust funds in Oregon can't sue  
tobacco companies for the smoking-related health costs of union 
members, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal judge's  
ruling last August that only individual union members, and not the 
union trust funds that cover their health care, could sue tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Two federal appeals courts in other states have reached the same  
conclusion. The trust funds have not been given the same legal 
standing as state governments, which can sue tobacco companies for 
the costs of caring for state residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust funds accused eight companies of conspiring to hide  
the dangers of smoking since the 1950s and to suppress the 
development of safer cigarettes. The suit said the companies' 
conduct led to increased smoking and higher health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Upholding a ruling by U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh, the  
appeals court said the suit had to be dismissed because the 
companies' alleged conduct was not closely connected to the harm 
claimed by the trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Shorr, a lawyer for the trust funds, declined comment,  
saying he had not seen the ruling. Herbert Wachtell, lawyer for the 
tobacco companies, had left for the day when his office was called 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to similar rulings in the 2nd and 3rd circuits, Philip  
Morris Co. assistant general counsel for Steven B. Rissman said, 
``We are optimistic that these developments will hasten the demise 
of this type of litigation brought by labor union funds and other 
insurers against the tobacco industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Oregon Laborers-Employers Health &AMP; Welfare Trust  
Fund vs. Philip Morris, 98-36024.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Julia Roberts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Unlike the insecure A-list actress  
she plays in ``Notting Hill,'' Julia Roberts professes to have 
learned, over these insane tabloid-filled years since ``Pretty 
Woman,'' how to deal with what she calls the ``extraneous aspects 
of being famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with the way that she approaches her famousness,''  
said Roberts, 31, of the character's fits and paranoia and 
duplicity. ``I've never approached it the same way. I would get 
really frustrated with some of her choices and I would feel she is 
kind of a little weak about some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how does Roberts deal with it?  
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly with ease,'' she said. ``I come from the sort of  
`live and let live' school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet ...  
</P>
<P>
	There are those prickly subjects. The money, for one. She  
doesn't like to talk about her ascendance to the heights of 
Hollywood success, the $17 million paychecks and all. It has 
nothing to do with the parts she picks, and, besides, it's nobody's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	And the personal stuff.  
</P>
<P>
	Don't even suggest, for a moment, that anybody could ever find  
the slightest hint of similarity between her real life and her role 
in the upcoming ``Runaway Bride,'' the story of a woman who can't 
deal with long-term commitment and has a habit of leaving men at 
the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is that possible?'' she asked, emotion in her voice. ``I'm  
asking you: `How is that possible?''' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been nine years since Roberts charmed moviegoers in  
``Pretty Woman,'' the megahit romantic comedy that teamed her with 
Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall. They're back together in 
``Runaway Bride,'' scheduled for release July 30. Roberts was 
interviewed in a Beverly Hills hotel while promoting the film. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How have things changed for you since ``Pretty Woman''?  
</P>
<P>
	Roberts: It's like the difference between being a girl and being  
a grown-up -- and all the wonderful and delicious life experiences 
that come with that. For me, in a lot of ways, I'm a really 
different person. As far as work goes, I think I'm more comfortable 
with my own personality, my own voice, with my own ideas in how to 
execute them. I was still really shy when I was 20. Now I feel I've 
either outgrown my shyness or know how to compensate for it. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Why did you decide to do a movie with Richard Gere and Garry  
Marshall again? 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts: Well, we all wanted to work together again because we  
liked working together. ... It wasn't, `Oh, we made tons of money 
let's work together again.' .... But we couldn't all agree on 
decent material, or find time to do it. There are a lot of 
variables with three working people. Three people of, you know, 
different tastes, different generations, different lifestyles. We 
couldn't be three more different people. To find something we could 
all actually work on together is no small feat. 
</P>
<P>
	3. It seemed as if ``Notting Hill'' was written with you in mind  
as the lead character. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts: It's not Julia Roberts. It's Anna Scott. For someone to  
think that I'm so fascinated with myself that I deserve to be the 
main character in a movie -- they're out of their mind. A, my life 
is not to be documented in that way and B, I'm not that 
narcissistic. So for people to think I'm playing myself is selling 
me way short. I worked way too hard on that movie. I work hard to 
look that natural. I can't prevent people from saying that. I'm not 
trying to change people's minds about me; never tried to, not 
interested in it. If they want to think Anna Scott is me playing 
myself, that's fine. But I didn't write the script. I didn't know 
the man who wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
	4. If you disagree with how Anna Scott dealt with her fame, how  
do you approach it? 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts: It's not to say that I am above having my feelings hurt  
and above getting annoyed. But for the most part I love what I do, 
and the positive aspects of what I do always outweigh the negative 
aspects. I've never been one to really care too much what strangers 
think. 
</P>
<P>
	5. You are among the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. Do you  
feel extra box-office pressure when you take a role? 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts: I can't. I'm the one who has to do it. I'm the one who  
has to live with it forever. So I have to decide if I like it, and 
I can't decide if someone else is going to like it. If we could 
predict which movies would make a ton of money -- guess what? -- we'd 
never make a flop. So, the only person I can rely on is myself, and 
what at the moment is appealing to me, and what I want to do and 
who I want to give a life to in a movie. That's the only choice I 
can make. I don't give a (expletive) about the money. I don't care 
if it makes a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't understand people who get so wrapped up in money, and  
quite frankly I think it's offensive. I think that's very peculiar, 
and yet I find people constantly throwing money questions at me. I 
find them interesting simply because I don't attach any kind of 
emotion to money. That's not what makes me do a movie. That's not 
what makes me not do a movie. That's not what makes me get up in 
the morning. That's not what makes me happy. That's not what 
motivates me in any way.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Unveils Laser Network System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies today unveiled a  
new networking system that transmits information on a laser light 
beam through the air, cutting out the need for underground cables. 
</P>
<P>
	The WaveStar OpticAir system uses dense wavelength division  
multiplexing, or DWDM, which combines voice, data and video 
information on a light beam. 
</P>
<P>
	DWDM can transmit data at 10 billion bits per second, Lucent  
says, while the fastest phone line can move data about 1.5 million 
bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
	The WaveStar system takes information from a traditional  
landline, such as fiber optic cable, shoots it through a two-inch 
wide amplifying lens to a receiver up to three miles away, which 
then distributes the information through a network via cable. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to the system is that nothing, such as a building,  
can obstruct the beam as it travels from the amplifying lens to the 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ability to expand a network without having to install  
underground fiber optic cable overshadows this drawback, Lucent 
spokeswoman Mary Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, she said, a local network provider doesn't have to  
go to a city and ask them to dig up streets so that more fiber 
optic cable can be laid down. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's system will be field-tested this December, with the  
company hoping for a commercial release by March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., is one of the world's  
largest providers of telecommunications equipment and services and 
was once a part of AT&AMP;T Corp.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earns $2.48B in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., profiting from robust car  
and truck sales in the United States, reported today that its 
second-quarter operating earnings rose 4 percent to $2.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker earned $2 a share on an operating  
basis for the April-June period compared with $2.38 billion, or 
$1.91 a share, for the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results surpassed the company's previous for high quarterly  
operating earnings of $2.42 billion in the second quarter of 1997 
and included profits from Associates First Capital, a finance unit 
since divested. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $42.3 billion, up 13 percent from $37.3 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's operating earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts'  
expectations. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by First 
Call Corp. was $1.95 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose 75 cents to $54.25 a share in early  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit improvement was largely the result of rising  
automotive earnings in North America. Ford continued to struggle in 
Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great quarter in North America, offset by a  
continuing poor performance overseas,'' said analyst John Casesa of 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The quarter is a reminder that despite what 
is clearly a compelling vision to transform the company 
longer-term, there are some near-term challenges that Ford needs to 
address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sales in the United States are on pace to set a record  
this year, barring a strike or other major event that severely 
restricts production or demand. Ford said it earned just under $2 
billion in the region, up 19 percent from the April through June 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many positive factors at work in the U.S. economy  
right now,'' President Jac Nasser said. ``We're confident vehicle 
sales will remain strong through the balance of 1999 and into 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford executives said continued cost-cutting also was a  
significant factor. Automotive costs declined by $300 million in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strong earnings momentum over the last 13 quarters is the  
result of our intense drive to improve quality, lower costs and 
become more nimble,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's net earnings were $2.34 billion, or $1.89 a share,  
including a one-time profit reduction of $146 million related to 
its acquisition of the car unit of Sweden's Volvo AB. Ford said 
that under U.S. accounting rules, it was required to write-up the 
inventory it acquired from Volvo to its fair value, resulting in 
the increase in cost of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford earned $89 million in Europe as Volvo results reduced its  
European profits by $125 million. Excluding Volvo, Ford earned $214 
million, down 31 percent from the $310 million earned a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The European results reflect lower sales of the aging Fiesta  
subcompact and Mondeo compact sedans and fewer exports, which were 
offset by strong initial sales of the new Focus subcompact and a 
better performance by Ford's Jaguar unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford Motor Co.'s market share is up in Europe, but restoring  
our profits in the region to a more robust level will take time and 
a continued focus on great products, quality and lower costs,'' 
Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	In South America, Ford lost $120 million, compared with earnings  
of $14 million a year ago. Ford blamed the downturn in Brazil, 
where vehicle sales declined 20 percent industrywide in the first 
half. Ford said it expects the Brazilian economy to remain weak for 
the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half operating earnings totaled $4.32 billion, up 11  
percent from the $3.9 billion in the first six months of 1998. 
Revenues during the period totaled $80.2 billion, an 8.5 percent 
increase from $73.9 billion in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford's problems in Brazil are not intractable, but meaningful  
improvement will take creativity and ingenuity on our part, a 
continued focus on costs, and government policies that encourage 
sustainable economic growth,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income from worldwide automotive operations was $1.9  
billion, down $120 million from 1998's second quarter. But 
excluding the Volvo profit reduction, automotive earnings totaled 
$2.1 billion, up 1 percent from $2.05 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its automotive cash reserve totaled $24 billion at the  
end of the quarter, up from $22.3 billion a year earlier. Minus 
outstanding debt, Ford's net cash was $12.6 billion, down from 
$14.1 billion a year ago because of the Volvo purchase and other 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Ford said it reduced automotive costs  
by $400 million. Its full-year goal is a reduction of $1 billion 
from 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's Visteon Automotive Systems parts unit earned $282 million  
in the second quarter, up 17 percent from $241 a year ago. For the 
first half, Visteon earned $490 million, a 14 percent improvement 
from $430 million earned in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit earned $335 million in the quarter, up 12 percent  
from $300 million a year ago. Ford's Hertz rental-car unit posted 
an $88 million profit, up 17 percent from $75 million.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Collects $800,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush went from northern  
Virginia's booming high-technology region to a poor inner city 
neighborhood in Baltimore on Wednesday, watching children work on 
computers and raising $800,000 for his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner visited a neighborhood center for  
children in a mostly black area a few blocks east of Baltimore's 
glittering Inner Harbor. Bush spoke to each of the youngsters and 
observed them as they worked on computer reading exercises and 
played games. 
</P>
<P>
	He answered questions from the children on topics ranging from  
his hobbies to whether he would support a minimum wage. His 
hobbies, he said, were reading books, running and fishing. Bush was 
less direct, however, on his response to the minimum wage question, 
saying he would worry about ``pricing people out of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who ranged in age from the early teens and down,  
crowded around Bush as he signed and distributed baseball 
card-style pictures of himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was accompanied by Rep. John Kasich, who quit the  
Republican presidential race earlier Wednesday and threw his 
endorsement to Bush. Kasich called the Texas governor a ``soul 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After praising the neighborhood center, The Door, as the kind of  
faith-based enterprise that is needed across the country to help 
children avoid drugs and crime, Bush left for the Inner Harbor and 
a fund-raiser that his press secretary, Karen Hughes, said would 
bring in about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a like amount was raised earlier in the day at the  
event in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's visit to Virginia, his second in less than a month,  
attracted high-tech luminaries such as America Online's chairman 
and chief executive, Steve Case, as well as executives from Network 
Solutions and Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush's aides touted the event as an overwhelming show of  
support for Bush from northern Virginia's high-tech leaders, some 
of those in attendance were there to simply meet and hear Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Case declined to say afterward whether he supports Bush, and a  
list of donors did not include his name. ``It's early in the 
process,'' Case said as he hurried to elude a reporter at the Ritz 
Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL spokesman said later that Case has donated $1,000 to  
Bush. He said he did not know if Case also had contributed to other 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, at a Washington news conference, Bush received the  
endorsement of former Republican presidential rival John Kasich, 
who dropped out of the race Wednesday. ``I feel as though I have a 
soul brother,'' Kasich said, wearing a Bush campaign cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting the Ohio congressman support, Bush responded, ``People  
in this country want a campaign that is positive and hopeful and 
inclusive, a campaign that attracts new faces and new voices; a 
campaign that will speak to our better angels, not our darker 
impulses; a campaign that will give America a fresh start after a 
season of cynicism. That's exactly the kind of campaign John Kasich 
was running. He's going to fit perfectly on my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In McLean, Va., Bush addressed about 500 at the hotel in the  
heart of Virginia's ``high-tech heaven'' and repeated his campaign 
themes of cutting taxes, reducing government regulation of 
business, free trade, and improving the military and education. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took a slap at the Democratic presidential front-runner,  
Vice President Al Gore, by saying that America's current prosperity 
is not due to the Clinton-Gore administration's policies. ``They no 
more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not say whether he supports efforts by states to impose  
taxes on Internet commerce, a topic of great interest in the 
high-tech community. Business representatives, meeting in 
Williamsburg last month, said they adamantly oppose any tax that 
singles out the Internet, such as a charge on World Wide Web 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said the candidate will await the recommendation of a  
congressional commission headed by Gov. James Gilmore, who is 
endorsing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore introduced Bush at the fund-raiser and accompanied him  
on a visit to a summer computer program at Alexandria's Thomas A. 
Edison High School, where a student demonstrated a computer program 
to design houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for a new house,'' Bush quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	At the fund-raiser, Gilmore said Bush understands northern  
Virginia's high-tech needs because of his work to promote the 
growth of technology growth in Texas. Gilmore drew laughs by 
introducing Bush as the next ``webmaster of www.whitehouse.gov.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Joe Howe said he has yet to choose a  
candidate. ``I think we would all like to get to know a little more 
about this man,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, about 30 protesters chanted ``Virginia is not for  
sale'' and held signs reading ``stand up for gun safety.''

	The formula for distributing U.S. aid allows Israel to get its  
money all at once in the beginning of each fiscal year while Egypt 
and other countries must wait for dollars to be doled out through 
the year. That allows Israel --the largest recipient of U.S. aid -- 
to put its money in an interest-bearing account. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House  
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said the formula 
was ``stupid foreign policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of keeping the status quo said this was no time to  
change the formula to Israel's disadvantage, particularly as the 
Mideast peace process seemed to be reviving and Israel's new prime 
minister, Ehud Barak, was on his way to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation in dealing with the Middle East to first  
do no harm,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has threatened a veto on the overall  
foreign aid bill because it falls far short of the $14.6 billion 
requested by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides $960 million in economic assistance and $1.9  
billion in military assistance for Israel in the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1. That compares with $1.1 billion in economic 
assistance and $1.9 billion in military assistance for Israel in 
the current year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Egypt, the bill provides $735 million in economic  
assistance, down from $775 million in the current year, and $1.3 
billion in military assistance, the same as now. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan said giving Israel preferential treatment did not make  
sense and reduced any leverage the United States had over how the 
money is spent. He blamed the ``Israel lobby'' for the existing 
formula, which has been in effect for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In legislation Callahan presented to his subcommittee, he  
removed the advance-payment provision for Israel. But subcommittee 
members, by a voice vote, approved an amendment by Reps. Joe 
Knollenberg, R-Mich., and Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., that restored the 
existing aid formula. 
</P>
<P>
	A compromise by Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the  
Appropriations Committee, would have added $25 million to Egypt's 
accounts. But Callahan protested that ``two wrongs don't make a 
right'' and Young withdrew his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and Egypt are, by far, the largest recipients of U.S.  
foreign aid, even though the Clinton administration and Congress 
have embarked on a program to scale it back over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill also provides $200 million in economic  
assistance and $125 million in military assistance for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation does not include any of the $500 million Clinton  
requested to carry out the 1998 Wye River peace accords, nor does 
it provide any funds for reconstruction in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's $12.7 billion foreign aid bill, passed June 30,  
contains roughly $500 million for reconstruction in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill provides $725 million in aid to Russia and other  
former Soviet republics, some $307 million beneath Clinton's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it would withhold half the amount earmarked for  
Russia ``unless it ends nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation 
with Iran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the State Department told a House hearing that it has  
no plans to attend a U.N. meeting, set for Thursday, to investigate 
whether Israel's settlements in disputed territory violate an 
international accord to protect civilians in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, in Geneva, is ill-conceived and should be  
delayed or canceled, Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for 
Near East affairs, told the House International Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House this week overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging  
the State Department to boycott the meeting. But Indyk said the 
United States never intended to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee chairman, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said that  
since Israel's admission to the United Nations in 1948, ``the 
General Assembly has regularly engaged in anti-Israel rhetoric and 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those attacks, led by such mutual foes as Iran, Iraq and  
Libya, continue today,'' Gilman said.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires, at odds with owners  
since Roberto Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, voted 
Wednesday to resign Sept. 2 and not work the final month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a meeting of the Major League  
Umpires Association, amounted to the first blow in their latest 
dispute with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, meanwhile, seemed almost pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting and said they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. The other 11 were expected to announce their resignations 
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
Games resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually. The deal bars strikes, so 
the resignations are an attempt to get around that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1985 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained a court 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of the repeated threats, seem to have adopted an  
attitude that the umpires are replaceable. Alderson said the 
umpires' actions made him wonder if this would ``escalate this 
situation to the point were it might be irretrievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> Rules Eyed After Internet Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent mergers of cable TV companies could  
mean higher Internet access prices for rural residents and perhaps 
lead to new regulations, some senators are suggesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  
said Wednesday that the 1996 law deregulating cable television 
prices did not anticipate the impact mergers might have on the race 
among telecommunications companies to provide fast cable Internet 
access, called ``broadband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's recent takeover of the large cable company  
Tele-Communications Inc. and its plan to buy MediaOne are 
intensifying debate over whether to force cable businesses to share 
their high-speed lines with competitors -- something America Online, 
consumer groups and some phone companies want. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission has declined to force  
high-speed line sharing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, R-Utah, and the chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee, Republican John McCain of Arizona, are considering 
whether Congress should act to prevent companies from freezing out 
competitors or restricting consumers' options for Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	But they left open the possibility that the market in the future  
-- through the expected big growth in high-speed Internet services -- 
could serve as a check on the power of individual companies, making 
new regulations unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and a few lawmakers predicted that the marketplace would  
straighten out the problem in the long-run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraging an open system,'' C. Michael Armstrong,  
chairman and CEO of AT&AMP;T, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just let it rip,'' agreed Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Since  
we're doing so well in the private sector, why should the 
government get involved?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, that is what Broward County, Fla., did. By 4-3,  
county commissioners voted to require AT&AMP;T to open its cable 
network to competing Internet service providers in an effort to 
foster competition between local companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone companies' high-speed Internet services are subject to  
federal regulations. Cable companies' provision of these services 
are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadband access over cable lines offers connection speeds  
dozens of times faster than today's standard telephone modems 
hooked to regular phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable, telephone, satellite and wireless companies, however, are  
all racing against each other to provide high-speed connections to 
consumers and businesses, using various technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeing consumers from the sluggish performance of the Internet,  
high-speed connections will finally make possible new computer 
applications that include TV-quality video and better audio on the 
Web.

<HEADLINE> Apple's Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc.'s profit nearly doubled in  
the recent quarter, easily beating Wall Street forecasts, as demand 
surged for the company's iMac desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The results released Wednesday offered the latest evidence of a  
resurgence at Apple this past year, further easing any doubts over 
the company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's profit in its fiscal third quarter rose to $203 million,  
or $1.20 a share. That was up from a profit of $101 million, or 65 
cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time gain, Apple would have earned $114 million,  
or 69 cents a share in the three months ended June 26, exceeding 
the 64 cents projected by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple released its financial results after the markets closed.  
Apple shares were trading at $56 in after-hours trading after 
jumping 4 percent, or $2.25, during the regular trading session on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market to close at $55.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.40 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., credited a 40 percent rise in  
unit sales of computers, fueled by the iMac. Apple's share of 
retail desktop sales was 6.7 percent in May, double that of a year 
ago, according to ZD Infobeads research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac desktop, which has spurred a design shakeup in the PC  
industry since its introduction last August, is shaped like a giant 
jelly bean, equipped with a built-in monitor, and comes in five 
translucent colors through which inner circuitry is faintly 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also profited from an unexpected drop in the cost of iMac  
parts, including memory and microprocessor chips, chief financial 
officer Fred Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were somewhat offset by higher expenses as Apple  
added 500 workers for a total work force of 8,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said its sales and growth rate are expected to rise  
slightly the next quarter, but will increase more strongly as the 
company rolls out new product lines, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple is widely expected to introduce a new consumer laptop to  
the market next week, but has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ended June 26, Apple earned $490 million, or  
$2.99 a share, up from earnings of $203 million, or $1.40 a share, 
in the year-ago period. Revenues rose to $4.80 billion from $4.36 
billion.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC, which takes over hockey games from Fox this  
season, will show four regional telecasts and the NHL All-Star game 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney Corp., which owns both ABC and ESPN, acquired the rights  
to the NHL in August for $600 million over five years. Fox's deal, 
which ran from 1994-99, was worth about $30 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's first broadcast will be the NHL All-Star game on Feb. 6 in  
Toronto. The network will also show weekend coverage for the first 
three rounds of the playoffs and up to five Stanley Cup finals 
games in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, which was part of the NHL package with Fox for the past  
five seasons, opens with the Pittsburgh Penguins at Dallas Stars on 
Oct. 1 at 7:30 p.m. The cable network has increased the number of 
games on ESPN2 from 75 last season to 102 in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN will air up to 27 regular-season games, playoff coverage  
and the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals.

<HEADLINE> Acclaimed Writer Williams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sherley Ann Williams, an author who used her  
experience as a migrant farmworker to write a critically acclaimed 
novel about black slavery, has died. She was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams died of cancer July 8, said Kate Callen, a  
spokeswoman for the University of California at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams had been working on a novel and a sequel to her  
1986 historical novel, ``Dessa Rose,'' a story about a privileged 
Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave. The New York Times 
praised the novel as ``artistically brilliant, emotionally 
affecting and totally unforgettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams' first book of verse, ``The Peacock Poems,'' was  
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975. 
Her second book of verse, ``Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' was 
another National Book Award nominee, and a TV performance based on 
the book won an Emmy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1992 children's book ``Working Cotton'' received the  
American Library Association Caldecott Award. 
</P>
<P>
	She also wrote a one-woman drama called ``Letters From a New  
England Negro'' that was performed at the National Black Theater 
Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater Festival 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams was born in Bakersfield and grew up in Fresno,  
where her parents were migrant workers. As a child, she loved to 
read, but her mother tried to discourage her from reading so she 
wouldn't develop ambitions she might not be able to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
	An eighth-grade science teacher encouraged her to pursue  
college, but her parents died by the time she was 16 and she 
survived by picking crops in the same fields where they had 
labored. 
</P>
<P>
	She attended California State University at Fresno, where she  
earned a bachelor's degree in English. After obtaining her master's 
degree in American literature at Brown University, she joined the 
literature department at UC San Diego in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by a son, a sister and three grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Maker To Cut 1,100 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.  
plans to cut 1,100 jobs from its work force -- most of them in 
Connecticut -- citing a need to reduce overhead and become more 
competitive in a global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said Wednesday it plans to close some of its 10  
plants in the state, but company spokesman William Tuttle would not 
identify the factories targeted for closure. 
</P>
<P>
	All but about 1,000 of Sikorsky's 8,100 employees are in  
Connecticut. The company also has plants in West Palm Beach, Fla., 
Troy, Ala., and smaller facilities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the plants outside Connecticut will be affected by the  
cuts, Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sikorsky is a division of Hartford-based United Technologies  
Corp. Among its helicopters are: the Black Hawk, used in a variety 
of military operations; the Seahawk, used by navies all over the 
world; the Comanche, used by the U.S. Army; and aircraft for civil 
applications, including medical rescue choppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it planned to offer early retirement packages  
for salaried and hourly employees who are 55 and older and have at 
least 10 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuttle would not say how many employees the company expected to  
lay off and how many may take the early retirement deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to allay layoffs,'' Tuttle said. ``We're putting  
the emphasis on packages right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sikorsky has cut nearly 2,200 jobs over the past five years,  
including 500 already in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Sikorsky said the job cuts and plant closings  
are designed to strengthen its competitiveness as it continues a 
decade-long shift from reliance on U.S. government contracts toward 
commercial and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through this restructuring, we will build a stronger  
competitive company to ensure our continuing leadership position in 
the global marketplace,'' said Sikorsky president Dean C. Borgman, 
who took office July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has its headquarters in Stratford, is named  
for the inventor of the modern helicopter, Igor Sikorsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Other United Technologies divisions have seen layoffs and job  
cuts as the defense industry softened. Its jet engine division, 
Pratt &AMP; Whitney, last year announced it was eliminating 2,000 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other United Technologies divisions include Carrier air  
conditioning equipment, Otis elevators and Hamilton Standard 
aerospace systems.

<HEADLINE> AG Files Suit vs. Supremacist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The state on Wednesday filed suit against the  
World Church of the Creator, the white supremacist group to which 
racial spree killer Benjamin Smith belonged, to determine if the 
group is a charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``No organization has the right to exploit the protections and  
benefits the law affords charities,'' Attorney General Jim Ryan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan launched an investigation of the church after learning that  
Benjamin Smith, who police say killed two people and injured nine 
during a shooting rampage over the Fourth of July weekend, was once 
a member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	All the victims were black, Jewish or Asian. The rampage ended  
when Smith killed himself as police tried to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had run-ins with authorities in Illinois and Indiana,  
where he blanketed communities with the church's white supremacist 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Revenue is also studying the group to  
find out whether it violated any tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``They applied to us as a religious organization,'' department  
spokesman Mike Klemens said earlier this month. ``They are not a 
religious organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church leader Matthew Hale said Wednesday he chose not to  
register the church with the state or pay any taxes based on 
informal talks he had with an attorney four years ago. He says he 
believes he followed the law on registration of charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also is scrutinizing Hale's group.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Mows Down Baseball's Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- At the end of the next century, baseball fans  
still will be talking about what Pedro Martinez did on this night. 
</P>
<P>
	Of how Mark McGwire flailed at strike three.  
</P>
<P>
	Of how Sammy Sosa looked like a statue when a called third  
zoomed by. 
</P>
<P>
	Of how Barry Larkin, Larry Walker and Jeff Bagwell walked away  
from the plate, strikeout victims all. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's biggest boppers came to the plate and Pedro Martinez  
made the power go out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't appreciate leading off today. I had to do  
it,'' Larkin said, in awe of Martinez's MVP performance in the 
American League's 4-1 victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez became the first pitcher to strike out the first three  
batters in an All-Star game, fanning Larkin, Walker and Sosa in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the ball when it went by me,'' Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
	He boosted his record to the first tour when he got McGwire on  
four pitches leading off the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout old Fenway Park, fans were buzzing. Would Martinez  
equal, maybe surpass, the great Carl Hubbell, who struck out five 
of baseball's best, all in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of how bad he wants to make hitters look,''  
Texas closer John Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it came down to Matt Williams, no slouch himself with 23  
homers this season. Williams, who threatened Roger Maris' home run 
record before the 1994 strike, turned out to be the only blemish. 
And it wasn't that much of a smudge, a grounder to second that was 
misplayed for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	All Martinez did was strike out Jeff Bagwell, and Ivan Rodriguez  
threw out Williams at second for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys, those are some of the best in the world,''  
Martinez said after his 28-pitch performance in two electric 
innings. ``But anything could happen, and that's what makes our 
game so special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez silenced the National League dugout.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty obvious there's not a lot to say,'' Jeromy Burnitz  
recalled. ``Guys aren't coming back happy and gay when they strike 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is 15-3 at the All-Star break, and has an outside  
chance to become the first 30-game winner in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best lively arm in the game of baseball,''  
McGwire said. ``There's a very, very good chance he'll win 30 or 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performance drew comparisons of the 1934 All-Star game at  
New York's Polo Grounds, when Hubbell struck out Babe Ruth, Lou 
Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin, each and every one 
elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin (165), Walker (250), Sosa (305), McGwire (485) and  
Bagwell (249) have combined for 1,454 homers. Hubbell's victims in 
1934 finished their careers with 2,218, and before long, Martinez's 
prey may top that. 
</P>
<P>
	Era of offense? Not with Martinez on the mound.  
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring all the sluggers on the field, fans who stuck around  
after the game kept chanting his name. In the shadow of the Green 
Monster, the very symbol of offense, Martinez was the star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Pedro pretty much dominated and lifted everybody up,''  
Cleveland's Jim Thome said. ``He's a big-game pitcher, and he rises 
to the occasion.''

<HEADLINE>  Maple Leaf Coach Quinn Also To Be GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Coach Pat Quinn of the Toronto Maple Leafs has  
added the general manager's job to his duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn, who at one time held the dual role in Vancouver, replaces  
Ken Dryden, the team's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were fifth overall in the league and reached the  
final four,'' Dryden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we still have a long way to go. I think Pat is the one who  
can see us through the next difficult steps and get us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said his priority would still be coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I'm still the coach and that's my prime responsibility.  
It's just that my focus on that job changes a little bit,'' he 
said. ``I hope to be able to still have my coach's hat and when the 
opportunity for a bigger picture of the organization comes into 
place I hope to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job became open when Dryden didn't rehire associate GM Mike  
Smith last month. Dryden had the GM title but Smith had been the de 
facto general manager, making all personnel moves.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires, at odds with owners  
since Roberto Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, voted 
Wednesday to resign Sept. 2 and not work the final month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a meeting of the Major League  
Umpires Association, amounted to the first blow in their latest 
dispute with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, meanwhile, seemed almost pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting and said they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 weeks of the 
season. The other 11 were expected to announce their resignations 
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
Games resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually. The deal bars strikes, so 
the resignations are an attempt to get around that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1985 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained a court 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of the repeated threats, seem to have adopted an  
attitude that the umpires are replaceable. Alderson said the 
umpires' actions made him wonder if this would ``escalate this 
situation to the point were it might be irretrievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Quits GOP, Seeks White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having quit the Republican Party, newly  
independent presidential candidate Sen. Bob Smith says he can win 
the White House with a coalition of those disenchanted with current 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to beat Al Gore and Bush if he's nominated,'' Smith  
told The Associated Press, after quitting the GOP Tuesday in a 
Senate floor speech. He referred to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who 
is leading all other Republican candidates in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he ``would seek the nomination of another political  
party,'' and that he had spoken with members of the Reform Party 
and the U.S. Taxpayers Party, whose September convention he plans 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire senator said an inevitable ``party  
realignment'' may have started and this ``could be the beginning of 
the end of the Republican Party as we know it.'' He said 
conservative Republican principles would wind up as the platform of 
another party. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP critics, including New Hampshire Republican Chairman Steve  
Duprey, have said Smith's abandonment of the party will doom his 
chances of re-election in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate race isn't until 2002. ... I intend to be president  
in 2001, so the Senate race is irrelevant,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he said, his constituents would not be  
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm voting the same way,'' Smith said. ``If Republicans  
elected me to be pro-life, pro-gun, pro-Constitution, pro-strong 
military, pro-character and integrity and to do good constituent 
service, I'm the same guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a crowded Republican presidential field, Smith's campaign has  
trailed in both support and fund raising. Only 1 percent of 
Republicans supported Smith, well behind virtually every other 
candidate in a field dominated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Karen Hickey said Smith would report about $1  
million in contributions over the first half of the year. Bush, by 
comparison, raised a record $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish Bob Smith hadn't left the Republican Party,'' Bush said  
Tuesday night as he arrived in Washington for a series of campaign 
appearances. ``I think the party is big enough for Bob Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he might have stayed in the GOP race if Bush had come  
out as ``a strong advocate of pro-life'' and had offered positions 
on other Republican issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I couldn't beat him, I probably would have dropped out and  
endorsed him,'' Smith said. ``But I don't know what he supports 
because he hasn't said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had  
counseled Smith against leaving the GOP. ``I know that he's doing 
this out of conviction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Smith, who cast his first votes as an independent  
Tuesday on patients' rights legislation, had indicated that he 
still would like to be included in Republican conference meetings 
and decisions. He said senators would discuss whether Smith should 
remain chairman of the ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that party members had told him ``there would be no  
punitive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential contender Dan Quayle said he could identify  
with Smith's frustration, and that his decision to leave was ``a 
loss for the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I share the frustration but not the conclusion that leaving  
the party is the right course of action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his Senate speech, Smith accused the GOP of betraying its  
``core values,'' saying the party platform was for ``suckers'' and 
``not worth the paper it's written on.''

<HEADLINE> Company Charged in ValuJet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Richard Kessler Jr. finds only a measure of relief  
in the landmark charges filed against the company accused of 
improperly packing the oxygen canisters blamed for the deadly 1996 
ValuJet crash. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Kathleen, was among 110 passengers and crew who died  
when their DC-9 burst into flames and plunged into the Everglades. 
Like other relatives of those killed, Kessler has been waiting a 
long time for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The families have just wanted to see the process go forward,''  
he said Tuesday, hours after SabreTech Inc. and three of its 
employees were indicted for murder and manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges conspiracy, making false statements and,  
in the case of SabreTech, failing to properly train the personnel 
who handled hazardous material. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed to be the first time in U.S. aviation history  
that criminal charges have been filed against a company and 
maintenance workers after an airplane accident. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the company could face fines that may go to the  
victims' families as restitution, said Don Ungurait, a prosecution 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This corporation is not going to be allowed to escape  
unpunished when it committed crimes and acts that resulted in these 
many deaths,'' said Katherine Fernandez Rundle, state attorney for 
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech said prosecutors ignored findings by the National  
Transportation Safety Board investigation, which spread the blame 
among SabreTech, ValuJet and the Federal Aviation Administration 
for lax oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to stand idly by and be made a criminal  
scapegoat for this tragedy,'' said Kenneth Quinn, an attorney for 
SabreTech. ``This was a horrific accident, not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crash investigators found that SabreTech workers improperly  
packaged the oxygen generators without their required safety caps 
and falsely labeled them as empty. ValuJet workers loaded them into 
the cargo hold for transportation at a time when the airline was 
not authorized to haul such hazardous cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The generators, about the size of a Thermos bottle, are used in  
compartments above passengers' heads. They contain chemicals that, 
when mixed in emergencies, produce about 15 minutes worth of 
oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the generators ignited, causing the fire that  
tore through the floor of the passenger cabin shortly after takeoff 
on the Miami-to-Atlanta flight on May 11, 1996. All aboard died. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal indictment said mechanics Eugene Florence and Mauro  
Valenzuela signed off on FAA-approved work orders, and falsely 
indicated they had fastened the required safety caps on the 
canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	The caps could have prevented the canisters from igniting. The  
crash led to a ban against transporting oxygen canisters aboard 
passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also alleges that Daniel Gonzalez, SabreTech's  
vice president of maintenance and repair work, pressured workers to 
falsify and prematurely certify the performance and completion of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The yellow caps would have cost a total of $9.16, according to  
testimony obtained during the NTSB investigation. Acting U.S. 
Attorney Guy Lewis contends that SabreTech ``put corporate profits 
ahead of public safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal arrest warrants were issued, and the three men were  
expected to surrender by Thursday. The men could be sentenced up to 
55 years in prison and fined $2.7 million on the conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has proposed a record fine of $2.25 million against  
SabreTech for improperly handling the canisters. The company is 
challenging the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA grounded Atlanta-based ValuJet after the crash. The  
airline later merged with the Orlando-based discount carrier 
AirTran and now flies under the name AirTran. 
</P>
<P>
	For Susan Smith, who lost her 24-year-old son Paul Jordan Smith  
III in the crash, the indictments brought a sense of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always felt it was murder,'' Smith said in today's  
Miami Herald. ``I felt they put them against the wall and put a gun 
to their heads.''

<P>
	The company, SabreTech Inc., was charged by the state on Tuesday  
with murder and manslaughter. The company and three of its 
employees were later indicted by a federal grand jury on separate 
charges of conspiracy, making false statements and, in the case of 
the company, and mislabeling and mishandling hazardous material.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged in 9th Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man accused of being the railroad killer was  
linked to a ninth slaying and charged with capital murder 
Wednesday, hours after he asked a judge, ``Can all this be done 
very quickly so I can say I'm guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Angel Maturino Resendez made his request during a  
court appearance on a burglary charge in Houston, authorities said 
they had linked him by a palm print to a ninth slaying -- that of an 
87-year-old woman who was bludgeoned in her home with an antique 
iron last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Leffie Mason, who lived within 50 yards of a rail line that cuts  
through the small east Texas town of Hughes Springs, was attacked 
by someone who entered her home through a window. Her body was 
covered by a blanket, as were several other victims believed to 
have been killed by Maturino Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez was charged with her murder Wednesday  
afternoon and could face the death penalty. Texas has executed 180 
people -- by far the most in the nation -- since the U.S. Supreme 
Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old rail-hopping drifter, who turned himself in  
Tuesday after a six-week manhunt that made him one of the most 
wanted fugitives in America, is also charged with two slayings in 
Illinois and one in Kentucky and is believed responsible for five 
other killings in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	During the manhunt, the FBI referred to him by one of his  
aliases, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the murder charge was filed in Hughes Springs, the only  
charge against him in Texas was burglary, at the scene where Dr. 
Claudia Benton, 39, was killed Dec. 17 in the Houston enclave of 
West University Place. She was beaten in the head, stabbed three 
times in the back and covered with a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez's fingerprints were found on parts from the  
woman's stolen car, and prosecutors said DNA evidence might also 
link him to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	After a prosecutor in Houston described the bloody scene of Ms.  
Benton's killing, Maturino Resendez, wearing an orange jail 
jumpsuit and handcuffs, calmly asked state District Judge William 
Harmon if he could plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Maturino Resendez was specifically  
addressing the burglary charge or all of the charges against him. 
His admission of guilt was not an official plea because his court 
appearances were only to set bail and assign him a lawyer. He was 
jailed without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a charge of capital murder can usually be filed only  
when there is evidence that a murder occurred during the commission 
of certain felonies, such as burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision of whether to charge also Maturino Resendez with  
capital murder in Ms. Benton's death rests with Harris County 
District Attorney Johnny Holmes, whose county has notched the most 
death-penalty convictions in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 469 people on death row in Texas, 146 -- about one-third --  
were sent there by Harris County. If Harris County were a state, it 
would rank third in the number of people executed in the nation 
with 56. Virginia has executed 67. 
</P>
<P>
	After hiding out in Mexico, Maturino Resendez surrendered to a  
Texas Ranger at an El Paso border station Tuesday in a deal 
brokered by his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear why he turned himself in. Mexico doesn't have  
the death penalty and doesn't return suspects to countries where 
they may face the death penalty. But Mike Cox, a Texas Department 
of Public Safety spokesman, said Maturino Resendez may have feared 
bounty hunters. A $125,000 reward had been offered for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' hold on Maturino Resendez also might mean Kentucky and  
Illinois officials never get to prosecute him. Lexington, Ky., 
police Sgt. Mark Barnard said he hopes that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if he gets the death penalty seven times,''  
Barnard said. ``I want him in Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez is thought to have traveled by hopping freight  
trains. All of the victims were killed near the tracks. 
Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing spree apparently started with the 1997 slaying of a  
21-year-old college student in Kentucky. The most recent slayings 
were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter, found 
dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Buys Into Gear.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com, the world's largest online book  
retailer, is taking another step toward its goal of being a massive 
online shopping hub. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com announced today it has bought a 49 percent stake in  
Gear.com, an online discount sporting-goods retailer. The 
announcement came one day after Amazon.com began selling toys and 
electronics on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The online superstore has already invested millions of dollars  
in online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop Pets.com, and 
cyber supermarket HomeGrocer.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall reason that we're making the investments we're  
making is we have a longterm vision to be the leading destination 
for e-commerce, where people can go find and discover anything they 
want to buy on the 'Net,'' said Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry. 
``Anything is a big category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to disclose the dollar value of the investment.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com was interested in Gear.com because of its focus on  
customer satisfaction, said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invest only in companies that share our passion for  
customers,'' Bezos said. ``The Gear.com management team is 
dedicated to providing a great customer experience, including a 
100-percent customer-satisfaction policy. From backpacking to 
wakeboarding, Gear.com finds the best closeouts, so customers get 
new, fully functional gear at closeout prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gear.com offers closeout merchandise at 20 percent to 90 percent  
off retail costs. The closeouts result from overproduction, a 
change of style, color, or function and the cancellation of 
preseason orders placed by retailers, and all merchandise is new 
and comes in its original packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are based in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Enjoys Big Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While rookie sensation Chamique Holdsclaw is the  
center of attention, she is equally in awe of her WNBA All-Star 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just excited to be here and meet some of these people,''  
the 21-year-old Holdsclaw said. ``Remember, I'm the youngest person 
here and I grew up watching some of these players. It's definitely 
an honor to be on the same court as them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw has a hard time walking down the streets of New York,  
especially on the eve of the inaugural WNBA All-Star game at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA player hyped by the league as the Michael Jordan of the  
women's game said its ``kind of impossible'' not to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
	She was mobbed by autograph seekers at the NBA Store and  
attended a Hudson River cruise with WNBA sponsors later Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, she will perform before a full house at Madison Square  
Garden, including Whitney Houston singing the national anthem and 
Spike Lee trash-talking from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw and Washington Mystics teammate Nikki McCray will play  
alongside the New York Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon and Kym 
Hampton. A starter for the injured all-star Rebecca Lobo has yet to 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Conference all-star starters will be Cynthia Cooper,  
Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson of the Houston Comets, Michele 
Timms of Phoenix and Lisa Leslie of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in the draft after winning three consecutive NCAA  
titles at Tennessee, Holdsclaw has lived up to her billing. She 
leads the Mystics in scoring (18.7) and rebounding (8.9) and ranks 
among the league's top four in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 forward can bring the ball upcourt like a guard,  
hit fadeaway jumpers or use her agility to slide around post 
players for a reverse layup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have a unique style and approach to the game,''  
Holdsclaw said. ``People aren't used to seeing it, so that excites 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray said Holdsclaw seems unfazed by the pressure of being one  
of the WNBA's marquee players. 
</P>
<P>
	``She handles it great,'' McCray said. ``She comes to practice,  
works hard, stays focused. She goes home, sits on the couch, goes 
to the movies and chills out with her friends. She's done a great 
job of handling everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw has her own way of blowing off steam.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like to go to the amusement parks and the spa. And I just  
hang out with my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics, 3-27 as an expansion team last season, are still  
adjusting to an influx of new players and new coach Nancy Darsch. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holdsclaw has put up decent numbers, the Mystics are  
struggling in fifth place. They earned their first two-game winning 
streak after a victory over Charlotte on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Still, the two-time ABL championship MVP, recently  
joined the Mystics to provided veteran leadership to a young team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's been the difference in our play over the last  
couple of games,'' Holdsclaw said. ``She's just a great leader. 
She's very outspoken. She tells you like it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She may have spoken with the rookie after Holdsclaw commited 11  
of the Mystics' 24 turnovers in a loss to Utah last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had 11 turnovers in a game in my life,'' Holdsclaw  
said. ``That's just one game, so I'm not consumed by it. When I'm 
on top of my game, the sky is the limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw realizes she cannot carry the team by herself.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect us to totally change things around. They have  
some great players added to the league this year. The teams are 
just that much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics recently added 6-3 center Nyree Roberts to the  
roster in a trade with Houston for 6-5 center Alessandra Santos de 
Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all the elements. If we get another big girl inside,  
we're going to be the Houston Comets of the future.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Linked in 9th Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The man accused of being the railroad killer was  
linked to a ninth slaying and charged with capital murder 
Wednesday, hours after he asked a judge, ``Can all this be done 
very quickly so I can say I'm guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Angel Maturino Resendez made his request during a  
court appearance on a burglary charge in Houston, authorities said 
they had linked him by a palm print to a ninth slaying -- that of an 
87-year-old woman who was bludgeoned in her home with an antique 
iron last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Leafie Mason, who lived within 50 yards of a rail line that cuts  
through the small east Texas town of Hughes Springs, was attacked 
by someone who entered her home through a window. Her body was 
covered by a blanket, as were several other victims believed to 
have been killed by Maturino Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez was charged with her murder Wednesday  
afternoon and could face the death penalty. Texas has executed 180 
people -- by far the most in the nation -- since the U.S. Supreme 
Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old rail-hopping drifter, who turned himself in  
Tuesday after a six-week manhunt that made him one of the most 
wanted fugitives in America, is also charged with two slayings in 
Illinois and one in Kentucky and is believed responsible for five 
other killings in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	During the manhunt, the FBI referred to him by one of his  
aliases, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the murder charge was filed in Hughes Springs, the only  
charge against him in Texas was burglary, at the scene where Dr. 
Claudia Benton, 39, was killed Dec. 17 in the Houston enclave of 
West University Place. She was beaten in the head, stabbed three 
times in the back and covered with a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez's fingerprints were found on parts from the  
woman's stolen car, and prosecutors said DNA evidence might also 
link him to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	After a prosecutor in Houston described the bloody scene of Ms.  
Benton's killing, Maturino Resendez, wearing an orange jail 
jumpsuit and handcuffs, calmly asked state District Judge William 
Harmon if he could plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Maturino Resendez was specifically  
addressing the burglary charge or all of the charges against him. 
His admission of guilt was not an official plea because his court 
appearances were only to set bail and assign him a lawyer. He was 
jailed without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a charge of capital murder can usually be filed only  
when there is evidence that a murder occurred during the commission 
of certain felonies, such as burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision of whether to charge also Maturino Resendez with  
capital murder in Ms. Benton's death rests with Harris County 
District Attorney Johnny Holmes, whose county has notched the most 
death-penalty convictions in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 469 people on death row in Texas, 146 -- about one-third --  
were sent there by Harris County. If Harris County were a state, it 
would rank third in the number of people executed in the nation 
with 56. Virginia has executed 67. 
</P>
<P>
	After hiding out in Mexico, Maturino Resendez surrendered to a  
Texas Ranger at an El Paso border station Tuesday in a deal 
brokered by his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear why he turned himself in. Mexico doesn't have  
the death penalty and doesn't return suspects to countries where 
they may face the death penalty. But Mike Cox, a Texas Department 
of Public Safety spokesman, said Maturino Resendez may have feared 
bounty hunters. A $125,000 reward had been offered for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' hold on Maturino Resendez also might mean Kentucky and  
Illinois officials never get to prosecute him. Lexington, Ky., 
police Sgt. Mark Barnard said he hopes that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if he gets the death penalty seven times,''  
Barnard said. ``I want him in Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez is thought to have traveled by hopping freight  
trains. All of the victims were killed near the tracks. 
Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing spree apparently started with the 1997 slaying of a  
21-year-old college student in Kentucky. The most recent slayings 
were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter, found 
dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people in Weimar attended a ceremony Wednesday  
to pray and give thanks for the suspect's capture. As the sun set 
and a train whistle blew in the background, residents of the South 
Texas town hugged and cried.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Visit Moves U.N. Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After walking amid the shoes and  
clothing of children buried at the site of a mass killing in 
western Kosovo, a top U.N. war crimes prosecutor said today she was 
``profoundly moved'' by what she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Arbour, paying her first visit to the Serb province,  
toured one of the worst killing fields of the Kosovo conflict just 
a day after British forensic specialists discovered the bodies of 
11 children shot to death at close range in Celine. 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes investigators have exhumed 57 bodies so far from nine  
separate grave sites in the village, nine miles northwest of 
Prizren. British officials have said the dead are believed to have 
been shot by Serb forces just after NATO began bombing Kosovo on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not possible to have this kind of experience and not be  
profoundly moved,'' Arbour said after visiting the dug-up graves 
and seeing the children's belongings. ``It's just too overwhelming 
to have the full visual impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a NATO spokesman said today that an anti-tank mine  
explosion in Kosovo killed one person and critically wounded 
another, the latest in an alarming number of deaths by mines in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	And NATO's supreme commander for Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark,  
said the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army was largely in compliance 
with demilitarization requirements -- although officials said strife 
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbour, the chief prosecutor for the U.N. tribunal on war crimes  
in former Yugoslavia, stopped first at a grave site at Celine and 
headed later to a site in Vlastica, southeast of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In Celine, Arbour walked up a hill and stopped by a grave with  
pink flowers in a clear plastic tube, where a teen-age girl was 
found buried. Then she continued up the hill and came to the 
10-by-20-foot grave site uncovered Tuesday by the British. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 21 bodies found buried there by villagers were  
women and children; six were under the age of 10, including a 
2-year-old. Bedding, a child's pair of leather shoes and several 
shirts still littered the area. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arbour looked at the scene, village leader Hamdi Fazliu shook  
his head and said sadly: ``Baby, two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British officials have said all the dead are believed to have  
come from one family, shot by Serb forces on March 25 or March 26. 
The Serbs apparently discovered the villagers hiding in a dry 
riverbed hidden by trees and shot them, according to officials of 
the NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Fazliu said Serb forces had attacked the villagers out of  
revenge because they couldn't find any KLA fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	An international tribunal official, Keith Martin, said the  
bodies were being taken for autopsies at a temporary morgue in 
another village. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole village is being treated as a crime scene,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine blast occurred Tuesday, when civilians hit the mine  
while driving along a muddy tract of road in the zone of Kosovo 
controlled by French peacekeepers, NATO spokesman Jan Joosten said. 
The exact location wasn't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was ``distressing,'' Joosten said, because the area  
had been cordoned off for mines, but residents repeatedly removed 
warnings and barriers so they could use the road. 
</P>
<P>
	With ethnic Albanian refugees flooding back into the province,  
NATO peacekeepers have been struggling to get out the word about 
the danger of mines. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 27 people have been killed in at least 61 confirmed  
mine incidents in the past month, according to NATO figures. The 
United Nations said the total number of deaths and injuries from 
mines may be as high as 170. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of casualties have been KLA soldiers helping in  
demining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, arriving on a visit to review NATO forces in the  
province, held talks with KLA chief of staff Agim Ceku in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	He told journalists afterward that the KLA is in compliance with  
a June 21 demilitarization agreement that required them to put 
their weapons in storage and stand down from military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, acts of retribution by ethnic Albanians against Kosovo's  
Serb minority were reported from all parts of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said four ethnic Albanians were arrested in Kosovo's  
capital, Pristina, on Tuesday trying to evict Serbs from their 
homes. Two of the men had KLA identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians have been taking revenge for Serb forces'  
brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against the province's 
Albanian majority during NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Business Targets Family Leave Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal law giving employees up to 12 weeks  
of unpaid leave a year to recover from illness, care for a new 
child or nurse a sick family member is causing confusion in the 
workplace, business groups told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They asked Congress to fix the 1993 family leave law before  
considering the Clinton administration's plan to expand it to cover 
more workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he suspects some  
opposition is coming from employers who would prefer not to have to 
comply the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seem to be hearing from those who are looking through  
regulatory process as a way of undoing some of the legislation we 
achieved,'' Dodd said during a hearing before the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's panel on children and 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 5 will mark the sixth anniversary of the law, which was  
intended to help employees balance the demands of work and family 
life. The law applies to public agencies, public schools, and 
private employers with 50 or more workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees must maintain health coverage for the duration of the  
leave, an average of about 10 days, said John R. Fraser, deputy 
administrator of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has been a ``tremendous success,'' Fraser said. By Sept.  
30, the department had received only 13,600 complaints, ``an 
extremely small number given the millions of workers who have taken 
time off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, he said, the Labor Department found no evidence of  
widespread problems or abuse, Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edward Harold, a New Orleans lawyer who represents  
businesses in employment-related matters, said the law ``has proven 
to be a financial boon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The confusion that leads all these people to my door is not a  
product of the act itself,'' he said, but of the rules developed by 
the Labor Department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that many of the regulations were written not to  
implement Congress's intent, but rather to expand the rights of 
employees beyond what Congress intended,'' Harold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems include businesses notifying employees of their rights  
by the required deadlines, getting enough information from 
employees on health problems that might qualify for the leave, and 
trying to determine what constitutes a ``serious illness,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Verdisco, president of the International Mass Retail  
Association, said in a statement that ``clarifying and resolving'' 
problems with the law would make it ``more useful and easier to 
understand and comply with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has proposed revising the law to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make it apply to any business with 25 or more employees. The  
law now covers only about half of the work force, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow eligible employees to take an additional 24 hours of  
unpaid leave each year to participate in their children's school 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states to create innovative ways of using unemployment  
compensation payments to support people taking parental leave.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After walking amid the shoes and  
clothing of children buried at the site of a mass killing in 
western Kosovo, a top U.N. war crimes prosecutor said today she was 
``profoundly moved'' by what she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Arbour, paying her first visit to the Serb province,  
toured one of the worst killing fields of the Kosovo conflict just 
a day after British forensic specialists discovered the bodies of 
11 children shot to death at close range in Celine. 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes investigators have exhumed 57 bodies so far from nine  
separate grave sites in the village, nine miles northwest of 
Prizren. British officials have said the dead are believed to have 
been shot by Serb forces just after NATO began bombing Kosovo on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not possible to have this kind of experience and not be  
profoundly moved,'' Arbour said after visiting the dug-up graves 
and seeing the children's belongings. ``It's just too overwhelming 
to have the full visual impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a NATO spokesman said today that an anti-tank mine  
explosion in Kosovo killed one person and critically wounded 
another, the latest in an alarming number of deaths by mines in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	And NATO's supreme commander for Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark,  
said the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army was largely in compliance 
with demilitarization requirements -- although officials said strife 
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbour, the chief prosecutor for the U.N. tribunal on war crimes  
in former Yugoslavia, stopped first at a grave site at Celine and 
headed later to a site in Vlastica, southeast of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In Celine, Arbour walked up a hill and stopped by a grave with  
pink flowers in a clear plastic tube, where a teen-age girl was 
found buried. Then she continued up the hill and came to the 
10-by-20-foot grave site uncovered Tuesday by the British. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 21 bodies found buried there by villagers were  
women and children; six were under the age of 10, including a 
2-year-old. Bedding, a child's pair of leather shoes and several 
shirts still littered the area. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arbour looked at the scene, village leader Hamdi Fazliu shook  
his head and said sadly: ``Baby, two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British officials have said all the dead are believed to have  
come from one family, shot by Serb forces on March 25 or March 26. 
The Serbs apparently discovered the villagers hiding in a dry 
riverbed hidden by trees and shot them, according to officials of 
the NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Fazliu said Serb forces had attacked the villagers out of  
revenge because they couldn't find any KLA fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	An international tribunal official, Keith Martin, said the  
bodies were being taken for autopsies at a temporary morgue in 
another village. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole village is being treated as a crime scene,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine blast occurred Tuesday, when civilians hit the mine  
while driving along a muddy tract of road in the zone of Kosovo 
controlled by French peacekeepers, NATO spokesman Jan Joosten said. 
The exact location wasn't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was ``distressing,'' Joosten said, because the area  
had been cordoned off for mines, but residents repeatedly removed 
warnings and barriers so they could use the road. 
</P>
<P>
	With ethnic Albanian refugees flooding back into the province,  
NATO peacekeepers have been struggling to get out the word about 
the danger of mines. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 27 people have been killed in at least 61 confirmed  
mine incidents in the past month, according to NATO figures. The 
United Nations said the total number of deaths and injuries from 
mines may be as high as 170. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of casualties have been KLA soldiers helping in  
demining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, arriving on a visit to review NATO forces in the  
province, held talks with KLA chief of staff Agim Ceku in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	He told journalists afterward that the KLA is in compliance with  
a June 21 demilitarization agreement that required them to put 
their weapons in storage and stand down from military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, acts of retribution by ethnic Albanians against Kosovo's  
Serb minority were reported from all parts of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said four ethnic Albanians were arrested in Kosovo's  
capital, Pristina, on Tuesday trying to evict Serbs from their 
homes. Two of the men had KLA identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians have been taking revenge for Serb forces'  
brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against the province's 
Albanian majority during NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia.
