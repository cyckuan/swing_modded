<HEADLINE> Personal Bankruptcies Soaring in U.S. This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The filings for personal
bankruptcy are continuing to surge in U.S. this year despite the
the fact that U.S. economy is in sound expansion.
</P>
<P>
About 1.1 million Americans will file to have their debts wiped
away this year under Federal bankruptcy laws, New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Not only will 1 in 100 American households declare bankruptcy
this year, their debt will be higher than ever before--5.3 times
their annual income, compared with only 3.5 times in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The previous surge in bankruptcy usually took place in the wake
of a severe recession. But the current soaring occurred at a time
when U.S. economy entered its fifth year of recovery and
unemployment and inflation are low.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the surging is partly resulting from the
fact that many households are still being shattered by job loss or
an uninsured medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, bankruptcy in U.S. no longer carries the
stigma it once did, making it far easier for those who have simply
accumulated too much debt to repudiate their obligations with only
modest adverse consequences. But most of all, the bankruptcy surge
reflects the payback from the wave of unsolicited credit-card
offers that banks and card companies showed on many more Americans
than ever before, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Population Continues Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The population of the Czech
Republic continued to drop in the first half of the year due to
lower birth rates, less marriages and more divorces, according to
the Statistics Bureau of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 47,100 babies were born in the first half of 1996, 2,700
less than during the same period last year, according to the
latest statistics released by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56,840 people died during the period, 9,740 more
than the number of births.
</P>
<P>
The number of divorcees rose to 17,500 in the first six months
of this year from 16,200 of the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country issued 24,900 marriage certificates, 800
less than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the country first registered minus population growth in
1994, the Czech Republic has been trying to increase its
population, currently at 10,316,207, through encouragement of more
child-bearings and acceptance of more immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,600 people immigrated to the country in the first half
of this year.

NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- India has received 4.33
billion US dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) during the
economic reform period, which began in 1991, official sources said
here today.

<P>
This is a little more than one-fifth of 20.25 billion US

approvals have gravitated towards areas with special incentives.
Telecommunications got 26.7 percent, power 9.1 percent and oil
refining 9.8 percent. Areas with high growth potential like
automobiles and transportation received 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Indian capital New Delhi, states of Maharashtra, West
Bengal and Tamil Nadu accounted for over half of the total FDI
approved during the period.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the leading investor accounting for
almost one-fourth of total inflow of foreign investments (24.3
percent), followed by U.K. (6.4 percent), Israel (5.9 percent),
Mauritius (4.6 percent), Japan (4.2 percent) and Germany (4.1
percent).

<HEADLINE> Most UK Primary School Pupils Fall Behind Ace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Most British primary school
pupils are failing to meet the basic academic standard expected by
government, according to a comprehensive investigation into the
achievement of 11-year-olds undertaken in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The research, which was conducted by a think tank, the Social
Market Foundation, and will be published Monday, shows that pupils
in the key subjects of mathematics and English are on average up
to two years below the standard expected for their age.
</P>
<P>
The performance of some schools is so poor that 11-year-olds
are unable to do basic sums such as adding two single-digit
numbers together and are barely able to read, tasks that the
government expects five-year-olds to do.
</P>
<P>
The study, the first of its kind and based on the results of
tests taken by 500,000 pupils last year, also exposes wider
variations than hitherto imagined in standards between schools.
</P>
<P>
Pupils at the worst primary schools are up to six years below
the standard they are expected to achieve at the age of 11. At the
best, they are up to three years ahead for their age, a gap
between the best and worst of nine years.
</P>
<P>
John Marks, the study's author and a government adviser, said
he was alarmed by what he had uncovered.
</P>
<P>
"There is a major crisis in the teaching of English and reading
and even greater problems in the teaching of mathematics in
primary schools right across the country," he said.

BAGHDAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade delegations from Canada

trade ties between these two countries and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jack Behadouria, a Canadian member of parliament, told

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian security authorities
have started urgent contacts in a bid to foil the convocation of a
conference to be attended by Islamic fundamentalist groups and
their supporters throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled to be held in London next month, is
expected to draw some 14,000 Moslem extremists, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Arab political circles have criticized the
British government for allowing such gatherings under the pretext
of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Even the British security authorities themselves have warned
their government that London may become the center of a dangerous
alliance of extremist fundamentalist groups, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
A security report voiced British security agencies' concern
over the large number of groups to be taking part in the
conference, which include masterminds and perpetrators of
assassinations, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
MENA added security authorities have revealed that the
organizer of the conference is Omar Bakri, former leader of the
Liberation Party whose members include scores of university
students in Britain calling for the assassination of British Prime
Minister John Major.

<HEADLINE> Second Round of Lebanon's Elections Held Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Amid strict measures taken by
security forces, nearly 300,000 Lebanese voters today went to
polling stations in northern Lebanon to elect 28 members of
parliament, in the second of the five-phase general elections.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and thirty-three candidates competed to obtain an
entry in the next half-Christian, half-Moslem parliament, which is
to still be based on confessionism, or in other words, a
representation according to proportions of various religious
and sectarian communities.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in the Interior Ministry, which supervised
today's elections, announced that the result would be counted out
on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory over
oppositions in the first round of elections in the predominantly
Christian governorate of Mount Lebanon last Sunday by winning 32
of the 35 seats.
</P>
<P>
Totally 128 new members of the unicameral house will be
elected in after the remaining three rounds are held in Beirut,
south Lebanon and western Beqaa on the next three Sundays.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese National News Agency hailed today's polling as
"another victory of participation over boycott, positivity over
negativity and honorable competition over challenge and
provocation, and the first and last victor is democracy and
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the election in the northern port city of
Tripoli and its hinterland were conducted "in a quiet atmosphere,
amid rigorous security measures taken by the army and interior
security forces" after the polling stations were opened at 7:30
a.m. (04:30 GMT) and before they were closed at 5:00 p.m. (14:00
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry sources estimated the voting rate at around
50 percent, or some half of 600,000 qualified voters
participating in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Moslems boycotted the last elections
in 1992, in protest against the presence of some 35,000 Syrian
forces on the Lebanese lands, and more than 1,000 Israeli troops
occupying a border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At stake in today's vote are 11 seats reserved for Sunni
candidates, nine for Maronite Catholics, six for Greek Orthodox
Christians and two for Alawites, an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam.
</P>
<P>
No serious incidents took place throughout the daytime except
a fist-fight at Wadi Khalid in Akar district in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Four men were injured by sticks and broken glass bottles and
the polling station was forced to shut up for nearly two hours,
police sources said, noting that the polling went on in a natural
way after it was resumed.
</P>
<P>
In Zgharta, the enthusiasm of voters was not cooled by a
explosion of a bomb in a downtown garden near a polling station,
and police stressed that the incident didn't cause any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Hot contests were registered at 360 polling stations in
Tripoli among five coalitions of candidates, especially between
the one led by former Premier Omar Karami and ex-minister Suleiman
Franjieh, and another led by Ahmed Karami, cousin of Omar Karami.
</P>
<P>
The long day of election in the Lebanese second largest city,
85 kilometers north of Beirut, was not free of reports on small
accidents from the death of a citizen just outside a station to
the tearing of ballots.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Domestic Pressure Mounts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Domestic pressure mounted on
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet with Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat, whom he once vowed never
to talk with.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic development, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
announced today he will meet with Arafat if Netanyahu refused to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said his decision was in response to a "distress call"
from Arafat, who wrote to him requesting the meeting to express
his concern about the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Weizman, disappointed with
Netanyahu's deliberate dodging of Arafat and the stalled peace
process, had handed the prime minister an ultimatum to hold such
a meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader, today strongly denied
Weizman had given him any ultimatum after holding a hurriedly
arranged meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
"The report that the president indicated about any kind of
ultimatum to me is nonsense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite of his denial, the president's move indicated the ever
growing pressure on Netanyahu to hold the long delayed meeting
with Arafat. In late July, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
held his first meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud veteran member of Knesset (Parliament) Meir
Sheetrit today also joined the opposition camp's repeated calls on
Netanyahu to meet with Arafat immediately, saying any
postponement was "unjustified."
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for anyone to postpone the meeting
between the prime minister and the Palestinian leader. I think the
prime minister should meet him at once, with no delay," he told
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"We went into the elections with the promise that we would
bring about peace with security. So I'm calling on the prime
minister to do it right now," Sheetrit added, warning the absence
of a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting would bring the whole nation into a
dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, Likud activists often ridiculed
former Labor premier Shimon Peres, a major architect of the peace
process, on his meetings with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After assuming office as prime minister, Netanyahu has already
softened his stance, saying he would only consider meeting Arafat
if "it's essential to the security of Israel."
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu has met with several leading players in the
Israeli-Arab peace process, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King
Hussein in order to foster his international image.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the hardline Likud leader has failed to convince the
world of his true intentions to push forward the peace process by
stubbornly rejecting the "land-for-peace" principle, the
cornerstone of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
And Netanyahu's arrogant attitude toward Arafat has further
cast doubts over the prospects of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process that was already dimmed by Likud's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Is it conceivable for Netanyahu to advance the peace process
while insisting on refusing to meet with the man who, in
President Weizman's words, represents more than two million
Palestinians in the self-rule areas?
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Blames Israel for Stalemate of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today blamed Israel for the
current stalemate of the Middle East peace process, calling on
resumption of peace talks on all tracks in accordance with the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that the Israeli policy has not
changed yet though Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has called for
giving the Israeli new government time to assess the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The current situation, which will have a negative impact on the
peace process, has prompted Egypt to take steps to save the peace
process, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
As part of Egypt's diplomatic efforts in this regard, he said,
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is to visit Cairo within the
coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's statements were the latest by an Egyptian leader
criticizing Israel while urging it to resume negotiations with
the Palestinians and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mubarak indicated that he may cancel the Middle
East and North Africa Economic Summit to be held in Cairo in
November if the Arab-Israeli talks remain deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was elected to
his post in May, telephoned Mubarak later Thursday, telling him
that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks will be resumed soon.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Refinery to Use Nigerian Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian Petroleum Refining
Corporation (LPRC) is now set to use 20,000 barrels of crude oil
offered by the Nigerian government about two and a half years
ago, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted LPRC Managing Director Cyril Allen as saying
that the allocation could not be utilized two and half years ago
because the Liberian government was unable to raise the letter of
credit for it due to the civil strife.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the financial backing ready and that is why I am
here to approach Nigeria's petroleum products marketing company,"
he said in Abuja, capital of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Though his country's refinery is still out of operation
because of the huge cost of repairs, Allen said other means of
refining the crude have been arranged. This includes the use of
the newly inaugurated west African refineries based in Sierra
Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian allocation will help satisfy Liberia's monthly
demand of 15,000-20,000 metric tons of fuel.

<HEADLINE> UN Boss Wants Extension of Observer Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked the Security Council to extend
the mandate of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) by
three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, the
secretary-general said that the decision by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to remain engaged in
Liberia has encouraged him to recommend the extension of the
mandate, which will end on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief may recommend to the council by mid-October if
the factions demonstrate their full commitment to the peace
process in the war-torn country, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretary-general announced plans to increase
the strength of UNOMIL military observers in Liberia by 24, as
well as to deploy additional civilian personnel in the fields of
disarmament, elections, human rights, public information and
administration.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of hostilities and the breakdown in the peace
process in Liberia on April 6 forced the reduction in the
strength of UNOMIL military observers from 93 to 10, and the
secretary-general warned that the international community will
have no choice but to disengage from Liberia if the faction
leaders frustrate the peace process again.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the faction leaders to remember the precedent of
Somalia and hope they will seize this opportunity to restore
peace in the country, now that the ECOWAS leaders had decided to
give them another chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also urged Liberia's warring factions to
return the vehicles and other assets they looted from the UNOMIL,
UN agencies and non-governmental organizations during the renewed
fighting in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that only 11 of the 489 vehicles, valued at about 8.3
million US Dollars, looted have been recovered so far.
</P>
<P>
The looting has severely affected the ability of the agencies
and organizations to respond effectively to humanitarian needs
throughout Liberia, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Liberation from Nazis Marked in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The French capital city Paris
today celebrated its 52nd anniversary of liberation from Nazi
occupation, which included a military parade on the square of the
mayor's office building, L'Hotel de Ville.
</P>
<P>
This year's celebration was dimmed by a demonstration by
several dozen people in front of the L'Hotel de Ville in central
Paris this afternoon protesting the expulsion of some African
immigrants. Police questioned and briefly detained the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi this morning went to the Invalides
Military Museum and laid a wreath before the tomb of war hero
Marshal Leclerc, who first entered Paris with his 2nd Armored
Division on August 25, 1944.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the Porte d'Orleans in southern Paris which saw
the entry of the first French tank 52 years ago, Tiberi laid a
spray of flowers before the plate in commemoration of the
surrender of German occupation force commander General Von
Choltitz and German troops on the site of former Montparnasse
Railway Station which no longer exists today.
</P>
<P>
Von Choltitz was said to have refused to obey the order of
Hitler to blow up Paris on the eve of the liberation of the city.

<HEADLINE> China's and Gabon's Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that world peace and development will not be
realized without Africa's involvement and that Africa needs the
world, and the world also needs Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks here this afternoon during talks
with President Hadj Omar Bongo of Gabon in the Great Hall of the
People, and noted that Africa is a major player on the
international stage.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that since China and Gabon established
diplomatic ties over 20 years ago, Sino-Gabonese relations have
developed in a stable way even though both the international scene
and domestic conditions in the two countries changed a lot during
that period.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have cooperated well politically,
economically, militarily, and culturally, they said, and have
established mutual confidence and sincere friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, as developing nations, both China and Gabon
face the common task of maintaining peace and of developing, and
that China is willing to develop a long-term friendship and
cooperate fully with Gabon with an eye towards the 21st century,
on the basis of traditional friendship and the five principles of
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his thanks for Bongo and Gabon's strong support
for China at the UN Human Rights Commission and for Gabon's
continued stand on the "one China" issue.
</P>
<P>
Bongo said he agrees with Jiang's sense of further development
of bilateral ties and noted that in recent years, the Gabonese
government has made a great effort to maintain national unity and
stability, and to promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its consistent economic and technological
aid to Gabon and said that the two countries can continue their
economic and technical cooperation in a wider scale.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Gabon have enjoyed
mutually-beneficial cooperation in trade and economy for a long
time, and that Chinese aid to Gabon has been sincere and without
conditions, and for economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Gabon is abundant in resources and has great potential for
development, the Chinese president said, and the Chinese
government is willing to explore new ways of cooperation with
Gabon and to expand the scale of economic and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The international situation is still changing in a complicated
way, Jiang said, and that world peace and development face serious
challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation in Africa has seen some positive
changes in recent years, and that African countries are learning
from past experience, exploring the future, and actively seeking a
road to develop in line with their own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
A stable and developed Africa will be a major contribution to
the world peace and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, he noted, the Chinese government will adhere
to its five principles of peaceful co-existence and its policy of
pursuing unity and cooperation with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China treasures its friendship with African countries and is
willing to increase consultation with African countries in
international affairs and develop economic cooperation with them,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of the visiting president, and after the talks, feted the
guests in the Great Hall of the People.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Hinder "Three Direct Exchanges": Xinhua Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities' excuses used to hinder the "three
direct exchanges" are that "Taiwanese investment in the mainland
will empty Taiwan's industries," that "Taiwan's economic growth
will be under the control of the mainland," and that "Taiwan may
be swallowed up by the Communist Party if the `three direct
exchanges' go into effect."
</P>
<P>
All these excuses have been refuted by the island's industrial
and commercial sectors and the media, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwanese newspapers have pointed out even that "one-way
and indirect" economic and trade relations with the mainland that
the Taiwan authorities have pursued have damaged economic
interests that should be benefitting the Taiwanese in the market.
</P>
<P>
Many Taiwanese scholars have noted that the two sides'
economies are highly complementary and that the "three direct
exchanges" are vital to the continuous development of the Taiwan
economy.
</P>
<P>
They say that over the past five years Taiwanese investment in
the mainland has played a positive role in maintaining Taiwan's
economic growth and in improving industries.
</P>
<P>
This May, a survey showed that Taiwan's business sector wants
to "maintain stable relations across the Taiwan Straits, sign
agreements that guarantee investment, and open the three direct
exchanges."
</P>
<P>
The urgent need for the "three direct exchanges" and the
increase in economic exchanges and co-operation between the two
sides has taken root among the people on both sides of the
straits. The feeble excuses about "security problems" and about
"being swallowed up" that are used to deceive the people of
Taiwan, are futile.
</P>
<P>
The rules on the "three direct exchanges" from the Ministry of
Communications and MOFTEC have met with a good response among
economic and transport sectors in Taiwan, and even some people
from related departments in Taiwan have not come up with any
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should, therefore, understand that
hindering the "three direct exchanges" will do no good to Taiwan's
long-term interests or to peaceful reunification. They should
rather respond in a more practical way, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Receives Defense Equipment from US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today received the
first consignment of 368 million dollars of defense equipment from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The first consignment which arrived at the Karachi port
consists of M-48A5 Tanks, M-88 armored recovery vehicles, M-109
propelled guns, M-110 howitzers and M-113 armored personnel
carriers besides spare parts and testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani and other senior
military officials visited the port to see the unloading of the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
These military equipment were ordered by Pakistan at the end of
1980s but were embargoed by the US government according to the
Pressler Amendment which came into effect on October 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited the US
last April, the ties between Pakistan and the US have improved.
Last October, the US Congress passed the Brown Amendment for
allowing the transfer of the Pakistan-ordered equipment except
dozens of F-16 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Mirani told the reporters at the port that the subsequent
shipments will contain major weapons and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said the next shipment of Air force equipment will soon be
flown to Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
The entire exercise of transporting the released equipment is
expected to be completed before December, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This event is not only a harbinger of a new phase of
strengthening Pak-US relations but also a vindication of present
government's successful foreign policy", he noted.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China wishes to maintain close relations with
Gabon and strengthen consultation and cooperation in international
affairs so as to safeguard the rights and interests of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the statement at a meeting with visiting
President Hadj Omar Bongo of Gabon in Diaoyutai State Guesthouse
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier extended a warm welcome to the President's
8th China trip, saying China is pleased to have old friends like
President Bongo in Gabon and in Africa as well. The Sino-Gabonese
relations have been developing well and the President and the
Chinese leaders have also forged deep friendship, Li Peng said,
adding that old and good friends should travel and meet each other
more often.
</P>
<P>
Bongo said his ongoing visit to China is of important
significance in accelerating and deepening cooperation between the
two countries in various fields, believing the visit would be
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that China attaches importance to bilateral
cooperation. As to specific projects in the cooperation, relevant
departments of the two countries could have further
discussions. Those projects that are believed to have had good
conditions could be managed first. For other projects that can not
be managed for the time being, efforts should be made to create
conditions from a long-term of view, Li Peng said, adding that the
Chinese leaders are optimistic about the prospect of the
Sino-Gabonese relations.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Drop for 2nd Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. dropped by 0.5 percent in July, the second
straight month of decline.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said today that sales
of existing single-family homes totaled 4.14 million at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from a revised 4.16 million
in June.
</P>
<P>
The sales in June were revised down from an originally reported
rate of 4.18 million and the 2.8 percent decline in the month
followed a 1.9 percent advance in May.
</P>
<P>
The high levels of mortgage costs were the cause behind the
slow-down of the U.S. housing industry.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.25 percent in
July, down slightly from 8.32 percent in June but well above the
7.03 percent average last January.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the Midwest posted the only sales increase of 5
percent in July. Sales were down by 2.2 percent in the West, 1.6
percent in the Northeast and 1.3 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
The Realtors also reported a 4.7 percent yearly increase in the
median price of an existing home, to 121,400 dollars in July from
116,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But the sale of existing homes in the U.S. remains at healthy
levels compared with last year when 3.80 million units were sold.
</P>
<P>
The housing market has been slowing down in the past few months
as the U.S. economy is cooling down. Housing starts have fallen
for three months through July and new home sales also declined in
June.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The friendship between China and
the Republic of Korea is not only in keeping with the fundamental
interests of the people of the two countries, but also benefits
the prosperity and stability of Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The remarks come from Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Hinder "Three Direct Exchanges": Xinhua Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua commentary today
accused Taiwan authorities of putting obstacles in the path of
"three direct exchanges" across the Taiwan Straits and urged them
to make a practical and good-will response to an important step
taken by the mainland in realizing the direct exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC)) have recently issued
rules on direct shipping and cargo services within their own
jurisdiction. A spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council made a speech on the issuing of the rules.
</P>
<P>
This is an important step taken by the mainland in realizing
the "three direct exchanges" -- postal service, trade, and air
service. It fully shows the sincerity of the mainland in
developing relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Taiwan authorities have continually
put many obstacles in the path of "three direct exchanges". In the
"National Reunification Program", they gave three "prerequisites",
which did nothing for the practical operation of "three direct
exchanges", but did clearly lay bare their attempt to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities also interfered with and put stumbling
blocks in the path of unofficial economic exchanges between the
two sides both in words and in deeds.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 and 1994, because of strong pressures from people of
both sides to open the "three direct exchanges" as soon as
possible, the Taiwan authorities presented an "exposition" and a
"prospect", emphasizing "political, legal, and secure obstacles",
as they continued to delay and hinder the exchanges and shirk
their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Taiwan authorities claimed to be
giving priority to cross-strait relations and the "three direct
exchanges" in order to get votes, but they did not follow up on
this afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Now, they say they will set limits on Taiwanese investment in
the mainland, causing a great deal of consternation among
industrial and commercial sectors and media in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Review of Draft of Rural Enterprise Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Standing
Committee of the 8th National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, this morning discussed a draft of the Law on Rural
Enterprises here.
</P>
<P>
One committee member, Sun Tingfang, said that "the rural
enterprise is a great invention of Chinese peasants and has become
the pillar of the country's rural economy and an integral part of
the national economy."
</P>
<P>
However, she went on to say, "there are still a lot of
problems, and as a result, the Law on Rural Enterprises is
necessary both for standardizing their operation and for
safeguarding their rights and interests."
</P>
<P>
Another member of the committee, Lin Zongtang, said that he
attaches great importance to the law and believes that it will
help boost China's rural industry, as well as guaranteeing the
stable and sustained development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out, China's deteriorating environment is
partly caused by heavy pollution from rural industry, and he
proposed that priority be given to protecting the environment
while the law is discussed.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhan'ao, also a member of the committee, criticized one
clause of the draft that said "no government at any level, or any
other organization or individual is entitled to dismiss a director
or manager of a rural enterprise".
</P>
<P>
He said that the clause does not reflect the leadership of the
Party, democratic management by the employees, or the supervisory
system, and as a result, "it should be revised."
</P>
<P>
Kang Zhenhuang, another committee member, said that "improving
workers' overall quality through scientific and technological
progress is important to the sustained development of the national
economy, and even more important to the booming rural industry.
</P>
<P>
Although the draft touches upon the issue of improving rural
industry with science and technology, Huang pointed out that "more
real content should be added to it in a bid to make the country's
rural enterprises become more prosperous."

<HEADLINE> South Korean Tycoons, Former Officials Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine top South Korean business
leaders were today convicted of bribing former president Roh
Tae-woo who was earlier sentenced to 22 years in prison for
mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Ten former officials, including former defense and finance
ministers, were also sentenced for their involvement in
accumulating slush funds for Roh and his predecessor, Chun
Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
The sentences on the nine businessmen including Samsung Group
Chairman Lee Kun-hee and President Lee Kyung-hoon of Daewoo
Corporation range from 10 months to two and a half years in
prison, with some sentences suspended.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the convicted was arrested after the prison
sentences were announced in view of their contributions to
economic development or the circumstances under which they gave
bribes to Roh.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen have seven days to appeal against their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel at Seoul District Court sentenced Lee
Hyun-woo, who served as Roh's chief bodyguard, to a seven-year
imprisonment and a fine of 762,500 U.S. dollars for accepting
bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Roh's two close associates, Kum Jin-ho and Lee Won-joe, were
sentenced to three years in jail for their roles in helping Roh
collect bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kim Chong-in, former economic aide to Roh, was given two and a
half years in prison with a stay of execution for four years and
Lee Tae-jin, former presidential accounting officer, a one-year
prison term, suspended for two years.
</P>
<P>
Former defense minister Chung Ho-yong was sentenced to 10 years
in prison, former presidential chief bodyguard Ahn Hyon-tae four
years in prison and a fine of 62,500 dollars, former National
Administration head Sung Yong-wook three years in prison, former
National Security Planning Agency chief Ahn Mu-hyok three years in
prison and former finance minister Sagong Il two and a half years
in prison with a four-year stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
In today's ruling, the court also meted out prison terms
ranging from four to ten years to 13 former South Korean military
officers who helped the two former presidents in their quest for
power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, former president Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to
death and his successor, Roh Tae-woo, to 22 and a half years in
prison on charges of mutiny, treason and bribery stemming from
their roles in the military coup on December 12, 1979 and the
subsequent killing of civilians in an uprising in the southern
city of Kwangju on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined Chun 282 million dollars and Roh 355
million dollars, representing the bribes the two former presidents
took during their time in power.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft for taking hundreds of millions of dollars
in bribes from businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, after a coup and ruled
the nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped
down in February 1993.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Malaysian Prime Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said today
that the world needs co-operation rather than confrontation,
contact rather than containment, dialogue rather than the use
of military force in order to establish a just and rational
international political order in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came during a meeting with visiting Malaysian
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Bin Mohammed here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Mahathir is an old friend of China who has made an
important contribution to the development of friendly relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the present visit, Jiang said, a series of agreements
were signed and consensus reached between the two sides on
increased co-operation in regional and international affairs,
including co-ordinating development of the Mekong River area and
construction of a Pan-Asia railway network. All these symbolize
the fact that Sino-Malaysian relations have entered a new stage,
the President noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that maintaining frequent contact between the two
states' leaders is of great significance to the reinforcement of
friendship and mutual understanding. At present, he said, the
bilateral ties are sound and there is no obstacle in the way of
further development.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia attaches great importance to Mekong River development
and the construction of a Pan-Asia railway network, which will
accelerate economic development of the region to a considerable
degree, Mahathir said, expressing satisfaction with China's active
involvement in both projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and Malaysia have had similar periods of
suffering in the modern age, and as the world moves towards the
next century, a major topic for all the people in the world is how
to safeguard peace and promote development.
</P>
<P>
So, he added, the old ideas of the cold war should be abandoned
in accordance with the movement of history.
</P>
<P>
The President reiterated his earlier point that the world needs
co-operation rather than confrontation, contact rather than
containment, and dialogue rather than the use of military force,
to set up a just and rational international political order in the
21st century and promote peace and development in society.
</P>
<P>
Statements that the economic growth of China or the whole of
Asia would use up the world resources and threaten the whole world
are groundless, Mahathir said, noting that Malaysia strongly
opposes this kind of wrongheadedness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation for the Prime Minister's just
position. The so-called "China threat", he said, is groundless,
and that China is willing to be a good neighbor and good friend of
all countries and to establish long-term co-operation with
them. China will always be a major factor in safeguarding world
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The President said that China's prosperity means the growth of
a force for world peace and a contribution to the development of
all human beings.
</P>
<P>
He said he welcomes the growth of ASEAN and that he believes
the association will play a more active role in promoting regional
development and safeguarding world peace during the period
Malaysia chairs it.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his belief that co-operative ties between
the association and China will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Jiang also asked Mahathir to convey his
regards to Tuanku Ja'afar, the supreme head of the state of
Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Prisoners End Hunger Strike: Interior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The hunger strike staged by
some 600 prisoners in Kuwait's only prison came to a peaceful end
and the situation in it returned to normal today.
</P>
<P>
A statement sent to Xinhua by the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry
said that security authorities have put under control the strike,
which was staged Saturday by a group of inmates in the Kuwaiti
Central Prison.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministry is performing its duties
towards prisoners and providing them with proper social care
guaranteed by laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of inmates at the prison went on the hunger strike
Saturday to protest what they called inhuman living conditions
inside the jail.
</P>
<P>
The inmates, mainly from ward one, which houses prisoners
convicted of drug trafficking, murder or attempted murders, were
unhappy with a barrier that was put up to keep prisoners separate
from visitors.
</P>
<P>
The barrier was erected in the visitors' area following a
recent escape of a Pakistani inmate with the help of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 200 inmates sewed their lips Sunday to
demonstrate their determination to continue the strike until
their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
The statement denied that the inmates in the Kuwaiti Central
Prison have sewed their mouths.
</P>
<P>
The strike was the most serious incident in the jail since
January when a number of prisoners broke through the jail
walls in a violent mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Human Rights Committee has been closely watching the
situation and kept contacts with the prison officials to make
sure that the inmates receive their rights according to prison
laws.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that 600 of the 1487 inmates at the prison
took part in the hunger strike.

Netanyahu, Oussama al-Baz, representative of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, and Dennis Ross, the U.S. special Middle East peace
coordinator, were due to attend the meeting, Radio Israel reported.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak has threatened to cancel the conference if
Israel does not make any gesture to pursue the peace process
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
But France has called on Egypt not to cancel the event, which
Paris said is "inscribed in the logic of peace created by the
Madrid Conference" in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Progress in the Middle East peace process has come to a virtual
standstill since Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister in
Israel's general election in May. He has taken a hard-line
approach to the process and many have accused him of halting the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Sunday that Egypt
has to take steps to save the peace process, which he said is
under "the negative impact" of Israeli government policy.
</P>
<P>
The previous two conferences on economic development in the
Middle East and North Africa were held in Casablanca, Morocco, and
Amman, Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Dialogue On China-Malaysia Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Mahathir Bin Mohammed and Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
today addressed the "China-Malaysia Partnership -- Beijing
Dialogue" which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "The Asian Century - a Malaysian Perspective,"
Mahathir expressed his view by saying that "The 21st century is
the Asian century," but does not means the century when Asia will
dominate the world, because "this idea of domination by a
continent is too simplistic and is really not in keeping with the
times."
</P>
<P>
In distinction to the "European Century" and "American
Century", the 21st century will be "for the first time a world
century," the prime minister pointed out, adding that Asian
countries "do not want to be prosperous for the purpose of making
others poor. It is not a zero sum game that we are after."
</P>
<P>
"A world of haves and have-nots adds nothing to the sum total
of the achievement of this modern world. A world of haves will
result in creating more wealth for everyone," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir urged Europeans and Americans to "Stop making a bogey
of Asian countries." "Let us all forget this Asian Century and
settle down to make the World Trade Organization a great
organization that will benefit rich and poor alike; an
organization dedicated to international interdependence and
friendship, free of arm-twisting and big-power dominance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that mutually beneficial
co-operation between China and Malaysia has great prospects and
will give a great push to the economic prosperity of the two
countries and to neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Malaysia, which is rich in resources, has had
sustained, rapid economic growth, and steadily increased economic
strength while China has a great potential as a market and for a
wide-range of investment.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia can find long-term, stable markets in China for its
resource-based products and can look to China for industrial
products such as machinery and electronics equipment to meet its
own market needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Malaysian Mekong River co-operation, Zhu said that China
has taken a great interest in economic co-operation in developing
the Mekong region, which will serve not only regional economic
growth in all countries along the river and in Southeast Asia, but
also peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Malaysian cooperation has been productive in
recent years and, given the strength of the two countries and
their possibility of complementing economically, China and
Malaysia can establish a long-term partnership in resources,
products, technology, and markets.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Chinese and Malaysian entrepreneurs, economists,
bankers, scholars and experts attended the session.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, a series of co-operative agreements
were signed by the two countries' enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civil Servants Continue With Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The strike by Zimbabwe's civil
servants entered its second week today as workers defied the
government which says they had been fired.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister
Florence Chitauro said all civil servants that had not reported
for duty that morning had been sacked.
</P>
<P>
But the workers this morning gathered at the Africa Unity
Square here, where they were addressed by the Public Service
Association.
</P>
<P>
Nurses went on strike last Monday demanding 60 percent
increments and they were joined by the rest of government workers
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, President Robert Mugabe criticised the strikers and
said the strike might be an opportunity for the government to
reduce the number of public servants.
</P>
<P>
The situation at government hospitals in Zimbabwe's capital,
Harare, and in the second biggest city of Bulawayo appeared to be
desperate on Monday as a strike by nurses, junior doctors and
supporting staff got into its second week.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals continued to use army and red cross personnel to
beef up staff as the situation deteriorated, following the
dismissal of all civil servants. enditem

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Argentina Step Up Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Argentina have
agreed to step up bilateral trade and economic ties and a
counter-purchase trading system might be applied between the two
countries, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said here today.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of Indonesian President Soeharto and
Argentine President Carlos Menem at the Merdeka palace, Moerdiono
told reporters that Indonesia will seek the possibility of such a
trading system, through which the country can buy Argentina's
wheat, corn and soybean in exchange for aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Menem arrived here today for a one-day official visit in
bid to strengthen the two countries' trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will also study the possibility of opening
transportation links between Indonesia and Argentina, said
Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
"Legal basis such as on double tax avoidance and investment
security must also be pursued to enhance both countries' economic
ties," Moerdiono added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed issues on the regional cooperation
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
Latin American Cooperation Organization, according to Moerdiono.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tour Operators Suffer from Unpaid Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai tour operators have been
defrauded of several hundred million baht (25 baht to the US
dollar) by dozens of eastern European tour companies in unpaid
bills.
</P>
<P>
Those foreign tour operators, mostly in eastern Europe and
republics of the former soviet union, who supply visitors to
Thailand, usually move from one Thai operator to another.
</P>
<P>
In the early stages of a relationship, they pay well, but after
a couple of months they begin showing telltales signs of
tardiness.
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency that foreign tour operators pay their Thai
counterparts less than the agreed amount by alleging delivery of
shoddy service or tours inconsistent with those advertised.
</P>
<P>
Operators from other countries, such as Israel and South
Africa, are also said to be very slow at paying.
</P>
<P>
Thai operators are in a double-bind because hotels are also
contracted through them, making them responsible for paying the
hotels regardless of whether or not the Thai operators are paid by
the foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The problem has been going on for some time and is threatening
the survival of many Thai travel agents.
</P>
<P>
Thai tour operators are moving to blacklist those fraudulent
foreign operators and circulate their names internally among the
Association of Thai Travel Agents (ATTA) and the Overseas Offices
of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They say the shady operators should never be invited to any
trade show or on any familiarization trip in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Weak Demand Builds up Nigeria's Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The weak domestic demand has led
to a 23 percent increase in Nigeria's industrial inventory in the
first half of this year, according to a latest economic review.
</P>
<P>
The review, carried out by the Manufacturers Association of
Nigeria (MAN) and issued at the weekend, said unsold stock of
manufactured goods in warehouses rose by 1.7 million U.S. Dollars
to 74 million U.S. Dollars at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
This was owing to the weak consumer demand occasioned by
strained liquidity, high inflation and high cost of production,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It was also because of the influx of imported cheaper
products, some of them with inferior quality, it added.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Controls Population to Preserve Charm of Old Town (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The population in the historic
section of Suzhou, a city famous for its beautiful and elegant
gardens, has decreased over the past decade thanks to the
government's efforts to protect places of interest there.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in the area has fallen from 354,652 to
320,948 over the past decade, a yearly net decrease of 3,200.
</P>
<P>
The city's population in both the older and newer areas has
risen from 710,000 to 1.05 million in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou's historic area, which covers 14.2 square kilometers,
has over 60 ancient gardens and many narrow twisting rivers which
once were vital transportation routes.
</P>
<P>
The city was called the "Oriental Venice" by Marco Polo, an
Italian adventurer in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
City authorities have issued strict restrictions against
outsiders who want to move into the historic areas; professional
people whose skills are needed in the area are exempt.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, no new factories have been added to the
city and more than 130 factories have been moved out. After
renovating transportation facilities and dilapidated houses in the
historic section, local authorities resettled citizens who lived
there to newer spots in the city.
</P>
<P>
During the renovation of an old city street, the city moved
more than 8,000 household with over 30,000 residents.

<P>
The new residences are sunny, spacious and well-ventilated, and
have kitchens, toilets and coal gas pipelines, which most of the
older houses do not have.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, Chinese people called Suzhou as a paradise on
earth. But with the population increase over the centuries, the
old town became increasingly crowded. At present, it is difficult
to lay water, sewer and gas pipelines there.
</P>
<P>
Most of the urban residents in the city's old part must carry
water from wells, use egg-shaped briquets of coal for cooking and
nightstools.
</P>
<P>
There are presently 53 new residential areas around the old
section of the city. More than one billion yuan (about 120 million
US dollars) have been spent on service facilities such as roads,
water factories, coal gas projects, garbage treatment centers and
stores.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 800 historic streets and alleys have been
repaired, and 35-kilometers of river channels have been dredged
and harnessed. The city has put up plaques on more than 200
historic buildings and 500 ancient trees that tell of their
history.
</P>
<P>
Many ancient gardens that were closed for years have opened to
tourists.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Inspection Group Cancels Trip to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG) will hold an emergency meeting in London on
Wednesday to weigh further actions as it cancelled a proposed
visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was made as Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi earlier claimed that the country's military leader was
not prepared to release political detainees to impress the CMAG
inspection group.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria insists that the proposed CMAG tour should be a
two-day visit to continue discussions with government officials
on the progress made at the first meeting in London on June
24-25. "The tour should not be a fact-finding mission," said a
report issued by the Nigerian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But the CMAG prefers to meet some political detainees,
pro-democracy groups as well as government officials, noting that
two days are too short to complete its comprehensive fact-finding
mission which will also cover human rights issues and the
military's transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
"CMAG ministers wanted to see and hear first-hand about this
process during the proposed visit," said New Zealand Foreign
Minister Don Mckinnon on Saturday while confirming the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting between Nigeria and CMAG was decided at
the London meeting in June when the group had vetoed recommended
economic sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth last November
following its execution of nine Ogoni minority activists.
</P>
<P>
And the CMAG, which comprises the foreign ministers of eight
Commonwealth member countries including New Zealand, Malaysia,
Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Ghana, Britain, South Africa and Canada, was
later set up to monitor the human rights situation and the
progress of the democratisation process in Nigeria.

ADDIS ABABA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today put economic problems as the root causes of
Africa's instability as world experts gathered to discuss the
continent's impending food security and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
"A speedy economic development of Africa holds the key to
durable stability in the continent and offers immense benefits
not only for Africans but also for Africa's partners," Meles told
the Economic Committee meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa
here today.
</P>
<P>
K. Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that "not only is
the south becoming more differentiated, Africa is also becoming
more differentiated."
</P>
<P>
Africa's food security and debt problems are top on the
agenda of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Africa is the only continent in the world with the poverty
population still on the increase. The poverty population is
expected to increase by another 100 million to over 300 million
in 2010.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Malaysian Prime Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining human rights and
improving the environment are important issues faced by the
international community, however, China does not approve of the
actions of some Western countries -- interested only in
benefitting themselves -- who pressure developing countries into
following their lead.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Chinese Premier Li Peng at a meeting
today with visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir
Bin Mohammed in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should gradually open their domestic
markets to overseas investors, Mahathir said. However, Western
countries have made use of their economic advantages to criticize
developing countries on the issues of human rights and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"This in essence obstructs the development of the developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Mahathir's view, Li Peng said the development of the
world economy and trade should be based on the principles of
mutual benefit and not on damaging the interests of the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, maintaining human rights and stressing environmental
protection are common issues facing human society. But some
Western countries have used them as a tool to impose pressure on
the developing countries in an attempt to safeguard their own
interests, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not agree with such acts and moves," Li Peng
said. Mahathir said he agreed with the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Li defined Mahathir's ongoing China trip as an important event
in the Sino-Malaysian relations, saying the Chinese greatly
appreciate the Malaysian government and also the Prime Minister
for their consistent policy of friendliness toward China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he believes the visit will help strengthen the
coordination and cooperation between the two countries in
international and regional issues and raise the bilateral
relations to new heights.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysian-Chinese relations have been good and
their economic and trade cooperation has been smooth. Malaysian
businesses show great interest in investing in China and
cooperating with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
And the two countries should enhance cooperation in all other
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the ASEAN countries hope that China will
support ASEAN's cooperation with countries in the Mekong River
area, especially, that China will participate in the construction
of the railway joining China and the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to strengthening
cooperation in the Mekong River area, and China supports
Malaysia's proposal to establish a Pan-Asian railways network.
Such a proposal would benefit the economic development of the
countries concerned, Li Peng noted.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers held that there is a general trend of
peace and development in the world, but that contradictions,
problems and disputes among countries remain evident. All
countries should solve issues through dialogues and friendly
consultations, they stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq Rolf Ekeus arrived
here today on an 48-hour visit to the country for talks with
senior Iraqi officials on issues related to Iraq's arms programs
in the past.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source here, who requested anonymity, said that Ekeus
will hold intensive talks with Iraqi officials, and the first
round of the talks will start later today.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus is expected to hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid, who is
to head the Iraqi side for technical talks with UNSCOM officials.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that Ekeus, who is not available for comment
 on his visit, will discuss pending issues related to ballistic
missiles with a range of more than 150 kilometers, which is banned
by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief inspector is expected to demand Iraq to give
information about 12 long-range missiles the U.N. claims Iraq is
concealing.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus' current visit came after a latest delay last Friday by
the Iraqi side in allowing the U.N. inspectors access to a site
suspected of links to Iraq's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
His visit was delayed for one day because of some technical
problems with the German planes used in transporting U.N. experts
between UNSCOM's base in Bahrain and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of standoffs this year, Iraq agreed to
allow "immediate, unrestricted and unconditional" access to U.N.
inspectors to any site they wish to investigate during Ekeus'
visit in June.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to hold regular meetings every two
months to discuss issues concerning Iraq's weapons program and
U.N. inspectors' mission in Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Technology Aiding Green Revolution: Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Gene technology could help
engineer a truly green revolution, the International Biotechnology
Symposium in Sydney was told today.
</P>
<P>
Jim Peacock, head of the Plant Industry Division of CSIRO
(Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization),
said, while addressing the symposium, that gene technology was
helping Australian farming become more sustainable and
environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
"Plant biotechnology should assist our world to foster a double
green revolution -- increasing potential yields in sustainable,
environmentally-neutral production systems", he was quoted by a
press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Global population growth necessitates a doubling of present
food production by the year 2030. Too often in the past, food and
fiber production has been accompanied by progressive loss in
quality of the production system's soil and water resources."
</P>
<P>
This year marked the first extensive use of transgenic
agricultural systems in the United Nations, Peacock said, "the few
examples of transgenic crops, mostly with pest, diseases and
herbicide resistances, of the current decade will be vastly
extended in the first decade of the new century."
</P>
<P>
Australia has approved a transgenic production crop earlier
this month when the authorities permitted the commercial release
of a pest-resistant cotton plant.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Says He Will Meet Kaunda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
said he is to meet former President and now opposition leader K.
Kaunda to ease the political tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made this clear in his departure for Lusaka from
Pretoria where he met South African President Nelson Mandela at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the meeting between Chiluba and Kaunda, who is
now leader of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), was
originally scheduled for last week but could not take place
because Chiluba went to Lesotho to attend the summit meeting of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Dr Kaunda last week but the meeting did not take
place due to the SADC meeting in Maseru. But we will continue the
process of dialogue with him and all other opposition parties,"
said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNIP said it has not yet received any formal
invitation of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We were not aware that he (Chiluba) is going to meet us but
since he said this in South Africa that he will meet us, we
sincerely hope he will do so," P. Mvunga, the UNIP leader in the
Zambian Parliament, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Political strife has taken place between the ruling and
opposition parties in Zambian since April and May when a
controversial Constitution Amendment Bill was passed in the
parliament and signed by President Chiluba, which disqualifying
Kaunda's potential leadership.

ABU DHABI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Frozen fish exports of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to southeast Asian countries increased
by 150 percent in the first half of the current year, compared
with the corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The UAE newspaper Al-Ittihad quoted today a fish sector
official as saying that the UAE exports of frozen fish to
southeast Asian countries in the first half of 1996 amounted to 9
million tons and were valued at some 138 million UAE dirham (about
37.26 million U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
Mansour Yassin, director general of the Green Emirates
Freighting and Shipping Company, pointed out that it had been
decided to run shipping lines to European countries and those of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, with the aim of promoting
the UAE fish exports.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the local fish-exporting
organizations, the increasing demand for the fish of the UAE and
other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, which are
exported through the Dubai ports, is due to high quality and
world-wide fame.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that the efficiency of the airline
companies that have regular flights through the Dubai
International Airport makes it possible for fish shipments to
reach the consumption areas, especially southeast Asian countries
and China, in due course and in perfect condition.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China warmly welcomes the
normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and Croatia, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to reporters' question, Shen cited both Yugoslavia
and Croatia as China's friendly countries. The Chinese government
has always held that independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states in the former Yugoslav region should be
respected; and all countries in the region should recognize each
other, establish normal state-to-state relation between them and
be good and friendly neighbors so as to seek common development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the forging of diplomatic ties between
Yugoslavia and Croatia not only accords with the fundamental
interests of the two countries and the two peoples and exert a
great, positive impact on the course of normalizing the relations
among all countries in the region, but will benefit peace and
stability in the region and in Europe at large," Shen noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan researchers developed
five new mosaic resistant cassava strains, the New Vision
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cassava is considered important food crop in famine relief in
southern Africa. But the outbreak of mosaic in this country in
1989 threatened the crop.
</P>
<P>
The new strains are now in district organs for multiplication,
Head of the Root and Tuber Crop Research at Namulonge
Agricultural and Livestock Research Institute Otim Nnape said.
</P>
<P>
As usual, it needs eight years to produce a new resistant
variety but Ugandan scientists managed to come up three mosaic
resistant cassava strains between 1989 when the disease broke out
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
"With now eight resistant varieties out in fields, there
should soon be sufficient planting materials to replacing all
infected gardens," said Otim. enditem

MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Whether Russian Olympic medalist
Alexander Popov could return to top-level swimming was in doubt
after he was stabbed on a Moscow street, doctor said on Monday.
</P>

Rimma Maslova, deputy chief doctor of Hospital No. 31 in the

<HEADLINE> Australia Absorbs More Migrants in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia had taken in 82,500
non-refugee migrants in the 12 months to June this year, an
increase of 6,000 from 76,500 in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But the figure is set to fall in the present fiscal year of
1996-97. Last Month, the coalition government announced that it
will cut the quota of non-refugee intake by 9,000 to 74,000 for
this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Phil Ruddock also used today's figures to
criticize the lack of "proper balance" in the make up of migrants.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released today showed that the number of
skilled migrants fell by 6,300 to 24,100 in the year, while the
number of migrants arriving under the family reunion catalogue
increased 12,200 to 56,700.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said that the figures showed that the former government
had failed to maintain a proper balance in migrant intake.
</P>
<P>
"The changes I announced in July will bring the program back
into line with the overall balance we have seen in recent years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The immigration minister announced last month a deep cut into
family reunions and a smaller increase in skilled migrations.
</P>
<P>
The government research showed that migrants coming under the
family reunion category faced much higher unemployment rates than
skilled category migrants.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government slashed the number of family reunions
by 13,700 and increase skilled migrants by 4,400 this year.
</P>
<P>
In the budget announced last week, the coalition government
also extended the waiting period for newly arrived migrants to
enjoy social welfare payments to two years from the original six
months.
</P>
<P>
The budget also cut the government funding for English language
learning assistance to migrants from non-English speaking
background.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Signs that proclaim "Soldiers
First" can be seen everywhere in China, especially in shops and
railway stations. But soldiers generally adopt the "Citizens
First" approach in their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
The mutual understanding and accommodation between armymen and
civilians has a long history in China, and it has been enhanced by
the country's drive of opening up process and reform.
</P>
<P>
Since July's catastrophic flooding struck Liujiang river in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 300,000 soldiers
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the
region have offered their help to the area's flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The army dispatched about 3,800 ships and 41 airplanes to the
area, rescued more than 1.65 million local residents and
transported two million tons of materials.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese government and people have supported the army,
supplying soldiers with necessary facilities, giving preferential
subsidies to disabled soldiers and providing other means of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, up to 40 million yuan in funding has been allocated
annually to the local army in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Considers Building Dam Near Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is considering building a
dam on a river some 30 kilometers south of the capital of Beirut
to create an artificial lake of 120 million cube meters, the
latest issue of the Beirut business weekly Eco News reported.
</P>
<P>
On completion, the Bissree dam will be the biggest in Lebanon
after the Qaroun dam on Litani river, the largest river in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The envisaged dam will feed Beirut and its vicinities,
extending to River of Dog in the north and to the Awali River in
the south and including the Chouf coast and Iglim Al-Kharoub.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the study on feasibility is expected to
finish in September and its objective is to check the
geotechnical conditions for the project and estimate approximate
cost.
</P>
<P>
Ordered by the Litani River Authority in 1980, the study has
been participated by international and Lebanese consultant
companies and was only intercepted by the 1975-90 Lebanese civil
war, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study, which preliminarily estimates the cost
at 60 million U.S. dollars, is an important prerequisite demanded
by the World Bank as a prelude to providing finance for the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Bissree dam is to be built over the Bisree River, about 395
meters above sea level and 23 kilometers away from the mouth of
the Awali River.
</P>
<P>
According to the researches to date, the highest level of the
dam water will be 461.9 meters above the sea level, and the
maximum height of the dam will be 67 meters.
</P>
<P>
The end-to-end length of the dam will be 737 meters to the top
and 381 meters at the bottom.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- In the first five months this
year, Thailand's sugar exports jumped from fifth place over the
past two years to the second spot in the farm and agro-industrial
sector in terms of value.
</P>
<P>
During the said five months, the country's sugar exports moved
ahead of marine products, grains, and preserved meat and fish
products, but behind rice, according to a local press report
today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was high at 28.3 percent over the same period
of last year. The report did not mention the total value.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's sugar exports value soared 65 percent to
31.6 billion baht (1.264 billion U.S. dollars) from 19.2 billion
baht (768 million dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at the Department of Business Economics predicted that
the future would be even more promising as a result of government
plans to encourage sugarcane cultivation.

<P>
Big buyers of Thai raw sugar this year were South Korea, China,
Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines, while of the total shipments

<HEADLINE> Telephone Users in Vietnam Grow Sharply in Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephone
subscribers shoot up ten times in ten years in Vietnam after the
one millionth phone user was linked to the national network on
Saturday, the Vietnamese News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Phone users have increased 22 percent annually on the average
in Vietnam since 1986, when the number of telephone subscribers
only stood at 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Post and Telecommunications (VNPT) now plans to
link one million more telephone subscribers in the second
quarter of 1998 and three million more in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In late 1995, there was already one telephone in every 100
Vietnamese people, a target set by the VNPT for 2000.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT also mapped out a 1995-2000 plan to invest 30,000
billion dong (about 2.73 billion U.S. dollars) in building three
million extra telephone lines by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are only 1.3 telephone lines per every 100
people in the country, compared with the worldwide average level
of more than 10 lines.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT has already digitalized its telephone exchanges across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has speeded up the modernization of telephone service
with high technology since 1993. As a result, the hike of phone
users in 1993 equaled to the total number of combined telephone
subscribers over the past 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Local Tax Revenue up 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The local tax revenue of South
China's prosperous Guangdong Province was up 15 percent
year-on-year to 16.26 billion yuan (about two billion US dollars)
in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The amount represented over 60 percent of the southern Chinese
province's tax target for this year, according to a senior tax
official.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to collect that much, as economic efficiency has
actually deteriorated everywhere since the start of this year,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's personal income tax revenue grew more than 30
percent during the January-July period to some 1.5 billion yuan,
which was the largest among all Chinese provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"As the forerunner of the country's opening-up and reform
policies, Guangdong has even greater potential in the collection
of personal income tax," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Biscuit Industry Complains About Tax Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's biscuit industry is
incurring a heavy loss after the government imposed an additional
five-percent sales tax on flour products one month ago, industry
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
They said the increased sales tax caused prices of local-made
biscuits to rise by an average of almost 35 percent, leading to a
loss of 1.5 million rupees (nearly 30,000 U.S. dollars) in the
industry in the past month.
</P>
<P>
According to an executive of a major biscuit company here,
Nepali biscuit products are now unable to compete with imported
biscuits on the domestic market, especially those from neighboring
India.
</P>
<P>
Noting the rising prices of Nepali biscuits because of higher
costs, the executive of the Nabisco Nepal, a leading Nepali
biscuit maker, warned that imported biscuits would eventually
replace local products if the government fails not move to protect
the domestic biscuit industry.
</P>
<P>
In its budget plan for the 1996-97 fiscal year that started in
mid-July, the Nepali government raised the sales tax for flour and
biscuits from 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 165 biscuit factories producing 15,000 tons of
biscuits annually in Nepal, whose demand stands at about 12,000
tons. And the country still imports 3,000 tons of Indian-made
biscuits every year.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean Presidents Sentenced to Death, Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan to death
and Roh Tae-woo 22 and a half years in prison on charges of
mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in South Korea's history that former
presidents were sentenced to death and prison term.
</P>
<P>
The two were found guilty of taking bribery. The court also
fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million
U.S. dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly accumulated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 13 of the 14 former South Korean officers who helped
the two former presidents in their quest for power were also
sentenced by the court to four to ten years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Four of the two ex-presidents' followers including former 1st
Army Corps Commander Hwang Young-si were given ten years in
prison, four others including former Commander of the 3rd Airborne
Brigade Choi Sae-chang eight years in prison, other three
including former Commander of the 30th Security Group Chang
Se-dong seven years in prison and the other two including former
15th Battalion Commander of the 3rd Airborne Brigade Park Jong-kyu
four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Former Commander of the Army 20th Division Park Jun-byung was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The 16 former South Korean officers including Chun and Roh were
indicted early this year for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges stemmed from their roles in the
military revolt on December 12, 1979, and the crackdown of the
civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Roh and Chun, who were arrested on November 16 and December 3
last year respectively, were also indicted for bribery since they
received huge amounts of illegal funds from businessmen while in
office.
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, Chun arrested the then martial law commander,
Chung Sung-hwa, and accused him of complicity in the assassination
of President Park Chung-hee. That made Chun the de facto head of
the martial law command.
</P>
<P>
Chun, then a major general, had been in charge of investigating
Park's death. After consolidating power, Chun was elected
president in 1980 and was succeeded by his friend, Roh, in
1988. The latter stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling followed 27 trial sessions on the mutiny and
treason charges involving the 16 defendants since March 11 this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, since the two former presidents and their followers
refused to admit their crimes in connection with the 1979 and 1980
incidents, it is most likely that they will appeal the case to a
higher court.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Plans Repayment Fund for Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The city of Huangshi, in central
China's Hubei Province, plans to set up a repayment fund for
foreign loans to ensure solvency.
</P>
<P>
A city official said Huangshi's use of foreign loans has risen
steadily in recent years and that such loans were involved in a
number of important technical renovation projects and urban
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
To date, the city has received foreign loans valued at 180
million US dollars, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of the lack of awareness of the importance of
timely repayment on the part of some company executives, and the
weak repaying ability of some enterprises have resulted in
unfortunate consequences," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu Huapin, secretary of the city committee of the Communist
Party of China, said that the record of repayment of foreign loans
has a direct bearing on the credit-worthiness and image of both
the local and central government.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must solve the problem of being unable to pay
back foreign loans and establish a repayment fund," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The repayment will come from enterprises' depreciation fees,
overhaul funds, profits and interests, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Vows to End Child Labor in Garment Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's garment sector is
determined to eliminate child labor in the industry by October 31
this year, President of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (BGMEA) Redwan Ahmed said here today.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was set in a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
signed by the BGMEA and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) on July 4
last year.
</P>
<P>
The MOU prohibits fresh recruitment of child workers in
Bangladesh's garment industry and provides for education and
training of the displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed warned that any factory that violates the MOU will be
punished.
</P>
<P>
A joint team of the BGMEA, UNICEF and the ILO had identified
10,547 child workers after surveying 1,821 garment factories in
the country. There are some 12 million workers in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 130 schools have been set up in Dhaka,
Chittagong and Narayanganj, providing education for 2,015 former
child workers. The reports said that 70 more schools are expected
to be opened by October 31.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cut Heralds Better Development Prospects: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists and market
analysts hailed last week's interest rate cut as heralding a new
takeoff of the national economy and the securities market.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate cut is an important signal for a new round
of economic growth," an analyst said in today's "Shanghai
Securities News."
</P>
<P>
It is also a major step in China's financial reforms, therefore
its impact and significance cannot be underestimated, the analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, last Friday cut
the interest rates on deposits by an average of 1.5 percentage
points and loans by an average of 1.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
With insufficient immediate demand being an outstanding problem
in China's economy, the rate cut can serve as an incentive to
boosting fixed-asset investment and immediate consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a better option than increasing the money supply, since
the present money supply is already nearing the GDP figure," the
analyst said. "Only a large amount of the supply is lying idle and
the amount in circulation is inadequately small."
</P>
<P>
The rate cut, the second in less than four months, will force
more bank deposits into the capital market, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
He said that though Chinese people were long used to the
traditional planned economy, the rate cut will encourage them to
put more of their savings into the capital market for higher
economic returns, which will in turn boost the securities market.
</P>
<P>
"The rate cut is an important market stimulus and forebodes the
lifting of the curtain for a new round of development of China's
securities market," the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Gede, an associate research fellow with the Institute of
Banking and Finance under the Central Bank's Shanghai Branch, said
that in the China Securities News that the cut will dampen
people's willingness to save money and encourage them to invest in
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The cut will save Chinese enterprises tens of billions of yuan
in interest payments, which is expected to help them improve
economic efficiency, Gu explained.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises paid 86.88 billion yuan in loan interest last year,
almost 1.3 times their total profits. The amount was up 20 percent
year-on-year to more than 60 billion yuan in the first six months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The rate cut signals an easing credit policy of the central
government and will lure more money to the capital market," said
Ye Lusheng, a securities regulatory official in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The cut also will lower the fund-raising cost of the listed
companies, making them more attractive to investors, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Miao Hengsheng, vice-president of Shenyin-Wanguo Securities
Co. Ltd, said the cut, especially the cut in the rates for
longer-term deposits, will probably make the stock market bullish
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
He said that the unexpected drops at the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock markets late last week were largely because "the interest
rate cut was long anticipated and the stimulus from it was
digested before the announcement was made."
</P>
<P>
In spite of general optimistic expectations, both Shanghai and
Shenzhen markets witnessed accelerated drops last week, with the
Shanghai composite index dropping 32.18 points to 803.69 and the
Shenzhen market down 143.13 points from the previous week to close
at 2530.07 points.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yun, general manager of Fujian Huaxing Securities Co., said
that given the background of the interest rate cut, it is of
far-reaching significance to the healthy development of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Cao Hai, a dealer of Huaxia Securities Company's Shenzhen
branch, the interest rate cut is helpful to easing a capital
shortfall of state-owned enterprises and reducing their production
costs.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to help moderately revitalize the real
estate sector, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yong, a dealer of the Shenzhen unit of Beijing Securities
Co., said that the rate cut reflects the central authorities'
determination to rejuvenate the large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises and reduce the burden of banks.
</P>
<P>
"From this perspective, we can safely predict that the
performance of enterprises will improve significantly and
investors should be confident and optimistic on the long run,"
Liang said.

<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly all the African paperless immigrants expelled from
the Saint-Bernard Church of Paris have been released after being
briefly detained by a Paris court for various offenses. Many of
the paperless Africans rejoined their families Saturday in an
abandoned theater of Cartoucherie de Vincennes outside Paris. A
group of 10 hunger strikers among the Africans, who were
protesting against the expulsion orders of the French government
and were seized in Friday's swoop on the Saint-Bernard Church,
stopped fasting Saturday after they were released from detention.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's security chief Alexander Lebed, who went to
Chechnya on Saturday hoping to rapidly reach a package of
agreements with the separatist forces, returned to Moscow on
Sunday to hear the views of high political leaders on the
proposals presented by the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
The space of movement for Lebed is very tight. President Boris
Yeltsin has fixed the limit of his exercise by saying that
Chechnya must be ``an inalienable part'' of Russia. The Chechens
have hinted that they can make some concessions on the status of
the Causasian republic, but will refuse a reintegration with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The American Democratic Party is to kick off its national
convention in Chicago today which will officially nominate Bill
Clinton and Al Gore as presidential and vice-presidential
candidates. With seven to 10 points ahead of his Republican rival
Bob Dole in the latest poll, Clinton is in a powerful position.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also made a spectacular turn towards the right by
signing the bill proposed by the Republicans on dismantling the
welfare system created by Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, which had
been one of the pillars of dogma of the Democrats since.
</P>
<P>
-- Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk will have to give an
amnesty to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas to bring about national
reconciliation. The amnesty could cover Ieng Sary. While
negotiations are going on between the Cambodian government and the
dissident faction of Khmer Rouge led by Ieng Sary, Sihanouk said
that he is ready to pardon on October 31 ``thousands of people.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Federation Helps Women in China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Women's Federation
has, over the past decade, helped 1.6 million women across China
to shake off poverty and become well-to-do through a series of
women's cadre classes, and technical training and literacy courses.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the group has conducted training
courses for over 1,300 local women's federation cadres and
township women cadres in Gansu and Ningxia, and sent another 230
female cadres to the highly-developed coastal areas for training.
</P>
<P>
The Dingxi and Hexi areas in Gansu Province, and Xihaigu in
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, all in northwest China, are the
country's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
After completing the courses, women cadres in Gansu in turn
held literacy classes and applied agro-technology training classes
which helped over one million women to learn read and write and 3
million women to master an area of applied technology.
</P>
<P>
In Ningxia, over 70,000 women in poor areas attended 279 new
technology training classes.
</P>
<P>
The training sessions fostered a great number of women cadres
who helped poor women become more prosperous and launched several
aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province has established nearly 900 entities headed by
women, including planting, domestic animal breeding and knitting
industries.
</P>
<P>
Mo Kongying, deputy head of Shixia Town in Dingxi County, Gansu
Province, collected 200,000 million yuan (24,000 dollars) after
she received special training and bought 100 knitting
machines. Her factory has offered job opportunities to 350 poor
women in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
Gansu also sends groups of poor woman to factories in coastal
cities such as Changzhou in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of China's 65 million poor people are
women.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the women's federations at all levels
plan to help at least one million women to become better off.

<HEADLINE> Scenic Mountain Enjoys State Priority in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Scenic Dahong Mountain, central
China, is one of four mountain tourist areas named on a State
priority list to enjoy sustainable development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 14 million US dollars of investment will be poured
into construction of attractions in the mountain region, located
in the northern part of Hubei Province, local tourist officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The other three mountains are the Changbai Mountain in
northeast China's Jilin province, Jinggang Mountain in east
China's Jiangxi province, and Huangshan Mountain in Anhui
province, also in east China.
</P>
<P>
The sustainable development plan of the mountain area, which
has its roots in the ancient culture of the Chu State during the
Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (770-221 BC), mainly
focuses on environmental protection through a combination of
scientific research, education, training and sightseeing, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Key construction projects include a scientific education
center, a historical site and cultural relics area, a rare plant
and animal viewing area, and water-tourism areas composed of a
reservoir, three streams, and 24 springs.
</P>
<P>
The investment in Dahong, which includes 5.15 million US
dollars from overseas sources, is expected to produce an annual
return of 10 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Expand Science Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- This largest port city in north
China plans to extend a busy, crowded street with
technology-intensive businesses.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, there were few enterprises along the 2.6 km
street in Tianjin, now a science and trade center in north China.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 600, which reported a total income of more
than one billion yuan last year, or 17.7 times that of 1989.
</P>
<P>
Market orientation and science backup have led to the
prosperity of the "science street" area, according to the street
administrative committee.
</P>
<P>
So far, 2,100 new techniques and products have been developed
and applied to industrial production in the area's
enterprises. Fifty-five businesses reported more than five million
yuan worth of income each in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, more than 3,300 hi-tech products
from the street have been spread to a dozen major cities in the
country, yielding over 300 million yuan worth of trade volume.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 9,200 people work along the science
street, over 70 percent of whom have received higher education.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Sharp Increase in Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's urban housing
construction sector is maintaining its strong growth momentum,
with total investment hitting 78.5 billion yuan in the first half
of the year, up 22 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Housing projects under construction in the first half of the
year amounted to 310 million sq m and 30 million sq m of houses
were completed in the same period, up 11 percent and 14 percent
respectively over the corresponding period last year, according to
a senior official with the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The official said that sharpest rise was registered in
investment for commodity housing, completing an investment of
53.74 billion yuan in the fist half of the year, or a 52 percent
increase over the Jan.-June period last year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government regards the housing sector
as a boost to the entire national economy, which is expected to
stimulate over 50 economic sectors, including building materials,
metallurgy, timber processing, chemical and light industries. And
it produces a far greater output value than the sectors of
auto-making and household electric alliances.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that housing reform is key to the
development of the housing sector. Much has to be done to change
the current situation of taking housing distribution as part of a
social welfare system, and steps should be taken to raise housing
rent and set up a rational proportion between rents and selling
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the problems existing in housing construction
include a shortage of funds for the state-launched "comfortable
housing project" and slack property sales.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of installment payments will help resolve
these problems, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Mother Lets Son Be Killed to Exorcise Ghost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A mother allegedly allowed the
beheading of her 32-year-old son in India's Uttar Pradesh Saturday
as a sacrifice to save her 29-year-old pregnant daughter from a
haunting ghost, the Times of India reported today.
vk
</P>
<P>
The son, called Jagmal, was a farm worker in a village 45
kilometers from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His wife Rajdulari and
his two sons and one daughter were also attacked in the incident.
Rajdulari is now in hospital with serious injuries, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, Jagmal was dragged out of his room,
beaten up and tied to a tree by eight male members of his mother's
family in the presence of many villagers.
</P>
<P>
His mother, Prakashee, then gave a cutter with pointed iron
teeth to the eight men who beheaded Jagmal, said the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
They said the villagers managed to foil the family's attempt to
kill Rajdulari as well in the horrible sacrificial ritual.
</P>
<P>
The family had reportedly decided three days ago to sacrifice
Jagmal and his wife after Prakashee visited her pregnant daughter
who was in difficult labor in her in-laws' house.
</P>
<P>
The report said the possessed Prakashee was told by local
witches that her daughter was haunted by a ghost who would wreck
the childbirth and haunt the rest of the family unless she
sacrificed her son.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Announces Measures to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti said Sunday that the government was determined to
proceed with economic reforms and announced a series of measures
to improve the kingdom's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that the proposed measures would bring about
social security to all sectors of society and help the private
sector through improving the investment environment and cutting
down bureaucratic procedures, according to today's Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
He also said that other measures would be taken to improve the
performance of the customs department, encourage exports and help
the national industry.
</P>
<P>
"The economic imbalance that prevailed in the past have partly
led to lopsided development, because, despite the sincere efforts
of all, pockets of poverty still prevail and unemployment stands
at 15 percent," he told a gathering of businessmen and
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
But he added comprehensive development cannot be achieved
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The government had started a comprehensive program to deal
with the problems of poverty and unemployment and reducing their
impact on the less-privileged people in the transitional period,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon cancel customs duties on 492 capital
imports to help increase productivity and provide new job
opportunities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that the proposed measures aim at
building a strong economy so that "all people will have a
dignified life and be able to participate in the economic and
political life of the country."
</P>
<P>
The measures include: improving the investment environment
through introducing new legislation and amending some of the
existing ones; improving the efficiency of production-supporting
services and simplifying governmental procedures leading to the
reduction of cost on the consumer and proceeding with
privatization.
</P>
<P>
A plan, which the prime minister described as a "green lane"
for exporters, will be introduced to help Jordanian exporters to
boost their competitive edge on the international level.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, products which will be imported as input to
export-oriented industries will be exempted from time-consuming
customs inspections, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that customs on these inputs, which will be
immediately cleared upon arrival, will be collected based on
documents presented by the importers.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of "the green lane" plan for exporters will
start on September 15, Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
A number of other economic legislation to be presented this
year include:
</P>
<P>
-- a competition and anti-monopoly law.
</P>
<P>
-- a law for protecting national economy which aims at
preventing the dumping of products and illegal practices in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
-- a law for financing guarantees, which will allow the
hypothecation of current assets for obtaining financing and
encourage small industries to expand and increase production and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
-- a law for securities which draws upon organizational
framework for the Amman Financial Market.

<HEADLINE> Highway to be Moved to Protect Thousand-Year-Old Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A highway situated in front of a
group of thousand-year-old buddhist grottoes in north China's
Shanxi Province will be moved early next year.
</P>
<P>
The re-routed roadway will be put to use in 1998, at an
estimated cost of more than 90 million yuan, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes are located in Datong, a major coal-producing city
in China.
</P>
<P>
Every day, at least 18,000 coal trucks travel the highway in
front of the grottoes, and pollution caused by the excessive dirt
and dust they stir up, as well as the heavy vibrations they
produce, has affected and brought some damages to the ancient
structures.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built road will be used mainly for tourist travel,
and heavy-duty cargo vehicles will be prohibited from entering the
roadway. Also, the No. 109 state highway will be moved to the back
of the grottoes, some 20 km away.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes, carved into a hill in the fifth century, consist
of 45 major caves, more than 1,100 alcoves and over 51,000
statues. They are among the first batch of cultural relics to be
listed under state key protection, and are considered one of
China's three major treasure troves, together with the Mogao
Grottoes in Dunhuang of northwestern Gansu province, and the
Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang of central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, 10 million yuan has been spent on the
protection of the grottoes, according to Wang Heng, a researcher
from the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The road relocation is only part of a comprehensive
grotto-protection plan, which has been approved by the State
Cultural Relics Bureau, according to Li Zhiguo, dean of the
Yungang Grottoes Research Institute.

<HEADLINE> Over 300 Chinese Libraries Establish Automation Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- An integrated library automation
 system, developed by the Shenzhen Library, has been installed in
more than 300 large and medium libraries in 26 Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
The system includes six sub-systems for book purchasing,
cataloguing, circulation, administration of publications, and
on-line book list searching and consultation services.
</P>
<P>
China's library automation process began in late 1970s. The
country's widespread use of computers in the 1990s has provided a
better environment for library automation.
</P>
<P>
Information processing technology for the Chinese characters is
an important part of library automation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese computer and library professionals have combined their
efforts to compile a book for Chinese character coding for
information exchange, which covers 6,763 most frequently used
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese experts have developed hundreds of methods
for computer input of Chinese characters, including the
"five-stroke input method" and the "natural code input method,"
which have helped promotion of library automation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China's libraries introduced a number of
foreign library automation systems in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Library introduced the Library System-100 computer
administration system from the U.S. CLSI Company, and the Shanghai
Library is to introduce the Dynix Horizon system from the United
States.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The 21st general conference
of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association (CBA) opened here
today with a call for building up other networks to counter the
products of the Western media.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said there was an urgent need for Commonwealth countries
to cooperate in establishing other networks to counter the
products of the Western media.
</P>
<P>
He said that by virtue of its economic strength, the Western
media industry was able to churn out products that were
subsequently dumped in Commonwealth countries.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that no single view dominates the air waves,
Commonwealth countries could set up other networks to exchange
programs and share ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Commonwealth represents one quarter of mankind and by a common
fund of experience and shared facility in English, it could become
a focus for new and innovative arrangements between media
professionals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will exchange ideas and views on information and
broadcasting at the five-day conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 working papers are expected to be presented at the
conference which is being attended by 151 delegates and observers
from 58 Commonwealth members and the United States.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- United Telecom (Unicom), one of
China's leading telecommunications companies, will launch an
advanced submarine cable project along the west coast of the
Pacific Ocean, according to a report in "China Electronics News."
</P>
<P>
The project, called China West Pacific Cable (CWPC), will start
at the submarine cable between Shenzhen and Zhuhai, China's two
special economic zones. A cooperation contract was signed by
NEC of Japan and two companies linked with Unicom on August 12.
</P>
<P>
The largest telecom trunk ever launched in China, the 7,050-km
cable runs between Dandong, an industrial city of Liaoning
Province, and Beihai of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, linking
up to 27 major coastal cities and the national capital city of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The project involves an investment of two billion yuan, and
will add 150,000 telephone lines to the the country's telecom
capacity.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Library Associations (IFLA) will step up its efforts to promote
national and international polices, strategies and standards for
literature preservation, an IFLA official said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Work will also be strengthened on the research and application
of new information carriers to maintain the long-term preservation
of publications, said Marie-Therese Varlamoff, director of the
international center of the program.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at preserving all kinds of literature,
published and unpublished, for as long as possible, Varlamoff said
at a forum of the 62nd IFLA.
</P>
<P>
Since the program began, much work has been done to establish
an international network that exchanges information about
publication preservation efforts, she said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the international center has put an
emphasis on increasing the awareness of publication preservation
and conservation work, according to Varlamoff.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the IFLA has worked in cooperation with some
national libraries to establish five regional centers around the
world, in the United States and Canada center, eastern Europe,
Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, and the Pacific and
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Publications preservation and conservation experts have made
progress in protecting publications from being damaged, and also
have slowed down the speed of damage to publications and developed
methods to treat them, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The program will benefit all national libraries in the world,
Varlamoff said, adding that there is still important work to do to
ensure that the work is effective.

<HEADLINE> Some 10,000 Iranian Companies Declared Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 Iranian companies
have been declared bankrupt in the first half of this Iranian year
(which started on March 20) due to strict government import policy
and shortage of banking credit, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily Abrar reported that the information
on the registration and dissolution of commercial firms was
published by the Central Bank of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Some specialists said that the actual figure of bankrupt
companies would be considerably higher than that of the official
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for wide-spread bankruptcy include general
economic instability, skyrocketing inflation (about 100 percent)
and volatile economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the dissolved firms were in agricultural,
financial, insurance and service sectors. Their average capital
was 8.3 million rials (about 2,075 U.S. dollars) each, 50.6
percent less than what it was during the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Iran now is in the year of 1375 according to its lunar
Islamic calendar which began on March 20, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cattle Shortage Hits Beef Exports to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of beef cattle on
Zimbabwean Market has hit the cold storage company which is now
struggling to fulfil its European Union beef quota.
</P>
<P>
Cattle producers said at the weekend many of them were holding
on to their cattle because of the available good grazing. The
shortage has pushed up the cattle and beef prices on the market.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Cattle Producers Association Paul
d'Hotman said farmers were no longer selling their cattle out of
desperation but were concentrating on planned sales resulting in
a general shortage of slaughter stock.
</P>
<P>
The shortage has affected both the cold storage company and
the private abattoirs who now have to compete harder for the few
cattle available for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
However, General Manager of the company Lawrence Massanga said
he was confident that the company would fulfil its EU beef quota
of 9,100 tonnes. He said the new producer prices announced by his
company to compensate farmers for the increases in input costs
had an encouraging response.
</P>
<P>
Beef prices in Europe at present were way below normal levels
and these would affect the yearly earnings. The state company
normally earns around 40 million US Dollars from beef exports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Malaysian PMs Meet Malaysian Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China and Malaysia will
strengthen economic and trade cooperation to promote the
comprehensive development of friendly ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Mahathir Bin Mohammed made remarks to this effect at a meeting
today in Beijing with a group of Malaysian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Extending his welcome to Mahathir and the 150 Malaysian
businessmen accompanying the Prime Minister on the China trip, Li
said that this is the first time in history that so many Malaysian
business people have come to China together with their prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
And this has ushered in a new phase for the Sino-Malaysian
economic and trade cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that both China and Malaysia are developing countries
and they are friendly neighbors in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The economies of the two countries are mutually complementary
on a broad basis, the Chinese premier said, predicting bright
prospects for economic and trade cooperation that would equally
benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's development requires not only a stable domestic
environment, but also a long-term peaceful international
environment, as well as more extensive international exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, the economic development of the Asian-Pacific
region, East Asia in particular, has gained sustained momentum and
displayed great vigor, Li pointed out. And the economic growth in
China and Malaysia provides clear-cut evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Malaysia have similar historical experiences, and
are now pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and
working to invigorate the national economy. Now that the two
peoples have stood up, their development and bilateral relations
promise a bright future, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said China, Malaysia and other developing countries
should forge closer relations in international affairs in order to
safeguard their common interests, as they share similar viewpoints
on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Malaysian businessmen present in Beijing
today all have an enormous interest in advancing the economic ties
and trade between the two countries, including investing in
China. He believed that with these businessmen visiting China, the
enterprises of the two countries will work together more closely
and probe new areas of cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Petrochemical Industry Earns 705 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's petrochemical industry
has earned 705 million U.S. dollars through export in the first
five months of this year, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Petrochemical Commercial Company (PCC) said that it
exported one million tons of petrochemicals worth 155 million
dollars and another million tons of products worth 550 million
dollars in the five months.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Iran News quoted PCC Chairman Mojtaba
Khosrowtaj as saying that Iran is expected to export 1.5 billion
dollars worth of petrochemical products this year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's major petrochemical products are liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), PVC powder, ammonia, aromatic 2 e.h., sulfur, and naphtha,
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the company's main customers are China, India,
South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Pakistan, Turkey and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"We are exporting about 40,000 tons per annum of benzene to
Saudi Arabia and India and selling another 40,000 tons a year
locally," Khosrowtaj said, noting that exports to European
countries were lesser due to the cost of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the U.S. sanctions, Khosrowtaj said Iran used to
sell 250,000 tons of LPG worth 40 million dollars to an American
company.
</P>
<P>
However, PCC cancelled the deal last year in the wake of
Washington's moves against Tehran and awarded the deal to a
Chinese company.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Criticizes Striking Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe last night criticized striking civil servants and said the
strike might be an opportunity for the government to reduce the
number of public servants.
</P>
<P>
''We don't take kindly to illegal strikes. Already the public
service is far too large and it may be an opportunity for us to
reduce it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking to journalists after arriving from
Cape Town where he had gone on a private visit after he had
attended the Southern African Development Community Summit which
ended in Lesotho yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he had met Chairman of the Public Service
Commission Mariyawanda Nzuwah two weeks ago and was happy that
statistics showed an increase of 20 percent in salaries for civil
servants. He said he now did not know the nature of their
grievances.
</P>
<P>
''I have to understand the actual reason because I don't
understand why the strike is on at all.''
</P>
<P>
He said he would have to be briefed on the nature of the
grievances and the responsible ministers, especially Florence
Chitauro of the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare, would be looking into those grievances.
</P>
<P>
''The government never knew that there was a grievance.Those
who are striking never told us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen if the fired civil servants returned
to work this morning, he said the issue of their dismissal was a
different matter.
</P>
<P>
Nurses and other medical workers went on strike on Monday
demanding higher salaries and other civil servants followed suit
a day later. The government issued an ultimatum on Thursday that
they should return to work on Friday or risk being fired.

<HEADLINE> Iran Offers to Mediate between Bangladesh and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran is ready to mediate in
Bangladesh's dispute with its neighbors of India and Pakistan,
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said that Iran will leave no stone
unturned in its effort to settle the disputes among the three
neighboring states, the local English-language daily Iran News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the statement Sunday at the Tehran international
airport where he saw off Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdol Samad
Azad, who called for Iranian mediation during his trip to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Velayati as saying that Bangladesh and India
have to accept the Iranian role before the Islamic Republic could
go ahead in regard to mediation over the Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Bangladesh, India and Pakistan to cooperate with
Iran to iron out differences among them.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also voiced concern over the
deteriorating situation in northern Iraq, saying that the United
States had tried to mediate between the two warring factions in
northern Iraq but failed to bring a durable peace to them.
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) are at odds over sharing power and oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
The most recent bout of Kurdish fighting erupted on August 17
and left 100 people dead and hundreds injured. The KDP blamed Iran
for actively helping the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Velayati stated that Iran followed a set policy that the
region should be tension free and "has tried and will try
to ease the strain in northern Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Angola's UNITA to Accept Angolan Vice-Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement
UNITA will accept the offer of a vice-presidency in a new unity
government but will not appoint its leader Jonas Savimbi to the
post, a report reaching here Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
``UNITA will accept an Angolan vice-presidency but will not
designate its President Jonas Savimbi to take this position,''
the report quoted Marcial Dachala, spokesman for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said some officials have suggested UNITA's Chief
Constitutional Negotiator Abel Chivukuvuku could become
vice-president instead.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been holding a congress in Bailundo since Tuesday to
decide whether UNITA should accept the offer of vice-presidency
by the Angolan government and whether Savimbi, 63, should take
the post.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the congress rejected the offer, shouting
``negative, negative'' when the topic was raised.
</P>
<P>
However, Savimbi later warned the delegates against making
``extreme decisions.'' He said war was no longer an option and
they would have to prepare for opposition politics.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi would hold a news conference on Tuesday to present the
congress's conclusions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNITA and the Angolan government had fought for 19 years since
l975 when the southern African country gained independence from
Portual. The two sides signed a peace agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia, in November, 1994. enditem

<HEADLINE> SAARC Needs More Economic Cooperation: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) should establish a series of
mechanisms to achieve greater trade among the SAARC countries,
said a latest study.
</P>
<P>
In addition to establishment of a common regional transit
treaty among the member states, the study also called for setting
up clearing and payments arrangements, an arbitration center,
trade financing facilities and a trade information network.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC countries could cooperate in the modernization of
existing industrial units through technology transfer and joint
ventures. This would help in reviving sick industrial units in
many countries, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study also recommended that SAARC countries explore the
possibilities of cooperation in improving infrastructural
facilities in different countries. This could cover areas like
railways, power, ports development, multimodal transport
facilities and utilization of water resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Unruly protesters in Bangladesh's
northern town of Bogra, 228 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, have
continued enforcing a dawn-to-dusk strike for the third straight

several people.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that angry mob clashed with
police several times on Sunday while police teargased and
lathicharged them, leaving more than a dozen injured.
</P>
<P>
All government establishments including banks, insurance and

traffic including train services were suspended.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the situation aggravated when the body of
a student with bullet wounds was recovered from a local river on
August 23 and four other persons were killed by police firing the
next day when the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
activists took to the streets and attacked the Bogra police
station in protest against the killing of the students.
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in Bogra is reportedly still in tense,
Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said on Sunday that "barring a few
scattered incidents, the overall situation is completely under the
control of the government."
</P>
<P>
He sought cooperation from the opposition BNP to maintain law
and order and curb terrorism unitedly.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday also visited the town
and addressed the district officials, local elite and leaders of
different political parties, excluding the BNP.
</P>
<P>
She ordered an immediate suspension of two police officers
allegedly responsible for excesses in an effort to pacify the
people and assured the people of stern action against those
involved in firing on the dead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the All-Party Student Unity of the town announced a
series of action programs in their rally on Sunday afternoon,
which include hoisting of black flag in all educational
institutions in the northern region on Monday, blockade at the
main crossing of the town on August 28 and a dawn-to-dusk strike
in the town on August 29.

officials responsible for the incidents by August 31. Otherwise,
they threatened that a greater movement would be launched after
the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Fujitsu to Stop Producing SRAM Microchips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Fujitsu Ltd. will
stop producing static random access memory (SRAM) microchips and
specialize in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory
microchips, a Kyodo report said today.
</P>
<P>
A production line in the Iwate Prefecture, northern Japan, will
be closed by March 31 next year. The company will also close the
old capital-intensive line, which produced mask read only memory
(ROM) microchips and erasable programmable ROMs for use in video
game software as well as SRAM microchips.
</P>
<P>
Used as assistant cache memories for personal computers, SRAMs
take the second-biggest share after DRAMs in the world market.
But imbalance in the semiconductor market led to the company's
decision to stop its production.
</P>
<P>
Demand for DRAMs is rising for use in personal computers and
flash memories are being increasingly used in mobile phones.

PYONGYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A United States and Japanese
announcement of a large-scale joint military exercise to be held
in November is criticised in an article carried today in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's newspaper, Rodong Sinmum.,
</P>
<P>
The exercise might aggravate the already tense situation on the
Korean Peninsula, the article warned.
</P>
<P>
The two-week military action, participated in by American
warships and fighters and Japanese army, naval and air forces,
will be in the East Korea Sea.
</P>
<P>
Since this kind of military exercise was held previously in the
Pacific Ocean, the US and Japanese intention of strangling Korea
was obvious, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Japan the United States claimed they intended to familiarize
themselvies with military actions in the Pacific Ocean and other
seas, and also demonstrated that they were preparing for a
possible war on the Korean Peninsula, the article said.
</P>
<P>
While publicizing the DPRK's military threat, which in fact did
not exist at all, America strengthened its military forces on the
periphery of the Korean Peninsula. This showed America was a major
threat to the peace and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK people would maintain vigilance on the US and
Japanese reactionary forces and their war attempts, the article
said.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Has to Wait for Settlement of Political Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Only after the breakaway Chechnya
recovers from its 20-month war with Russia will the issue of its
political status be settled, says the Russian Prime Minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with Russian Television that he hoped
the Chechen separatists would not raise the independence issue
during the on-going peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The issue should be decided in a referendum, by the will of the
Chechen people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The people must decide. As they decide, so it will be." A
referendum should be held five years later, after the work of
restoring order in the region was completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that Chechnya should be an integral part of
the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
As for how, and with what status, it was essential not to
decide that now, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges ASEAN Not to Use Anti-Dumping Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will urge its ASEAN
counterparts not to use anti-dumping duties against Thai exports,
the local newspaper the Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Thai officials as saying that only with
the removal of anti-dumping measures can ASEAN exporters truly
benefit from the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which requires
members to cut tariffs on manufactured ASEAN exports to a maximum
of five percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, several countries have recently tended to use
anti-dumping measures as a means of protecting their domestic
markets from foreign competitors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Philippines, for instance, is using anti-dumping
duties to prevent imports of fired bricks from Thailand, iron
tubes from Singapore and rubber from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia levies anti-dumping duties on PVC floor covering from
Thailand and Singapore imposes anti-dumping tariffs on iron
products from Malaysia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Thai Business Economic Department said that
Thailand expects trade and investment in the ASEAN region to
increase markedly if anti-dumping measures are removed.
</P>
<P>
It cited achievements of other economic groups such as the
European Union, the Australia-New Zealand group, and the economic
cooperation area between the EU and EFTA, noting that these groups
have abolished anti-dumping duties to promote economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will try to persuade ASEAN members to stop using
anti-dumping measures within the trading bloc to bring AFTA into
reality as soon as possible, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Chun Sentenced to Death, Roh 22 1/2 Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court sentenced
former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo to
death and 22 and a half years in prison respectively on charges of
mutiny, treason and bribery here this morning.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the prosecution demanded the death penalty for
Chun and life imprisonment for Roh. Both are charged with leading
or playing a key role in the 1979 military revolt and the 1980
suppression of civil protesters.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh were indicted early this year for mutiny and
treason. The mutiny and treason charges stem from their roles in
the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and the brutal crackdown
of the uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft since they received huge amounts of bribes
from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attitude Towards U.N. Criticized by Think-Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Council on Foreign
Relations, a "think-tank" of the United States, has issued a
report criticizing the attitude of the government and the Congress
toward the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., it says, "can -- and often has -- served American
interests well."
</P>
<P>
A recent report in Newsweek magazine, said the United Nations
was in crisis and the United States was partly to blame for that.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the magazine following the report, John
Whitehead, a member of the Council and former Deputy Secretary of
State, said that it was "wrong" for U.S. political figures to
attack the world organization, and to attack U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "That is not appropriate for an
American leader," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Whitehead said polls showed that "around 70 percent of the
American public favor the U.N. and believe we should pay our back
dues."
</P>
<P>
The United States has delayed paying its U.N. member's fee of
many millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Whitehead said it was in the interests of the United States to
support the U.N.. "It can't do things against our interest if we
coordinate ourselves, and vote against things that we disapprove
of.
</P>
<P>
"For the United States to vote in favor of something, and then
refuse to provide the funds to do something that we voted for, is
absolutely inconsistent and places the United Nations in a very
difficult position," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the U.N. ran out of money and went out of
business, it would be a tragedy for America.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have conducted a
series of research projects on glaciology and on construction
projects in the country's frigid zones.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Chinese and foreign scholars presented 148 papers to
the Fifth National Glaciology-Cryopedology Conference held last
week in Lanzhou, capital city of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Chinese Society of Glaciology and
Cryopedology, the conference's purpose is to make scientific
discoveries in the field better serve China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Scholars discussed the following four topics: the relation
between frigid areas and global climatic changes, the formation
and control of glaciers and frozen earth, construction work in
frigid zones, and water resources in dry and cold areas.
</P>
<P>
There are two key state laboratories in Lanzhou doing research
on construction in frozen earth and environmental research on
frigid zones.
</P>
<P>
A number of famous scholars have been working in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western part of China, where the
particular environment created significant glaciers and frozen
earth zones millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
The scholars agree that solving environmental problems such as
mud-rock flows, soil erosion, salinization, snow melting, and the
thawing of frozen earth, which hinder social and economic
development, is very important.

<P>
KUNMING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The largest foreign-owned
project in southwest China's Yunnan Province, the Yunnan Kunling
Thin Film Industrial Co. Ltd, has gone into trial production here.
</P>
<P>
The project, with more than 30 million US dollars in
investment by the KMP group of Singapore, has a designed
production capacity of 10,000 tons of thin film annually.
</P>
<P>
The BOPP thin film is a packaging material widely used in the
food and cigarette industries. The material is used by the
land-locked province, China's largest cigarette producer, which
has depended on imports from foreign countries for a long
time. China has several BOPP thin film factories, but most of them
are located in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The investors say that Kunling will be used to make up for
BOPP production lacks in the southwest market, and promote the
development of food processing industries in Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> BIS Sees Stability in Global Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) announced on Monday said that the net total of
new international securities financing reached a new record volume
in the second quarter of 1996. This was against a background of
somewhat lower interest rates, currency volatility and ample
global liquidity.
</P>
<P>
In its regular quarterly financial commentary, the Basel-based
BIS said while the more cautious attitude of investors towards
market risk was reflected in a larger proportion of short-term
euronotes and floating rate issues, there was also some evidence
of a greater tolerance for credit risk.
</P>
<P>
This was illustrated by an unprecedented volume of issues by
developing countries. It underlined the fact that the Mexican
crisis of early 1994, and the bond market turbulence seen at the
beginning of 1996, had no more than a temporary influence, said
the BIS, which acts as the clearinghouse for the world's central
banks.
</P>
<P>
The trend towards the establishment of borrowing programmes
which enabled issuers to raise funds in various forms at the
expense of traditional bonds continued, it added.
</P>
<P>
The BIS commentary also stated that the return to a generally
calmer financial market in the second quarter was accompanied by a
lower volume of business in all three broad groups of market risk
-- interest rates, currencies and equities -- traded in organised
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The erosion of profitability in well-established interest rate
products, and the difficulty of attracting currency business away
from the over-the-counter market, induced exchanges to place
greater emphasis on the expansion of trading facilities and on
equity and emerging market instruments.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to the BIS, detailed international
banking data available for the first quarter of 1996 indirectly
confirmed earlier evidence that fixed income markets were
initially less leveraged than they had been prior to the market
reversal of early 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thus, although the interbank market contracted, lending to
final customers accelerated during the quarter, with the apparent
loss of momentum in new bank lending to developing countries being
more demand than supply-driven, the report said.

<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- British Linford Christie placed
third in his final international race on his conutry Sunday and
confirmed he would retire at the end of the season. in Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Olympic and world 100 meters champion Christie
ran behind Nigeria's Osmond Ezinwa and compatriot Ian Mackie in
Sheffield, reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for 10 years that he had been beaten by a
British runner. Afterwards he said he was still considering
running in the grand prix final in Milan on September 7 but was
then definitely quitting international athletics.
</P>
<P>
"There's no turning back," Christie was quoted as saying. "I've
kept changing my mind in the past but it has not been a hard
decision to make. I am good, I have been good but all good things
have to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
"I've given a lot of my life to athletics but athletics is not
my life. The best things are when you remember the highs."
</P>
<P>
Cool and overcast conditions damaged athletes' performances on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sarka Kasparkova's triple jump of 14.84 meters was close to
the distance that brought the Czech athlete an Olympic bronze
medal last month. Behind her Britain's Ashia Hansen, fourth in
Atlanta, jumped a national best of 14.78 meters.
</P>
<P>
Three Olympic champions recorded victories. American Charles
Austin cleared 2.30 meters to win the high jump from Australia's
Tim Forsyth, who recorded the same height but had more failures
throughout the competition.
</P>
<P>
Austin's compatriot Allen Johnson won the 110 meters hurdles
in 13.23 seconds. Norway's Verbjorn Rodal took the 800 meters in
one minute 44.93 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's William Tanui, the 1992 Olympic 800 meters gold

<HEADLINE> France to Make Technical Modifications on Pasqua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The French government said today
that it will draft some new laws to make up some "gaps" of the
Pasqua immigration law which became the focus of contention in
France during the crisis of paperless immigrants in the past
several months.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after President Jacuqes Chirac and
Prime Minister Alain Juppe spent an intensive working weekend in
the Bregancon Castle.
</P>
<P>
The new laws will include clauses to clarify some issues
unclear in the Pasqua law to "more effectively" control
immigration, and those for the reinforcement of fight against
underground economic activities which are badly harming the French
economy.
</P>
<P>
The government ruled out the possibility of abandoning the
principle of the Pasqua law, which was made by former interior
minister Charles Pasqua in 1993 to tighten control of immigration
and fight clandestine economic bodies in France.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the government is under a
double pressure from the left and the ultra-right, with the former
calling for a softening of the Pasqua law, and the latter
demanding a complete closing of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
The French government said that the new legal texts, expected
to be adopted in late autumn or early winter, "will neither modify
nor abolish in their principle" the Pasqua law, but will "make up
some legislative gaps".

<HEADLINE> Chirac Supports Expulsion of Paperless Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today that he fully supports the expulsion of most paperless
immigrants because "one should give a strong signal" against
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
During a one-hour meeting with the press at the Bregancon
Castle in the department of Var, Chirac repeated his advice to
illegal immigrants that he made in his National Day speech this
year: "There is no more chance for you in France."
</P>
<P>
"It is out of the question that our (immigration) policy should
be changed," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that there is a "growing irritation
towards immigrants" in the French society. Such an attitude is
"irrational and unfair", he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also denounced "those who with irresponsibility are
developing xenophobia and racism in our country". "I will not be
part of those who play with fire in this issue,'' said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Netanyahu to Meet with Arafat Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, as
well as President Ezer Weizman, will all meet with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat "in the next
couple of weeks," Israel Television reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Channel 1 of Israel Television, Netanyahu
said that such a meeting would not depend on a date, but "depend
upon developments."
</P>
<P>
"I want a purposeful meeting," said the Israeli premier. "A
meeting that would bring results."
</P>
<P>
This development came after Weizman announced today that he
would meet with the PNA president soon, though no date has been
set.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Netanyahu at the Presidential House
this morning, Weizman said he had received a letter from Arafat,
who requested for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The president said that after exchanging views with Netanyahu,
it was agreed that the meeting would be held at his private house
in Caesarea, in northwest Israel.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had agreed to meet with Arafat, Weizman said,
"Today he (Arafat) has controlled over two millions of
Palestinians, when a leader like that, who is my neighbor, asks to
meet with me, I think I have to agree."
</P>
<P>
Both Weizman and Netanyahu denied that the president had given
Netanyahu an ultimatum that if the Israeli premier did not meet
Arafat, he would.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two was held after the Israeli media
reported this morning that Weizman had told Netanyahu that if he
does not meet with Arafat within 10 days, he will.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the president told Israel Radio that
Weizman arrived at this decision because he felt that the Middle
East peace process is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said that Weizman has also consulted with
senior Israeli politicians and security officials before making
the decision.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Shumer, director-general at the Presidential House, is
reported to have rejected all efforts to convince the president
not to initiate to meet with the PNA president.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Nevah told Israel Radio later today
that a meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat would have to be part
of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Nevah said the Israeli government's policy is that if the peace
process is to move forward, both sides must keep their commitments
to the signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
During the interview with Channel 1 in the evening, Netanyahu
said Israel's next step is to enter into negotiations with the
PNA with the objectives, in his words, "to clear the debt."
</P>
<P>
"There are commitments on their (the Palestinians') side which
have not been fulfilled," said Netanyahu. "They have requested
and demanded us, saying we have not fulfilled our commitments."
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it is to clear the debt," he said. "Then to open
a deliberation of continuing the process."
</P>
<P>
Since he took office in June, Netanyahu has been saying that
there would be a variety of channels in dealing with the
Palestinians, but the new premier refused to say if or under what
conditions he would meet with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Officials believed that a meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu was essential before any serious talks can begin on
the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for high-level talks, and that means Arafat
and Netanyahu," said Arafat's aide Nabil Abu Rudeineh.
</P>
<P>
When it happens, "I am sure the first meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu will be difficult, but I am sure it will be less
difficult than the first meeting between Arafat and Yitzhak
Rabin," the assassinated Israeli premier, said Ahmed Tibi, a
close adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also believed that such a meeting
would be necessary before any Israeli army's redeployment in the
disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
