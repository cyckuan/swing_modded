<HEADLINE> U.S. To Pursue Steel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department will pursue the U.S.  
steel industry's trade complaints against six countries accused of 
illegally pricing cut-to-length steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry was triggered by a U.S. International Trade  
Commission vote Friday finding evidence that imports from France, 
India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and South Korea have hurt domestic 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are part of a second round of complaints filed by  
major producers that have been struggling against a recent surge in 
steel imports. In the first round, the government is considering 
tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's vote represents another step by the U.S. steel  
industry and its workers to pursue aggressively all available 
courses of action,'' said Paul Wilheim, president of U.S. Steel 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was only a partial one, however. The trade  
commission, an independent fact-finding agency, voted to drop cases 
against the Czech Republic and Macedonia after finding their 
shipments of cut-to-length plates to be negligible -- less than 3 
percent of overall imports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic steel producers and steelworkers have blamed the  
imports for thousands of layoffs and three U.S. company 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports have since dropped, steel producers continue to  
press the administration and Congress for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The imports reached record highs last year as the Asian economic  
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, five steel producers and the United Steelworkers of  
America accused the eight countries of illegally dumping 
cut-to-length steel in the United States at prices below production 
costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accused France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Macedonia and  
South Korea of unfairly subsidizing their producers to artificially 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Fujio Ono, has called the cases  
unjustified, saying market forces and not artificial trade 
practices were responsible for the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until mid-May to issue a preliminary  
finding on subsidies and until late July to initially rule on 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut-to-length plate, thicker than the widely used hot-rolled  
variety, is used in agricultural and construction equipment, 
bridges, ships, railcars and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hot-rolled cases, the Commerce Department has issued  
preliminary dumping findings against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
Final rulings are expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face tariffs of up to 71 percent if the  
findings are affirmed and found to threaten U.S. industry. Russia 
has reached a deal with the United States to avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily curtailing shipments.

	NATO Steps Up Attacks in Belgrade  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO air raids destroyed a second  
bridge over the Danube, Serbian television reported today. The 
bridge is the second highway bridge in Novi Sad destroyed this 
week. NATO missiles knocked out a key bridge in the city on 
Thursday, blocking traffic on the waterway. Today's attack leaves 
only a railroad bridge in the city of 500,000. NATO Air Commodore 
David Wilby said alliance forces were targeting communications and 
transport links in their escalating campaign to force Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to capitulate and stop his offensive 
in Kosovo.

	Macedonia Overwhelmed by Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Macedonia announced today it won't  
accept any more refugees unless they can go on to other European 
countries. With an estimated 65,000 Kosovo Albanians jammed at its 
border and more coming, lack of toilets and running water have 
overwhelmed efforts by relief agencies to help. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said that as many as 300,000 more refugees were believed 
to be en route to Kosovo's borders.

	BENTON, La. (AP) -- A tornado tore through this northwestern  
Louisiana town today, flattening homes and trapping people inside 
when walls collapsed around them. At least nine were killed when 
the twister swept through trailer parks just north of Shreveport 
and destroyed at least 30 house trailers. ``We're still searching 
and have so much to go through, there's no way of telling what the 
end total will be,'' said Bossier Parish Coroner Dawn Young.

	NYPD Shooting Sparks D.C. Rally

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 2,500 demonstrators marched in  
Washington today calling for President Clinton and Congress to help 
combat police brutality. The rally was intended to call for changes 
to abusive police practices nationwide, but it was spurred by the 
shooting death of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo by four New York 
City police officers. Demonstrators wore buttons, T-shirts, fliers 
and posters with Diallo's picture and chanted his name.

	Lockerbie Suspects Get Passports  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libya has provided passports to two suspects  
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, a sign their promised handover was 
under way, Arab diplomats said today. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and 
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are to be tried under Scottish law in 
the Netherlands.Diplomatic sources said both men have received 
their passports, which were taken from them by the Libyan 
government following their 1991 indictment by a U.S court. The Dec. 
21, 1988, bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
killed 270 people.

	Radiation Case Reportedly Settled  
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Families of 90 cancer patients who allege  
their relatives were unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored 
radiation experiments have reached a proposed $5 million 
settlement, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported today. The lawsuit 
alleged terminally ill cancer patients who sought treatment at 
Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 and 1971 were given 
full-body and partial-body doses of radiation. The suit named the 
hospital and the federal government among defendants. The 
government was included in the suit because the Defense Department 
paid $651,000 for the test results to learn about the effects of 
radiation exposure.

	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Marking the most solemn ceremony of the  
Catholic calendar, Pope John Paul II led clerics in procession 
through a darkened St. Peter's Basilica today, a candle-lit vigil 
for the coming of Easter. Thousands of faithful lit their own 
candles as he passed, filling the boundless darkness with glints of 
light. John Paul, appearing steadier and stronger than in his 
grueling schedule of Christmas services, is to deliver the address

	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Penny Hardaway scored 20 of his  
game-high 30 points in the second half to lead the Orlando Magic to 
a 92-77 victory against the Detroit Pistons tonight. For the second 
time this season, Chuck Daly's Magic stopped his former team's 
winning streak at six games. The win also gives Orlando a 3-0 sweep 
of the season series. Darrell Armstrong added 16 points and 10 
assists for Orlando.

<HEADLINE> It's Time To Think Earnings Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the Dow 10,000 party is over, investors  
are returning to a more sobering concern: Did companies earn enough 
in the first quarter to justify their stratospheric stock prices? 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few weeks, earnings reports will determine whether  
the Dow can stay near its all-time closing high of 10,006.78 
reached last Monday. Despite the earnings warnings already issued 
by some high-profile companies, many analysts believe the Dow can. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that first-quarter earnings are more likely to boost  
the market than drag it down,'' writes Edward Keon at Prudential 
Securities. ``Most companies probably feel pretty comfortable that 
they will meet or beat forecasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect first-quarter profits for S&AMP;P 500 companies to  
be up between 5 percent and 6 percent from the first quarter of 
1998 after a flat fourth quarter and a drop of 3 percent in the 
third quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer companies have warned of disappointing earnings this  
quarter, compared with the fourth quarter. By this point three 
months ago, 10 of the 30 Dow industrials had issued downbeat 
forecasts; so far this quarter just Coca-Cola and IBM have 
announced their sales would not meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits have improved mostly because the U.S. economy continues  
to grow at a ferocious pace. Last Wednesday, the Commerce 
Department confirmed that the nation's gross domestic product grew 
at a 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income and spending both grew in February, and a Money  
Magazine/ABC News poll showed consumer confidence held up in the 
face of NATO military strikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for optimism is that foreign economies are doing  
less badly, which should benefit U.S.-based global companies. And 
the dollar remains weaker than it was for most of 1998. While that 
can make imports more costly, it boosts the value of U.S. profits 
earned overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the list of first-quarter earnings winners will be  
technology companies, expected to rise 37 percent, said analyst 
Joseph Abbott of I/B/E/S Inc., a provider of corporate earnings 
information based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were hurt first by the Asian crisis and now they're  
recovering first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at big Internet companies like America Online and Yahoo  
will also be higher, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications profits are expected to be up 25 percent as  
companies benefit from Internet business and deregulation of the 
long-distance industry, said Chuck Hill, an analyst at First Call 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at consumer durable goods manufacturers should rise  
about 15 percent from last year, Abbott said. Most of that gain 
will come from auto companies. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, there are obstacles.  
</P>
<P>
	While there are signs of recovery in Asia and at least a  
containment of problems in Latin America, neither region is back on 
its feet yet. ``It wouldn't take much to go into another downward 
spiral again,'' Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict in Yugoslavia could derail economies in Europe,  
such as Germany and Italy, which are important U.S. trading 
partners and already teetering on the edge of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, domestic interest rates are about half a percentage  
point higher than they were at the beginning of the year. They 
could go higher if commodity prices continue to rise, or if the 
U.S. economy continues so strong that the Federal Reserve decides 
to brake it by raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Blots on the first-quarter earnings picture include energy,  
expected to be down 49 percent, and basic materials companies, down 
28 percent. These companies are just now beginning to benefit from 
higher oil and commodity prices, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week, the Dow finally made its first close above  
10,000, but the blue chips gave up ground and ended the week only 
10.27 higher at 9,832.51. On Thursday the Dow was up 46.35; there 
is no trading on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 7.35 Thursday to 1,293.72.  
It was up 10.92 on the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index rose 31.97 to 2,493.37 Thursday,  
giving it a gain of 74.20 for the week. The Russell 2000, 
reflecting the performance of smaller companies, rose 1.11 to 
398.74 Thursday, for a weekly gain of 4.82. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite rose 1.40 Thursday to  
604.99, picking up 2.64 during the week. The American Stock 
Exchange composite gained 1.00 Thursday to 711.30, but fell 7.44 on 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $11.769 trillion, up $110.03 billion from the 
previous week. A year ago the index stood at $10.672 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer's Streak Ended by Dutch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After 12 races in three days, Jenny Thompson  
was worn down by the World Short-Course Swimming Championships' 
tough new schedule, which includes semifinals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In race No. 12, Thompson's winning streak at the championships  
ended Saturday, broken by Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands in the 
50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will have a chance Sunday to add another gold medal to  
the two she already won. She also has a $15,000 bonus for a world 
record in another event she didn't win, because she dropped out 
after breaking the record in the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson swam five races Saturday, and in the fifth de Bruijn  
rallied over the final 25 meters and beat her, 24.35 seconds to 
24.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good about my swim,'' Thompson said. ``Inge deserved  
that. She's good in the 50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In line with a new format being adopted for the Olympics, this  
meet has semifinals for races of 100 meters or less -- meaning all 
of Thompson's events. For races of 200 meters or more, the eight 
fastest from the heats go directly into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In semifinals in the 100-meter butterfly, less than an hour  
before her 50 freestyle final, Thompson was only fourth-fastest at 
59.08. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson, who holds the world record of 56.90, had 24 hours  
to rest before the final. 
</P>
<P>
	American Kurt Grote, the world long-course champion in the 200  
breaststroke, was fastest Friday in the semifinals for the 100 at 
59.77. But in Saturday's final, he finished eighth at 1:00.28, with 
Patrik Isaksson winning at 59.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaksson's gold was Sweden's third of the meet, but Sweden's  
women, world record-holders in the 800 freestyle relay, missed a 
sweep of the freestyle relays when they were disqualified for an 
early takeoff in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes were fastest at 3:36.05, but the gold went to Britain  
at 3:36.88. 
</P>
<P>
	That, plus a gold by world record-holder James Hickman in the  
men's 200 butterfly, gave Britain a total of three golds, the same 
as Japan. Australia leads with five golds. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Sandra Voelker of Germany spoiled Japanese  
Mai Nakamura's attempt for a second gold medal, winning the 50 
backstroke. Voelker's time of 27.63 was slower than her world mark 
of 27.27. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thompson's absence, Slovakia's Martina Moravcova won the  
women's 100 individual medley at 1:00.20, nearly a second slower 
than Thompson's record of 59.30. 
</P>
<P>
	World record holder Jani Sievinen of Finland won the men's 100  
individual medley at 54.18 and Russia's Nadejda Chemezova took the 
women's 400 freestyle at 4:05.23.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Target Is Off-Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As NATO missiles struck downtown Belgrade, the  
Clinton administration declared today that ``no target is 
off-limits'' in the campaign to pressure Serb forces to end their 
campaign of repression in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his weekly radio address, declared the  
Kosovo operation ``a difficult and dangerous one, but it's 
necessary and right, and we must stand with all our NATO allies to 
see it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation cannot do everything. We can't stop all the  
violence. But there are times when looking away simply is not an 
option,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said the U.S. military would pitch in with  
humanitarian relief for what NATO spokesman Jamie Shea today called 
a ``demographic earthquake'' in the Balkans -- with 290,000 refugees 
having left Kosovo in the past 10 days and as many as 300,000 more 
moving toward the border. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force C-17 cargo plane was flying out of Dover Air Force  
Base, Del., this afternoon with 50,000 pounds of packaged meals, 
known as humanitarian daily rations, to feed Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Dover spokesman Tech. Sgt. Don Perrien said the C-17 was headed  
for Ramstein, Germany, headquarters of U.S. Air Force operations in 
Europe. The supplies then will be flown to the Balkans, he said. 
Perrien said that in the next several days Dover will be shipping 
as much as 1.1 million pounds of rations. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official said the attacks in Belgrade ``made  
it clear we are targeting high-value targets, especially those 
assets Mr. Milosevic holds most dear -- his regular army and special 
forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is that no target is off-limits that is involved  
in the repression of Kosovo, including downtown Belgrade,'' 
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move forward in the days to come, we will continue to  
intensify the strikes to make clear to Mr. Milosevic our 
determination to significantly degrade his military capability,'' 
he said, referring to Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	After sea-based cruise missiles set a complex of military  
offices in downtown Belgrade afire early today, Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon declared they hit buildings Milosevic ``uses to 
control the forces responsible for ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buildings house the Yugoslav Interior Ministry and  
headquarters for the Serb police, which U.S. officials say is 
leading the terror campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, interviewed by radio reporters just  
before the new missile strikes, said, ``Milosevic has barely begun 
to incur the damage he will feel to his military and police and the 
security apparatus by which he keeps his dictatorship in power, if 
he continues this activity and if he does not allow these innocent 
families to return to their homes with security and autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians comprised about 90 percent of Kosovo's prewar  
population, and the White House accuses Yugoslavia of trying to 
``depopulate'' the province. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated one-third of Kosovo's 2 million people have been  
driven from their homes. Scores of thousands have been forcibly 
sent to the borders since NATO airstrikes began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House briefing Friday, Julia Taft, assistant  
secretary of state for refugees, population and migration, said at 
least 344,830 ethnic Albanians have fled the province since last 
year. An additional 345,000 have been driven from their homes but 
are still within Kosovo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton saluted NATO's decision to have its forces in Macedonia  
provide support and manpower to independent relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to support them in every way we can,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States has directed $91 million in humanitarian aid  
to the region since last year. Clinton authorized another $50 
million in support this week. He told the Pentagon to airlift food, 
tents and other relief supplies to neighboring countries unable to 
cope with the tide of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, a symbol of  
American military might, entered the western Mediterranean Sea 
today and was heading toward the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav 
coast. Defense officials said it was likely to be ordered to stay 
in the Adriatic to join the NATO battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The air war against Yugoslavia has yet to use carrier-based  
aircraft, although Navy ships have fired Tomahawk cruise missiles 
at Yugoslav targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that if ordered into  
action, the Roosevelt, with 5,500 sailors and 75 aircraft aboard -- 
including 46 strike planes -- ``would bring a large amount of 
firepower to continue with our systematic, day and night attacks 
designed to choke off the Serb military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House signaled that the campaign is likely to continue  
beyond just a few weeks. But no enthusiasm was seen for introducing 
American ground forces to supplement air and sea power, even though 
the president did not explicitly rule that out.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Iowa Assistant Fighting for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- All the way back to his youth, Bob  
Elliott's life has been consumed by football. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched his father coach, he played the game, he became a  
coach himself. Elliott seemed destined to become a head coach, 
possibly of his beloved Iowa Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	All that has changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of rearranging depth charts or tinkering with defensive  
alignments, Elliott will be going into the hospital to battle a 
life-threatening blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the former top assistant at Iowa will begin a  
week-long barrage of chemotherapy and radiation treatments to 
prepare his body for a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I said I wasn't afraid, I'd be lying,'' said Elliott, who  
turns 46 on May 6. ``There's significant risk of dying in a bone 
marrow transplant. To say otherwise is not realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott suffers from a blood disorder called polycythemia vera.  
His bone marrow is hyperactive, producing too many white blood 
cells, too many red cells, too many platelets. 
</P>
<P>
	Left unchecked, the blood disorder could turn into leukemia.  
It's also possible that, with too many platelets, blood clots could 
form and lead to a heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The blood disorder led doctors at University Hospitals to remove  
Elliott's spleen in 1991 because of clotting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since 1991, I've been in that hospital at least once a week  
with those doctors,'' said Elliott, a defensive back at Iowa in the 
early 1970s and a coach at the school for 12 years before stepping 
down late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the very least, the disorder could lead to fibrosis in the  
bones, preventing the bone marrow from making blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean blood transfusions every other day, Elliott  
said, although no one knows if that would be two years down the 
road or 15 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
	So Elliott decided have the bone marrow transplant and believe  
in the odds -- he says they're about 60-40, perhaps even 70-30 -- 
that he'll survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott is determined to return to coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the goal, to be able to coach again,'' he said. ``I  
think I'm a good football coach. I think that's what I was put on 
this earth to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his health, Elliott no longer was a viable candidate  
to take over when Hayden Fry retired in November. Before his health 
worsened, Elliott, the son of former Iowa athletic director Bump 
Elliott, had been at or near the top of the list of possible 
successors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the job went to Kirk Ferentz, another former Fry assistant  
who had spent the last six years as the offensive line coach with 
the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott will undergo seven or eight days of chemotherapy and  
radiation before doctors introduce the new bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, for the following two to three weeks, it will be a waiting  
game as doctors determine if Elliott's system accepts the new 
marrow and begins producing blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, anyway, football won't be so important.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Free Meal Program Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Millions of dollars in federal money meant to  
pay for meals for California's poor children were instead used for 
vacations, clothing, tuition and vehicles, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture found. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Education has been negligent in its  
oversight of the $168 million program that distributes money to 
nonprofit groups, the USDA's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California Department of Education fostered a lax  
environment in which ... sponsors could personally enrich 
themselves through various questionable or fraudulent schemes which 
they could perpetrate with little likelihood of detection,'' the 
report, released last week, found. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA questioned the spending of $5.5 million from 1995 to  
1998. California's program, the largest in the country, reimburses 
day care centers for up to two meals and a snack a day for each 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal charges have been filed against 15 people, including a  
Los Angeles couple accused of using funds to pay for everything 
from a 5,000-square-foot home to ski trips and their children's 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they have instituted changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that sometimes not as much attention was paid to the  
integrity aspects of the program as it was to the nutritional 
health aspects,'' said Kathy Lewis, state deputy superintendent for 
Child, Youth and Family Services.

<HEADLINE> Florida Prepares For More Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM COAST, Fla. (AP) -- The pictures under glass on Bill and  
Lorie Majewski's coffee table record the story of their loss and 
recovery over the last 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost all their worldly possessions on one windy summer  
afternoon when 21 homes in their community were destroyed and 37 
others were damaged by a wildfire, one that turned out to one of 
the first of a series of devastating blazes around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Majewskis are working to rebuild their lives while  
state officials are gearing up for another dangerous spring and 
summer, hoping thunderstorms will come in May and June to end a 
winter drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are preparing for an extended dry period, but hoping for  
some water,'' said Terence McElroy, a spokesman for state 
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford. ``It has been an incredibly 
dry winter and we've had a significant number of wildfires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Division of Forestry's Wildfire Season Forecast predicts  
more wildfires than usual through May. Drought indexes -- which 
range from 0 to 800, with 800 being ``desert level'' -- are about 
650 in southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	And since Feb. 28, more than 900 fires have charred 28,000  
acres. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, one fire blazed through a large area of brush about  
15 miles south-southwest of downtown Miami. The size was not 
immediately determined. ``Most of the area out there is not 
accessible by road and it's rough terrain,'' said Miami-Dade Fire 
Rescue Capt. John Spadaro. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, sparks from the wheels of a train ignited a smoky  
blaze which closed about 10 miles of Interstate 75 in rural 
Charlotte and Lee counties. No one was hurt, and no homes were 
damaged, but the smoke blocked hundreds of motorists for about 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire that destroyed the Majewskis' two-story home last June  
6 was started by hunters on the other side of four-lane Seminole 
Woods Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Majewski and her husband were out with their oldest  
daughter, while her mother stayed at home with the other three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were assured it was under control,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time they learned the fire had jumped the highway and was  
racing through their neighborhood, there was only time to get the 
family out. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was destroyed -- videos they had taken of the children  
as toddlers, photographs, honors the children had won at school, 
even Mrs. Majewski's wedding rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was able to move into a new home on Feb. 10.  
</P>
<P>
	On the coffee table are photographs they retrieved from  
relatives or took since the fire. There is a picture of two of 
their children standing in the driveway of the house before it 
burned. There are photos of its gray ruins. There are pictures of 
the new house under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Majewski still feels like a stranger in the new house.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing here belongs to me. I feel hollow,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, heavy rain caused flooding in northern and central  
Florida during the winter and spring, but then the rain stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time thunderstorms returned in mid-July, fires had raged  
across 500,000 acres around Florida, destroying 126 homes and 
damaging 211 others. At the start of the July 4 weekend, the 42,000 
people living in Flagler County were told to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the state is doing more to prevent fires, McElroy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More controlled burns are being done to reduce the amount of  
fuel before big blazes start up. Fire breaks are being built around 
neighborhoods near forested areas. Firefighting equipment and 
supplies are being positioned around southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Arsonists who are blamed for a third of the fires this spring  
also are being targeted, McElroy said, with a task force set up to 
track down and prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's a possibility of rain next week, said Scott  
Goodrick, a Division of Forestry meteorologist.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored his first goal of  
the season and Walter Zenga made seven saves as the New England 
Revolution shut out Kansas City 1-0 Saturday, extending the 
Wizards' record scoreless streak to 550 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards have been shut out in all three games this season  
and have not scored since Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore scored for the Revolution (1-1) in the 40th minute off a  
cross pass from defender Mike Burns. Johnny Torres had an assist on 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards (0-3) best scoring opportunity came in the 70th  
minute, when player-coach Zenga saved a diving header by Vincente 
Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first win for the Revolution at Arrowhead Stadium in  
five tries.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Bicoastal Bilking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Michael Dean Rockey has been many  
things to many people. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say that in the course of duping vulnerable women out of  
tens of thousands of dollars, he posed as a Cornell University 
psychiatrist, a prospective Irish Republican Army member and a 
British wool-business scion -- just to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey's trail of deception leads from California to New York,  
``and who knows where in between,'' said Robert Weiner, a deputy 
district attorney in this mountain town. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey is supposed to show up in May for trial on charges of  
bilking a woman out of more than $30,000. He's out on bail, and 
Weiner doesn't know where Rockey is. California wants him in May, 
too, for sentencing in another case. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit for Rockey's arrest reads like a cross between a  
bodice-ripper romance tale and a cheap crime novel: Stranger comes 
to town, seduces women and makes off with their money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be his chosen profession,'' Weiner said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Glenwood Springs trial will focus on the charges involving  
Sonya Doyal, a bail bondsman who is married with two children. But 
the affidavit lists several others -- mostly women -- whom the 
47-year-old Rockey also has allegedly conned out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a way with women and he's got a way with the talk,''  
Doyal said of Rockey, a tall, bulky man with a perpetually ruddy 
complexion. 
</P>
<P>
	The tools of his trade, according to the affidavit, include a  
British accent, a list of aliases including Mikal Dhalgren, Michael 
Finnegan and Michael Beckett, and a story about a wife, Kathleen, 
who died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge, Kathleen never existed,'' said John White, a  
Colorado Springs private investigator who looked into Rockey's 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a ploy to get in close,'' White said. ``He gets in  
close, takes them for as much money as he can and just 
disappears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey's public defender, Peter Rachesky, declined to discuss  
the Doyal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyal said she met Rockey in 1992, when she was a jailer in  
Glenwood Springs and he was held on felony theft and impersonation 
charges. They exchanged letters during his two years in state 
prison for those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't hear from Rockey for a year after his release, but in  
November 1995 he wrote from California with news: He loved her, he 
was terminally ill, he had become a Christian and he wanted to go 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	They arranged to meet, but first he needed a $2,200 loan, he  
said. Doyal sent him a cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
	That launched a relationship marked by rare meetings at hotels,  
motels, even a highway exit -- and a sheaf of receipts from the 
Western Union office where Doyal wired Rockey money. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey was always on the verge of coming into money, Doyal said,  
but he always needed some to tide him over -- legal fees, traveling 
money, cash to carry him until his book deal came through. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was supposed to be about how Rockey grew marijuana in  
California to pay for his wife's cancer treatment -- a story several 
alleged victims said he used, and one Doyal found convincing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see him, I could feel him picking his wife up in the  
hospital, just a bag of bones, and her dying of cancer,'' she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyal said she lost friends because she refused to heed their  
warnings that she was being duped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to believe so much that this guy had changed,'' Doyal  
said. ``He would tell me in letter after letter, `I'm going to live 
in the light, I'm going to be a good person.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Doyal said she had had major surgery and was having  
marriage problems when she met Rockey, so she was depressed and 
insecure -- a pattern Weiner said was common to many of his alleged 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with situations in which people are vulnerable,  
caring and trusting and trying to help their fellow man,'' Weiner 
said. ``That is turned around and they become victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those victims the affidavit lists a multiple sclerosis  
patient, the son of the owners of an Ithaca, N.Y., motel where 
Rockey stayed in 1992. He allegedly gave Rockey $400 to buy special 
computer equipment after Rockey told him he was a computer company 
executive and could get a discount. 
</P>
<P>
	Another alleged victim is Lori Pinello, a Colorado Springs woman  
who said she loaned him $9,500. After Rockey skipped town, Pinello 
began investigating and called Doyal, whose name he had mentioned. 
Their revelations prompted Doyal's decision to go to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He found a good victim -- he thought,'' Doyal said. ``But I'm  
saying: You're not going to do this to me, and you're not going to 
do it to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey is charged with three felony theft counts, and faces up  
to 96 years in prison because of prior convictions in Colorado, 
Nevada and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockey was out on $25,000 bail, but that was raised to $250,000  
on March 24. A warrant was issued for his arrest until he posts the 
larger amount, a bid to put him behind bars in Colorado before 
California sentences him in May on a felony conviction involving a 
rental car that wasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of who gets him first,'' Weiner said.

<HEADLINE> 'Apocalyptic' Books Now Big Sellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The approach of the year 2000 may be a  
devil of a problem for computer programmers, but it's heavenly for 
the $3 billion Christian book market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores specializing in Christian products have seen a big  
increase in sales of books about endtime prophecies and the Y2K 
computer bug as believers become more focused on what might happen 
when the calendar turns to Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the books examine current world events in a biblical  
context and conclude the time is ripe for the return of Jesus 
Christ. Others offer dire, Bible-based predictions of what may 
occur if computers fail worldwide because of the highly publicized 
year 2000 glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the books are novels; others are classified as  
nonfiction. All are selling like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nationwide trend,'' said Chris Rogers, merchandising  
vice president of Lifeway Christian Resources, a Nashville, Tenn., 
company with 81 Baptist bookstores in 20 states. ``No doubt about 
it, it's going to build.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a Christian, Liz Dyson loves reading about what the future  
may bring. As the owner of Lemstone Books in suburban Birmingham, 
she likes the surging sales of endtime books, which are second only 
to Bibles in volume at her mall store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows what's going to happen, really, and you see so  
much happening that was prophesied,'' said Mrs. Dyson. ``You see 
weather patterns changing, and nation against nation. People are 
wondering how much longer it can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Stone has noticed a tremendous increase in sales of  
endtime books in recent months at Faith Book Store where she works 
in Gardendale, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we get them in, they're gone,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Book stores trace much of the interest in the endtime genre to  
fear over the computer problem known as Y2K. Books such as the 
popular ``Millennium Meltdown'' discuss what could happen if 
computers programmed to read years by two digits only, confuse the 
``00'' in 2000 with 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the Christian Booksellers  
Association, said three of the top seven books on the group's 
nonfiction best seller list deal directly with Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Also driving up sales are the Christian novels known as the  
``Left Behind'' series. The books by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, 
along with a related children's series and audio books, have sold 
3.2 million copies since 1995. The fifth book in the series, 
``Apollyon,'' debuted recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The books, written like action novels with plenty of references  
to Bible verses, describe what will happen in the years following 
an event known as ``The Rapture,'' when many Christians believe the 
faithful will be taken to heaven in an instant before chaos 
envelops the world. Some claim the Y2K bug may be a precursor of 
those tumultuous times. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as she enjoys perusing the endtime section of her  
Christian book store, Mrs. Dyson isn't staying up nights fretting 
over the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about it,'' she said, ``because I know God's  
going to take care of me.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Leads Solemn Easter Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Marking the most solemn ceremony of the  
Catholic calendar, Pope John Paul II led clerics in procession 
through a darkened St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, a candle-lit 
vigil for the coming of Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light of Christ,'' a deacon intoned, in Latin, and John Paul  
bore a single 4-foot-tall candle through the pitch-black basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of faithful lit their own candles as he passed,  
filling the boundless darkness with glints of light. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike past years, John Paul's homily for the vigil leading up  
to Easter Sunday was strictly religious, making no mention of the 
war over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The only hint of the Balkan bloodshed was symbolic, in the  
selection of faithful from many nations for baptism in the ceremony 
-- this year, including one from Albania, as well as Cape Verde, 
China, France, Morocco and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has made numerous appeals for negotiations to end  
the crisis in Kosovo, John Paul has been publicly silent on the 
conflict over Easter weekend, instead stressing divine love as the 
hope of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Good Friday, the pope scrapped a prepared text that referred  
to Kosovo and deplored the triumph of ``the culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's ANSA news service suggested the pontiff might use his  
traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' address -- literally, ``To the City and 
to the World'' -- to ask on Sunday for opening of a humanitarian aid 
corridor in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, appearing steadier and stronger than in his grueling  
schedule of Christmas services, is to deliver the address and 
celebrate Easter Mass on Sunday morning in St. Peter's.

<HEADLINE> Twin Boys Held in Father's Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Eleven-year-old twin brothers were spending  
the weekend in separate juvenile detention centers after being 
charged with killing their father and wounding their mother and 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were trying to learn what set off the  
twins. Authorities say quit their shooting rampage after emptying a 
.32 caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the spark was,'' Vance County Sheriff  
Thomas Breedlove said. ``There had to be one, but we're still 
looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Harvey Bawcum Jr., 46, was gunned down Thursday night  
while rushing up a flight of steps to a bedroom where his wife had 
been shot in their home in Kittrell, about 35 miles north of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Bawcum, 45, was in good condition Saturday at Duke  
University Medical Center in Durham, where she recovered from a 
bullet wound to the right arm. Robin Bawcum, 16, was in fair 
condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins, whose names were not released, were each charged  
Friday with murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	They are too young to be tried as adults. If found to be  
delinquent, they could be held until they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's investigators said they had no record of calls to  
intervene in domestic troubles at the Bawcum home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors described what appeared to be a stable country family.  
</P>
<P>
	The principal at Zeb Vance Elementary, where the boys were in  
the fifth grade, said the brothers were close, but not inseparable. 
Their worst offense recently was not turning in their homework a 
couple of weeks ago, said principal David Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing in the classroom or in school overall that  
indicated to us that this could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were assigned guardians to act as their advocates.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the guardians, Harvey Johnson, said he talked to the  
boys, but would say little about his conversations other than that 
the shooting wasn't planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically they're fine,'' he said. ``Mentally . . . that will  
come out later.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Second Offer Made for Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott has a second offer for her  
controlling shares in the Cincinnati Reds, according to published 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	And Schott's limited partners appear to be willing to exercise  
their option to acquire her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Post, citing  
unidentified sources, reported Saturday that the limited partners, 
led by financier Carl Lindner, have offered to match Cleveland 
lawyer Larry Dolan's $65 million offer for most of her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also reported that Steve Schott, a cousin of Marge Schott's  
late husband, heads a group that has made a rival offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Schott's home was not answered.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati auto dealer has controlled the Reds since  
December 1984, when she paid an estimated $25 million for her 
shares. She agreed in November to seek a buyer for her controlling 
interest rather than face another suspension from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000, at  
which time the limited partners can oust Schott if she hasn't 
already sold control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 shares in the team, including the two that  
make her the managing partner. The limited partners own the other 
8 1/2 shares.

<HEADLINE> 9 Illegal Immigrants Dead in Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPINE, Calif. (AP) -- They set out from Mexico three or four  
days ago, hiking north into rugged, unfamiliar mountains, some 
dressed only for mild, spring weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the final stretch of their trek, disaster struck: A  
surprise snowstorm brought frigid temperatures, leaving at least 
nine dead, seven in the United States and two in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers with dogs and helicopters rescued more than 130 others  
on both sides of the border Friday, including some who wore only 
jeans, T-shirts and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials blamed immigrant smugglers who callously lead  
their ill-prepared clients into dangerous terrain and then abandon 
them when trouble strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say Operation Gatekeeper, the U.S. effort to shut  
down illegal immigration in the urban and suburban part of San 
Diego County, shares a major part of the blame by forcing 
border-crossers into more remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Operation Gatekeeper has maximized the risks,'' said Claudia  
Smith, a spokeswoman for the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, a migrants' rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescued migrants, whose journey was halted about 40 miles  
east of San Diego, were hospitalized and treated for hypothermia or 
exposure. They were then taken into U.S. Border Patrol custody for 
eventual return to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors, two young sisters between the ages of 5 and  
7 were in good condition late Friday, and authorities re-united 
them with an uncle who was part of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 140 illegal immigrants died last year crossing from  
Mexico into California's San Diego and Imperial counties, said Bill 
Strassberger of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. About 
20 died this year before Friday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow were already on the ground in the  
Cleveland National Forest when another storm brought flurries 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities first learned about the stranded travelers when a  
woman, freezing from the cold, sought aid from a rancher near 
Alpine late Thursday. She told him that her husband and friend were 
lost in the storm, Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rancher called Border Patrol agents, who found the body of  
the friend and later the husband, he said. Investigators then found 
a group of seven immigrants, triggering a full-scale rescue 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. rescuers found more than 50 people by late Friday and were  
trying to locate others reported missing by the migrants. Mexican 
authorities found two people dead near Tecate and 80 people 
stranded, Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol supervisor Roy Villareal said several of the  
survivors told authorities they had arranged for smugglers to take 
them across the border, but were abandoned them when the weather 
got bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get a ride to the border; a smuggler leads them through  
the mountains, where another smuggler picks them up and takes them 
to a safe house,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mexican national typically pays a smuggler $1,000 to $3,500.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, when the federal government tripled patrols along  
the San Diego border as part of Operation Gatekeeper, migration has 
moved to more dangerous routes in the mountains and desert east of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego agents arrest as many as 500 illegal immigrants a day,  
mainly in the mountains, Villareal said. The Border Patrol 
estimates that hundreds of thousands cross each year without 
getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol has asked Mexican officials to warn people  
against making the trip, especially in bad weather. An El Nino 
storm last April left three migrants dead and a surprise snow storm 
in February 1997 claimed seven lives, Strassberger said.

<HEADLINE> Twister Hits Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- A tornado flattened homes Saturday and  
injured an undetermined number of people trapped inside, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the injuries wasn't immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	The twister struck about 4 p.m. in a rural residential area just  
north of Shreveport in northwestern Lousiana, said Jeff Broome, a 
spokesman for the Bossier Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers were still assessing the injuries of some people  
two hours later before sending them to local hospitals, Broome 
said. Buses took residents whose homes were destroyed to a shelter 
in Bossier City. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also took off the roof of an apartment building in the  
nearby town of Blanchard, possibly injuring some tenants, according 
to a report on KSLA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The television station also reported that a tornado destroyed  
the First United Methodist Church in Logansport, a town southwest 
of Shreveport near the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	Benton resident Mary Maxwell said the tornado destroyed between  
15 and 20 homes but didn't do any damage to her house. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents had to use an ax to break through the wreckage of one  
trailer to extricate a family of five, she said.

<HEADLINE> 'Baywatch' Moving to Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Aloha, ``Baywatch.''  
</P>
<P>
	A labor dispute that nearly saw the long-running television show  
about buff and busty lifeguards pack up and leave America for 
Australia has been resolved. The show will now be based in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a blast,'' cast member Brooke Burns said  
Friday on Waikiki Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine years in Los Angeles, the show's creators were  
planning to move production to Queensland, Australia, because of 
increasing costs and declining ratings. But Hawaii officials 
stepped in, making a pitch to bring the show to Honolulu and 
Haleiwa on Oahu's North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive producer Gregg Bonann said he preferred to keep the  
show in the United States if he could afford it, and the deal 
seemed ready to go -- until a local Teamsters official refused to 
agree to a wage reduction for Hawaii's movie and television 
industry drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal seemed dead, and Bonann announced he was off to  
Australia to make ``Baywatch Down Under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Gov. Ben Cayetano stepped in, offering Leo Reed of the  
Teamsters Local another $200,000 for wages from the state and 
improved working conditions for drivers. Production is expected to 
pump $20 million annually into Hawaii's stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program will give us exposure that we couldn't possibly  
afford,'' Cayetano said. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Baywatch Hawaii'' begins airing in September, it will  
mark the return of the state to the little screen -- for the first 
time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 12-year run of ``Hawaii Five-0'' and eight-year run of  
``Magnum PI,'' Hawaii hasn't had a successful weekly series since 
``Jake and the Fatman'' left the islands in 1992 after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've celebrated a California culture and lifestyle for nine  
years and now we get to celebrate Hawaiian culture,'' Bonann said.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Reform Uncertain This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republicans in Congress  
have pledged to forge ahead in their quest to overhaul Medicare 
this year. But they favor very different fixes. 
</P>
<P>
	And politics is threatening to widen the gap, raising the  
question of whether anything substantial will get done. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough time for compromise,'' said Marilyn Moon, a  
health policy expert who also serves as one of Medicare's trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the trustees reported that the strong economy has  
helped improve Medicare's finances, giving lawmakers an 
unanticipated seven years more breathing room before the health 
insurance program for the elderly and disabled runs short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton and Republican leaders rushed to say that's no  
reason to be complacent, the pressure to resolve their differences 
this year has obviously eased. 
</P>
<P>
	One key disagreement: whether Medicare should be promised more  
money from the wave of expected coming budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to do that, in a roundabout way, by using $700  
billion over the next 15 years to pay down the national debt. That 
would make it more likely the government can continue to run large 
surpluses -- money Clinton would earmark for Medicare's use after 
baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, however, have so far declined to endorse  
Clinton's idea. Many GOP lawmakers instead support substantial 
income tax cuts, which could make it difficult to find any extra 
money for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	And Republicans insist on cost-control changes before they'll  
even consider devoting more money to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding money first ``takes us down a very, very slippery path,''  
and avoids ``the structural changes that are going to be needed,'' 
said Sen. John Chaffee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he will soon present a complete Medicare overhaul  
plan to Congress -- including changes to ``modernize'' the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is considering ways to give Medicare some of the  
tools that private health plans already use to negotiate good 
prices, according to White House advisers. Those might include the 
ability to competitively bid out exclusive contracts for medical 
products or services. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's doubtful whether Clinton's proposal will gain GOP  
support. Already, Medicare is living up to its reputation as a 
magnet for political attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberal Democrats are accusing Republicans of wanting to cut  
taxes rather than take care of the nation's elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just quite unbelievable that we're at peak economic  
performance and here we are being told that we can't afford to 
provide humane and dignified health care for senior citizens,'' 
said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, for their part, note that the two changes Clinton  
has already proposed would cost money, not save it: Adding a 
prescription drug benefit, and letting some people as young as 55, 
who have trouble getting private insurance, buy Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Clinton has criticized a dramatic restructuring  
plan supported by Republicans -- and two moderate Democrats -- on an 
advisory commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel didn't formally recommend the plan because of  
objections from liberal members -- including Clinton appointees. 
Still, a recently approved GOP budget blueprint directs a Senate 
committee to consider it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, Medicare would no longer pay  
government-controlled prices for people's medical bills or health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, private insurance companies would bid competitively to  
provide Medicare benefits. Their bids would determine the amount of 
a government subsidy to elderly and disabled Americans to help them 
buy their own insurance coverage, choosing among 
government-approved plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Such market competition might work more efficiently to save  
money than the piecemeal fixes of the recent past, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and other Democrats fear that relying too heavily on  
the private sector could result in more expensive or lower quality 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer complexity of predicting the results of changes to  
Medicare -- combined with its political sensitivity -- may argue for 
an incremental approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Many elderly Americans and health care providers are still  
struggling to cope with the unexpected consequences -- including HMO 
closings -- of Medicare changes made in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that the only way you're going to get change over  
time is to do it very slowly, and experiment with things,'' Moon 
says.

<HEADLINE> Search Continues for Atheist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- FBI agents began searching a Texas ranch in  
an apparent attempt to locate the bodies of missing atheist leader 
Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair vanished from San Antonio in 1995 with her son,  
granddaughter and $500,000 in gold coins. Her 1963 Supreme Court 
case led to the ban on organized prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranch owner Joanne Friend said Friday she was startled when FBI  
agents knocked on her door and announced they had a warrant to 
search for the three bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they were looking for bodies,'' she told the Fort  
Worth Star-Telegram. ``They said they suspected they were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI confirmed that a search warrant was executed but refused  
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're acknowledging that a search warrant was executed, but  
we're not acknowledging why we're doing it or whether there was any 
digging or whether it's related to the O'Hair investigation,'' said 
agent Mike Appleby. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch is located near the town of Camp Wood, about 100 miles  
west of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger told the  
Star-Telegram: ``We are assisting the FBI, searching for evidence 
related to Madalyn Murray O'Hair at an undisclosed location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, David R. Waters, 52, the former office manager for  
Mrs. O'Hair, and Gary P. Karr, 50, were arrested on weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters has denied involvement in the O'Hairs' disappearance, and  
neither man has been charged in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News reported last Saturday that  
evidence puts Karr and Waters in San Antonio about the same time in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Waters told the Express-News that he has been told  
by a federal prosecutor that Waters has been implicated in Mrs. 
O'Hair's slaying.

<HEADLINE> Crew 3, Mutiny 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Brian McBride headed home a corner kick from  
Robert Warzycha in the 83rd minute to lift the Columbus Crew past 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny 3-2 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern John and Todd Yeagley also scored as the Crew bounced back  
after being shut out 1-0 by New York-New Jersey in last week's 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ralston and Musa Shannon had the Tampa Bay goals.  
</P>
<P>
	Shannon, a second half substitution, tied the game at 2 in the  
65th minute when he raced past the defense after taking a pass from 
Paul Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay goalkeeper Andy Kirk, making his first start, kept the  
match close early by stopping two chances by John from close range. 
Kirk was filling in for Scott Garlick, who sat out the contest 
after being ejected in the Mutiny's opening 5-2 loss to D.C. 
United. 
</P>
<P>
	John put the Crew in front 2-1 three minutes before halftime,  
using a spin move on defender Jan Eriksson and putting a 
left-footed shot past Kirk from about 10 yards out. The Trinidad 
native has four goals in five games against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeagley scored in the 16th minute to give the Crew a 1-0  
advantage. Ralston tied it in the 29th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's Jefferson Gottardi left the match in the 61st minute  
after being cut above the eye when he collided with the Crew's 
Ansil Elcock.

<HEADLINE> 'Stunt Man' Starting for Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The self-proclaimed stunt man is going to have a  
starring role. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenny Harris, who prefers the term ``stunt man'' over ``utility  
player,'' will start in right field Sunday night when the Colorado 
Rockies open the season against the San Diego Padres at Monterrey, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The opportunity stems from an injury to four-time Gold Glove  
winner and reigning NL batting champion Larry Walker, recovering 
from a strained rib muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy, shocked,'' Harris said Saturday. ``It's been a long  
time. I can't even remember the last time I started on opening day. 
I started with the Dodgers in 1990 or '91 at third base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has a history of injuries, Walker has been in  
Colorado's opening-day lineup for the past four seasons. He swung a 
bat underwater Saturday in his first activity since injuring the 
rib muscle Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic about tomorrow still,'' he said. ``Who knows? I  
might pull the ace out of the hole and walk up there 10 minutes 
before the game and tell them I want to play. Stupider things have 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, said he is frustrated by his expanding reputation as  
an injury magnet. He has played in more than 150 games just once in 
nine major league seasons -- a subject that came up while 
negotiating a $75 million, six-year contract extension last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just signed this big contract and there's a lot of  
nay-sayers out there, a lot of people disputing how he's injured 
all the time, and here I am again injured, so it really (ticks) me 
off,'' Walker said. ``I want to get out there and prove people 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's slowly improving health has prevented the Rockies from  
placing him on the 15-day disabled list. The subject was a touchy 
one for manager Jim Leyland as he prepared to start the season 
without one of baseball's best all-around players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about the DL. We're going to use these  
three days and re-evaluate him Tuesday,'' Leyland said. ``I'm not 
going to start crossing bridges before I get there. We'll have plan 
B, C, D, E and F if we have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though his credentials fall short of Walker's, Harris has played  
every position but catcher, and he showed Saturday that he is a 
capable alternative. He homered, singled and drove in two runs in 
Colorado's 10-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lose my name. It's the stunt man work that I  
do, so I'm just picking up the MVP player for us,'' Harris said. 
``Hopefully he can get back on target and get this team going.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Fans Root for Castilla  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- Opening day will be more like Vinny  
Castilla day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the trailblazing and defending NL champion San Diego  
Padres are the ``home'' team for Sunday night's game against the 
Colorado Rockies, Castilla can expect a hero's welcome when big 
league baseball returns to Mexico for what's being billed as the 
International Opener. 
</P>
<P>
	And the pressure will be on, because everyone in this  
baseball-mad industrial city wants to see the Rockies slugger hit 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Castilla has brought a lot of Mexicans into baseball,'' Carlos  
Chavez, 30, said Saturday while waiting in line for an attraction 
at the Baseball Festival at a park next to 26,000-seat Estadio 
Monterrey. ``He's the star here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is he ever, especially with the kids.  
</P>
<P>
	Alan Antonio Gonzales, 9, said he's a Rockies fan ``because of  
Vinny Castilla. He hits a lot of home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Leaguer was asked how many he'd like to see Castilla  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	His father prompted him, saying: ``Well, he goes up to bat four  
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``About four,'' Gonzales replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Arturo Garza Nava, 8, predicted ``about three or four'' homers  
for the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he knows about Castilla, the youngster said:  
``That he is very home-running, that he is from here in Mexico and 
nothing else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enough said.  
</P>
<P>
	In August 1996, Fernando Valenzuela provided Monterrey fans with  
a memorable evening when he started and won the first 
regular-season big league game in Mexico, a 15-10 Padres victory 
over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans hung on Valenzuela's every move, crowding the bullpen rails  
to watch him warm up and chanting ``Toro, Toro, Toro'' -- his 
nickname, Bull, in Spanish -- over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's Castilla who's the national hero.  
</P>
<P>
	Born in the southern state of Oaxaca, he is the greatest power  
hitter Mexico has produced. He's coming off a career year that saw 
him hit 46 homers, pushing his career total to 170, and drive in 
144 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big day for me, a huge day for me,'' Castilla  
said just before the Rockies broke camp in Arizona. ``To be a part 
of this game, I'm very excited especially because I'm going to play 
in my country. I just can't wait to get down there and do some 
damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ought to love the bandbox Estadio Monterrey, which plays  
shorter than its listed dimensions of 325 feet down the lines and 
400 feet to center field. In three games in 1996, the Padres hit 
eight homers and the Mets one. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were two memorable shots by Ken Caminiti in the  
series finale that helped propel him toward unanimous selection as 
NL MVP. Weakened by the brutal heat and food poisoning, Caminiti 
required two liters of IV fluid before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla hit six homers in 12 games against San Diego last year,  
including one off Sunday's starter, Andy Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla said there's a chance he'll be too pumped up Sunday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just play the way I play. I know there will be a lot of  
people cheering for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado manager Jim Leyland, who makes his Rockies debut, has  
stressed to his team that this one counts. But he also wants 
Castilla and Roberto Ramirez, a former Padres pitcher who's also 
from Mexico, to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take anything away from Vinny or Roberto,''  
Leyland said. ``This is kind of their day, and I think that's the 
way we should approach it. But I want to be sure Vinny is kind of 
zeroed in, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the teams will fly to San Diego where they'll  
finish the series with games Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Castilla said he'll wear No. 14 instead of his usual No. 9  
for the game in tribute to former teammate Andres Galarraga, who 
will miss this season while undergoing treatment back cancer. ``Cat 
says he feels good and says he will be back next year,'' Castilla 
said. ``He is upbeat, and I want to let him know we are thinking 
about him. This is my way to show him support.'' ... Tony Gwynn 
begins the season 72 hits shy of 3,000. ... In Ashby's last 
appearance that counted, he was shelled in Game 2 of the World 
Series at Yankee Stadium. ... Colorado will start Darryl Kile, who 
was 13-17 last year. ... The game was a quick sellout, and scalpers 
were asking the equivalent of $150 for box seat tickets that had a 
face value of about $30. ... The Rockies won't need to pack parkas. 
Their exhibition game against Boston on Friday in Denver was snowed 
out, but it's hot and humid in Monterrey. It was 86 degrees on 
Saturday, with a high of 75 forecast for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iverson, 76ers Coach Trade Barbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Star guard Allen Iverson and Philadelphia  
76ers coach Larry Brown have had a rocky relationship since Brown's 
arrival nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension flared again Friday night when Iverson sat out the  
final three quarters in an 85-80 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's official explanation: Iverson had a ``mild sprain''  
of his already severely bruised right quadriceps. But there was 
clearly more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was benched for the opening 2 minutes, 3 seconds, of the  
second quarter after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. When Brown 
told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson muttered, ``It's 
about ... time you put me back in,'' or something like that, the 
Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pulled him out again, and Iverson sat the rest of the  
game. Iverson didn't even participate in halftime warmups or sit on 
the bench until the third quarter was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said he was not going to play at Toronto Sunday and was  
doubtful for Tuesday's home game against Milwaukee because of his 
thigh, injured March 19 against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't gotten any better,'' he said. ``I've never had  
anything like this before. Ever. ... It feels the same as when I 
first did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning Iverson by name, Brown, at a postgame press  
conference, questioned whether his players were making winning 
their primary focus. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute raised old questions about Iverson's compatibility  
with his coach. A year ago, Brown urged Iverson to become more of a 
playmaker instead of a shooter, publicly criticizing Iverson's 
running of the team, his defense and his off-the-court lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson responded by vowing he would ``remember everything come  
contract time'' -- although in January he signed a six-year, $70.9 
million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson sought to downplay Friday's quarrel.  
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no problems,'' he said after the game.  
``Everything ain't going to be peaches and cream all the time. But 
I don't have any problems with him.''

	Serbs Fire at NATO Troops in Bosnia  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- NATO-led troops came under  
fire today while destroying the Bosnian portion of a key rail link 
between Serbia and Montenegro. The commander of the NATO-led forces 
in Bosnia, U.S. Gen. Montgomery Meigs, said the stabilization 
force, known as SFOR, fired back and that his forces suffered no 
casualties. Bosnian Serb television claimed the SFOR soldiers 
killed a railway guard. The television showed what appeared to be a 
body lying in the grass and a witness saying SFOR soldiers attacked 
the guard and that he did not resist. The Bosnian Serb claim could 
not be independently confirmed.

	NATO Destroys Bridge in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO air strikes today destroyed a  
second bridge over the Danube at Novi Sad, local media reports 
said. Serbian television reported some cars may have been on the 
bridge hit today in Serbia's second-largest city. The independent 
Beta news agency said seven people were injured, some seriously. 
Another independent agency, FoNet, reported that the attack left 
Novi Sad without water. NATO said earlier today that its forces had 
demolished a highway bridge farther downstream, cutting a major 
road link between Belgrade and Hungary.

	Macedonia May Stop Taking Refugees

<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Macedonia announced today it won't  
accept any more refugees unless they can go on to other European 
countries. With an estimated 65,000 Kosovo Albanians jammed at its 
border and more coming, lack of toilets and running water have 
overwhelmed efforts by relief agencies to help. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said that as many as 300,000 more refugees were believed 
to be en route to Kosovo's borders.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Families of 90 cancer patients who allege  
their relatives were unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored 
radiation experiments have reached a proposed $5 million 
settlement, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported today. The lawsuit, 
filed five years ago, alleged terminally ill cancer patients who 
sought treatment at Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 and 
1971 were given full-body and partial-body doses of radiation so 
researchers could measure the effects. Terms of the settlement also 
include an apology from the government and a memorial plaque to be 
placed on the University of Cincinnati campus listing the patients' 
names.

	'Melissa' Suspect To Plead Innocent

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of creating the so-called  
Melissa virus, which infected thousands of computers and overloaded 
e-mail systems worldwide, never intended to do anything wrong, his 
lawyer said today. David L. Smith, a 30-year-old computer 
programmer, will plead innocent to the state charges, lawyer Steven 
Altman said. Smith faces charges that include interruption of 
public communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service -- 
charges that carry a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a 
$480,000 fine.

	Pope Leads Solemn Easter Vigil

	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Marking the most solemn ceremony of the  
Catholic calendar, Pope John Paul II led clerics in procession 
through a darkened St. Peter's Basilica today, a candle-lit vigil 
for the coming of Easter. Thousands of faithful lit their own 
candles as he passed, filling the boundless darkness with glints of 
light. Unlike past years, John Paul's homily for the vigil leading 
up to Easter Sunday was strictly religious, making no mention of 
the war over Kosovo.

	Russian Official Sees Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia could attain a 2.5 percent budget surplus  
by 2000 if the country's relations with the International Monetary 
Fund continue to improve, a news agency reported today. The 
government hopes the IMF will give it a steady supply of loans over 
the next several years to pay off old debts and revive its economy. 
But given that Russia's economy is in deep recession and faces 
chronically bad tax collection and massive debts, such a growth 
forecast seems unlikely to be reached.

even worse today, beating the Heat 88-77. Gill had a triple-double

Duval lurking near the top once again. Duval, who hoped to use this 
tournament as a relaxing warm-up for the Masters, will have to 
change his focus now that another victory is in sight, the product 
of a third straight sub-70 round.

<HEADLINE> Fire 4, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ante Razov and Peter Nowak each  
scored two goals as the Chicago Fire continued its offensive 
explosion by beating the Miami Fusion 4-1 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov, Major League Soccer's leading scorer with six goals, put  
the Fire ahead 1-0 in the game's second minute and Chicago peppered 
a weak Miami defense for three more goals in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago now leads the league with 10 goals this season. Carlos  
Valderrama scored the Fusion's lone goal, coming in the 69th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight week, Miami gave up a goal almost from  
the opening whistle because of a failed clearance deep inside its 
own territory. John Maessner's weak attempt instead wound up at the 
feet of Razov, who drilled a 16-yard shot that eluded goalkeeper 
Dusty Hudock. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov used another failed clearance to score his second goal in  
the 54th minute. This time, it was Leo Cullen who committed the 
turnover before Razov struck a left-footed shot from 18 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak increased Chicago's lead to 3-0 in the 59th minute on a  
feed from Lubos Kubik, who dribbled deep into the Fusion end and 
found an open Nowak. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama drew the Fusion within 3-1, but Nowak answered with  
his second goal on a give-and-go from C.J. Brown at the 77th 
minute.

<HEADLINE>  Duke's Brand Named Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Duke's Elton Brand collected another player  
of the year honor Friday, winning the John R. Wooden Award as 
college basketball's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore center who led the Blue Devils to the NCAA  
tournament title game had already been honored by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club, the United States Basketball 
Writers Association and the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name will go down in history with these individual  
accolades, but if you could win with your team, it's so special,'' 
he said after accepting the trophy at the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand received 4,312 points in a nationwide vote of  
sportscasters and sportswriters. He finished 696 points ahead of 
Andre Miller of Utah, who had 3,616 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak was third with 3,108 points,  
followed by Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State (2,964) and Richard 
Hamilton (2,865), whose Connecticut team defeated Brand and Duke 
77-74 in Monday night's NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to sleep that night because we were so close. I  
ran about a thousand plays through my head that I could have done 
to help win the game,'' Brand said. ``Then when I did sleep the 
next day I was dreaming of winning it. That's going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton admitted he's still living the dream of winning the  
NCAA title, and wasn't disappointed to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take a national championship over anything,'' he said.  
``You can always win an MVP trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand became the only sophomore winner in the Wooden Award's  
23-year history. He's the third consecutive ACC player to win, 
joining last year's honoree Antawn Jamison of North Carolina and 
Wake Forest's Tim Duncan in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the Blue Devils,  
who finished 37-2, including a perfect record in ACC play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said he has no timetable for a decision on whether he'll  
stay in college or enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in any rush,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wooden described Brand as ``a very nice young man'' who should  
stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes pro, the only thing that would be beneficial about  
it is money, and that'll all get away in time,'' said Wooden, who 
coached UCLA to 10 national championships. ``He'd be sacrificing 
two of the most wonderful years of his life with people his own 
age. Almost any youngster would be better to finish school.''

<HEADLINE> San Fran Court Going to the Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Does your neighbor's dog howl at the moon  
until 2 a.m.? Did the pit bull next door eat your hamster? Is 
little Fifi sneaking into your yard and leaving unwanted mementos? 
</P>
<P>
	Justice goes to the dogs in San Francisco, thanks to William  
Herndon, a police sergeant who also is a judge, presiding for the 
past five years over Dog Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon loves dogs -- he has two, an Australian shepherd named  
Bart and a mixed breed he calls Lisa -- and wants to protect owners' 
rights to their animals, as long as the city's human population 
isn't in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important job. I take it real seriously,'' he  
said. ``I want to do right for the people, for the dogs and make it 
safe for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon's charter is a section of the city's health code. Owners  
can ask to have the case transferred to Superior Court, although it 
doesn't happen often. 
</P>
<P>
	The people on both sides of the issue show up, tell their  
stories, and present witnesses if necessary. Occasionally an 
attorney shows up, but generally these sessions are informal and 
casual. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon can send both sides home to work out their difficulties  
or can have the dog euthanized (that happens about 20 percent of 
the time). In about half of the cases, he orders the dog leashed or 
muzzled in public, or sends it to a canine behavior expert -- a dog 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, 45, heard three cases on a recent Thursday, the only  
day his court is in regular session. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two were fairly routine, both involving unleashed dogs  
biting other dogs. Herndon said he would make a ruling at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	The third case was more serious, involving pit bulls Buggsy and  
Cookie who were owned by Sergio Guevara. Neighbor Curtis Norman 
alleges that when he tried to shoo the dogs out of his yard, Buggsy 
bit him on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Norman seems willing to forgive and forget if Guevara  
fixes the fence between their yards, Norman's wife, Arlene, isn't 
as accepting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be attacked,'' she said with a scowl,  
mentioning visiting grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon told Guevara to take his dogs to the Department of  
Animal Care and Control for examination by a behaviorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Buggsy bit the behaviorist. The injury wasn't severe, but that  
was it for Buggsy; a destruction order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had that happen before,'' Herndon said of the  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Cookie, who didn't join the attack, was still to be  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cases end up much as they might in some instances of  
disturbing human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the case of a Jack Russell terrier who lived in a  
neighborhood where people left their doors open,'' Herndon said. 
``The dog got loose and ran into a neighbor's house, where he 
chased the people around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was bitten, but that still amounted to ``menacing  
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog wound up on Prozac because he was so high-strung,''  
Herndon said.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Admits To Killing Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- It was an October afternoon when Susan Marie  
Watson walked into a Newark police interview room. She was there to 
discuss her mother's murder 27 years earlier, and Detective Rashid 
Sabur knew exactly what she would say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `She's gonna lie, she's gonna lie,''' recalled Sabur,  
one of two detectives comprising Newark's recently formed cold-case 
squad. ```But then she's gonna tell the truth.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, tears streaming down her face, she did just  
that. In 1971, 14-year-old Susan Marie Watson had cold-bloodedly 
murdered her own mother. Her stunned husband asked why she had 
confessed this horrible secret to a pair of total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trusted them,'' replied the 41-year-old mother of three.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Watson's arrest is an example of cold-case success, a  
combination of archaeology and old evidence, of instinct and 
amateur psychology. It began -- as many such cases do -- with a phone 
call from a family member. 
</P>
<P>
	Her brothers, George and David Johnson, had read about the  
cold-case squad's formation last fall. They wanted Sabur and 
partner Keith Sheppard to reinvestigate their mother's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The facts were fairly basic.  
</P>
<P>
	Maylon Johnson, while lying in bed, was shot to death in the  
early morning hours of Oct. 3, 1971. Her nightclothes bore a single 
bullet hole. The lone witness, her daughter Susan Marie, called 
police and implicated the dead woman's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	He instantly became the main suspect, but the trail just as  
quickly grew cold. The murder of Maylon Johnson became another 
unsolved homicide, ignored for years -- until the cold-case squad 
phone rang this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Johnson brothers offered new information: they believed  
their mother was possibly dating a second man, someone apart from 
the suspect named by their sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabur and Sheppard reopened the case. They mounted a dig in the  
police property room, rooting through dirty boxes and decades of 
accumulated dust. They located the file and studied old evidence 
for something the original investigators may have missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair next hit the streets, reinterviewing everybody  
connected with the case. They tracked down Susan Marie Watson in 
Schenectady, N.Y., where she was married with three girls of her 
own and working as a keyboard operator. 
</P>
<P>
	She had a new life. But her old life was soon to intrude.  
</P>
<P>
	As he read Mrs. Watson's 1971 interview, Sabur sensed something  
wrong: ``She was doing a lot of dancing around.'' One specific 
thing bothered him: There was a two-hour gap between the time of 
death and the arrival of police. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is, being the suspicious person that I am, that this  
girl waited two hours to get her story together because she killed 
her mom,'' said the veteran homicide detective. ``She panicked. She 
sat there and said, `What lie can I tell so they won't focus in on 
me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	His instinct, combined with some new details from from her  
brothers, convinced Sabur there was no mysterious boyfriend: Maylon 
Johnson was killed by her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he first saw Mrs. Watson, Sabur recalled, her body language  
sent the same message. But their conversation Oct. 23, 1998, didn't 
focus on her guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The detectives instead chatted with Mrs. Watson over two hours,  
becoming the distressed woman's ``best friends,'' Sabur recalled. 
Slowly, she opened up. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the detectives that she was sexually abused by the  
mother's boyfriend. She said her mother had done nothing to stop 
it. And then, weeping before the two detectives, she confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout my years as a police officer, I never felt what I  
felt in that room,'' Sheppard said later. ``The feelings were 
overwhelming when she confessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Watson's brothers have declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The case resulted in an unusual legal situation: Mrs. Watson was  
charged as a juvenile, since she was 14 when the crime occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing guidelines for juveniles have since changed. In 1971,  
she could have been held only until age 21. Now she could face 20 
years. The case has yet to go to trial; a plea bargain is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Sabur has little sympathy.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Ten Commandments say, `Thou shall not kill,''' the  
detective says matter-of-factly. ``You understand what I'm saying? 
So now it's up to us to go and get these individuals responsible 
for these deaths and bring them to justice -- not only in the eyes 
of society, but in the eyes of God.''

<HEADLINE>  Swimmer's Streak Ended by Dutch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After 12 races in three days, Jenny Thompson  
was worn down by the World Short-Course Swimming Championships' 
tough new schedule, which includes semifinals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In race No. 12, Thompson's winning streak at the championships  
ended Saturday, broken by Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands in the 
50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will have a chance Sunday to add another gold medal to  
the two she already won. She also has a $15,000 bonus for a world 
record in another event she didn't win, because she dropped out 
after breaking the record in the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson swam five races Saturday, and in the fifth de Bruijn  
rallied over the final 25 meters and beat her, 24.35 seconds to 
24.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good about my swim,'' Thompson said. ``Inge deserved  
that. She's good in the 50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In line with a new format being adopted for the Olympics, this  
meet has semifinals for races of 100 meters or less -- meaning all 
of Thompson's events. For races of 200 meters or more, the eight 
fastest from the heats go directly into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In semifinals in the 100-meter butterfly, less than an hour  
before her 50 freestyle final, Thompson was only fourth-fastest at 
59.08. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson, who holds the world record of 56.90, had 24 hours  
to rest before the final. 
</P>
<P>
	American Kurt Grote, the world long-course champion in the 200  
breaststroke, was fastest Friday in the semifinals for the 100 at 
59.77. But in Saturday's final, he finished eighth at 1:00.28, with 
Patrik Isaksson winning at 59.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaksson's gold was Sweden's third of the meet, but Sweden's  
women, world record-holders in the 800 freestyle relay, missed a 
sweep of the freestyle relays when they were disqualified for an 
early takeoff in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes were fastest at 3:36.05, but the gold went to Britain  
at 3:36.88. 
</P>
<P>
	That, plus a gold by world record-holder James Hickman in the  
men's 200 butterfly, gave Britain a total of three golds, the same 
as Japan. Australia leads with five golds. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Sandra Voelker of Germany spoiled Japanese  
Mai Nakamura's attempt for a second gold medal, winning the 50 
backstroke. Voelker's time of 27.63 was slower than her world mark 
of 27.27. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thompson's absence, Slovakia's Martina Moravcova won the  
women's 100 individual medley at 1:00.20, nearly a second slower 
than Thompson's record of 59.30. 
</P>
<P>
	World record holder Jani Sievinen of Finland won the men's 100  
individual medley at 54.18 and Russia's Nadejda Chemezova took the 
women's 400 freestyle at 4:05.23.

<HEADLINE>  Swimmer's Streak Ended by Dutch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After 12 races in three days, Jenny Thompson  
was worn down by the World Short-Course Swimming Championships' 
tough new schedule, which includes semifinals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In race No. 12, Thompson's winning streak at the championships  
ended Saturday, broken by Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands in the 
50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will have a chance Sunday to add another gold medal to  
the two she already won. She also has a $15,000 bonus for a world 
record in another event she didn't win, because she dropped out 
after breaking the record in the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson swam five races Saturday, and in the fifth de Bruijn  
rallied over the final 25 meters and beat her, 24.35 seconds to 
24.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good about my swim,'' Thompson said. ``Inge deserved  
that. She's good in the 50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In line with a new format being adopted for the Olympics, this  
meet has semifinals for races of 100 meters or less -- meaning all

<HEADLINE> Behrens Wins Oaklawn Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Favored Behrens overtook Littlbitlively  
early in the stretch run and easily won the $750,000 Oaklawn 
Handicap on today. 
</P>
<P>
	With regular rider Jorge Chavez aboard, the 5-year-old Behrens  
was not threatened in the stretch. He covered 1 1/8 miles on a sloppy 
track in 1:47 3-5 and won by 2 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively set all the pace and hung on for second. His  
stable mate, Precocity, the defending champion, passed some horses 
in the turn and ran third. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively and Dixie Road battled down the backstretch but  
Behrens and Archers Bay, 1-2 finishers in the Gulfstream Park 
Handicap on Feb. 27, were never far back. 
</P>
<P>
	Beherns paid $5, $2.80 and $2.60. The entry paid $2.80 and $3.  
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the far turn, Behrens and Archers Bay started  
moving on the leaders but Archers Bay couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens was coming off a 2 1/2-length victory in the Gulfstream  
Park Handicap, his first in a Grade I stakes and first victory 
since Sept. 20, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively was scratched from the Razorback Handicap  
because of an off track. Trainer Bobby Barnett said early in the 
week that Littlebitlively was doing as well as he was last November 
when he lost in a photo finish to Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Precocity prepared for the Oaklawn Handicap by  
finishing second in the New Orleans Handicap. A month ago, he won 
the New Orleans Handicap, beating Kentucky Derby and Preakness 
winner Real Quiet.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Brown may call Georgia his home, but that  
doesn't mean he's going to live like a nomad while he's pitching 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a former Georgia Tech star, and his wife, Candace, have  
bought the former Beverly Hills, Calif., home of musician John 
Fogerty for $3.8 million, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported 
Saturday. The Browns also purchased the lot next door for $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, the Browns will live at the new home they're  
building on 60 acres in his hometown of Macon, 80 miles southeast 
of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers raised the eyebrows -- and ire -- of several other  
teams in December by signing Brown to a record seven-year, $105 
million contract.

</P>
<P>
	SOUTH BERWICK, Maine (AP) -- Gladys Hasty Carroll, a writer known  
for her portrayals of rural life in Maine in the early 20th 
century, died Sunday. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll's most famous work, the 1933 best-seller ``As the Earth  
Turns,'' was a Pulitzer Prize nominee that inspired a Hollywood 
production the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll wrote 21 other works of fiction and nonfiction,  
including short stories and children's books. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Rochester, N.H., Carroll spent her childhood and  
much of her adult life in the farmhouse her grandfather built 
during the Civil War in Dunnybrook, a tiny hamlet in South Berwick.

	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Harold Greenwald, a  
psychotherapist whose dissertation on the psychology of prostitutes 
was turned into a best-selling book and Hollywood movie, died 
Friday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald wrote ``The Call Girl: A Social and Analytic Study''  
in 1958, which was reissued as ``The Elegant Prostitute.'' It sold 
more than a million copies and was translated into seven languages. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was later used as the basis for the 1960 film, ``Girl  
of the Night,'' starring Anne Francis and Lloyd Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald was known among psychologists for his development of  
direct decision therapy, which held that decisions were the key to 
understanding personality and dysfunctional patterns.

	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Wilson Riles, California's first black  
statewide elected official, died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Riles became state schools superintendent in 1970, serving as  
California's leading schools advocate. He had a 12-year tenure 
before losing election in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Riles went to work for the state Department of Education in  
1958, heading a program to encourage schools to hire minority 
teachers. 
</P>

	ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Jesse Stone, a major influence on  
20th century music who wrote ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' and helped 
develop many of Atlantic Records' biggest hits, died Thursday. He 
was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	As a writer, producer and arranger at Atlantic, Stone worked  
with artists such as Ray Charles, Big Joe Turner, the Drifters and 
the Clovers. Among his other famous songs were ``Idaho'' and 
``Money Honey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone helped build Atlantic Records into a top rhythm-and-blues  
label in the late '40s and early '50s, signing such stars as Ruth 
Brown. In 1954, Bill Haley had a Top 10 hit with Stone's ``Shake, 
Rattle and Roll.''

<P>
	In Chicago, he learned from such artists as Jimmy Rogers and  
Otis Rush, and appeared on records with Albert King and Koko

<HEADLINE> First American Wins Flamingo Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- First American, who had not won since  
breaking his maiden last September, earned a trip to the Kentucky 
Derby after pulling away for a 3 1/4-length victory in today's 
$250,000 Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jose Velez Jr., First American stole the spotlight  
from heavily favored Prime Directive when he took the lead turning 
for home and eased away to cover 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, we're going to the Derby,'' trainer Eduardo  
Caramori said after First American paid $8, $4.40 and $3.40. ``He 
earned it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats finished second and returned $8.80 and $7 and  
Vision and Verse paid $6.20 to show. Both were making their first 
starts in stakes competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive, who went off at 4-5, finished sixth in the  
eight-horse field, 18 lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	First American has won just two of eight starts, but Saturday's  
$150,000 purse increased his career earnings to $222,777. The son 
of Quiet American had failed to finish in the money in his three 
previous stakes, although he was just 2 1/2 lengths behind Vicar in 
the Florida Derby three weeks ago as a 119-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always been high on this colt, but we needed to win  
today to get his earnings to where he'd qualify for the Derby,'' 
said Caramori, who said he'd ship First American to Churchill Downs 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive ran third entering the turn, but suddenly  
dropped off the pace and ran himself out of the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so much better than that,'' trainer Pat Byrne said.  
``We'll check him out and try to find a reason he stopped so badly. 
There's no chance for the Derby now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First American didn't sustain his run in the Florida Derby, but  
did not falter Saturday as he stalked early leaders Shut Out Time 
and Forty One Carats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the position I wanted, about four or five lengths off  
the lead,'' said Velez, who was riding First American for the 
second time. ``When I asked him, he really responded. ... He's at 
his best when he's got a horse to run at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shut Out Time set the pace through the first turn and down the  
backstretch, with Forty One Carats a half-length behind at the 
half-mile pole. Prime Directive ran third at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats took the lead on the far turn as Prime  
Directive started to fade, then First American made his move. He 
drove past Forty One Carats at the top of the stretch as Vision and 
Verse moved into third. 
</P>
<P>
	First American led by two lengths at the eighth pole and drew  
out as Velez drove him with a left-handed whip.

<HEADLINE> FBI Steps Up Search For Atheist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP WOOD, Texas (AP) -- The FBI moved in additional heavy  
equipment Saturday as part of its search of a sprawling ranch, 
apparently looking for clues to the 1995 disappearance of atheist 
leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has been close-mouthed about the search, which began  
Friday with the execution of a federal search warrant at the 
5,000-acre Cooksy Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be here at least today and maybe tomorrow,'' FBI Special  
Agent Roderick Beverly said Saturday at the main gate to the ranch. 
He would not confirm that the search related to the O'Hair case or 
provide any additional information. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Department of Public  
Safety, which oversees the Texas Rangers law enforcement agency, 
said Saturday the O'Hair case is the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair, whose 1963 Supreme Court case led to the ban on  
organized prayer in public schools, vanished in 1995 with her son, 
a granddaughter and $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly said the searchers at the ranch Saturday included dogs,  
Real County sheriff's deputies, Texas Rangers, FBI forensics 
experts and Internal Revenue Service agents. In addition, a backhoe 
was moved onto the ranch early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly said the ranch's size and the presence of wild animals  
such as turkey and deer were hindering the search, but added: 
``We're content, I think, with what we have so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, David R. Waters, 52, the former office manager for  
Mrs. O'Hair, and Gary P. Karr, 50, were arrested on weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters has denied involvement in the O'Hairs' disappearance, and  
neither man has been charged in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported that FBI agent Bill O'Leary  
testified during Karr's March 26 detention hearing that Karr 
admitted being an accessory to four homicides in Texas and helping 
get rid of the victims and their property. 
</P>
<P>
	Karr's lawyer, Richard Helfrick, said his client cooperated with  
FBI questioning about homicides in Texas. Helfrick wouldn't say if 
Karr admitted a role in any slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Friend, an owner of the Cooksy Ranch 100 miles west of San  
Antonio, said Saturday that officials didn't know how long the 
search would go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them that I was to move some cattle in there today, and  
they said no, don't move the cattle in,'' Friend said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Take Irabu, Warts and All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu will rejoin the New York Yankees  
this weekend and may start Wednesday's game at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``His role will be determined by the manager,'' Yankees owner  
George Steinbrenner said Saturday. ``It would be my hope he would 
start Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu departed Tampa to rejoin the Yankees in Los Angeles after  
several meetings and a one-hour workout at the Yankees' 
minor-league facility. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after Steinbrenner called the Japanese pitcher a ``fat  
... toad,'' the Yankees said Friday that Ramiro Mendoza would start 
in place of Irabu at Oakland on Wednesday. Now, the possibility 
exists Irabu could reclaim the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``His teammates are anxious to have him back,'' Steinbrenner  
said. ``He will do fine. It's a good day for the Yankees,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu upset Steinbrenner by failing to cover first base in a  
spring game for the second time in a week. Steinbrenner on Friday 
indicated the pitcher might not rejoin the Yankees on Tuesday, as 
previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu had an extensive 18-minute bullpen session Saturday with  
Yankees director of player personnel Billy Connors. Steinbrenner, 
meanwhile, met with Irabu's agent, Don Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted Hideki to know we are all behind him,'' Steinbrenner  
said. ``I'm glad he spent the two days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner did not address the specific reasons behind  
Saturday's decision and Irabu didn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu has struggled this spring, going 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA. He  
has allowed 19 runs -- 18 earned -- and 30 hits in 19 1-3 innings.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Teemu Selanne scored two goals to increase his  
NHL-leading total to 45 as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the New 
York Rangers 4-1 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was another blow to the Rangers' fading playoff hopes.  
New York trails Boston by seven points for the Eastern Conference's 
final playoff spot, with seven games left for the Rangers and eight 
for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim took a 1-0 lead 2:28 into the game when Selanne  
intercepted a pass by Brian Leetch for a breakaway and beat goalie 
Mike Richter with a slapshot from outside the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Green put the Ducks ahead 2-0 with his 13th goal of the  
season at 6:43 when he took a trailing pass from Pavel Trnka on a 
three-on-one break and beat Richter high to the far side. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Stevens made it 2-1 at 10:07 with his 22nd goal of the  
season. Stevens took a hard slapshot from the blue line that goalie 
Guy Hebert couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne gave the Ducks a 3-1 lead with a power-play goal at  
10:09 of the second period, one-timing a pass from Paul Kariya into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne returned the favor at 16:41 of the second period,  
feeding Kariya during a four-on-four for his 35th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers center Petr Nedved, hindered by a strained ribcage  
muscle, played only 64 seconds over two first-period shifts and did 
not return to the ice.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Try To Buy a Pennant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just wondering, John Smoltz. All those wins in the '90s, all  
those October near misses, what does it all mean for the Atlanta 
Braves and their fans? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the legacy is that they're going to appreciate it 10  
times more when it's over,'' the former Cy Young winner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean anything now. We're still trying to win.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have reached the NL championship series seven  
straight times, yet have only one World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	The upstart Florida Marlins ended the Braves' season in 1997,  
and the San Diego Padres stopped them in 1998. So, is this the year 
someone else -- the Los Angeles Dodgers, perhaps -- blocks the 
Braves? 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by Fox money, the Dodgers made free agent ace Kevin Brown  
the first $100 million man in the majors. They also hired Davey 
Johnson, who never has finished lower than second place in 10 full 
seasons as a manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a talented team,'' Johnson said. ``My job is to give them  
the best opportunity to win. We have a chance to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta should easily win the East even though it lost first  
baseman Andres Galarraga, who was diagnosed with lymphoma and is 
out for the season. Houston should repeat in the Central despite 
Moises Alou's knee injury in a treadmill accident, which probably 
will keep him out for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers should win the weaker West, while the New York Mets  
may take the wild card, beating out Mark McGwire and the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs, who earned the extra playoff spot last year  
behind Sammy Sosa, lost their chance in March when Kerry Wood was 
sidelined for the season with an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the NL in predicted order of finish: 	
</P>
<P>
                               *EAST 	
</P>
<P>
                          *Atlanta Braves    	
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Smoltz &AMP; Co. will surely be back in  
the playoffs. The only question is how far they will go. 
</P>
<P>
	GM John Schuerholz acted quickly to fill Atlanta's biggest  
needs, signing free agent RF Brian Jordan (.316, 25 HRs, 91 RBIs 
for St. Louis) to boost the offense and trading for Cincinnati 2B 
Bret Boone (95 RBIs) to steady the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Ryan Klesko (18 HRs, 70 RBIs) moves from LF to take  
over at 1B for Galarraga (.305, 44, 121). New batting coach Don 
Baylor also intends to improve Klesko's hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, the rotation is as ripe as the juiciest Georgia  
peach. Glavine (20-6, 2.47 ERA) kept the Cy Young Award in Atlanta, 
while Maddux (18-9, 2.22), Smoltz (17-3, 2.90) and Kevin Millwood 
(17-8) were impressive. Impressive in camp, 20-year-old LH Odalis 
Perez beat out rookie LH Bruce Chen for the spot left by Denny 
Neagle. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullpen may be a trouble spot. Kerry Ligtenberg (30 saves)  
is out after injuring an elbow in a spring game, meaning John 
Rocker (2.13 ERA, 47 games) might be the closer. Former ace Mark 
Wohlers seems to have made progress in solving a control problem 
that threatened to end his career. 
</P>
<P>
                           *New York Mets    	
</P>
<P>
	A whirlwind winter has Mets fans hoping this will be the year  
their team wins a postseason game for the first time since Keith 
Hernandez and Gary Carter played in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	LF Rickey Henderson (101 runs for Oakland) led the majors with  
66 steals at age 40. He'll bat leadoff in a lineup that added 3B 
Robin Ventura (91 RBIs for the White Sox) and RF Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza (.328, 32, 111) begins his first full season as the  
main man at Shea Stadium, supported by John Olerud (.354, 93 RBIs). 
Edgardo Alfonzo moves to 2B to make room for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Leiter (17-6, 2.47) and Rick Reed (16-11) lead a rotation  
that is solid, not spectacular. John Franco (0-8, 38 saves) often 
was shaky, and the Mets hope Armando Benitez (87 strikeouts in 68 
1-3 innings for Baltimore) settles down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Valentine has gone 1,541 games (769-772) without a playoff  
appearance, the longest drought at the start of a career by any 
manager in 40 years. At least he won't have to hear fired announcer 
Tim McCarver talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Philadelphia Phillies    	
</P>
<P>
	Topic No. 1 in town is still Curt Schilling. As in, will the  
Phillies trade their ace? 
</P>
<P>
	GM Ed Wade insists Schilling (15-14, major league-leading 300  
strikeouts) is staying, saying Philadelphia wants to build around 
him. If so, he'll lead a staff that underwent a lot of change -- 
Chad Ogea, Paul Spoljaric and Jeff Brantley came, while Ricky 
Bottalico, Mark Leiter and Mark Portugal left. 
</P>
<P>
	3B Scott Rolen (.290, 31, 110) is among the best young players  
in the game. Rico Brogna (104 RBIs), Bobby Abreu (.312) and Doug 
Glanville (23 SBs) did well. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark down May 10. That's when newcomer Ron Gant (26 HRs) faces  
Tony La Russa's team for the first time since implying his former 
St. Louis manager had different standards based on race. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Montreal Expos    	
</P>
<P>
	The good news in Montreal: For the first time in years, the  
Expos kept all of their young stars during the offseason. The bad 
news: The city might be losing its whole team because of shaky 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Alou, perhaps the most patient man in all of baseball,  
turned down a chance to manage the Dodgers and stuck around. He has 
the next Clemente or Griffey -- depending on whose opinion is asked 
-- in 23-year-old RF Vladimir Guerrero (.324, 38, 109). 
</P>
<P>
	Ugueth Urbina (34 saves, 1.30 ERA) might be the most unhittable  
reliever in the majors, but not that many people know it. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Florida Marlins    	
</P>
<P>
	As predicted, the Marlins set a record for the worst record by a  
defending World Series champion -- 54-108. The Florida forecast 
calls for a bright future, although it may be a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year manager John Boles inherits from Jim Leyland a young  
staff that has promise. Add in 1997 World Series MVP Livan 
Hernandez (10-12, 4.72) and Alex Fernandez's return from rotator 
cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Braden Looper, acquired from St. Louis for Edgar  
Renteria, is among the young talent. So is rookie 3B Mike Lowell, 
recovering from testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                             *CENTRAL   	
</P>
<P>
                          *Houston Astros    	
</P>
<P>
	To win its third straight Central title and close out the  
Astrodome in style, Houston must overcome two huge losses -- Randy 
Johnson to free agency, and Moises Alou to a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, the ``Killer B's'' are still intact with Jeff  
Bagwell (.304, 34, 111), Craig Biggio (.325, 50 SBs) and Derek Bell 
(.314, 108 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hidalgo (.303) will fill in for Alou (.312, 38, 124),  
while former MVP Ken Caminiti (29 HRs) returns from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds (19-8), Jose Lima (16-8) and 23-year-old Scott  
Elarton -- the pitcher Houston would not trade for Roger Clemens -- 
get plenty of help from a deep bullpen led by Billy Wagner (30 
saves, 97 strikeouts in 60 IP). 
</P>
<P>
	The most wondrous stadium in America when it opened in 1965 --  
Mickey Mantle hit the first home run in an exhibition -- the 
Astrodome never has held the World Series. Coming off a team-record 
102 wins, this is Houston's last chance before moving into The 
Ballpark at Union Station in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
                        *St. Louis Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and his 70 home runs brought the whole country's  
attention to Busch Stadium in 1998. Only a healthy pitching staff, 
however, will bring the playoffs to St. Louis in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not looking good. Matt Morris, expected to be the ace,  
will miss the season because of an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, Alan Benes and Donovan Osborne were hurt last year,  
leaving Kent Mercker (11-11) as the top winner and only pitcher to 
make 25 starts. Manny Aybar and Darren Oliver should bolster the 
rotation, while Juan Acevedo (2.56 ERA, 15 saves) is joined in the 
bullpen by former All-Star Ricky Bottalico, injured last year in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire (147 RBIs, 162 walks) and Ray Lankford (31 HRs, 105  
RBIs) are joined by free agent OF Eric Davis (.327, 28, 89) and SS 
Edgar Renteria (.282, 41 SBs). Renteria and Lankford, though, were 
slowed this spring by bad knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, there's J.D. Drew. Projected as the 1999 Rookie of the  
Year, he gave a glimpse of his glorious future by hitting .417 with 
five homers and 13 RBIs in only 36 at-bats as a September call-up. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Cincinnati Reds    	
</P>
<P>
	GM Jim Bowden was busy in the winter, getting Greg Vaughn, Denny  
Neagle, Steve Avery and more. Along the way, he restored some hope 
in Cincinnati, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn (50 HRs, 119 RBIs for San Diego) is the biggest hitter in  
a lineup that needs SS Barry Larkin (.309, 26 SBs) to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Harnisch (14-7) and Neagle (16-11 for Atlanta) were hurt  
this spring and Avery (10-7 for Boston) has been injured in past 
years. Reliever Stan Belinda (4-8) is pitching even though he was 
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Chicago Cubs    	
</P>
<P>
	Minus Kerry Wood, the oldest team in the league is sure to  
extend baseball's oldest drought -- the Cubs have not won the World 
Series since 1908. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago started this spring full of excitement, coming off MVP  
Sammy Sosa's 66-homer season and its one-game playoff win over San 
Francisco for the wild-card spot. All that enthusiasm was dashed 
when Wood was lost for the season, and possibly longer, because of 
elbow damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa (.308, 158 RBIs), Mark Grace (.309), Henry Rodriguez (31  
HRs) and latecomer Gary Gaetti (70 RBIs) made Wrigley Field a fun 
place last fall. Without the 21-year-old Wood, who struck out 20 
Houston hitters in a May game, it should be a long summer 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tapani (19-9, 4.85) is now 35, and every player in the 	
starting lineup will be over 30 after the All-Star break. The Cubs 
signed Hideo Nomo to a minor league contract after he was cut by 
the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Pittsburgh Pirates 	
</P>
<P>
	Eager to boost a lineup that was next-to-last in NL scoring, the  
Pirates got Brian Giles, Brant Brown and Ed Sprague. Their most 
curious trade, though, comes in the leadoff spot: Jason Kendall, 
now batting instead of traded Tony Womack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall (.327, .411 on-base percentage) could become the first  
catcher in major league history to hit leadoff on an everyday 
basis. He set an NL record for catchers by stealing 26 bases, yet 
he must stay healthy -- he was hit by a pitch 31 times last year, 
most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	For those curious: Since 1970, Jeff Newman (32) and Butch  
Wynegar (31) are the only catchers to bat leadoff more than 30 
times in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Cordova (13-14, 3.31) leads a young rotation that  
pitched better than the records show. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Milwaukee Brewers    	
</P>
<P>
	This is the Brewers' final year at County Stadium before they  
move into Miller Park. It might also be manager Phil Garner's last 
try at stopping a rut of six straight losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Garner does not have much to work with. Jeromy  
Burnitz (38 HRs, 125 RBIs) led the hitters and no pitcher won more 
than 10 games. Maybe Jim Abbott can help in both areas -- 5-0 for 
the White Sox last year, he showed skill at the plate in spring 
training despite having only one hand. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                               *WEST    	
</P>
<P>
                        *Los Angeles Dodgers    	
</P>
<P>
	Davey Johnson's job is easily defined: Help the Dodgers win a  
postseason game for the first time since Orel Hershiser beat 
Oakland in Game 5 to win the 1988 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers gave Brown (18-7, 2.38) a $105 million, seven-year  
contract and hope he will work his magic on and off the mound -- 
he's credited with inspiring pitchers in Florida and San Diego 
during the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismael Valdes (11-10, 3.98), Chan Ho Park (15-9, 3.71), Darren  
Dreifort (8-12, 4.00) and Carlos Perez could all benefit from being 
around Brown. Jeff Shaw (48 saves overall) is fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Runs should be no problem. In Johnson's previous three positions  
-- with Baltimore, Cincinnati and the Mets -- his team's offense 
dramatically improved in his first full season. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as anything, the Dodgers need former All-Star C Todd  
Hundley (.161) to recover from elbow surgery that limited him to 53 
games for the Mets. Gary Sheffield (.302) griped this spring about 
moving from right field to left, while newcomer Devon White should 
settle things in center field. 
</P>
<P>
                        *San Francisco Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Dusty Baker keeps finding ways to win. Of course,  
having Barry Bonds on his side helps. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bonds (.303, 37, 122, 28 SBs) and Jeff Kent (.297, 31, 128)  
leading the way, the Giants made it to a one-game playoff before 
losing to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now going into the final season of what used to be called  
Candlestick Park, the Giants may find it difficult to duplicate 
last year's 89 victories. Most of all, they need former ace Shawn 
Estes (7-12, 5.06) to fully recover from arm woes. Kirk Rueter 
(16-9) and Mark Gardner (13-6) get relief from Robb Nen (40 
saves). 
</P>
<P>
                         *Colorado Rockies    	
</P>
<P>
	Jim Leyland comes to Coors Field facing a formidable and  
familiar task in Colorado -- trying to find enough pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the Rockies boast NL batting champion Larry Walker (.363,  
23 HRs), Vinny Castilla (.319, 46, 144), Dante Bichette (.331, 22, 
122) and young Todd Helton (.315, 25, 97). Yet as their 77 wins 
show, it takes more than hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Kile (13-17, 5.20) found out the hard way. After going  
19-7 with a 2.57 ERA for Houston, he signed with Colorado and got 
knocked around. Further evidence came last summer when the AL beat 
the NL 13-8 in the highest-scoring All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Arizona Diamondbacks    	
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson gives the Diamondbacks a presence rarely seen in  
second-year franchises. Yet for all of owner Jerry Colangelo's 
spending, Arizona may not greatly improve on its 65 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (10-1, 1.28 for Houston), Todd Stottlemyre (14-13  
overall) and Armando Reynoso join surprising Omar Daal (8-12, 2.88) 
and Andy Benes (14-13) in the rotation. Gregg Olson may be 
hard-pressed to duplicate his 30 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hit a major league-worst .246, and Steve Finley, Luis  
Gonzalez and two-time NL stolen base champion Tony Womack will not 
boost that a lot. Young 1B Travis Lee (22 HRs) is improving, but 
the D-backs need much more from Matt Williams (20 HRs, 71 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
                          *San Diego Padres    	
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn and his Padres put it all together last season,  
reaching the World Series and winning voter approval for a new 
ballpark. Then, much like the 1997 champion Marlins, they were 
gutted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, Greg Vaughn, Steve Finley, Ken Caminiti and others  
are all gone, making country music star Garth Brooks the most 
interesting attraction in camp this spring. The result: San Diego 
could become the first team to go from last to first to last again. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn (.321) needs 72 hits to reach 3,000. At 39, he could be  
joined in that exclusive club this year by Wade Boggs and Cal 
Ripken.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gov't Settles Radiation Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Families of 90 cancer patients who allege  
their relatives were unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored 
radiation experiments have reached a proposed $5 million 
settlement, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed five years ago, alleged terminally ill cancer  
patients who sought treatment at Cincinnati General Hospital 
between 1960 and 1971 were given full-body and partial-body doses 
of radiation researchers could measure the effects. The facility is 
now known as University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached Friday when the last surviving patient  
from the study agreed to its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit -- which named the hospital and the federal government  
among defendants -- contended many of the patients' deaths were 
hastened by the treatment. Researchers in the 11-year study 
defended their actions as attempts to cure or ease pain in the 
earliest days of radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was included in the suit because the Defense  
Department paid $651,000 for the test results to learn about the 
effects of radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the settlement earned the approval of Donna White  
Christy, the study's sole survivor, who was treated for cancer at 
the hospital when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Newman, an attorney for about 50 of the plaintiffs, said  
the settlement will amount to about $50,000 for each family. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms also include an apology from the government and a memorial  
plaque to be placed on the University of Cincinnati campus listing 
the patients' names. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sandra Beckwith will be asked to sign the  
agreement on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Surprise Calif. Storm Claims 8th Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An eighth illegal immigrant has been found dead  
in the area where a surprise snowstorm stranded dozens who tried to 
enter the United States, an official with Mexico's consulate said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the most recent victim was found late Friday in  
a rugged area that has become a well-used illegal border crossing 
point, said Rebeca Romero, a spokeswoman for the Mexican consulate 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the U.S. Border Control and other agencies  
rescued more than 50 immigrants in and around the Cleveland 
National Forest, about 40 miles east of San Diego, late Thursday 
and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities working the other side of the border south  
of Tecate, in an area known as La Rumorosa, reported finding an 
additional two people dead and more than 80 people stranded by the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the rugged region were expected to drop into the  
freezing range overnight and more snow was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the United States have detained seven of the  
rescued immigrants. Three were suspected to be smugglers who may 
have led the other victims unprepared into the snowy region, while 
the other four were possible witnesses, the consulate's spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 50 immigrants were still in San Diego hospitals  
Saturday, the consulate said. A spokesman for the hospital where 
six were recovering said all were in good condition and were being 
guarded by agents from the U.S. Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining immigrants have been repatriated.

<HEADLINE> Aide: Farrakhan Walking Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recuperating from prostate cancer surgery,  
Louis Farrakhan is alert, walking around and has even watched a 
movie with family members. His son-in-law said Saturday he expects 
the Nation of Islam leader to be released from the hospital within 
``a matter of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sitting up, he's talking, he's walking around more than  
the doctors would like at this time,'' Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad, 
Farrakhan's son-in-law and chief of staff, said in a telephone 
interview from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Farrakhan, 65, watched a movie in Washington's  
Howard University Hospital with members of his family including 
Muhammad. He did not say which film they saw. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when Farrakhan is expected to be released from the  
hospital, Muhammad said: ``We think it's a matter of days now that 
he would be released.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, diagnosed with and first treated for prostate cancer  
in 1991, was flown from his Illinois home to the hospital here 
Tuesday night for emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he organized the nation's largest black gathering ever,  
the Million Man March on the National Mall in Washington.

<HEADLINE>  'Melissa' Virus Suspect Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The virus spread like lightning, infecting  
scores of computers and overloading e-mail systems of companies and 
governments worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleuths who tracked down the alleged culprit, David L.  
Smith, cornered their quarry almost as fast, relying on an age-old 
detective's tool: There are fingerprints in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how creative you think you are, you always leave a  
digital trail,'' Don Willmott, executive editor of PC Magazine 
Online, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Smith, 30, holed up in his Aberdeen apartment,  
created the virus and named it after a topless dancer from Florida 
called Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	The bothersome virus first appeared March 26 and spread around  
the world Monday like a malicious chain letter. It came disguised 
as an ``important message'' from a friend or colleague and caused 
affected computers to fire off 50 infected messages, slowing e-mail 
systems to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was arrested Thursday night at his brother's house. He  
faces charges that include interruption of public communications, 
conspiracy and theft of computer service -- charges that carry a 
maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $480,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard  
time,'' said New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith allegedly created Melissa using a stolen America Online  
account, said Christopher Bubb, head of a state computer analysis 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL contacted state authorities after an in-house investigation  
turned up evidence that pointed to New Jersey, Bubb said. Using the 
information provided by AOL, investigators in the state's computer 
unit, with the aid of federal experts, were able to trace the virus 
to Smith's phone number. The investigation took about three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators wouldn't explain how they tracked Melissa to  
Smith's phone. But Willmott said e-mail ``always leaves a trail,'' 
and that the key was for detectives to untangle the web of computer 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest must have been easy,'' he said. ``They did it very  
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith worked as an on-site consultant for AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham  
Park, employed by Iselin-based CGS Computer Associates. He was 
hired to troubleshoot the facility's personal computers, AT&AMP;T 
spokesman Burke Stinson told The Star-Ledger of Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending the night in jail, Smith, who was released on  
$100,000 bail, called a supervisor at AT&AMP;T Friday morning to say he 
wouldn't make it to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He phoned his boss today to say he wouldn't be in, but added  
that he'd see him next week,'' Stinson said. ``My reaction is, `Fat 
chance.' My guess is we won't be seeing much of him in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently frightened when the FBI posted a warning about  
Melissa last week, investigators said Smith threw his computer 
equipment into one of the trash bins at his central New Jersey 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he put the virus onto the Web, he tried to hide all of  
his computers and manuals,'' said Monmouth County Prosecutor John 
Kaye. ``Everything was thrown into a Dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors of the pale, heavyset Smith said he was neatly groomed  
and ventured outside only to leave for work, dressed simply in 
khakis and a button-down shirt with no tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he never went out,'' said Kim Holler, a legal  
secretary who lives in an apartment across a courtyard from Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A cable installer said he rang Smith's doorbell a month ago  
after receiving a referral that someone new had moved into the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The installer, who identified himself only as John, said the man  
declined his offer for cable service. ``He said, `No, I'm on my 
computer all the time.'''

                            *Lionel Bart    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lionel Bart, the lyricist and composer who created  
``Oliver!'' and other musicals, died Saturday at age 68, his family 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not announced, but Bart's nephew, Michael  
Pruskin, said he had been treated for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart played a large role in reviving the English musical at a  
time when American productions dominated London's stages. He also 
won dubious fame for losing his fortune from ``Oliver!'' and 
survived long years of alcoholism and excess. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart's first musical, ``Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be,''  
premiered in 1959. He also produced for ``Lock Up Your Daughters'' 
that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	1960 brought ``Oliver!,'' based on Charles Dickens' ``Oliver  
Twist.'' The show was also a hit in New York, and Bart won 
Broadway's Antoinette Perry award (the Tony) for the music and 
lyrics of ``Oliver!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bart followed up with music and lyrics for ``Blitz!'' in 1962  
and ``Maggie May'' in 1964, and did the music for ``Lionel'' in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
	He also produced two flops: ``Twang!'' in 1965 and ``La Strada''  
in 1969.

<P>
	SOUTH BERWICK, Maine (AP) -- Gladys Hasty Carroll, a writer known  
for her portrayals of rural life in Maine in the early 20th 
century, died Sunday. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll's most famous work, the 1933 best-seller ``As the Earth  
Turns,'' was a Pulitzer Prize nominee that inspired a Hollywood 
production the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll wrote 21 other works of fiction and nonfiction,  
including short stories and children's books. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Rochester, N.H., Carroll spent her childhood and  
much of her adult life in the farmhouse her grandfather built 
during the Civil War in Dunnybrook, a tiny hamlet in South Berwick.

<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Phil Fourney, the president of the West  
Virginia Press Association Foundation and a longtime newspaper 
owner, died Saturday of complications from diabetes. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourney spent more than 33 years as the owner of Star Printing  
and Publishing Co., which published the Ravenswood News, before 
selling the company in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, he served as president of the state Press Association.  
In 1975, former Gov. Arch Moore named him a Distinguished West 
Virginian, and in 1991, he was recognized as the state's first 
Premier Journalist, the highest award given by the West Virginia 
Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joslin Foundation honored him in 1994 for living more than  
half a century as an insulin-dependent diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourney is survived by his wife, Wilma; one daughter; five sons;  
two stepdaughters; two stepsons; and two grandchildren.

                        *Jim ``Jug'' Jackson    	
</P>
<P>
	TAHOLAH, Wash. (AP) -- Jim ``Jug'' Jackson, hereditary chief and  
longtime leader of the Quinault Indian Nation, was found dead 
Friday at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a logger, shake mill operator and for more than 20  
years the chairman of the Olympic Peninsula tribe, was found dead 
of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home, said tribal 
President Pearl Capoeman-Baller, and Joe DeLaCruz, who followed 
Jackson as president from 1972 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic Party activist, he and his wife, Mary, were seated  
among the dignitaries at the 1960 inauguration of President John F. 
Kennedy, Capoeman-Baller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's great-grandfather, Chief Taholah, and another  
ancestor, Chief Kape, were the first two signers of the 1855 
Quinault River Treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty established a 10,000-acre reservation that today  
covers 211,000 acres of rain forest and rugged coastline about 75 
miles north of the mouth of the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit over the federal government's logging practices that  
Jackson helped organize was settled for $26 million in the early 
1990s, DeLaCruz said. The tribe also briefly closed 28 miles of 
coastline because of litter problems, and still restricts beach 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Mary; four sons, a daughter, 14  
grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Wilson Riles, California's first black  
statewide elected official, died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Riles became state schools superintendent in 1970, serving as  
California's leading schools advocate. He had a 12-year tenure 
before losing election in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Riles went to work for the state Department of Education in  
1958, heading a program to encourage schools to hire minority 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	As superintendent, Riles supported school integration but  
opposed mandatory busing. He also advocated higher testing 
standards.

Time Inc. founder Henry R. Luce and a leader of New York's social 
and philanthropic circles, died Wednesday. She was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Chicago in 1899, she met Luce on New Year's Eve 1919  
through Thornton Wilder, one of his Yale classmates. They were 
married in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
	They divorced in 1935, shortly after Luce met the author Claire  
Boothe, who became his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyng and Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce  
III, chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in 
New York, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head  
of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District 
Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She served on the boards of several 
institutions and once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren  
and five great-grandchildren.

team,' '' Gary Payton said after Seattle's 107-95 loss to the 
Portland Trail Blazers Friday night, which ended a 1-4 road trip. 
``It won't happen. So right now, hopefully, we can start playing a 
little better, and when (Baker) gets back, we hope that he can 
produce quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped the Sonics to 15-16, a startling decline for a  
team that won four Pacific Division titles in the past five years 
and averaged 59 1/2 wins between 1992 and 1998. Seattle hasn't been 
below .500 this late in the season since 1990-91, when they 
finished 41-41. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not happy about being below .500,'' coach Paul Westphal  
said. ``We've got a chance, going home, to do something about it. 
We are undermanned, but I like the fight we've shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker began the season overweight and out of sync, and was  
ridiculed when he missed his first 18 foul shots. But the Sonics 
started 6-0, and Baker gradually improved. He scored 31 points and 
tipped in the winning basket in an 87-85 victory at Vancouver March 
16. The Sonics had won three straight and were 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
	In his next game, Baker injured his right thumb in a loss at  
Golden State. He played only 11 minutes in a loss at Denver two 
nights later, and was put on the injured list with a partially torn 
ligament in the thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Without him, the Sonics are 2-5, and the lack of muscle in the  
middle was apparent against the Blazers. Seattle didn't make an 
inside shot until Jelani McCoy's layup early in the second quarter. 
The Sonics also were outrebounded 45-35. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're without your All-Star low-post player, you  
struggle to find your inside game, and you struggle to defend 
inside,'' Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury to Baker has taken some of the heat off Westphal, who  
replaced the fired George Karl and stood to take much of the blame 
for the Sonics' letdown this season. But the reality is that many 
of Seattle's problems have nothing to do with either Baker or 
Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shooting guard Hersey Hawkins has lost his confidence, even  
suggesting that Westphal bench him following a 104-87 loss at 
Detroit last week. He's averaging a career-low 9.2 points, and is 
shooting 26 percent from 3-point range, compared to 42 percent last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics have been starting Billy Owens at shooting guard  
lately, and it's not working. In a 113-110 loss to the Nuggets 
Thursday night, Chauncey Billups lit up Owens for a career-high 32 
points. Isaiah Rider took his turn against Owens Friday night, 
hitting all six of his first-quarter shots for 13 of his 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are 4-12 on the road, with six of the losses coming  
with a healthy Baker in the lineup. Also, Seattle's bench has been 
weakened by the retirement of Nate McMillan and the loss of free 
agents Jerome Kersey and Greg Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony, who signed with the Blazers, helped shut down the  
Sonics in the stretch Friday night, forcing them into 10 turnovers 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never have I seen so many turnovers in one quarter,''  
Seattle's Detlef Schrempf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, wearing a soft cast, took a few shots during warmups at  
Denver, and worked against Seattle's big men before the Portland 
game. He was supposed to be on the injured list for at least four 
weeks, but said he wanted to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's dreaming,'' Westphal said. ``If the team doctor  
says no, Vin doesn't have any say. If the team doctor says it's up 
to Vin, then we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who hasn't endured a losing season as a pro or in  
college at Oregon State, wishes his teammate a quick recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know, when he gets back, what's going to happen,''  
Payton said. ``We can't just say, `Vin, can you give us 30?' It's 
not going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope things get better, and right now they're not.''

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter scored the only goal  
of the match two minutes into the second half to lift D.C. United 
to a 1-0 victory tonight against the New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The game-winning goal came moments after Lassiter had just  
missed wide left following a cross from Jaime Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno set the winning goal in motion when he passed to Marco  
Etcheverry just beyond the midfield stripe. Etcheverry then split 
the MetroStars' defense with a seeing-eye pass that put Lassiter in 
alone on goalkeeper Mike Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	The United striker carried the ball inside the box before  
slipping a left-footed shot past Ammann into the right corner for 
his third goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars had two chances to score in the second half, but  
Eduardo Hurtado's shot in the 63rd minute hit off the left post and 
Hurtado's shot from the top of the box in the 73rd minute whistled 
wide right. 
</P>
<P>
	A red card to midfielder Billy Walsh in the 65th minute further  
diminished the MetroStars' chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half ended in a scoreless tie with neither team having  
a significant advantage. With a little more than eight minutes to 
play the MetroStars Mike Duhaney collided with United keeper Tom 
Presthus after Presthus had punched away a cross by Miles Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players fell to the ground with Presthus bleeding from the  
head and Duhaney from the nose. After a brief delay during which 
both players received medical attention, both continued in the 
match with Presthus receiving nine stitches at the half.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to drop charges against the  
1,200 people arrested at protests sparked by the police shooting of 
an unarmed West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4  
outside his Bronx apartment when four police officers fired 41 
shots and struck him 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting led to daily demonstrations outside police  
headquarters in Manhattan where a number of prominent activists 
were arrested, including NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, and actors Ossie Davis and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a model demonstration, both on the part of the  
protesters and the police,'' District Attorney Robert Morgenthau 
said Friday. ``I just think it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Police Commissioner Howard Safir disagreed with the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my opinion that these summonses should have been  
prosecuted through the system with a judge making the final 
determination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four officers involved in the shooting were indicted  
Wednesday on charges of second-degree murder.

<HEADLINE> Rochester Meats' Beef Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- Wholesale beef products produced at  
Rochester Meats were ordered recalled nationwide after federal 
inspectors found a dangerous strain of E. coli in samples collected 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The products recalled Wednesday include ground beef patties,  
ground chuck patties, chopped beefsteak, beef patties, meat for 
chili, beef patty mix and pure beef bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The products were sold to wholesale and institutional customers  
in 10-, 15-and 20-pound packages. They were marked with the Julian 
code 8335 and Establishment 8999 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	When ingested by humans, the E. coli bacterium can cause serious  
illness and sometimes death, especially in children and the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture has not confirmed any  
illnesses linked to the tainted meat, Joanne Randen, a Rochester 
Meats spokeswoman, said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Grzanek, vice president of quality assurance, said the  
recall is the company's first.

<HEADLINE> 'Inferno' Ushers in Good Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's largest cathedral went to hell -- to  
Dante's ``Inferno,'' that is. But it was back again by Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning on a night marking both Passover and Christ's Last  
Supper, a six-hour reading of the epic by the great Christian poet 
filled the Cathedral of St. John the Divine until 3 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And the violent, rotten world painted in the 14th century by  
Dante Alighieri seemed all too real in a week of protests against 
alleged police brutality and the carnage in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante envisioned his descent into hell for this night, the eve  
of Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing at a lectern under a stone chiseled with the words  
``The Poet's Corner,'' readers -- including some prominent poets -- 
each recited one ``canto,'' or section, during the marathon reading 
of Dante's masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Inferno,'' the first part of the poet's journey through  
hell and purgatory to heaven, touched a nerve at a time when 
killing at home and abroad was the issue of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst sinners in Dante's hell are those who generate  
violence -- ``people who chewed each other to pieces bit by bit,'' 
as the Tuscan poet put it. For that, the perpetrators are banished 
to his 10th, and lowest, circle of hell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of other characters wander into the poem: grafters, pimps  
and cheats whose sins have made it to the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have today is the Inferno come to life,'' said the  
cathedral's poet-in-residence, Daniel Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	From Judas and corrupt political figures in Medieval Florence to  
priests, cardinals and a pope seduced by power and money, they 
parade their greed, corruption, lust, gluttony and envy. Dante's 
God condemns them forever to a merciless inferno alive with frogs, 
serpents and monsters. 
</P>
<P>
	At the cathedral, the readers declaimed this tale to a rapt,  
youthful audience of several hundred -- including a woman with 
fuchsia-colored hair -- who sat at the base of the main aisle under 
massive stone pillars. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a different kind of devotion.  
</P>
<P>
	Many came with their own copies of ``Inferno.'' Smiles of  
recognition crossed some faces as well-known lines echoed through 
the cavernous cathedral, its air heavy with incense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had we but world enough and time,'' said Hoffman, paraphrasing  
a famous poem by Andrew Marvell, ``we'd have read Dante's 
'Purgatory' and 'Paradise' too -- and that would correspond to 
Easter Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, a Quaker who was America's poet laureate in 1973-74,  
said the cosmology of Dante's poem ``is a descent followed by an 
ascent, just as (Christ's) crucifixion is followed by the 
resurrection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Readers included Harry Pritchett, the dean of the 105-year-old  
church, and poets Cynthia Zarin, Alfred Corn and Grace Schulman. 
The reading was interrupted at midnight for an organ meditation. 
</P>
<P>
	Several dozen people made it to 3 a.m. to hear the last words  
signaling an exit from hell. 
</P>
<P>
	After six hours, Dante and his guide, the ancient Roman poet  
Virgil, finally glimpse through a round aperture ``some of the 
beautiful things that Heaven bears, 
</P>
<P>
	``Where we came forth, and once more saw the stars.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Group Fears Computer Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Marvin Tarlton and his neighbors fear a  
great storm may be approaching, and they're preparing like coastal 
residents would for a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	The tempest would not be wind and rain, but computer data gone  
haywire on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	So his family in Marshville, a rural community 30 miles  
southeast of Charlotte, is stocking its farm pond with fish, buying 
bags of dried pinto beans and keeping 600 canning jars on hand to 
preserve vegetables they may have to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	After listening to Focus on the Family chief James Dobson,  
attending a Christian Coalition conference and doing his own 
research, Tarlton decided to err on the side of caution with the 
Y2K computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're preparing a little more radical than others,'' said  
Tarlton, 39. ``I feel good, but I'm not where I want be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of conservative Christians have been taking the Y2K  
threat seriously for months, holding seminars, surfing Web sites 
and stocking provisions to make it through any storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cite Proverbs 27:12: ``The prudent see danger and take  
refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the Y2K bug may turn out to be little more than a  
quick thunderstorm, but pessimists predict that it will ripple into 
a Category 5 storm. Widespread power outages, crippled ATMs and 
food hoarding are possible, they say. Some survivalists cite 
Biblical prophecy to corroborate their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y2K may be nothing. It may be grave,'' said Gene Edwards, a  
Christian writer from Newnan, Ga., who just wrote a book predicting 
a worldwide economic depression later this year. ``The fear of it 
may bring this nation into a collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics within the conservative Christian community say some Y2K  
pundits are bordering on fear-mongering. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a subset of people out there who are alarmists,'' said  
Lee Grady, editor of Charisma, the nation's largest news magazine 
for Pentecostals and charismatics. ``There's a lot of products to 
be sold and a lot of books to be sold ... It's a big distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But folks such as Tarlton say they just want their brethren to  
be safe: ``Our philosophy is to prepare for the worst and hope for 
the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions of technological disaster -- when computers using two  
digits for the year will read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000 -- fit in 
neatly with world views that see Y2K as a sign of the endtimes. 
</P>
<P>
	American Christians who interpret scripture literally always  
have had a keen interest in the second coming of Jesus. Belief that 
the prophecy could be fulfilled soon is widespread. A 1997 
Associated Press poll, for example, found nearly one in four 
Christian adults expect Jesus to arrive in their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can look at the geopolitical scene in the Middle East  
and the prophecy movement, and with it comes the reality of Y2K and 
the general fragility of the world economic bubble,'' said James 
Tabor, a religion professor at the University of North Carolina at 
Charlotte and expert on apocalyptic movements. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads hawking books on Y2K have popped up in Christian magazines  
and Web sites. Among the titles: ``Y2K Chaos'' and ``Y2K 2000: 
Worldwide Collapse.'' More mainstream Christian fiction books about 
Y2K are best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	A national intercessory-prayer group is asking members to pray  
for Y2K survival efforts. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have 
warned Christians to be ready for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the video ``A Christian's Guide to the Millennium Bug,''  
Falwell said he intends to stock up on food, sugar, gasoline and 
ammunition. ``Y2K,'' he said, ``may be God's instrument to shake 
this nation, to humble this nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magazine ads in Christian magazines promote gold and silver  
coins as a hedge against stock market computer malfunction and 
worldwide depression. Edwards has already bought a year's supply of 
firewood, six 50-gallon barrels to store food and a 5,000-gallon 
tank for diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	At The Prophecy Club, a Kansas-based publishing house, customers  
with $1,400 can purchase enough dehydrated food to feed four people 
for a year. One Christian Web site is selling mills to turn grain 
into flour for bread 
</P>
<P>
	``Should we prepare food because ... the end of the world is  
coming? If the end of the world is coming can we prepare?'' the 
site asks. ``Yes, but not without food for the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer experts say there is cause for concern. In  
January's Scientific American, Peter De Jager, who is widely 
credited with alerting business and government to Y2K, offered what 
he called an optimistic prediction of perhaps a month of 
disruptions. The chairman of President Clinton's Year 2000 
commission is worried small towns and businesses won't be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent USA Today/National Science Foundation poll finds that  
34 percent of those surveyed expect major computer problems in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Senate panel report said Y2K disruptions in vital  
services will be minimal but warned that serious potential problems 
in health care, energy supply and government services are possible. 
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said people should have canned 
goods and water on hand but don't need to stockpile food. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Leimer, a Charlotte mother of four who has run a grain  
cooperative for the last five years, has been setting aside 
40-pound pails of grain for her family. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative Lutheran, Leimer is unsure whether the computer  
crisis is a sign of the endtimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Jesus said not to worry about tomorrow, since  
today has enough worries of its own,'' said Leimer, 38. ``I'm 
taking things a day at a time. ... If Jesus is coming, I want to be 
ready for that. We really just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some church groups view the attention on Y2K as an opportunity  
to minister to the physical needs of people who might be affected 
by power or banking disruptions. Hundreds of churches -- including 
Leimer's -- have held Y2K-awareness seminars, bringing in government 
and business leaders to provide practical information. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Wilson, who publishes a magazine and Web site on Y2K issues  
out of Crossland, Tenn., says churches got involved because in many 
areas they are ``about the only real community anymore in 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It only takes about two to three people in church to get a  
little worried,'' he said, ``and they tell others and soon they all 
say, `What can we do about it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaunti Feldahn, a former Federal Reserve Board analyst, started  
Joseph Project 2000 last summer to inform churches and pastors 
about the computer bug. Feldahn named her group after reading the 
Old Testament story of Joseph, who was sold into Egyptian slavery 
only to rise to become a prince and save the country from a coming 
famine by planning ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else is thinking about the church as their  
contingency plan,'' Feldahn said. ``We're saying get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At speaking engagements and conferences, Feldahn, 31, makes no  
predictions but urges churches to work together across 
denominational and racial lines to prepare by checking out their 
computers and calling their utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Congregations can band together to buy food and set up storage  
areas, Feldahn said. If the worst comes, she said, neighborhood 
churches will be able to give food to people who don't have cash. 
If there are few disruptions, she added, the food can be given to 
the needy. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 people attended the first conference in Atlanta in  
the fall, Feldahn said. Chapters in Toledo, Ohio, and Woodstock, 
Ga., have already met to discuss Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	A Joseph Project representative spoke recently at a  
church-sponsored Y2K meeting in Hendersonville, 20 miles south of 
Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose is to sort out fact from fiction and to inform  
people...,'' said the Rev. Jerry McClellan, a pastor who put the 
conference together. ``We're not saying to head for the hills and 
become survivalists. We want to say `Hey, region, this thing won't 
go away.'''

<HEADLINE> Sixers' Iverson Skips Road Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson, hobbled by injury and mired  
in a feud with 76ers coach Larry Brown, did not make a road trip to 
Toronto with the team Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, who exchanged words with Brown and sat out the last  
three quarters of an 85-80 loss to Cleveland on Friday night, 
stayed in Philadelphia to get treatment on a strained and severely 
bruised right quadriceps, team spokeswoman Karen Frascona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, will be re-evaluated Monday  
and is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The prolific, sometimes volatile superstar has had a rocky  
relationship with Brown since the coach arrived last season. With a 
scintillating start this season for Iverson and the team, both 
proclaimed their differences behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the old animosity flared up for all to see Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was benched for the opening 2:03 of the second quarter  
after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. When Brown told Iverson 
to go back into the game, Iverson muttered something that reporters 
sitting near the Sixers' bench reported as, ``It's about ... time 
you put me back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange was heard by reporters who sit courtside between  
the Sixers' bench and the scorer's table, where Iverson had been 
ready to check in. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pulled him out again, and Iverson sat the rest of the  
game. Iverson didn't even participate in halftime warmups or sit on 
the bench until the third quarter was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's official explanation was a strain to a right thigh  
that already had been severely bruised in a collision with the 
Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said he was not going to play at Toronto on Sunday and  
was doubtful for Tuesday's home game against Milwaukee because of 
his thigh. Brown and Iverson agreed that he should not make the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't gotten any better,'' Iverson said. ``I've never had  
anything like this before. Ever. ... It feels the same as when I 
first did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, without mentioning Iverson by name, questioned his  
players' maturity and whether winning was their primary focus in a 
postgame press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think mature guys who care about their teams step up,''  
Brown said. ``I don't think we have that maturity yet. ... I'm the 
coach and I have the right to play a guy or not play a guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute raised old questions about Iverson's compatibility  
with his coach. A year ago, Brown urged Iverson to become more of a 
playmaker instead of a shooter, publicly criticizing Iverson's 
running of the team, his defense and his off-the-court lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson responded by vowing he would ``remember everything come  
contract time'' -- although in January he signed a six-year, $70.9 
million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Iverson had an unexcused absence from practice March 11.  
In a brilliant move that forced Iverson to be accountable to his 
teammates, Brown had the team decide how to handle it. Brown 
followed the players' recommendation not to suspend Iverson, but 
the 23-year-old guard was warned that further transgressions would 
be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson tried to downplay Friday's quarrel.  
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no problems,'' he said after the game.  
``Everything ain't going to be peaches and cream all the time. But 
I don't have any problems with him.''

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce scored his first goal for  
San Jose and the Clash scored on four consecutive shots in a 
shootout to beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 2-1 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Cerritos, Eddie Lewis, John Doyle and Jamie Clark each  
connected for the Clash in the tiebreaker. Welton and Mauricio 
Cienfuegos scored for the Galaxy in the shootout, but goalie David 
Kramer stopped Daniel Hernandez and Clint Mathis for the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose (2-1) acquired Diaz Arce from New England in an  
offseason trade. The high-scoring forward put a one-touch shot off 
a cross by Lewis into the Los Angeles net nine minutes into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy (2-1) tied it when Mathis scored with just four

<HEADLINE> Hughes Wins $154 Mil. Patent Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. collected  
$154 million from the federal government, ending a 26-year legal 
battle that centered on pioneering technology still used to 
position satellites in orbit, the company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes sued the federal government in 1973, alleging the  
government used the technology without permission in the launch of 
dozens of communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes contended in the lawsuit that the technology, in which a  
single gas jet is used to position and orient a satellite so its 
antennas point toward Earth, made possible the satellite 
communications revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic concept is still being used today in some form,''  
Hughes spokeswoman Marcy Woodhull said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Claims Court Judge James Turner entered the $154 million  
judgment on March 12 and the money was paid to Hughes on Tuesday, 
Hughes said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The positioning technology was invented in 1959 by Hughes  
scientist Donald Williams. It was first used in 1963 to position a 
satellite Hughes built for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government challenged Hughes' attempt to patent the  
technology, saying it should hold the patent since it was used 
first on a government spacecraft. Hughes won the patent in 1973 and 
filed the lawsuit that same year seeking damages for government use 
of the technology on non-Hughes satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal attorneys argued the technology used in government  
satellites differed from that developed by Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., accepted a reported $75  
million from Ford Motor Co. in 1989 to settle a similar case.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to drop charges against the  
1,200 people arrested at protests sparked by the police shooting of 
an unarmed West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4  
outside his Bronx apartment when four police officers fired 41 
shots and struck him 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting led to daily demonstrations outside police  
headquarters in Manhattan where a number of prominent activists 
were arrested, including NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, and actors Ossie Davis and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a model demonstration, both on the part of the  
protesters and the police,'' District Attorney Robert Morgenthau 
said Friday. ``I just think it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Police Commissioner Howard Safir disagreed with the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my opinion that these summonses should have been  
prosecuted through the system with a judge making the final 
determination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four officers involved in the shooting were indicted  
Wednesday on charges of second-degree murder.

<HEADLINE> Melissa Creator To Plead Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of creating the so-called  
Melissa virus, which infected thousands of computers and overloaded 
e-mail systems worldwide, never intended to do anything wrong, his 
lawyer said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, a 30-year-old computer programmer, will plead  
innocent to the state charges, said lawyer Steven Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was arrested Thursday night at a brother's house in  
Eatontown. He faces charges that include interruption of public 
communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service -- charges 
that carry a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $480,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Altman said his client had been wrongfully portrayed as a  
dangerous computer-hacker and been victimized by the government's 
crackdown on high-tech crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computer world is a world where people do things,  
experimental things, just about every day,'' Altman said. ``Nothing 
he did, or intended to do, had a premeditated or wrongful intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was released Friday on $100,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's very upset, scared and nervous. This has been a horrible  
ordeal. They went in there as gangbusters -- local authorities, 
state police, the FBI. Ted Bundy, that's what they treated him 
like,'' Altman said, referring to the serial killer executed in 
Florida 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No court appearance had been scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	The virus spread around the world Monday like a chain letter,  
arriving in e-mail messages with the heading ``important message.'' 
It then caused affected computers to fire off 50 more infected 
messages, and the volume of e-mail slowed some systems to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who worked as an on-site consultant, or a troubleshooter,  
for AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham Park, employed by Iselin-based CGS 
Computer Associates, was tracked down by a task force of federal 
and state agents, with help from America Online technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL contacted state authorities after its own investigation  
turned up evidence that pointed to New Jersey, said Christopher 
Bubb, head of a state computer analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Saturday that investigators  
determined that the first copy of the Melissa virus originated from 
an account with Monmouth Internet Corp., based in Red Bank, and 
then traced it to Smith's telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Monmouth Internet gave New Jersey investigators records of  
Internet use on March 26, the day Melissa appeared, confirmed Mark 
R. Stevens, the company's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently frightened when the FBI posted a warning about  
Melissa last week, Smith threw his computer equipment into a trash 
bin at his apartment complex, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in  
documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known virus writer who 
calls himself VicodinES, but authorities said Smith was not the 
person known by that handle. They suspect Smith took two viruses, 
one of which came from VicodinES, and combined them with another 
virus to create Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicodin ES, or extra strength, also happens to be the name of a  
narcotic pain killer. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from Smith on Saturday. Altman would not  
say where he was staying.

<HEADLINE> Casinos Transform Poor US County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUNICA, Miss. (AP) -- In the engulfing whir and hum and jingle  
and jangle of a thousand slot machines, accented by the occasional 
Rebel yell of a jackpot winner, your brain has to do a fast rewind 
to remember that this cavernous casino sits -- floats? -- in what was 
once the poorest county in the poorest state in the Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would've ever thought it, out here in the middle of a  
Delta cotton field?'' muses Victor Vantore, maitre d' of the 
upscale Jack Binion's Steak House at the Horseshoe casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Having grown up on the other side of Choctaw Ridge (where Billy  
Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge) I remembered 
Tunica as a wretched rural backwater. The monotonously flat and 
treeless cotton and soybean fields stretching to the horizon were 
worked by miserably poor sharecroppers and field hands, many of 
whom lived in a squalid slum called ``Sugar Ditch'' for the open 
sewer running through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	For good reason, this corner of the Mississippi Delta was the  
birthplace of the blues, the mother of people like Muddy Waters, 
B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Gatemouth Brown and Pinetop Perkins. 
They put to music the wails of the plowboys and cotton pickers out 
sweating in the scorching Mississippi sun. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a group of reporters to  
Sugar Ditch and labeled Tunica County ``America's Ethiopia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, Sugar Ditch is long gone now, replaced by a 37-unit  
subsidized apartment building for the elderly and handicapped, part 
of a transformation in the 1990s dubbed the ``Tunica Miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driving after nightfall down from Memphis, Tenn., on newly  
four-laned U.S. 61, cutting arrow-straight through miles and miles 
of plowed-under cotton stalks, I was astonished by an apparition up 
ahead. It looked like Disney World in the darkness of the Delta -- 
buildings glowing, lights twinkling, searchlights sweeping the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The glow was coming from Tunica County's nine world-class,  
big-name, floating gambling casinos out near the Mississippi River 
levee, linked by well-lighted, four-lane roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	I felt like comedienne Joan Rivers, who asked the first time she  
stepped onto a Tunica casino stage, ``Where the (bleep) am I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be widely known beyond mid-America, but Tunica today  
is major league. Drawing 40,000 to 60,000 customers a day, the 
area's casinos, with 13,535 slot machines and 522 gaming tables, 
took in just under $1 billion in 1998, making this the 
third-largest gambling center in the country, behind only Las Vegas 
and Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	As Memphis magazine put it, ``Not since the glory days of Ole  
Miss football coach John Vaught and the heyday of Southern 
Democrats in Washington's seniority system has Mississippi enjoyed 
such national prominence in anything besides John Grisham novels 
and the poverty index.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1995, the last year for which figures are available,  
the Tunica casinos paid more than $85 million in state, city and 
county taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The AAA Auto Club South and the Travel Industry Association of  
America, in their annual predictions on summer travel, list Tunica 
County as one of their ``hot spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos have created 15,000 new jobs in a county of just  
9,500 men, women and children. Moreover, casino workers get medical 
insurance and other benefits whereas farm workers get none. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1992, the year gambling came to Tunica County,  
unemployment here was at 26.2 percent. Today it's down to 5.6 
percent. Per capita income rose from $11,856 in 1992 to $18,045 in 
1995. The number of people receiving food stamps fell 56 percent 
between 1992 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The beneficiaries are people like Gary Tyler, 22, who once  
worked for $4.25 an hour, then the minimum wage, at a fast-food 
joint. He's now a barback, an apprentice bartender, at a casino 
lounge. While his salary is just $5.50 an hour, ``on a good night 
I'll pick up $80 to $100 in tips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say everyone has benefited. There are still  
pockets of hopeless poverty in Tunica County, and some who once had 
money are now broke. There have been at least two reported suicides 
since the casinos opened. 
</P>
<P>
	In the local parlance, ``Their money's gone down to the boats.''  
</P>
<P>
	For all Tunica's outward trappings of wealth, some believe  
casino legislation, approved 22-20 by the state Senate in 1990, 
wouldn't survive a floor vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Rep. H.L. ``Sonny'' Merideth of the river town of  
Greenville, who as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee 
was a supporter of legalized gambling, now has second thoughts. 
``Those places take more local money out of the community than I 
ever dreamed of,'' he says. ``People in those places are gambling 
dollars that should be spent on food, clothes and shelter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation that would allow state colleges and universities to  
train casino workers has failed to pass in the past two sessions of 
the legislature, thanks to the opposition of people such as Paul 
Jones, executive director of the Christian Action Commission of the 
Mississippi Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	On my first night out, at Bally's Saloon, Gambling Hall &AMP; Hotel,  
I met Beth Gerard of Senatobia when I heard a slot machine spitting 
out quarters like the U.S. mint. She had just hit her second 
jackpot of the night, bringing her winnings to $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old brunette, with the looks of a Mississippi State  
cheerleader, formerly worked here for two years as a cocktail 
waitress, shuttling free drinks to the players. She says she 
averaged about $1,000 a week, mostly in tips. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make good money, but you have to put up with a lot,'' she  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Catching her drift, I ask if prostitution is a problem around  
the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking her head, she replies in a melodious drawl that only  
Mississippi women can manage, ``I think everybody goes to Memphis 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in three days and nights of cruising the casinos I  
spotted not one woman I took to be a ``working girl''; not one 
proposition, no single women hanging around the bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is, about the only skirts you'll see around here are  
those skimpy minis worn by the cocktail waitresses. The women all 
wear pants, and if you see a man in a suit, he's probably a 
floorwalker. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the working girls hang on the fringes. In mid-March, the  
owner of the Club Sigg nightclub in the town of Tunica, Van H. 
Siggers, was arrested on charges of distributing cocaine and 
marijuana and with transporting prostitutes across the state line 
to engage in ``nude dancing, prostitution ... and other sex acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this is mid-America, folks. The casino patrons are  
overwhelmingly middle-class white, fortyish to elderly, gray-haired 
women in jeans or pant suits, potbellied men wearing baseball caps 
and windbreakers. They come in droves by car and tour bus from as 
far away as Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	One old lady was seen maneuvering around the casino floor with a  
walker. Another was playing the slots with a tube leading from her 
nose to a portable oxygen tank, even though people were smoking all 
around her. Casinos have no no-smoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, Tunica's casinos are riverboats, but they're boats in  
name only. They sit on barges floating in slips cut into the river 
flats near the Mississippi. Their ancillary hotels, restaurants and 
other buildings are on dry land. Walking from a hotel or souvenir 
shop into a casino, it's hard to tell where the land stops and the 
riverboat begins. There is no motion. The only clue is a slight 
bump under the carpet where the two are joined. 
</P>
<P>
	Why must they float? Mississippi towns along the Gulf Coast and  
the Mississippi traditionally have offered tourists lively night 
life, with open bars and back-room gambling even when the entire 
state was legally dry. The state tax collector even collected a 
black market tax on the sale of this illegal liquor, and the local 
law officers simply looked the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	The riverboat law was an effort to restrict the casinos to the  
Coast and river and away from the more conservative inland areas. 
Today, when other counties or states start talking about legalizing 
gambling, the Tunica casino crowd joins forces with the preachers 
to put it down. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos represent gambling's heavyweights -- Bally's,  
Fitzgerald's, Gold Strike, The Grand, Harrah's, Hollywood, 
Horseshoe, Sheraton and Sam's Town. Their elaborate facades and 
themed decor remind one of their counterparts on the Las Vegas 
Strip. The themes include an Irish castle (with moat), an Old West 
town, a Southern plantation and a German hunting lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	It's surreal in a way, the size of these places. At the  
Hollywood casino a downsized replica of the sinking Titanic used as 
a prop in the filming of the movie now lies in a 500,000-gallon 
indoor pool of water. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, when Tunica got its first casino, there were only 16  
motel rooms in the county. Now there are just under 6,000. There 
were no golf courses. Now there are two. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos offer live entertainment nightly with headliners  
ranging from Jay Leno to Bill Cosby to Ray Charles to Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bally's has a 250-seat nightclub built into an authentic grain  
silo. The decibel level is off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bar in Bally's, where there's a video poker game embedded  
in the counter top in front of each stool, I ordered a Diet Coke 
and asked, ``How much?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever you'd like to leave,'' the bartender replies.  
</P>
<P>
	So, to look like a sport, I started dropping quarters in the  
blackjack machine in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coke wound up costing me $10.  
</P>
<P>
	Blackjack croupier Linda Davis, 48, used to work at a casino on  
the Choctaw Indian reservation in Philadelphia, Miss. She now 
commutes from West Memphis, Ark., about 50 miles away, to work the 
8 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift. With the dealers splitting their tips, she 
says she makes $31,000 to $38,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Why put up with such a long commute and awful hours?  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the casino atmosphere,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Donald Hampton must like it, too. Every three or four weeks he  
drives down from Poplar Bluff, Mo. This night he had just hit a 
$750 payoff on the $1 slots and was standing up waiting for his 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	I ask himwhat's the biggest jackpot he's ever hit. It was  
$2,250. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you ahead?'' I ask.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you ever get ahead of it?'' he asks back.

<HEADLINE> Twins Held in Family Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITTRELL, N.C. -- Investigators say they have no idea why twin  
11-year-old boys allegedly opened fire in their family's home, 
killing their father and wounding their mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins, whose names were not released, were each charged  
Friday with murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon 
after the incident the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were equally responsible. Both were equally involved,''  
said sheriff's Capt. John C. Shockley. 
</P>
<P>
	William Harvey Bawcum Jr., 46, heard the sound of bullets and  
bounded up the staircase to protect his wife, Shockley said. He was 
shot in the right cheek and throat and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen-year-old Robin Bawcum was hit below her right  
collarbone. Her mother, Deborah, 45, was wounded in her right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Bawcum was in fair condition and Mrs. Bawcum was in good  
condition at Duke University Medical Center late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say after the shootings, the boys waited for  
officers to arrive. Police were unsure who called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible, bloody mess. There was a lot of blood all  
through the house,'' Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they recovered a .32-caliber handgun.  
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department had no record of being called to the  
home 35 miles north of Raleigh for domestic disputes, but Shockley 
said after talking to Mrs. Bawcum, investigators ``understand 
they've had problems with school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Bawcum, a technician for the local telephone  
company, was an avid hunter and fishermen, and the boys practiced 
with BB guns on the family's thickly wooded lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where they learned to use guns,'' said Darlynn  
Oxendine, a family friend and a physical education teacher who was 
Robin's basketball and volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine, who spent hours consoling Deborah and Robin Bawcum at  
the hospital, said Mrs. Bawcum kept saying, ```He came up to save 
me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine said she was shocked by the shootings.  
</P>
<P>
	``All little boys are mischievous. But these boys you'd never  
imagine would shoot somebody,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A juvenile court hearing is scheduled next Wednesday. The boys  
were being held Friday in separate juvenile centers.

	NATO Troops May Enter Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO said today an international,  
alliance-led force could go into Kosovo to return refugees ahead of 
any signing by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of a Kosovo 
peace agreement. Until now, NATO was planning for a peacekeeping 
force on the ground in Kosovo only after compelling Milosevic to 
enter a peace agreement with the Kosovo Albanians. A NATO source 
said it was the first time the alliance was considering such a 
force without Milosevic first signing the draft agreement signed by 
Kosovo Albanians at peace talks in Rambouillet, France. 

</P>

	Clinton: No Target Is Off-Limits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration declared today that  
``no target is off-limits'' in the campaign to pressure Serb forces 
to end their campaign of repression in Kosovo. President Clinton, 
in his weekly radio address, declared the Kosovo operation ``a 
difficult and dangerous one, but it's necessary and right, and we 
must stand with all our NATO allies to see it through.'' Clinton 
also said the U.S. military would pitch in with humanitarian relief 
for what NATO spokesman Jamie Shea today called a ``demographic 
earthquake'' in the Balkans -- with 290,000 refugees having left 
Kosovo in the past 10 days and 300,000 more moving toward the 
border.

	Enraged Belgraders Curse NATO  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Enraged Belgraders cursed NATO today  
for attacking the heart of Yugoslavia's capital, while Western 
leaders made plans to airlift emergency supplies and send troops to 
help hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees overwhelming 
bordering regions. NATO cruise missiles destroyed the downtown 
Belgrade headquarters of some of President Slobodan Milosevic's 
security forces before dawn, escalating the mission to stop a 
terror campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Germany Prepares for Kosovo Role  
</P>
<P>
	AMBERG, Germany (AP) -- With the debate in NATO over sending  
ground troops into Kosovo growing, Germans used to watching their 
soldiers sit out allied operations because of World War II 
inhibitions are nervously preparing to do their part this time. 
Three thousand German soldiers are already in Macedonia, a quarter 
of the NATO force on standby there to monitor a hoped-for peace 
agreement. Germany's Nazi past fostered strong pacifist sentiments 
that kept the German army at home for decades. Still, a recent poll 
found 62 percent of Germans supported the army's participation in 
the NATO action, while 31 percent opposed it.

	Farmers Urged To Prepare for Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a dim agricultural forecast this year,  
farm families should begin now to assess their financial situation 
and adjust their spending habits, advises Janet Bechman, a Purdue 
University extension specialist in consumer sciences. Last year's 
price collapse has affected agricultural commodities from grains to 
livestocks. Forecasts for this year project little improvement as 
the Asian economic crisis continues and the market for U.S. goods 
abroad declines. The Agriculture Department predicts net farm 
income for 1999 will drop $3.4 billion, to $44.6 billion.

	China Dissidents Appeal To U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A member of a banned Chinese opposition party has  
written to President Clinton urging him to mention the beleaguered 
party's plight when he meets with China's premier in Washington. 
Gao Hongmin, in a letter dated today and faxed to The Associated 
Press, asked Clinton to encourage Premier Zhu Rongji to back human 
rights improvements that would give Chinese freedom to voice their 
opinions and form opposition parties. Zhu leaves Tuesday for a trip 
to the United States and Canada.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to drop charges against the  
1,200 people arrested at protests sparked by the police shooting of 
an unarmed West African immigrant. Amadou Diallo, a street vendor 
from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4 outside his Bronx apartment when 
four police officers fired 41 shots and struck him 19 times. The 
shooting led to daily demonstrations outside police headquarters in 
Manhattan where a number of prominent activists were arrested.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott reportedly has a second offer for  
her controlling shares in the Cincinnati Reds and Schott's limited 
partners appear to be willing to exercise their option to acquire 
her shares. The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Post 
reported today that the limited partners, led by financier Carl 
Lindner, have offered to match Cleveland lawyer Larry Dolan's $65 
million offer for most of her shares. Both also reported that Steve 
Schott, a cousin of Marge Schott's late husband, heads a group that 
has made a rival offer.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Wins Ashland Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Silverbulletday made her case for a  
Kentucky Derby entry today, coming from off the pace in the 
backstretch at Keeneland to win the $500,000 Ashland Stakes going 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bob Baffert-trained filly ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:41.72,  
winning by seven lengths over Marley Vale. Gold From The West was 
third. The time was a record for the stakes at its current 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Mike Pegram, who looked like he worked up more of a sweat  
than his filly, mopped his brow with a shredded napkin as he ducked 
questions about whether Silverbulletday would try to extend her 
six-race winning streak in the Kentucky Derby on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all have got to realize the Kentucky Derby is a  
mile-and-a-quarter, and is that in the best interests of the 
filly?'' he said. ``That's what we've got to decide, and I'm glad 
Bobby (Baffert) is going to have to make that decision and not 
me.''

<P>
	Baffert was in California at the Santa Anita Derby, watching his  
3-year-old colts General Challenge and Prime Timber finish 1-2 in 
their final Kentucky Derby tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Jerry Bailey said Silverbulletday, who has now won nine  
of 10 lifetime starts, including last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies, reminded him of an earlier champion mount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of shades of Cigar,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was never worried,'' he said. ``In the first turn, she threw  
her ears up and she really got herself into the race. She's as good 
a filly as I've ridden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sent off as a 1-5 favorite in the six-horse field,  
Silverbulletday paid $2.60, $2.40 and $2.10, Marley Vale $3.60 and 
2.10 and Gold From The West $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	On a muddy track, Silverbulletday stayed wide around the first  
turn and was three-wide along the backstretch. Marley Vale sprinted 
clear from the start and led by 3 1/2 lengths at the half-mile over 
Gold From The West, with Silverbulletday another four lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey pushed Silverbulletday up to challenge around the second  
turn and she caught Marley Vale at the top of the stretch, then 
pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things as an owner you look at it the way the jockey gets  
off the horse,'' Pegram said. ``I'll never forget when I was here 
last October, when Gary (Stevens) got off Silverbulletday (after 
the Alcibiades Stakes) and he said, `Wow, this filly is special.' 
You know, you've seen the same look on Jerry's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram won the Kentucky Derby last year with a Baffert-trained  
colt, Real Quiet. He said that experience has kept him from being 
overly eager to run Silverbulletday in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I thought this was the last time I was going to have a good  
horse, then, yeah, I'd probably get a little Derby fever,'' he 
said. ``But this sweat is not from Derby fever. This sweat's from 
happiness and seeing this filly run the way that she ran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Silverbulletday does not run in the Derby, she will go in the  
Derby eve Kentucky Oaks, Pegram said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will guarantee you guys one thing: She will not run in  
both'' the Oaks and the Derby, he said.

<HEADLINE> Twins Held in Family Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITTRELL, N.C. -- Investigators say they have no idea why twin  
11-year-old boys allegedly opened fire in their family's home, 
killing their father and wounding their mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins, whose names were not released, were each charged  
Friday with murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon 
after the incident the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were equally responsible. Both were equally involved,''  
said sheriff's Capt. John C. Shockley. 
</P>
<P>
	William Harvey Bawcum Jr., 46, heard the sound of bullets and  
bounded up the staircase to protect his wife, Shockley said. He was 
shot in the right cheek and throat and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen-year-old Robin Bawcum was hit below her right  
collarbone. Her mother, Deborah, 45, was wounded in her right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Bawcum was in fair condition and Mrs. Bawcum was in good  
condition at Duke University Medical Center late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say after the shootings, the boys waited for  
officers to arrive. Police were unsure who called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible, bloody mess. There was a lot of blood all  
through the house,'' Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they recovered a .32-caliber handgun.  
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department had no record of being called to the  
home 35 miles north of Raleigh for domestic disputes, but Shockley 
said after talking to Mrs. Bawcum, investigators ``understand 
they've had problems with school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Bawcum, a technician for the local telephone  
company, was an avid hunter and fishermen, and the boys practiced 
with BB guns on the family's thickly wooded lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where they learned to use guns,'' said Darlynn  
Oxendine, a family friend and a physical education teacher who was 
Robin's basketball and volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine, who spent hours consoling Deborah and Robin Bawcum at  
the hospital, said Mrs. Bawcum kept saying, ```He came up to save 
me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine said she was shocked by the shootings.  
</P>
<P>
	``All little boys are mischievous. But these boys you'd never  
imagine would shoot somebody,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A juvenile court hearing is scheduled next Wednesday. The boys  
were being held Friday in separate juvenile centers.

<HEADLINE> 34 Injured in Ohio Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- A bus carrying high school students returning  
from a tour of Canada went off an interstate highway Saturday and 
landed in an embankment, injuring 34 people, the State Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, Robert G. Shattuck, 55, of Peebles, apparently  
fell asleep while traveling on Interstate 75 about four miles south 
of Lima. He was cited for impaired alertness, said Sgt. Mary 
Cosgrove of the patrol's Lima post. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said the bus, owned by Croswell Bus Lines of  
Williamsburg, veered off the right side of the road at 6:15 a.m., 
traveled 700 feet down a hill, smashed into a tree and landed in 
the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	On board were 41 people, 34 of whom were students taking part in  
the four-day tour, sponsored by Wittenberg University in 
Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said 27 of the injured were taken to Lima Memorial  
Hospital and seven to St. Rita's Medical Center. All were treated 
and released with injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to neck 
and back strains and dizziness.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Ohio Tornado Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	XENIA, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Louderback was only 5 years old when he  
stood at his window and saw a devastating tornado moving near his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom and Dad covered me, shielding my body from flying bricks  
and shattered glass,'' Louderback recalled. ``The deafening wind 
sounded like a team of fighter jets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the massive, swirling black cloud left on April 3,  
1974, more than 30 people were dead and 2,200 homes and businesses 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the survivors in this southwest Ohio city gathered  
Wednesday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the terrifying 
ordeal -- and to raise public awareness about the danger of 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can this happen again? Certainly,'' said Dan McCarthy, a  
meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction 
Center. ``But we feel confident that now we have the technology and 
we have the knowledge that we can cut the number of deaths down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado that hit Xenia marked the worst tornado outbreak in  
U.S. history, with 148 tornadoes clawing through 13 states east of 
the Mississippi. The storms killed 330 people and injured 5,484. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak began the afternoon of April 3 and ended more than  
16 hours later, carving a 2,598-mile path. At one point, 15 
twisters were on the ground at the same time. One was on the ground 
for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In Xenia, population 25,000, the tornado destroyed the  
Louderbacks home. Jeff's mother, Rebecca, recalled emerging from 
the rubble when the storm had passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably very similar to the aftermath of a bomb,'' she  
said. ``It was eerily quiet. Then you started to hear children 
crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the weather service, the 1974 outbreak debunked  
several myths, including the notion that tornadoes won't touch down 
where major rivers meet or that tornadoes won't go up and down 
steep hills. 
</P>
<P>
	It also produced engineering studies which concluded that  
hallways provide the greatest safety in schools, while gyms with 
large roofs and classrooms with outside walls are the most 
dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
	John Forsing, director of the weather service's eastern region,  
said technology has improved to the point that warnings on average 
are issued 11 minutes before tornadoes touch down. He said people 
need to heed those warnings because another outbreak like the one 
in 1974 is certain to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all know it will -- someplace, sometime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Urged To Prepare for Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a dim agricultural forecast this year,  
farm families should begin now to assess their financial situation 
and adjust their spending habits, an expert advises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes people are kind of vague about where they're  
spending their money,'' said Janet Bechman, a Purdue University 
extension specialist in consumer sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should make sure they write things down and not just base  
their decision on the way they think things are but the way they 
really are,'' said Bechman, one of several Purdue officials who 
gave hog farmers financial advice during a recent tour around 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's price collapse has affected agricultural commodities  
from grains to livestocks. Hog farmers, for example, have seen 
prices fall to about 8 cents per pounds, the lowest in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for this year project little improvement as the Asian  
economic crisis continues and the market for U.S. goods abroad 
declines. The Agriculture Department predicts net farm income for 
1999 will drop $3.4 billion, to $44.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're watching all of our costs of living,'' said John  
Diettrich, who runs a 3,500 acre corn and soybean farm in Tilden, 
Neb., with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hold off on expenditures. You just don't make expenditures  
that a family normally would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good business practices are even more important these days for  
any farm operation, from shopping for the lowest prices and 
figuring out the best time to buy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also can adjust their planting patterns and switch to  
more profitable crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Diettrich said his operation normally grows 20 percent soybeans  
and 80 percent corn. This year, the mix is 40 percent soybeans and 
60 percent corn because soybeans have lower production costs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As families plot their financial future, parents should involve  
children who are old enough to participate in the discussion, 
Bechman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just start thinking about what's important to each one or the  
family as a whole,'' Bechman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you figure out which is important, it's a little bit  
easier to look at things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bechman said families must determine what they can do without  
and what that means: cutting back on a child's extracurricular 
activities or going without cable television or vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of looking at what you're doing, looking at the  
reason you're doing it and seeing if there might be a less 
expensive alternative,'' Bechman said. ``It's saying, 'the reason 
we do this recreation stuff is so we can all be together but do we 
need to go to Disney World so we can all be together.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever families decide, the decisions should come earlier  
rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where the longer you put it off, the  
more drastic changes you have to make,'' Bechman said.

<HEADLINE> Koznick Wins Final NorAM Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEND, Ore. (AP) -- World Cup veteran Kristina Koznick of  
Burnsville, Minn., took the first-run lead Saturday and, despite a 
winter-like snowstorm and 13-degree weather, made it stand up to 
win the final NorAm Cup slalom of the season as U.S. women swept 
the top four places. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick had a two-run time of 1 minute, 34.87 seconds, .13  
faster than Sarah Schleper of Vail, Colo., who's coming back from a 
knee ligament injury and broken leg in December. Tasha Nelson of 
Mound, Minn., was third and Alex Shaffer of Park City, Utah, 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Uros Pavlovcic of Slovenia, who won the U.S. giant slalom title  
10 days ago, took the final men's NorAm slalom in 1:36.48 with Andy 
LeRoy of Silverthorne, Colo., finishing second to clinch the men's 
slalom title. 
</P>
<P>
	The NorAm women's slalom championship went to Genevieve Simard,  
who finished 12th Saturday. Canadian Jeff Durand, the downhill 
champion and runnerup in super-G behind Scott Macartney of Redmond, 
Wash., won the men's overall title. 
</P>
<P>
	Alison Powers of Fraser, Colo., a downhill and super-G racer,  
clinched the women's overall crown Friday when she also won the 
super-G championship. On Saturday, she was 29th in the slalom.

<HEADLINE> La. Twister Kills 3, Injures 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- A tornado tore through this northwestern  
Louisiana town Saturday, flattening homes and trapping people 
inside when walls collapsed around them. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three were killed when the twister swept through a  
trailer park just north of Shreveport and destroyed at least 30 
house trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still searching and have so much to go through, there's  
no way of telling what the end total will be,'' said Bossier Parish 
Coroner Dawn Young. 
</P>
<P>
	KTAL-TV quoted sheriff's deputies and rescue workers on the  
scene saying there were six dead. Two died in a house trailer park 
and four others died in homes, KTAL reported. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people were injured, said Trooper Chris Johnson of the  
Louisiana State Police. Injuries ranged cuts and bruises to broken 
bones and more serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister struck about 4 p.m. Some people were still missing  
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities went house to house looking for injured or dead, but  
decided they would have to bring in backhoes and front end loaders 
to remove fallen wall panels and roofs. They were also using dogs 
that are trained to find corpses and live accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of rubble to sift through,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The center of destruction was the Hay Meadow Trailer Park.  
Twisted trees and flipped cars were mixed in with the wreckage of 
the house trailers, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even tell it was a trailer park,'' Johnson said.  
``It looks like a trash heap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said the twister was 300 yards wide  
when it passed through north Shreveport on its way to Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	KSLA-TV also reported that a tornado destroyed the First United  
Methodist Church in Logansport, a town southwest of Shreveport near 
the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado or severe winds also downed trees, damaged some homes  
and caused minor injuries in Shreveport, said Chuck Mazziotti, 
director of the Caddo Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Benton resident Mary Maxwell said the tornado destroyed between  
15 and 20 homes in her neighborhood but didn't do any damage to her 
house. She said there were about seven trailers in the trailer 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents had to use an ax to break through the wreckage of one  
trailer to extricate a family of five, she said. Another neighbor's 
large truck simply disappeared from the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone, they just can't find it,'' Maxwell said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, severe storms brought floodwaters across the  
southern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty people were evacuated to emergency shelters in the  
Bootheel as flash floods swept across Fredericktown. People were 
rescued from the roofs of homes, one of them carried to safety by a 
helicopter

<HEADLINE> 'Apocalyptic' Books Now Big Sellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The approach of the year 2000 may be a  
devil of a problem for computer programmers, but it's heavenly for 
the $3 billion Christian book market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores specializing in Christian products have seen a big  
increase in sales of books about endtime prophecies and the Y2K 
computer bug as believers become more focused on what might happen 
when the calendar turns to Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the books examine current world events in a biblical  
context and conclude the time is ripe for the return of Jesus 
Christ. Others offer dire, Bible-based predictions of what may 
occur if computers fail worldwide because of the highly publicized 
year 2000 glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the books are novels; others are classified as  
nonfiction. All are selling like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nationwide trend,'' said Chris Rogers, merchandising  
vice president of Lifeway Christian Resources, a Nashville, Tenn., 
company with 81 Baptist bookstores in 20 states. ``No doubt about 
it, it's going to build.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a Christian, Liz Dyson loves reading about what the future  
may bring. As the owner of Lemstone Books in suburban Birmingham, 
she likes the surging sales of endtime books, which are second only 
to Bibles in volume at her mall store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows what's going to happen, really, and you see so  
much happening that was prophesied,'' said Mrs. Dyson. ``You see 
weather patterns changing, and nation against nation. People are 
wondering how much longer it can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Stone has noticed a tremendous increase in sales of  
endtime books in recent months at Faith Book Store where she works 
in Gardendale, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we get them in, they're gone,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Book stores trace much of the interest in the endtime genre to  
fear over the computer problem known as Y2K. Books such as the 
popular ``Millennium Meltdown'' discuss what could happen if 
computers programmed to read years by two digits only, confuse the 
``00'' in 2000 with 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the Christian Booksellers  
Association, said three of the top seven books on the group's 
nonfiction best seller list deal directly with Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Also driving up sales are the Christian novels known as the  
``Left Behind'' series. The books by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, 
along with a related children's series and audio books, have sold 
3.2 million copies since 1995. The fifth book in the series, 
``Apollyon,'' debuted recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The books, written like action novels with plenty of references  
to Bible verses, describe what will happen in the years following 
an event known as ``The Rapture,'' when many Christians believe the 
faithful will be taken to heaven in an instant before chaos 
envelops the world. Some claim the Y2K bug may be a precursor of 
those tumultuous times. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as she enjoys perusing the endtime section of her  
Christian book store, Mrs. Dyson isn't staying up nights fretting 
over the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about it,'' she said, ``because I know God's  
going to take care of me.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Trademark Revoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins intends to appeal the  
ruling of a federal panel that the National Football League team 
should lose its trademark protections because its name may 
disparage American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it believed the decision Friday by the  
three-member Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to cancel the 
trademark registrations is incorrect and that it will appeal to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit here. 
</P>
<P>
	The board had granted a petition filed by seven American Indians  
in September 1992 to cancel the team's trademark registrations 
because of a federal law that prohibits registering ``disparaging'' 
names and logos. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling, the trademark board said the derogatory  
connotation of the word ``redskins'' extends to the football team's 
name, such that it ``may be disparaging of Native Americans to a 
substantial composition of this group of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzan Shown Harjo, one of the petitioners, said the board's  
ruling sent a strong message that racial slurs should not be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the last vestiges of overt racism right out in  
public in America, and it happens on a weekly basis during sports 
season,'' said Harjo, who is president of the Morning Star 
Institute, an American Indian advocacy group. ``This is the worst 
name you can call Native Americans in the English language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board's decision strips the team and NFL Properties Inc. of  
federally protected exclusive rights for using and licensing the 
Redskins name and logos for merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Redskins, John Paul Reiner, said the ruling  
does not affect the team's use of its trademark. ``The club will 
continue to use it as a team name and license it for logos and 
merchandising,'' he said. ``This decision affects only the 
registration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the club also defended the use of the name,  
saying: ``The Redskins believe its name honors Native Americans and 
has for the past 67 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the trademark board said it was not convinced that American  
Indians supported the use of the name Washington Redskins and that 
the petitioners provided evidence to support the opposite 
conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Upset Steinbrenner's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Acting New York Yankees manager Don Zimmer  
reacted angrily Saturday night to remarks earlier in the day by 
owner George Steinbrenner concerning pitcher Hideki Irabu. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the Yankees' exhibition game against the Los  
Angeles Dodgers, Zimmer said his mind ``isn't going to be changed 
by anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reference was to Zimmer's announcement Friday that Ramiro  
Mendoza, not Irabu, will pitch Wednesday at Oakland in the third 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Steinbrenner said it was his hope Irabu would  
pitch Wednesday, but added, ``His role will be determined by the 
manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His teammates are anxious to have him back,'' Steinbrenner  
said in Tampa, Fla. ``He will do fine. It's a good day for the 
Yankees,'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if what Steinbrenner said was a slap at his  
authority, Zimmer replied, ``We'll find out. I'm ready for 
anything, and don't give a damn about it, either. I'm the manager, 
I try to do what's right for the ballclub. My mind is not going to 
be changed by anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If given an ultimatum that Irabu is to pitch Wednesday, Zimmer  
said, ``Would I resign? It won't be resigning if something happens. 
I'd quit. I'm not saying I'm quitting, but ain't nobody going to 
tell me one thing and double-talk me on something else. He's fired 
a lot better people than me. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that every time (Steinbrenner) has walked into  
the coach's room for the last week, he's emphasized `Joe's not 
here, you run the team.' That's what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he tried to phone Steinbrenner three different times  
Saturday, but was unable to make contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner has been a friend of mine, George  
Steinbrenner has done a lot of good things for me,'' said Zimmer, 
who is filling in as manager for Joe Torre, who underwent surgery 
for prostate cancer last month. ``This man, every time I've been 
fired, he's always been one of the first to call me. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner has been good to me, but, to me, you can't  
sit back here and be a little wimp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu remained in Tampa when the Yankees left for California and  
their two-game series with the Dodgers, and was expected to remain 
there for at least a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he departed Saturday after several meetings and a  
one-hour workout at the Yankees' minor-league facility. It's 
believed he'll rejoin the team for Sunday's exhibition finale at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu upset Steinbrenner by failing to cover first base in a  
spring game on Thursday for the second time in a week, and the 
owner called the pitcher a ``fat ... toad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Steinbrenner indicated the pitcher might not rejoin  
the Yankees on Tuesday, as previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu had an extensive 18-minute bullpen session Saturday with  
Yankees director of player personnel Billy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, meanwhile, met with Irabu's agent, Don Nomura.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted Hideki to know we are all behind him,'' Steinbrenner  
said. ``I'm glad he spent the two days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner did not address the specific reasons behind  
Saturday's decision and Irabu didn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu has struggled this spring, going 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA. He  
has allowed 19 runs -- 18 earned -- and 30 hits in 19 1-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> New England Paintings Showcased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Dwight Eisenhower became president nearly  
a half-century ago, a jokester said the first sign of a more 
conservative administration came when Abercrombie and Fitch 
displayed a four-button suit -- the style of a half-century before. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome portrait of a man in a four-button suit hangs in one  
of the first rooms of a show that opened Friday at the National 
Gallery of American Art. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit tells how the values of old New England, both  
conservative and liberal, have helped shape U.S. history. For 
people less interested in history, it sugarcoats the lesson with 
paintings by artists from Winslow Homer to Norman Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-button man was the Rev. Thomas Wentworth Higginson,  
painted in 1893 by Frank W. Benson, one of uppercrust Boston's most 
admired portraitists. Higginson's conservative background didn't 
keep him from opposing slavery before the Civil War, so radically 
that his parishioners forced him out of his first pulpit. During 
the war he became colonel of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the 
earliest regiment of freed slaves in the Union army. 
</P>
<P>
	In the show, his portrait hangs near Augustus St. Gaudens'  
sternly erect statue of ``The Puritan.'' The puritan is holding 
back his cape to reveal a coat of the 1600s with no fewer than 20 
buttons down the front. His left hand clutches a big brass-bound 
Bible, his right a long cudgel. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 173 items: books, photos, posters -- even a piece of  
needlework by Marguerite Zorach and her better-known husband, 
William Zorach. During World War II, he worked on decorating 
federal buildings in Washington. The picture, ``Maine Islands,'' 
shows two nude couples on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't want to imagine Maine so free, especially so  
mosquito-free, that one could strip down in nature?'' asks Bruce 
Robertson in the show's catalogue. He teaches art history at the 
University of California in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with the period from the end of the Civil War to the end  
of World War II, the exhibit notes the romantic picture that 
artists often gave to earlier centuries. Sections of the show have 
ironic titles like ``Gilded Age Pilgrims'' and ``The Discreet Charm 
of the Colonial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A snowy landscape by Grandma Moses is ``determined to bring  
alive the `good old days,''' says the catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	It also tells the story of the industrialization of New England,  
with its huge textile and shoe factories, its de-industrialization 
as other parts of the country competed successfully -- and its 
re-industrialization after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	There are photos of a mill girl of 1895 with demure face and  
filthy apron, applying dye to shoes; of Italian immigrant boys 
playing in front of Paul Revere's house; and dreary cityscapes with 
stark factories painted by Stuart Davis, Stefan Hirsch and Charles 
Sheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Picturing Old New England: Image and Memory'' will be at the  
National Gallery of American Art through Aug. 22. Admission is 
free.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Family Displays 'Eggshelland' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNDHURST, Ohio (AP) -- The Manolio family of suburban Cleveland  
started collecting eggshells during President Dwight Eisenhower's 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years and 44,000 eggshells later, the family is still  
going strong, creating a colored egg display each Easter and 
drawing bigger drive-by crowds each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our neighbors are very, very nice about it,'' Betty Manolio  
said. ``There has only been one person that complained, and it was 
about the traffic on Ridgebury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her five grown children, four in the Cleveland area and one in  
Pittsburgh, still return to the old homestead each spring to help 
with the three-week routine of setting up the display dubbed 
Eggshelland. 
</P>
<P>
	One of seven grandchildren is old enough to help out. The others  
get a wide-eyed chance to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Where do you come up with more than 3,600 dozen eggs?  
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, friends and relatives have saved about 30,000  
and two Lyndhurst restaurants have donated their shells. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband and I go in when they get their shipments, about  
once a week, and we drain the eggs. Then they use them for making 
bread, or whatever they need them for,'' Mrs. Manolio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manolios use a stick to poke a hole the size of a dime in  
the eggs and empty them. The eggshells are then washed and the 
edges of the holes are trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	After painting, the shells are stored by color in boxes, with  
250 shells in each box. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertain spring weather off Lake Erie can be troublesome for  
the display. Snow and rain won't hurt the shells, but wind and hail 
can be damaging. Last year, just before Easter, a hailstorm 
destroyed 10,238. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manolios got the idea for Eggshelland in 1957 when Ron  
Manolio's mother put dyed eggshells on bushes in front of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband said it was a good idea because no one really does  
anything for Easter,'' Mrs. Manolio said.

<HEADLINE> US Tops Iran in Wrestling World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Kerry McCoy pinned Iran's Ebrahim Mehraban  
in the final heavyweight match of the 27th World Cup of Wrestling 
to lead the United States to the team title on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy, of State College, Pa., pinned Mehraban after 1:03 to cap  
the United States' 4-0 finish in the two-day, round-robin event. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran, which finished 3-1, took second. Cuba (2-2) was third,  
with Germany (1-3) and Canada (0-4) taking the final two spots. 
</P>
<P>
	In the championship match, Iran took an early lead by winning  
the two lowest weight categories. Gholam Reza Mohammadi won by 
technical fall over Sammie Henson of Norman, Okla., in the 
119-pound class, and Ali Rezar Dabier won by decision over Tony 
Purler of Clarion, Pa., in the 127 3/4-pound event. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States captured the next four events with victories  
by Cary Kolat of Bellefonte, Pa. (138 3/4 pounds); Lincoln McIlravy of 
Iowa City, Iowa (152 pounds); Steve Marianetti of Urbana, Ill. 
(167 1/2 pounds); and Les Gutches of Corvallis, Ore. (187 1/4 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
	In the 213 3/4-pound event, Iran's Ali Reza Heidari won by decision  
over J.J. McGrew of Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	In the match for third place, Cuba beat Germany 19-11.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba opened with four wins in the four lowest weight categories.  
German wrestlers took two of the four highest weight classes, with 
Cuba's Alexis Rodriguez winning a decision over Sven Theile in the 
286-pounds-and-over heavyweight class. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada failed to advance to the final session after losing to  
the United States and Germany earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tournament format, the five teams competed in a series  
of dual meets over two days. The teams were chosen based on the 
performance of their wrestlers at the World Championships last 
September in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Six teams were supposed to compete, but the defending champion  
Russian team did not arrive. The conflict in Kosovo led to the 
closure of the U.S. embassy in Moscow, and the wrestlers' visas 
were inside the embassy and could not be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has dominated the World Cup in the 1990s,  
winning seven of nine team titles, including Saturday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	An international event, the World Cup is a step below world  
championship or Olympic competitions, but some team members are 
likely to compete for Olympic berths.

<HEADLINE> Duval in Spotlight for Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- All David Duval could do was wait and watch.  
</P>
<P>
	He signed for a 67 and sat in the white clapboard lodge known as  
Jones Cabin, next to the 10th tee at Augusta National Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara, who had birdied the 17th to pull into a tie, was  
standing over a 20-foot birdie putt at the 18th -- virtually the 
same putt Duval had missed moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry, David,'' Augusta chairman Jack Stephens told him.  
``Nobody ever makes that putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been 10 years since anyone had won the Masters with a  
birdie putt at the 18th hole. Only Arnold Palmer in 1960 had 
birdied the final two holes to win. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no mistaking that roar for O'Meara.  
</P>
<P>
	With shocking suddenness, the tournament was over. Before  
leaving the room for the green jacket presentation in Butler Cabin, 
Stephens looked over at Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good tournament,'' he said. ``We'll look forward to seeing you  
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval returns to Augusta National Thursday, not as the hard-luck  
runner-up but as the No. 1 player in the world whose resume lacks 
only a major. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Masters was the first time he had been in contention at  
a major. The outcome left a feeling he later described as getting 
kicked in the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	But from that experience, and a stunning stretch of golf that  
followed, Duval will drive down Magnolia Lane riding a wave of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in my mind I can win that golf  
tournament,'' he said. ``I know I can beat the players. It's just a 
matter of being on my game and playing well to do it. It's no 
guarantee I will, but I have proven I can do it. I have proven it 
to myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has proven it to the world. Duval has won 10 times in his  
last 33 tournaments, the best stretch of golf since Tom Watson went 
10-for-25 during the Carter administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winners-only field in Hawaii, Duval won by nine strokes.  
He was seven strokes back in the final round of the Hope Classic 
and turned in the only Sunday 59 in tour history to win again. And 
after taking three weeks off, he beat the best field of the year in 
The Players Championship to rise to No. 1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Fred Couples in 1992 has anyone come into the Masters  
on this kind of roll, with expectations this high. Couples was the 
last player to be ranked No. 1 without having won a major, and he 
won the Masters a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the 63rd Masters could be one of the most intriguing  
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the best young players in golf -- Duval, Tiger Woods and  
Ernie Els -- have each won at least once this year and could start 
an anxiously awaited rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara proved last year how valuable experience can be in the  
Masters, winning the green jacket in his 15th try. Greg Norman is 
still trying to get into the Champions Locker Room, this year with 
a healthy left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will set a record with his 45th straight appearance,  
while Jack Nicklaus had hip replacement surgery and will miss the 
Masters for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta itself has gone through a reconstruction. Two holes play  
25 yards longer, there are new pine trees at the par-5 15th, a new 
green at No. 11 and rough only as deep as a golf ball, but still 
twice as high as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most eyes will be on the 27-year-old Duval, whose success  
has a lot to do with patience and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	He never got upset when he finished second seven times before  
his first PGA Tour victory. He never thought once about changing 
his game, which was good enough for an 11th-place finish on the 
money list when he was a rookie and no worse than that since. 
</P>
<P>
	``David has gotten over the hurdle of winning on Sunday,'' Nick  
Price said. ``All he has to do is realize that he's beaten the guys 
in a major championship. Once he realizes that, he's going to win a 
couple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago, the player who was going to win a bunch of majors  
was Woods, and the Masters figured to be his domain. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus once predicted that Woods would win as many green  
jackets as he and Palmer combined (10). That didn't look too 
far-fetched when Woods won his first Masters as a professional by a 
record 12 strokes with a record 270. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two years ago has gone by pretty quick in my life,'' said  
Woods, who hasn't won a major since. 
</P>
<P>
	With Duval getting all the attention, Woods could capitalize. He  
has won only twice on the PGA Tour over the past 21 months, but he 
is never far from the lead -- six top-10 finishes this year in only 
eight tournaments, including a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made some improvements in my game and I'm getting better  
each year,'' Woods said. ``It's only a matter of time before things 
start clicking. I know how it felt to put on a green jacket, and 
hopefully I'll do the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els, the two-time U.S. Open champion, could be the third part of  
this generation's ``Big Three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that is missing is a showdown between the best young players  
on the most important stage in golf -- a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine that will happen in time,'' O'Meara said.  
</P>
<P>
	What better place than Augusta?  
</P>
<P>
	The Masters gave us the great rivalry between Ben Hogan and Sam  
Snead during the early 1950s. Palmer and Nicklaus first went 
head-to-head in the U.S. Open, but the Masters is where their 
rivalry blossomed during the '60s. Both times Tom Watson won a 
green jacket, Nicklaus was a runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great if you get guys like David and Tiger, both of  
them playing well at Augusta,'' Els said. ``That should be one hell 
of a shootout, because they hit the ball the same way and that 
would be exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Els wouldn't love to be part of that mix again, this  
time with a major championship at stake. Or Justin Leonard, the 
1997 British Open champion. Or Phil Mickelson, a 13-time winner on 
tour who is still looking for his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if all these players can get together and  
play well in a major,'' Els said. ``You will remember that for a 
long time.''

<HEADLINE> At Least Nine Killed in La. Twister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- A tornado tore through this northwestern  
Louisiana town Saturday, flattening homes and trapping people 
inside when walls collapsed around them. At least nine people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister swept through trailer parks just north of  
Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said six were killed at the Twin Point Trailer Park  
and three died at the Hay Meadow Trailer Park. At least 30 house 
trailers were destroyed in the Hay Meadow park. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people were injured, said Trooper Chris Johnson of the  
Louisiana State Police. Injuries ranged cuts and bruises to broken 
bones and more serious injuries. Local hospitals reported at least 
five people in critical conditon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the afternoon twister hit, authorities were still  
looking for missing people, using police dogs and huge searchlights 
from nearby Barksdale Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some children and moms missing in both trailer  
parks,'' said Lt. Mike Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Bossier Parish Coroner Dawn Young said the death toll could rise  
even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still searching and have so much to go through, there's  
no way of telling what the end total will be,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, Gov. Mel Carnahan declared a state of emergency in  
southern and east-central Missouri late Saturday night after severe 
storms caused flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana authorities went house to house looking for injured or  
dead, but decided they would have to bring in backhoes and front 
end loaders to remove fallen wall panels and roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Johnson, manager of the Silver Dollar Bingo, a cement  
block building next to the Hay Meadow trailer park, said about 20 
people were getting ready to start playing when the twister hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden it just sucked the doors open,'' he said.  
``The napkins, trash cans and everything else just all started 
moving around. The people just huddled together in the center of 
the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado tore off part of the roof, but none of the players  
were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hay Meadow Trailer Park, twisted trees and flipped cars  
were mixed in with the wreckage of the house trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even tell it was a trailer park,'' Johnson said.  
``It looks like a trash heap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said the twister was 300 yards wide  
when it passed through north Shreveport on its way to Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, a separate tornado destroyed the First  
United Methodist Church in Logansport, a DeSoto Parish town 
southwest of Shreveport near the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	And a tornado or severe winds also downed trees, damaged some  
homes and caused minor injuries in a Shreveport neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, severe storms brought floodwaters across the  
southern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty people were evacuated to emergency shelters in the  
Bootheel as flash floods swept across Fredericktown. People were 
rescued from the roofs of homes, one of them carried to safety by a 
helicopter 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old boy was found dead in waist-deep water in a  
Fredericktown saw mill next to the flooded Caster River. The boy 
was moving equipment to higher ground to try and keep it dry. 
Authorities believe he died from an electrical shock.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Urged To Prepare for Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a dim agricultural forecast this year,  
farm families should begin now to assess their financial situation 
and adjust their spending habits, an expert advises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes people are kind of vague about where they're  
spending their money,'' said Janet Bechman, a Purdue University 
extension specialist in consumer sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should make sure they write things down and not just base  
their decision on the way they think things are but the way they 
really are,'' said Bechman, one of several Purdue officials who 
gave hog farmers financial advice during a recent tour around 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's price collapse has affected agricultural commodities  
from grains to livestocks. Hog farmers, for example, have seen 
prices fall to about 8 cents per pounds, the lowest in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for this year project little improvement as the Asian  
economic crisis continues and the market for U.S. goods abroad 
declines. The Agriculture Department predicts net farm income for 
1999 will drop $3.4 billion, to $44.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're watching all of our costs of living,'' said John  
Diettrich, who runs a 3,500 acre corn and soybean farm in Tilden, 
Neb., with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hold off on expenditures. You just don't make expenditures  
that a family normally would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good business practices are even more important these days for  
any farm operation, from shopping for the lowest prices and 
figuring out the best time to buy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also can adjust their planting patterns and switch to  
more profitable crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Diettrich said his operation normally grows 20 percent soybeans  
and 80 percent corn. This year, the mix is 40 percent soybeans and 
60 percent corn because soybeans have lower production costs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As families plot their financial future, parents should involve  
children who are old enough to participate in the discussion, 
Bechman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just start thinking about what's important to each one or the  
family as a whole,'' Bechman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you figure out which is important, it's a little bit  
easier to look at things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bechman said families must determine what they can do without  
and what that means: cutting back on a child's extracurricular 
activities or going without cable television or vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of looking at what you're doing, looking at the  
reason you're doing it and seeing if there might be a less 
expensive alternative,'' Bechman said. ``It's saying, 'the reason 
we do this recreation stuff is so we can all be together but do we 
need to go to Disney World so we can all be together.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever families decide, the decisions should come earlier  
rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where the longer you put it off, the  
more drastic changes you have to make,'' Bechman said.

<HEADLINE> Masters Champion Relives Memories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Maybe it was the birdie at 15 that got him  
within a shot. Or the 6-iron tucked close to the pin on the next 
hole as the pressure increased at about the same rate the late 
afternoon shadows stretched across Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever it was, Mark O'Meara had a feeling about this Masters  
as he walked off the 16th green on an April Sunday last year and 
handed his putter to Jerry Higgenbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to birdie the last two holes and win this sucker,''  
he told the caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgenbotham responded with a quizzical look, not sure what had  
come over his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back on it, O'Meara wasn't sure, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why I said that,'' O'Meara said. ``I'm not  
usually an aggressive person. Maybe I was just trying to use it as 
a motivating tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he was, it worked.  
</P>
<P>
	Only Arnold Palmer had won the Masters by making birdies on the  
last two holes. O'Meara was about to do it to beat two of the 
game's best, Fred Couples and David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	A 7-footer for birdie from above the hole put O'Meara into a  
three-way tie at 8-under at 17. Then a 7-iron to the 18th green was 
followed by a 20-foot birdie putt that quickly became part of 
Masters lore. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly 18 years of grinding it out on the PGA Tour --  
winning a respectable 14 times -- O'Meara finally had won the 
tournament that would define his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement has yet to fade a year and one more major  
championship later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching that putt on 18 still makes the hair stand up on my  
arms,'' the 42-year-old O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	His win came a year after the runaway victory of Tiger Woods,  
his neighbor and playing partner. O'Meara says friendly matches the 
two play in Orlando have sharpened his game and rekindled his 
competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Woods couldn't have helped O'Meara roll in the putt of  
a lifetime, a dramatic stroke that forever changed his golfing 
career and the way he would be remembered. Before sneaking up from 
behind after an opening 74, O'Meara's days of being mentioned as a 
contender in a major tournament seemed to be long gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were starting to forget that I was in that category,''  
O'Meara said. ``They thought, he's 41, he can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara not only showed he could win, he proved he wouldn't be a  
one-major wonder only three months later when he beat Brian Watts 
in a three-hole playoff to win the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He returns to the Masters Thursday with greater expectations,  
from himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't do as well as I'd like to I'll be disappointed,''  
O'Meara said. ``But I know I have that coveted green jacket. At 
least I've experienced that one time, no matter what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara remembers marveling at the setting sun and the galleries  
creating shadows surrounding the 17th hole last year. The moment of 
beauty relaxed him enough to hit a 9-iron just over the pin for the 
birdie that would make the Masters a three-way tie with one hole 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	With Duval already in the clubhouse at 8-under, it was left to  
Couples or O'Meara to make birdie to win. Couples missed the green, 
while O'Meara put a 7-iron 20 feet to the right of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the gallery already were headed toward the 10th tee and  
a playoff when O'Meara calmly rammed in the putt, then raised his 
arms in jubilation and hugged his caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember my memories and thoughts coming down the  
stretch shot by shot,'' O'Meara said. ``It was just an incredible 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming back to Augusta last month to plan the champion's dinner  
(sushi appetizers and fajitas), O'Meara relived some of the 
memories as he played the course for the first time since the 
Sunday that changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a cool Tuesday with none of the pressure of the Masters  
as O'Meara, his father and his agent played 18 and had lunch in the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see how wonderful it would be to be a member at  
Augusta,'' O'Meara said. ``Just to sit in the clubhouse and look 
out there was a wonderful feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only wonderful feeling O'Meara had.  
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the 18th green, he looked for the spot where the  
hole was cut on that magical day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pin was not exactly where it was, but there was an old cup  
almost exactly in the same area as where it was on Sunday last 
year,'' O'Meara said. ``So I put a ball down and said, `OK, guys, 
this is the putt I had.' I made it again, right over the old cup. I 
said, `That's enough.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It brought back a lot of neat memories.''

<HEADLINE> Trust Funds Build Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Politicians bickering over which party would  
best protect Social Security's huge trust fund are ignoring a dirty 
little secret: More than 100 other, smaller but similar accounts 
routinely are used to make the budget surplus look bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	These other trust funds cover programs from Medicare to the  
construction of a monument to World War II veterans planned for 
Washington. Although most are tiny and obscure, combined they are a 
mighty force. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding Social Security and its predicted $137 billion surplus  
next year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the 
other trust funds to run a total surplus exceeding $68 billion in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That means next year's expected $133 billion overall federal  
surplus would be a $4 billion deficit without the Social Security 
money -- and a near $73 billion deficit without the money credited 
to other trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next decade, the non-Social Security trust funds are  
expected to amass a cumulative surplus of $614 billion, CBO says. 
</P>
<P>
	That number has enormous political significance. It represents  
three-fourths of the $800 billion in non-Social Security surpluses 
Republicans want for tax cuts, and President Clinton and Democrats 
prefer for Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Take that $614 billion out of the equation, and there is little  
left for either party to use for tax cuts or for more spending over 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would put off the party for a long time,'' said Robert  
Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and 
now senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	All year, Republicans and Democrats have sought to portray  
themselves as fervent protectors of Social Security, a widely 
popular program. Tellingly, though, few want to do the same for the 
other trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Bud  
Shuster, R-Pa., persuaded Congress last year to begin spending most 
of the money in the highway trust fund for road building, instead 
of letting it accumulate. He has launched a similar effort this 
year for a fund covering airport and aviation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., has complained  
that the trust funds have been ``looted'' to balance the budget and 
is waging a long-shot campaign to make that illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say, however, lawmakers have no particular reason  
to leave alone many of the trust funds: Their proliferation makes 
it harder to control spending by creating a sense that the covered 
programs are politically sacrosanct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's harder to rein them in,'' said Scott Hodge, senior fellow  
at the conservative Citizens for a Sound Economy. ``You can lose 
political and budgetary control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal trust funds bear no relation to private trust funds,  
where someone's money is held and managed by somebody else. 
Instead, federal trust funds are accounting devices where money is 
raised and spent for a defined purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	If a trust fund collects more money than it spends, the  
government is credited with a surplus. The excess cash goes to the 
Treasury, which uses it to purchase paper clips, bombs and other 
government needs and when possible to buy down federal debt. In 
return, the trust fund gets a government IOU. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear precisely how many trust funds exist. In a report  
last June, the Congressional Research Service cataloged 110. This 
January, the Congressional Budget Office said there are more than 
150. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of them account for almost all the trust fund  
surpluses. Of the $206 billion in trust fund surpluses expected in 
2000, all but $2.5 billion comes from Social Security, Medicare, 
federal civilian and military retirement, railroad retirement, 
unemployment and highways, aviation and mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources of the money vary.  
</P>
<P>
	Social Security and Medicare's trust funds for hospital  
insurance get their money from payroll taxes deducted from most 
workers' salaries, matched by their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, such as the transportation funds, get money from users  
through taxes on gasoline, airline tickets and such. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other funds are fed by federal money, making them simply  
accounting devices where the government owes itself money. For 
example, the military retirees' fund comes entirely from the 
government, with no employee contributions.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Town Won't Forget Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPAC, Mich. (AP) -- It's nearly impossible to go anywhere in  
this small rural community without being reminded of Army Staff 
Sgt. Christopher Stone and the other two American soldiers captured 
near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellow ribbons are everywhere. Nearly every tree, lamp post and  
business is adorned with ribbons. On Saturday evening, students 
tied ribbons to antennas of vehicles arriving at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School for a candlelight vigil and handed out 
POW-MIA stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town's support has overwhelmed us,'' Stone's sister,  
Deanna, said shortly before the candlelight vigil. ``When we came 
up here for the first time, it really surprised us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A gasoline station in town informed residents about the vigil.  
The sign in front of the high school reads: ``Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the hostages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, 25, was captured Wednesday along with Staff Sgt. Andrew  
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Reliford, Stone's sister who lives in St. Clair County's  
Riley Township, said that faith and the support of the community 
were the main things keeping the family going. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate this town very much. We appreciated their  
prayers the most. It's God that's going to bring him home,'' she 
said.

	NATO Troops Come Under Fire  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- NATO-led troops came under  
fire today while destroying the Bosnian portion of a key rail link 
between Serbia and Montenegro. The commander of the NATO-led forces 
in Bosnia, U.S. Gen. Montgomery Meigs, said the stabilization 
force, known as SFOR and which aren't taking part in the attacks on 
Yugoslavia, fired back and that his forces suffered no casualties. 
Bosnian Serb television claimed the SFOR soldiers killed a railway 
guard. The television showed what appeared to be a body lying in 
the grass and a witness saying SFOR soldiers attacked the guard and 
that he did not resist. The Bosnian Serb claim could not be 
independently confirmed.

protect a humanitarian relief effort for more than 100,000 refugees 
there. NATO officials didn't specify the size of the Albania 
deployment, but a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the number being mentioned was about 6,000.

province. The video was handed to international media today by 
Melaim Bellanica, who said he hid from Serbs for five days in his 
basement in the village of Velike Krusa while killings and looting 
raged above. Bellanica also carried a list of 26 names of people he

efforts by relief agencies to help. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Families of 90 cancer patients who allege  
their relatives were unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored 
radiation experiments have reached a proposed $5 million 
settlement, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported today. The lawsuit 
alleged terminally ill cancer patients who sought treatment at 
Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 and 1971 were given 
full-body and partial-body doses of radiation. The suit named the 
hospital and the federal government among defendants. The 
government was included in the suit because the Defense Department

Washington calling for the president and Congress to help combat 
police abuses. Although the rally was intended to call for changes 
to abusive police practices nationwide it was spurred by the 
shooting of Amadou Diallo, which has riveted national attention on 
the troubled New York City Police Department. Buttons, T-shirts, 
fliers and posters with Diallo's picture or name were everywhere in

<HEADLINE> Judge Allows N.C. Lighthouse Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge is not getting in  
the way of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and its new resting place 
away from the eroding coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	Dare County, which covers most of the Outer Banks, sued in  
January to stop the move, but Chief U.S. District Judge Terrence 
Boyle ruled Friday he would not stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the move had already started and it would cost extra  
money to have some the pieces already moved put back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has invested years of effort and millions of  
dollars into the ongoing relocation of the lighthouse,'' he wrote. 
``That relocation is now under way, and significant progress has 
been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot lightouse is the nation's tallest.  
</P>
<P>
	All the outbuildings at the historic light station -- two  
keepers' quarters, three cisterns and an oil house -- have been 
moved to the new location 1,600 feet from the ocean. The 
black-and-white candy-striped lighthouse now stands just 120 feet 
from the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, the lighthouse's granite foundation has been 50  
percent cut through and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacon is expected to be lifted up on steel runners and  
slowly rolled to its new site by late May or early June. The move 
should be complete by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacon once helped sailors navigate the often treacherous  
waters off Cape Hatteras, known as the ``Graveyard of the 
Atlantic.'' It is seldom used today because of the availability of 
high-tech navigation aids.

<HEADLINE> Mom, Four Kids Die in Kentucky Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- An early morning house fire killed a  
woman and four of her children Saturday and critically injured 
another child. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the woman, Valeria Rutledge, 28, and her children  
were found in different locations in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Jefferson County Coroner's Office, Joshua  
Rutledge Taylor, 3; Brittany Rutledge Taylor, 4; and male and 
female twins Biantez and Bianca Rutledge Taylor, 7; also were 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Another girl, 13-year-old Clarisa Rutledge, was found outside  
the house and was listed in critical condition at University of 
Louisville Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire appeared to have started in the front of the house,  
where smoke detectors were installed, said acting Fire Chief Walter 
Lage. The cause remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire moved quickly through the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out my door, the whole house was on fire ... just  
flames everywhere,'' said neighbor Alfreda Morris. ``That was 
before anyone had even got there to try to put the fire out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives who live in the neighborhood said they had been with  
the victims only hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all together, just hanging out and laughing last  
night,'' said Nate Weaver, a cousin of the woman. ``There's nothing 
anyone can do now except pray. That's it.''

<HEADLINE> Firms Seek Safer Computer Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stung by the fast-spreading Melissa computer  
virus, corporate security experts are hoping to deploy new tools to 
protect networks from intruders, including technology that 
automatically identifies and expunges viruses before they cause 
widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa, a particularly insidious virus, infected more than  
100,000 computers and overloaded the e-mail systems of companies 
and government agencies worldwide. Standing out from the roughly 
40,000 other computer viruses already identified, the lightning 
spread of Melissa and several mutant versions underscored a new 
vulnerability in Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa tricks computer users by disguising itself as an e-mail  
from a friend or colleague and comes a note saying that an 
important document is attached. Once the victim opens up the 
document, a Microsoft Word file, the virus digs into the computer's 
Microsoft Outlook address book and sends the same e-mail to the 
first 50 names it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, companies said they had largely eradicated the virus  
by upgrading computers with new cures. Federal authorities arrested 
a New Jersey man and charged him on Friday with originating the 
Melissa virus. 
</P>
<P>
	But security experts warn that Melissa mutations could easily  
renew the threat posed by viruses transmitted through e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Current methods of eradication are too slow for viruses like  
Melissa. Days can pass before a user realizes a computer is 
tainted. Anti-virus software previously installed on computers may 
not work on the new infection, so technicians must install new 
software. By that time, corporate e-mail systems can crash and 
networks grind to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and Symantec Corp., which makes Norton anti-virus software,  
are working together on an all-in-one system to dramatically speed 
up detection and cure. Network Associates Inc., maker of the McAfee 
brand of anti-virus software, has a similar project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is designed to immunize the world against  
fast-spreading viruses faster than the virus can spread,'' said 
Steve White, head of IBM's anti-virus laboratory in Hawthorne, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it would work.  
</P>
<P>
	Symantec software running on a company's desktop computers would  
automatically scan for as-yet-unidentified viruses, unlike 
conventional software that checks for already discovered ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The software does this with up to 90 percent accuracy, in part  
by matching a stored list of suspicious virus characteristics 
against e-mail and files, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Got a match? The PC automatically sends a version of the  
potential virus across the Internet to a Symantec office in Santa 
Monica., Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	There, IBM mainframes ``trick'' the virus into thinking it's  
running on a desktop computer. The idea is to tempt it to 
replicate, a key virus behavior. Once copies are made, the system 
automatically figures out a cure, and sends it back across the 
Internet to update all of a company's PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	The process takes anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours,  
White says -- compared to potentially days for current methods, 
which involve programmers testing potential cures. A pilot program 
for this new technology starts this summer and the product, called 
a Digital Immune System, is due out next year. Network Associates 
promises its version by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with far-flung operations are modernizing their  
computer networks to try to bolster virus protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a Dallas-based chain, is linking its  
120 hotels into a central computer network, by October, that is 
capable of automatically immunizing all the company's 1,800 Windows 
machines without the help of individual technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	While anti-virus companies do a good job of quickly coming up  
with a cure, a big challenge is distributing it before damage is 
done, says Danny Perkins, Bristol's manager of computer networks 
and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	For individual users seeking protection against Melissa-like  
viruses, the usual precautions may not be enough. The traditional 
advice is to refrain from opening an attachment sent by a stranger. 
But Melissa and other e-mail-based viruses nearly always bear the 
names of acquaintances and even friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some security experts warn that users shouldn't open an  
e-mail attachment unless completely sure of the contents. ``With 
Melissa, you would never know'' based on the sender, said Carey 
Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's antivirus research 
facility.

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa Take Aim Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here we go again.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are hitting even more home runs. The  
World Series champion New York Yankees seem even stronger with 
Roger Clemens. And the gap between the haves and have-nots is 
getting even wider. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Baseball 1999 really be a repeat of the most remarkable  
year in memory? 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Big Mac said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready, I'm ready,'' Slammin' Sammy added.  
</P>
<P>
	But before anyone takes aim at 80 homers -- remember, no one  
thought 70 was possible -- let's just hope everyone stays healthy. 
Because it sure has been a scary spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Torre, Andres Galarraga and Mike Lowell were diagnosed with  
cancer. Kerry Wood, Moises Alou, Carlos Hernandez, Matt Morris and 
Paul Wilson were severely injured. And Kerry Ligtenberg, Gary 
DiSarcina and Nomar Garciaparra also got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think about all the wonderful things that happened in  
baseball last year -- McGwire and Sosa, Kerry Wood having his great 
rookie year and Joe Torre winning 114 games with the Yankees -- and 
you wonder if things are trying to balance out now with a lot of 
bad things,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a lot to get excited about.  
</P>
<P>
	Opening day in Mexico, the All-Star game at Fenway Park.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn, Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken closing in on 3,000 hits.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, Mo Vaughn and Greg Vaughn playing for new teams.  
</P>
<P>
	A new ballpark opening at midseason in Seattle, plus the final  
year for Tiger Stadium, the Astrodome, County Stadium and the 
former Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much history in that place,'' Sparky Anderson said  
of Tiger Stadium, which opened April 20, 1912, the same day Fenway 
debuted. ``It went all the way back to basically when Cobb played; 
Gehrig and Ruth, all of them. If the fans will only try, they'll 
see them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts Sunday night, when the NL champion San Diego  
Padres face the Colorado Rockies and their new manager, Jim 
Leyland, in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball might really go global in the new millennium. The 2000  
opener could be played in Japan, featuring Ken Griffey Jr., Alex 
Rodriguez and the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, an intriguing matchup at Dodger Stadium features top  
free agents: New Los Angeles manager Davey Johnson sends $105 
million man Kevin Brown against Arizona ace Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone will watch that game with enthusiasm, however.  
Right after Brown signed his seven-year deal that made him the 
sport's first $100 million man, some claimed the disparity between 
big- and small-market teams was out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to criticize Kevin Brown, but it's a truly tragic  
day for baseball,'' San Diego Padres owner John Moores said after 
losing his best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run race also starts Monday. That's when McGwire and  
his St. Louis Cardinals open at Busch Stadium against Milwaukee; on 
Tuesday, Sosa and his Chicago Cubs visit Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa put on quite a show throughout spring training,  
hitting shot after shot at a startling rate that exceeded last 
year's exhibition totals. They claimed not to notice each other's 
exploits, and discounted all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down here it means absolutely zippo,'' McGwire said after  
another moonshot at the Cardinals' Florida camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe, but try telling that to the fans who traveled hundreds of  
miles to Arizona and Florida, just hoping to catch a glimpse -- or 
perhaps a valuable souvenir -- of the rival sluggers who riveted the 
country last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's uncertain whether McGwire can top his 70 homers or Sosa can  
exceed his 66. There was the same type of debate right after Roger 
Maris hit 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet here's a stat worth thinking about: Even though 1998 was an  
expansion year, home run rates stayed about the same as in 1997. 
So, McGwire and Sosa got no special help, meaning there's no reason 
they couldn't do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	And here's a quick history lesson: When Babe Ruth hit a  
then-record 29 homers in 1919, some wondered whether that was a 
once-in-a-lifetime feat. Instead, the Babe had merely signaled an 
era in which he, along with the likes of Hack Wilson and Jimmie 
Foxx, would post far greater totals. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, for those looking way ahead: Sosa and the Cubs close the  
season with a weekend visit to Busch Stadium. Thanks, 
schedule-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, the only player to hit 50 homers in three straight  
years, needs 43 to reach the 500 mark. But if he hits 80, as Carlos 
Baerga recently predicted, it might also be his last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd definitely retire if I did that,'' McGwire said. ``There's  
no more reason to play after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McGwire nears No. 500, three other longtime stars approach  
3,000 hits. Gwynn needs 72 to get there, Boggs 76 and Ripken 122 -- 
there's never been a season when three players did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we all get there,'' Gwynn said. ``It would be great to  
be part of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees made history with their 125 victories last year,  
capped by their Series sweep of San Diego. Now, after winning its 
24th championship and making a claim as the best team ever, New 
York will try to do even more. Don Zimmer will run the team while 
Torre recovers from prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Steinbrenner and the Yankees did not tinker much  
with success, making only one major move. That trade brought them 
five-time Cy Young winner Clemens for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and 
Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said of  
Steinbrenner. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I enjoy 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month after Toronto traded Clemens, the Blue Jays had another  
shakeup. In a rare spring training move, they decided manager Tim 
Johnson's lies about his military service in Vietnam were too 
damaging and fired him, hiring Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	Also worth watching this season:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta tries to reach its eighth straight NL championship  
series and win its second World Series. Cy Young winner Tom 
Glavine, newcomer Brian Jordan and the Braves will be minus 
Galarraga, out for the season because of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Mariners leave the Kingdome and move into Safeco Field in  
July. The brick-and-steel ballpark has a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dennis Eckersley, Paul Molitor and Joe Carter have retired.  
St. Louis outfielder J.D. Drew and Oakland third baseman Eric 
Chavez are among the top rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- No imminent ruling is expected on androstenedione, the  
muscle-building supplement that is used by McGwire and other 
ballplayers but banned in the NFL, NCAA and the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> White Wins in Women's All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Tennessee-bound Kara Lawson and North  
Carolina recruit Jennifer Thomas each scored 20 points to lead the 
White to a 100-82 victory over the Red team Saturday in the Women's 
Basketball Coaches Association High School All American game. 
</P>
<P>
	In a game showcasing some of the best high school female  
basketball players in the country, the White team had little 
trouble taking the victory before 6,200 fans at the Hartford Civic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson, a 5-foot-9 guard from Springfield, Va., also had five  
assists and four rebounds and was voted her team's most valuable 
player. Thomas, a 6-foot forward, is from Lathrup Village, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red team MVP was Connecticut-bound Kennitra Johnson, a  
5-foot-8 forward from New Albany, Ind. She scored 16 points and had 
six steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers recruit Kourtney Walton, a 5-foot-11 forward from  
Chicago, playing for the White team, finished with 18 points and 
four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Smith, a University of Wisconsin recruit, had 10 points for  
the White team. Notre Dame-bound Alicia Ratay of Lake Zurich, Ill, 
led the Whites with nine rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Report: Second Offer Made for Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott has a second offer for her  
controlling shares in the Cincinnati Reds, according to published 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	And Schott's limited partners appear to be willing to exercise  
their option to acquire her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Post, citing  
unidentified sources, reported Saturday that the limited partners, 
led by financier Carl Lindner, have offered to match Cleveland 
lawyer Larry Dolan's $65 million offer for most of her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also reported that Steve Schott, a cousin of Marge Schott's  
late husband, heads a group that has made a rival offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Schott's home was not answered.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati auto dealer has controlled the Reds since  
December 1984, when she paid an estimated $25 million for her 
shares. She agreed in November to seek a buyer for her controlling 
interest rather than face another suspension from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000, at  
which time the limited partners can oust Schott if she hasn't 
already sold control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 shares in the team, including the two that  
make her the managing partner. The limited partners own the other 
8 1/2 shares.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Recovering in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros's lung is expanding again and  
most of the fluid has drained from his chest cavity today, one day 
after doctors began treating the Philadelphia Flyers star for a 
collapsed right lung. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, 26, apparently suffered the injury after being  
cross-checked during the Flyers' 2-1 win at Nashville on Thursday. 
Television replays showed Lindros falling on his stick in the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros spoke with reporters in the dressing room for several  
minutes following the victory and did not appear to be in pain. He 
awoke Friday morning with chest pain and went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three quarts of bloody fluid filled into the space where  
the lung collapsed, and doctors at the hospital drained the fluid 
with a chest tube. Team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said doctors 
inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help re-expand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a big piece of this team. Somebody else has to pick it  
up and step up,'' center Marc Bureau said after a 3-0 loss in 
Boston on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, who is being treated by Predators team physician Dr.  
Richard Garman, will stay in Baptist Hospital in Nashville at least 
until Tuesday to make sure the lung is working properly. He will 
probably be moved from intensive care to a regular room on Sunday, 
Dorshimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was coming off a two-game suspension when the injury  
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	He will probably miss the rest of the regular season and his  
status for the playoffs remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury could not have come at a worse time for the  
injury-wracked Flyers, who have seen their chances of going deep in 
the playoffs diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it this way: We have a lot bigger chance with him. We need  
him back,'' Flyers winger Mikael Renberg said. ``But whatever 
happens, if he can't come back, we got to do it without him. It's 
going to be tough, but we've got a good team still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Lindros, the Flyers played Saturday without  
second leading-scorer John LeClair, who has an injured back; right 
wing Mark Recchi, who complained of headaches and nausea; and top 
defenseman Eric Desjardins, out with a torn left anterior cruciate 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for any team if you take away the team's top  
scorers,'' said Flyers coach Roger Neilson. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, Dorshimer said Recchi was feeling much  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was initially concerned that Recchi's condition might  
be related to a March 22 concussion that kept him out of the lineup 
for three games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dorshimer said the nausea and headaches were probably caused  
by a combination of insomnia, the stress of traveling, and lack of 
conditioning from his time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, who told Dorshimer he felt ``back to normal,'' will be  
evaluated again Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Free Meal Program Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Millions of dollars in federal money meant to  
pay for meals for California's poor children were instead used for 
vacations, clothing, tuition and vehicles, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture found. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Education has been negligent in its  
oversight of the $168 million program that distributes money to 
nonprofit groups, the USDA's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California Department of Education fostered a lax  
environment in which ... sponsors could personally enrich 
themselves through various questionable or fraudulent schemes which 
they could perpetrate with little likelihood of detection,'' the 
report, released last week, found. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA questioned the spending of $5.5 million from 1995 to  
1998. California's program, the largest in the country, reimburses 
day care centers for up to two meals and a snack a day for each 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal charges have been filed against 15 people, including a  
Los Angeles couple accused of using funds to pay for everything 
from a 5,000-square-foot home to ski trips and their children's 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they have instituted changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that sometimes not as much attention was paid to the  
integrity aspects of the program as it was to the nutritional 
health aspects,'' said Kathy Lewis, state deputy superintendent for 
Child, Youth and Family Services.

<HEADLINE> San Fran Court Going to the Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Does your neighbor's dog howl at the moon  
until 2 a.m.? Did the pit bull next door eat your hamster? Is 
little Fifi sneaking into your yard and leaving unwanted mementos? 
</P>
<P>
	Justice goes to the dogs in San Francisco, thanks to William  
Herndon, a police sergeant who also is a judge, presiding for the 
past five years over Dog Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon loves dogs -- he has two, an Australian shepherd named  
Bart and a mixed breed he calls Lisa -- and wants to protect owners' 
rights to their animals, as long as the city's human population 
isn't in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important job. I take it real seriously,'' he  
said. ``I want to do right for the people, for the dogs and make it 
safe for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon's charter is a section of the city's health code. Owners  
can ask to have the case transferred to Superior Court, although it 
doesn't happen often. 
</P>
<P>
	The people on both sides of the issue show up, tell their  
stories, and present witnesses if necessary. Occasionally an 
attorney shows up, but generally these sessions are informal and 
casual. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon can send both sides home to work out their difficulties  
or can have the dog euthanized (that happens about 20 percent of 
the time). In about half of the cases, he orders the dog leashed or 
muzzled in public, or sends it to a canine behavior expert -- a dog 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, 45, heard three cases on a recent Thursday, the only  
day his court is in regular session. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two were fairly routine, both involving unleashed dogs  
biting other dogs. Herndon said he would make a ruling at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	The third case was more serious, involving pit bulls Buggsy and  
Cookie who were owned by Sergio Guevara. Neighbor Curtis Norman 
alleges that when he tried to shoo the dogs out of his yard, Buggsy 
bit him on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Norman seems willing to forgive and forget if Guevara  
fixes the fence between their yards, Norman's wife, Arlene, isn't 
as accepting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be attacked,'' she said with a scowl,  
mentioning visiting grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon told Guevara to take his dogs to the Department of  
Animal Care and Control for examination by a behaviorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Buggsy bit the behaviorist. The injury wasn't severe, but that  
was it for Buggsy; a destruction order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had that happen before,'' Herndon said of the  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Cookie, who didn't join the attack, was still to be  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cases end up much as they might in some instances of  
disturbing human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the case of a Jack Russell terrier who lived in a  
neighborhood where people left their doors open,'' Herndon said. 
``The dog got loose and ran into a neighbor's house, where he 
chased the people around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was bitten, but that still amounted to ``menacing  
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog would up on Prozac because he was so high-strung,''  
Herndon said.

<HEADLINE> Phils' Manager Remembers Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOOVER, Ala. (AP) -- Once Terry Francona walked onto the field at  
the Hoover Met, he knew it would only be a matter of minutes before 
the first Michael Jordan question was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was he like? Did he listen to you? Was it fun managing  
him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francona, back in Birmingham for the first time since leaving  
the Barons organization after the 1995 season, expected questions 
about the year he spent managing Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the visitors dugout Saturday, Francona didn't mind  
the questions. But when asked if managing Jordan ``got you where 
you are now,'' Francona paused, looking for just the right words. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people want to think that, it's fine,'' Francona said  
before the Phillies played the Baltimore Orioles in their final 
exhibition game of the spring. ``I was the only baseball manager he 
ever had, so it doesn't bother me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But make no mistake, Jordan didn't make Francona's career. If  
anything, he may have nudged it along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask for the attention Michael Jordan brought, but  
that's the way it shook out,'' Francona said. ``I don't resent it, 
though. When you get a break, you take it and try to learn from it 
-- if it was a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francona was in his second season managing the Barons, his third  
overall, when Jordan joined his team in 1994. The Barons had won 
the Southern League title the year before and Francona had been 
selected the minor league manager of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Life was good. He lived down the hill from The Met and jogged to  
work each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Jordan arrived and the media crush that followed gave  
Francona a crash course in major league managing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wanted to talk about Michael Jordan, I wanted to talk  
about the Barons,'' he said. ``I would get to the stadium early and 
every single day there would be someone here who wasn't supposed to 
be here. It taught me to be organized, and I guess you could say I 
learned do things on the run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things changed overnight for Francona. Suddenly there were  
crowds of 14,000 and a small army of reporters and television crews 
following his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crazy,'' said Phillies pitcher Doug Glanville, who  
played for Orlando of the Southern League at the time. ``Everywhere 
they went it was packed and this place was always jumping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a major league atmosphere at a minor league park,''  
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it got Francona, and they way he handled the situation,  
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 he was hired as the Detroit Tigers' third-base coach.  
And when the Phillies needed a replacement for the fired Jim 
Fregosi in 1997, Jordan called Phillies general manager Lee Thomas 
and endorsed Francona. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazing out into left field on Saturday, Francona said he  
wouldn't trade his Jordan experience for anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it was a Saturday night, late in the season and we  
had 16,000 fans here,'' Francona said. ``Michael hit a home run 
over that left-field fence, it was his first one, and I remember 
the look on his face -- it was like `Ahhh, I did it.' That look made 
it all worth it for me.''

<HEADLINE> In Indiana, Time Is Relative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- What time you got? In Indiana, the answer  
isn't so simple -- especially this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	When dawn breaks Sunday in the Hoosier state, it might be  
Central Standard Time, Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight 
Time-- depending on where you're standing. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the nation welcomes daylight-saving time by  
nudging their clocks ahead one hour, most of Indiana will skip the 
switch altogether, keeping their clocks on Eastern Standard Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the state -- but not all of it.  
</P>
<P>
	In southeastern Indiana, five breakaway counties will make the  
saving-time switch to keep synchronized with nearby Cincinnati and 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people work in the Cincinnati area, and we're right on  
the borderline,'' said Ohio County Sheriff Elton Fancher. ``Of 
course, it does cause some confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's especially true since Ohio County schools don't make the  
switch, leaving some parents pushing one house clock ahead to 
Eastern Daylight Time and leaving another clock on Eastern Standard 
Time, Fancher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always kind of playing that fast-time, slow-time  
thing,'' said Steve Patz, the county's schools superintendent. 
``Surprisingly enough, it goes off with very few hitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the inconsistency, 10 counties in northwest and  
southwest Indiana keep clocks set to Central time -- and they 
observe daylight-saving time. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved daylight-saving time in 1918 to save  
electricity and fuel during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana lawmakers have pondered making the change ever since,  
but even now, no change looms. 
</P>
<P>
	When a bill to institute daylight-saving time statewide was  
filed in the state Senate once again this year, Senate President 
Pro Tem Robert Garton promptly assigned it to the Rules Committee -- 
a legislative graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Year after year, Garton said, surveys show most Hoosiers are  
opposed to daylight-saving time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the problem is the geographic size of the state, a  
relatively long, narrow state, right on the edge of two time 
zones,'' Garton said. ``So the folks in northwest Indiana and the 
folks in southwest Indiana don't want to be out of sync with the 
rest of the state all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those against daylight-saving time have often argued that  
setting the clocks ahead would throw cows off schedule, making life 
difficult for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``cows aren't going to scream and holler if you change your  
clocks one hour,'' said David Byers, a dairy farmer in 
north-central Indiana. Still, he doesn't change his clocks. 
</P>
<P>
	That may hint at the real reason behind Indiana's quirky system,  
said Bob Kraft, the state's director of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we don't want to observe daylight-saving time because it  
makes us different,'' Kraft said. ``It's a little bit of pride, I 
think.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Head Decries Serb Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mormon church President Gordon B. Hinckley  
on Saturday condemned Serbian ``atrocities'' in Kosovo while urging 
the faith's members to be tolerant of others despite differences of 
belief. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this moment our hearts reach out to the brutalized people  
of Kosovo,'' Hinckley said in opening the church's 169th Annual 
General Conference in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult for us to understand how those who claim to be  
Christians can act so barbarically to those of another faith,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 88-year-old Hinckley, president of The Church of Jesus  
Christ of Latter-day Saints since 1995, did not mention the Serbs 
by name but added, ``I am grateful that we are rushing humanitarian 
aid to the victims of these atrocities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, church officials said a shipment of 100 tons of clothing  
and blankets would be shipped Tuesday to Macedonia and distributed 
by Mercy Corps, a Christian relief agency. The Mormon church has 
only 100 members in the Yugoslav Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's blunt condemnation was unusual for the general  
conferences, held each year in April and October. Mormon leaders 
seldom use sermons there to comment directly on current events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must never forget that we live in a world of great  
diversity,'' Hinckley said. ``The people of the earth are all our 
Father's children, and are of many and varied religious 
persuasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the faith's more than 10 million members toward greater  
tolerance and respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have differences of doctrine,'' he said. ``This need not  
bring about animosity or any kind of holier-than-thou attitude.''

<HEADLINE> Detectives Chase 'Old' Murder Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Dave Hatch sits alone, a solitary researcher in  
a library of death. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelves around him hold scores of black vinyl three-ring  
binders, each with a tale of murder unsolved -- the woman raped and 
killed behind the Las Vegas Hilton in 1981, the prostitute murdered 
in her room in 1976, the Boston thug dumped in the desert back in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the dead are typed neatly on the spines of the  
300-plus binders, stark black print on white labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``VICTIM: BRUCE FISHER.''   	
</P>
<P>
	``VICTIM: PATRICIA MARGELLO.''   	
</P>
<P>
	``VICTIM: KIMBLEE ELLINGTON.''   	
</P>
<P>
	Old murders are Hatch's beat; the 27-year police veteran opened  
the Las Vegas Police Department's cold-case squad in July 1997. The 
binders date to 1943; the detective scours each for fresh leads on 
cases long since stale, chasing killers long since convinced they 
had beaten the rap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoking guns? Those aren't even a challenge,'' says Hatch,  
whose left bicep sports a skull tattoo. ``These cases are 
challenges. You've got to track everybody down, make sure of what 
they can remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, Hatch works alone, but the number of cops doing  
similar jobs is increasing across the country. With the national 
murder rate plunging 28 percent since 1993, and with the 
proliferation of high-tech crime-solving methods, cold-case 
investigators are appearing from Newark to New Orleans, from San 
Antonio to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has closed dozens of cases since taking the job --  
``closed'' meaning anything from a suspect's confession to his 
arrest to his death to (in one instance) his turning up in the 
federal Witness Protection Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cold-case squads nationwide have racked up similarly  
dramatic numbers, relying on a combination of instinct and evidence 
-- much of it unusual. Dog hairs, a religious conversion, a traffic 
ticket, a 23-year-old fingerprint, a Cajun chef -- all have helped 
resolve antique cases, producing these results: 
</P>
<P>
	--In New York City, the squad has cleared 280 cases in three  
years. A 1980 double murder was solved when a Georgia traffic 
ticket tipped police to the suspect's whereabouts. ``OK, you got 
me,'' the reputed drug dealer said upon his arrest in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Washington cold-case squad, in its first five years, closed  
157 old homicides and several high-profile attempted-murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Los Angeles squad, formed two years ago, has closed 35  
cases in the last six months. In a 1995 murder, detectives used a 
lab comparison of dog hairs to secure an arrest and indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New Orleans squad, in three years, has solved 113 cases,  
including one prompted by an unsolicited tip from a chef at a local 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Massachusetts state police cold-case squad opened for  
business two years ago, reopening investigations into 25 murders. 
Three arrests have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Newark, N.J., the cold-case squad opened last September and  
scored an almost immediate hit: arresting a woman for her mother's 
1971 slaying. Two other arrests quickly followed, with several more 
cases on the edge of resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark's two-man detective team approaches its task with almost  
religious zeal. The master book that holds details on murders 
dating to the 1940s is called ``the bible,'' and detectives talk of 
``resurrecting'' forgotten victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not up to another human being to snuff out the life of an  
8-year-old child or 80-year-old woman,'' says Detective Rashid 
Sabur. ``That's God's decision. We step in and represent the 
victims, because these people are calling us from the grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those calls can lead to strange places.  
</P>
<P>
	Detective Rick Marks, head of the LAPD squad, reopened a 1995  
murder investigation. Derrick Sims was suspected of murdering his 
girlfriend, but the probe had bogged down. The cold-case squad 
tried a new tactic: They went after Sims' dog. 
</P>
<P>
	The squad took hair samples from the pet pooch; they were  
compared with dog hairs collected from a blanket that was wrapped 
around the victim. After the FBI crime lab scored a match, Sims was 
arrested. He goes on trial for murder later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed interest in crimes from the past is good news for  
surviving families seeking closure. ``Just as rewarding as putting 
the cuffs on a murderer is telling family members that you have the 
guy who did it,'' says Lt. Ray Ferrari, head of the New York squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The response from suspects contacted years down the road?  
``Surprise'' doesn't quite cover it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them, `Well, we never go away.' Then I add 'em to my  
Christmas card list,'' says Hatch, smiling like the cat that ate 
the homicidal canary. ``There are killers that you always want to 
make sure know you're around, and you're never going away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to let 'em know.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hatch is a typical cold-case investigator -- a veteran who  
investigated some 600 murders during 17 years in homicide at Las 
Vegas PD. The New York squad's officers each have between 15 and 30 
years on the job; in New Orleans, the range is 16 to 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch could have been born grizzled. His graying hair features a  
Parris Island buzz cut, with a matching salt and pepper beard. His 
sentences are short, blunt, salty. He is the institutional memory 
of the 14-member homicide division. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a great resource,'' says Lt. Wayne Peterson, head of the  
Vegas homicide bureau. ``His knowledge and experience make him a 
superior investigator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Hatch has perused cases between 1943 (three years  
before mobster Bugsy Siegel brought the mob west to The Flamingo 
hotel) and the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	There are frustrations: He has opened binders and watched  
misfiled fingerprint cards waft into his lap. One binder held an 
unidentified woman's jewelry -- potentially key evidence. A bag of 
bloody clothes was infiltrated by maggots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got bug DNA in there,'' Hatch deadpans.  
</P>
<P>
	Such problems are quickly forgotten when Hatch gets his hooks  
into a hot case. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Hatch was reinvestigating the April 1981 rape and  
murder of a local woman when an unsolicited letter arrived in the 
mail from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect my ex-husband murdered a woman about 15 years ago,''  
the letter began, quickly getting Hatch's attention. ``I don't know 
her name. She died about a year before I met him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch connected the letter to one of his binders, matching  
victim and details. The letter contained potential new evidence; 
Hatch began poring over the old material. Police are quietly 
putting together a case, hoping to close out the 18-year-old 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``So this old case is not such a dead case,'' Hatch says. ``You  
just start looking, and all of a sudden, there you go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Improved technology is a key cold-case component, providing  
crime-solving tools that didn't exist when many of these crimes 
were committed: DNA testing, national fingerprint databases, 
enhanced crime scene forensics, ballistics databases. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a single, bloody fingerprint left 23 years earlier that  
convicted Anthony Lowe. Gerrit Weynands, a 46-year-old Seattle 
timber salesman, was shot once in the back of the neck during a 
February 1973 robbery. He died on the street, his pockets turned 
inside out by the bandit. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime, committed during the Nixon administration, remained  
unsolved until Bill Clinton was in office. Lowe, 45, was arrested 
years after the murder on a drug charge. He was fingerprinted, and 
his prints added to the database. 
</P>
<P>
	When the cold-case squad reopened the Weynands case, they ran  
the old fingerprint through the new database. The result: a match 
and a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it's that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio police posts ``featured cold cases'' on its  
Internet site, hoping that another new investigative tool -- the 
World Wide Web -- can help them in solving crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	A simple point-and-click can turn up details of the Nov. 20,  
1986, murder of Michael S. O'Donnell, gunned down while shooting 
pool inside the Blue Sky Lounge. Tips can come in via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Space Age hasn't usurped shoe leather. ``It's still  
knocking on doors, talking to people,'' says Sgt. John Rice of the 
New Orleans squad. ``It's not all technology today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice recently solved an old case based on a lunchtime tip. ``I  
was talking to a chef I knew, and he introduced me to a man whose 
cousin was killed many years ago,'' Rice recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice interviewed the cousin, who provided new information on the  
slaying. Rice hit the streets and quickly made an arrest; he says 
decisions to cooperate years after the crime are a fairly common 
occurrence for cold-case detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it the ``telltale heart syndrome.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 19, you're invincible,'' Rice says. ``You can't  
tell a young man anything. But people change. As he gets older, as 
he has children, he thinks, `Maybe I ought to come forward.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Newark's Sabur, with partner Keith Sheppard, solved a 1995  
murder when they tracked down an eyewitness -- a former drug dealer. 
She had since gone into rehab and become a born-again Christian; 
she viewed the interview as a chance to atone for past sins, and 
identified the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had a change of heart, thanks to Jesus,'' says a grinning  
Sabur, appreciative of the help. 
</P>
<P>
	That the nation's police officers can now investigate old crimes  
is partially attributable to a drastically decreased crime rate. 
Nationally, murder is down about 28 percent in the last five years; 
overall crime is down 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the figures are even more stunning: A 70-percent  
drop-off in homicides in the last five years. That allowed creation 
of the cold-case squad, a luxury that was once impossible in a city 
with 2,245 homicides in the year 1990, where detectives had just 
four days to clear a homicide before catching another case. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was much the same across the Hudson River in Newark,  
where the 1997 murder rate hit its lowest level in 30 years. One 
year later, the cold-case squad opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, homicide investigators couldn't invest the  
same quality time,'' explains Newark Police Director Joseph J. 
Santiago. ``But we drastically reduced homicides, and it kept the 
investigators from having to deal at the same pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Newark squad works in an annex behind City Hall. Its  
existence is still somewhat of a secret within the department; two 
phone calls and several transfers were needed to reach one of its 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the squad had almost instant success.  
</P>
<P>
	In its first five months, it solved three cases: a 1973 slaying,  
the 1995 born-again Christian case, and the 1971 murder of Maylon 
Johnson. The last case generated headlines when it turned out the 
killer was Ms. Johnson's 14-year-old daughter -- now a 41-year-old 
married woman with three kids of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	With evidence in the 27-year-old case at a premium, the  
detectives focused on the suspect. After an emotional two-hour 
interview, she confessed to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	The squads share common woes: witnesses who disappear or die,  
suspects who do the same. Memories are no longer as fresh. Hatch 
said closing out cases can involve just acknowledging that the 
prime suspects are dead, themselves victims of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know 15 murder cases where the four or five principals were  
all killed,'' Hatch says. ``Drug crazies -- everybody involved is 
now dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are other cases, plenty of them, where the suspects  
are still out there. And as Hatch likes to remind those folks, the 
cold-case squad never goes away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing about murder,'' Hatch says evenly, ``is there's  
no statute of limitations.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Indians Should Top AL in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The American League hasn't offered much suspense in the past  
four years. Don't expect that to change in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians should already count  
on playing at home in October as the top two division champions. 
Last year's runaway winners have only gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion Yankees traded for five-time Cy Young  
winner Roger Clemens and the Indians signed free agent Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the team to beat and we know that,'' Cleveland's Mike  
Jackson said. ``We're sure they understand we're their team to 
beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Indians and Yankees improved, the second-place teams  
in their divisions each lost their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle took his fierce swing and hot temper out of Chicago  
to Baltimore, where he will try to shatter records, not locker 
rooms. And Mo Vaughn left Boston for Anaheim, tilting the balance 
of power in the West to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect New York or Cleveland to be complacent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing to do in sports is to win when everyone  
expects you to,'' said Don Zimmer, the Yankees bench coach who will 
manage the team until Joe Torre returns from prostate cancer 
surgery. ``I have never seen a team face as much pressure as this 
team did going into the playoffs after winning 114 games. And they 
responded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That they did, beating the Texas Rangers and Cleveland before  
sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series on their way to a 
record 125 wins. And expectations won't be any lower this year for 
the best team in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get to the World Series, because of who we are and  
what we spend on players,'' Torre said of the team's $85 million 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians feel the same way. After a 46-year playoff drought,  
Cleveland has won the AL Central the past four years but hasn't 
been able to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a team that's decided it's time to go win the  
World Series,'' Sandy Alomar said. ``That's not being cocky, it's 
just assuming a responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West again will have the only real pennant race. The  
division boasts some of the game's best offensive players in Juan 
Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro (Texas), Vaughn and Tim Salmon 
(Anaheim), and Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez (Seattle). 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever makes the best in-season move to get a pitcher probably  
will win the division. So look for Anaheim, which with the addition 
of Vaughn has a spare outfielder -- either Jim Edmonds or Garrett 
Anderson -- to make the playoffs for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-place team in the West will compete with Baltimore,  
Boston and Toronto in the league's fourth race -- for the wild-card. 
The wild-card winner has come from the East all four years and 
don't look for that to change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays, without manager Tim Johnson and his Vietnam  
tales, may have the second best rotation in the league and are the 
wild-card favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the AL in predicted order of finish: 	
</P>
<P>
                               *EAST 	
</P>
<P>
                          *New York Yankees    	
</P>
<P>
	The biggest knock against the Yankees being called one of the  
greatest teams ever last season was that they didn't have a 
surefire Hall of Famer. Well, they do now with Clemens (20-6, 2.65 
ERA, 271 Ks), whom they got for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Yankees could add the best pitcher in the league to the  
best rotation in the league. Plug Clemens in front of David Cone 
(20-7, 3.55), Orlando Hernandez (12-4, 3.13), Andy Pettitte (16-11, 
4.24) and Hideki Irabu (13-9, 4.06) and there's nothing that can 
keep this team out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense should only get better this year -- only Scott  
Brosius (.300 BA, 19 HRs, 98 RBIs) had a career year in 1998. With 
Chili Davis healthy, Chuck Knoblauch comfortable and Jorge Posada 
getting more playing time, the Yankees should easily surpass 100 
wins again. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Toronto Blue Jays    	
</P>
<P>
	Granted the Jays lost Clemens and one of their biggest offensive  
threats in Jose Canseco (.237, 46, 107), but they still have youth. 
</P>
<P>
	With veterans Wells (18-4, 3.49), Pat Hentgen (12-11, 5.17) and  
Joey Hamilton (13-13, 4.27) anchoring a pitching staff that 
includes youngsters Kelvim Escobar (7-3, 3.73) and Chris Carpenter 
(12-7, 4.37), manager Jim Fregosi may have the strongest rotation 
in the league after the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's 21-year-old Roy Halladay, who came within one out  
of a no-hitter on the final day of the 1998 season. He could be a 
major contributor by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Green (.278, 35, 100, 35 SBs) and Carlos Delgado (.292,  
38, 115) anchor a lineup that could use another bat in the 
outfield. Look for GM Gord Ash to get that player by trading one of 
his pitchers, maybe Hentgen, for possibly Anaheim's Edmonds or 
Anderson or Detroit's Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Baltimore Orioles    	
</P>
<P>
	Peter Angelos seems to be following the same blueprint Yankees  
owner George Steinbrenner used during the '80s. The only problem 
is, that was the first decade since the 1910s that the Yankees 
didn't win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Orioles have a wild card to shoot for in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore has developed few young players to inject life into  
one of baseball's oldest teams, instead relying on big free agent 
signings. 
</P>
<P>
	But this offseason's moves should do little more than keep  
Baltimore treading water. The Orioles spent $88.5 million to sign 
Belle, Will Clark and Delino DeShields, but those three were about 
as productive as the departed Palmeiro, Alomar and Eric Davis last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Orioles combined to hit .310 with 79 homers and 268 RBIs  
last season, essentially the same as the .300-85-266 put up by the 
three players who left. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important addition may be Charles Johnson (.218, 19,  
58), coming off his worst year at the plate and in the field. 
Johnson will be called upon to shore up a pitching staff that 
ranked seventh in the AL last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be interesting to watch how Cal Ripken responds to a few  
days off. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Boston Red Sox    	
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have gotten rid of any outspoken personalities, most  
notably Vaughn (.337, 40, 115), who left for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's playoff loss to Cleveland proved the Sox needed at  
least one more bat in the lineup to help Vaughn and Nomar 
Garciaparra (.323, 35, 122). Instead, they lost Vaughn and added 
only Jose Offerman (.315, 7, 66), who's coming off his best year 
but still does not scare opposing managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, slowed in the spring by an arm injury, should get  
few good pitches to hit with Mike Stanley (.256, 29, 79) or Troy 
O'Leary (.270, 23, 83) providing protection. If Boston can stay in 
the wild-card race until July, don't rule out a move for a 
legitimate bat at first base or left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez (19-7, 2.89) and Tom Gordon (7-4, 46 saves) lead  
a pitching staff filled with many questions, most notably the 
health of Bret Saberhagen (15-8, 3.96) and newly signed Ramon 
Martinez, who could be on the roster by the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Tampa Bay Devil Rays    	
</P>
<P>
	The expansion tag has worn off and now the long process of  
getting to respectability begins. 
</P>
<P>
	While expansion-rival Arizona opened up its wallet for free  
agents, the Devil Rays settled for Canseco to add much needed 
firepower to the lowest scoring team in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	To be competitive, the Rays need Rolando Arrojo (14-12, 3.56) to  
pitch like the All-Star he was in the first half not the 4-8 
pitcher after the break. Also, Wilson Alvarez (6-14, 4.73) needs to 
bounce back from his worst season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Boggs' run for 3,000 hits -- he needs 78 -- should provide  
the most drama for Tampa Bay fans. 
</P>
<P>
                             *CENTRAL   	
</P>
<P>
                         *Cleveland Indians    	
</P>
<P>
	The Indians probably will have 12 former All-Stars on their  
opening day roster and could have one in every spot in the lineup 
if Wil Cordero (.267, 13, 49) starts at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	But to compete with the Yankees in the playoffs, Cleveland still  
needs a No. 1 starter. Kansas City's Kevin Appier, Philadelphia's 
Curt Schilling and Oakland's Kenny Rogers could all be available 
before the trading deadline. If not, manager Mike Hargrove must 
count on RHPs Bartolo Colon (14-9, 3.71) and Jaret Wright (12-10, 
4.72). 
</P>
<P>
	The additions of LHP Ricardo Rincon (2.91, 14 saves) and RHP  
Jerry Spradlin (4-4, 3.53) to a bullpen anchored by Jackson (40 
saves, 1.55 ERA) gives Hargrove a lot of versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup, featuring 1B Jim Thome (.293, 30, 85), RF Manny  
Ramirez (.294, 45, 145) and CF Kenny Lofton (101 runs, 54 SBs), is 
one of the deepest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Detroit Tigers    	
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers upgraded the AL's third-worst offense by adding 3B  
Dean Palmer (.278, 34, 119) and OF Gregg Jefferies (.301, 9, 58). 
</P>
<P>
	With 1B Tony Clark (34, 103), OF Bobby Higginson (25, 85) and 2B  
Damion Easley (27, 100) back, offense shouldn't be manager Larry 
Parrish's biggest worry. 
</P>
<P>
	That will be starting pitching. LHP Justin Thompson (11-15,  
4.05) has recovered from elbow surgery, giving the Tigers two solid 
starters with RHP Brian Moehler (14-13, 3.90). The problem is there 
isn't much behind them in the rotation, though last year's No. 1 
pick Jeff Weaver has been impressive in spring training and could 
be in Detroit before Tiger Stadium closes at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit is so ecstatic about rookie CF Gabe Kapler that they are  
willing to trade Hunter, or possibly Higginson, for pitching. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Chicago White Sox    	
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox went 45-31 after the All-Star game for the second  
best mark in the league. But instead of adding to their team and 
making a playoff run, owner Jerry Reinsdorf bid farewell to Belle 
and 3B Robin Ventura, who combined for 69 homers and 243 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Frank Thomas (.265, 29, 109), coming off his worst  
year, 2B Ray Durham (.285, 19, 67) and not much else. 
</P>
<P>
	It's gotten so bad that the strength of this team might be the  
pitching staff that posted a league-worst 5.22 ERA last year. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Kansas City Royals    	
</P>
<P>
	The Royals lost their two top run producers, Palmer and  
Offerman, and No. 1 starter, Tim Belcher, and got nothing to show 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for GM Herk Robinson to make the same mistake again.  
He'll probably deal at least one of three players -- RHP Kevin 
Appier, closer Jeff Montgomery (36 saves), 1B Jeff King (.263, 24, 
93) -- before the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters OF Carlos Beltran, OF Jeremy Giambi and 2B Carlos  
Febles give fans something to look forward to other than George 
Brett's Hall of Fame induction in July. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Minnesota Twins    	
</P>
<P>
	Never a good sign when you start the season with your best  
players on the trading block. The Twins would love to drop OF Marty 
Cordova (.253, 10, 69) or Rick Aguilera (38 saves) in an effort to 
reduce their payroll to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, GM Terry Ryan could be forced to part with ace Brad  
Radke (12-14, 4.30), the Twins' most marketable commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tom Kelly doesn't even have the rich farm system that  
small-market partner Felipe Alou has in Montreal to cheer him up. 
</P>
<P>
                               *WEST    	
</P>
<P>
                          *Anaheim Angels    	
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was signed as much to add fire to the clubhouse as he was  
to add a big bat to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels would like to deal outfielders Anderson (.294, 15,  
79) or Edmonds (.307, 25, 91) for pitching help, possibly Hentgen. 
Otherwise, manager Terry Collins has some difficult decisions to 
make with four outfielders -- the other two are RF Tim Salmon (.300, 
26, 88) and Darin Erstad (.296, 19, 82) -- for three spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of SS Gary DiSarcina (.287, 3, 56) for three months  
with a broken arm puts a lot of pressure on newly-signed Andy 
Sheets (.242, 7, 29). 
</P>
<P>
	Ace Chuck Finley (11-9, 3.39) also has been slowed by an arm  
injury. He leads a pitching staff that has several question marks 
with Ken Hill (9-6, 4.98), recovering from elbow surgery, and 
37-year-old Tim Belcher (14-14, 4.27), who's trying to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *Texas Rangers    	
</P>
<P>
	Texas didn't get the ace pitcher it needed, losing out in the  
Randy Johnson and Clemens sweepstakes. They did sign hard-working 
Mark Clark (9-14, 4.84) to replace Todd Stottlemyre, a midseason 
acquisition last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent signee Palmeiro (.296, 43, 121) could miss the first  
few weeks with an injured knee, but he should flourish with the 
short right-field porch in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Add RF Juan Gonzalez (.318, 45, 157), LF Rusty Greer (.306, 16,  
108) and C Ivan Rodriguez (.321, 21, 91), and the Rangers have one 
of the strongest lineups in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                         *Seattle Mariners    	
</P>
<P>
	How can a team with two of the best all-around players in the  
game -- Griffey (.284, 56, 146) and Rodriguez (.310, 42, 124, 46 
SBs) -- be so bad. Easy, no pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for the lack of pitching stems from ownership's  
unwillingness to open its wallet and bungled moves by GM Woody 
Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fassero (13-12, 3.97) and Jamie Moyer (15-9, 3.53) are  
capable starters, but the Mariners need either an ace -- like 
departed Randy Johnson -- or a strong bullpen to succeed as they 
move into the new Safeco Field July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they lost Mike Timlin, the most reliable member of  
baseball's most combustible bullpen. They replaced him with Jose 
Mesa (4.57, 1 save), who walked in the winning run twice in one 
week last year. That should do wonders for manager Lou Piniella's 
infamous temper. 
</P>
<P>
	Another season like last year's 76-85 mark could be enough to  
drive away Rodriguez and Griffey, who become free agents after the 
2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                         *Oakland Athletics    	
</P>
<P>
	The A's are well short of competing, but at least they are  
moving in the right direction. Seven of their opening-day starters 
could be home grown and 3B Eric Chavez is the early favorite for 
rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with last year's winner Ben Grieve (.288, 18, 89) and 1B  
Jason Giambi (.295, 27, 110), manager Art Howe has a core from 
which to build. SS Miguel Tejada (.233, 11, 45) is only 22 and 
already has shown improvement at the plate in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers (16-8, 3.17) probably won't last the year in Oakland, but  
future ace Mark Mulder, the A's first-round pick in 1998, probably 
will end the season in the majors.

<HEADLINE>  Maine, N.H. Vie For Hockey Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The coach looks at Jason Krog and sees  
Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog was very deserving of college hockey's top honor, the coach  
said, comparing the New Hampshire center's ability to control a 
game with that of basketball great Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	And that praise came from the coach of the rival team, Maine's  
Shawn Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an excellent player,'' Walsh said Friday after Krog  
received the Hobey Baker Award, the first time a New Hampshire 
player has been so honored. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Walsh's players, Steve Kariya, was among the 10 finalists  
for the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog and Kariya, both seniors, will play their college finale  
this evening as Hockey East rivals New Hampshire and Maine meet for 
the fifth time this season, with the NCAA championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools split their four earlier meetings, although New  
Hampshire won the last two by one-sided scores, 6-1 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed with the way the regular season wound up.  
We didn't play well, and give them credit, they've played 
excellent,'' Kariya said. ``We'll need a better performance against 
them if we're going to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said it's no surprise the teams are very familiar with  
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to be playing against our neighbor and traveling  
partner,'' he said. ``We've been on the road together, seen these 
guys so much on the ice, in hallways and hotel lobbies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire coach Richard Umile added, ``This is obviously the  
rubber match. These are two teams that know each other real well 
and have a lot of respect for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh echoed that high regard, saying, ``It's turned into a nice  
rivalry instead of a bitter rivalry. The bottom line, though, is 
we're both going for the same prize and only one of us is going to 
get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance in the title game will be the first for New  
Hampshire, a 4-0 loser to Michigan in last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most satisfying things is that our team was picked  
to finish in the middle of our league. The guys really stepped it 
up and had career seasons,'' said Krog, who led the nation with 84 
points on 34 goals and 50 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire finished first in Hockey East by beating Maine  
twice and dropping the Black Bears to second, three points back. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, whose brother Paul plays on the same Arrowhead Pond ice  
with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, has 65 points this season, with 
27 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats (31-6-3) overpowered Michigan State 5-3 in the  
semis on Thursday, with Krog contributing two goals and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine (30-6-4) edged Boston College 2-1 in a semifinal match of  
Hockey East teams, with freshman Niko Dimitrakos tying the game in 
the third period, then setting up teammate Bobby Stewart for the 
winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Maine was banned from the tournament for three years for  
violating NCAA rules, the Black Bears won the 1993 national 
championship and lost in the title game to Boston University in 
1995.

<HEADLINE> Religious Groups Plan for Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Most U.S. religious groups are getting their computers ready and  
scaling back events in advance of 2000, but some say careful 
planning can't totally insulate them from the computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious organizations with extensive computer networks are  
working feverishly to replace computers or correct programs so 
computers will not misread the date when the year rolls over to 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Major denominations including Episcopal, Roman Catholic, United  
Methodist, Presbyterian, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal have been 
working for months to put their systems in order by year's end. 
Costs are in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming along according to our schedule,'' said Bobbie  
Binggeli, a leader of a Y2K task force at the Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.) headquarters in Louisville, Ky. ``We have taken it very 
seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in-house managers have used the extra scrutiny caused by  
Y2K to rebuild or replace aging computer networks. Groups that 
can't replace equipment for everyone are taking a thrifty approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking: `Is it essential for that item to be Y2K  
compliant?','' says Ellie Anderson, director of information 
technology for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. The 
2.3-million-member archdiocese runs the nation's largest parochial 
education system with 325 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, we have laminating equipment, but it will still  
work even if it's not ready for Y2K,'' Anderson said. ``As long as 
it boots up, it's not an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of most concern in the United States are pension and insurance  
records of ministers. The worst disruptions are expected overseas, 
where missionaries and other staff could have a difficult time if 
predictions of power outages and off-line ATMs hold true. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is huge,'' said Daniel Carr, a management  
information systems manager at Catholic Relief Services 
headquarters in Baltimore, which has offices in 60 other countries. 
``We should have within our control things like our computers ... 
our communications equipment. What's concerning us is our outside 
vendors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travel plans are also being evaluated, since computers play a  
major role in air-traffic control networks worldwide. And American 
groups often bring their workers home for the year-end holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with nearly  
60,000 missionaries around the world, is considering suspending 
travel by its workers around New Year's Day, Don LeFevre, a church 
spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern over travel in part has prompted InterVarsity Christian  
Fellowship to delay for a year its triennial missions conference 
originally scheduled for Dec. 27-31. If the conference in Urbana, 
Ill., had not been postponed, 18,000 people, mostly American 
college students, would have been traveling Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be the heaviest travel month of this century,''  
said Allan Beeber, a computer expert for Campus Crusade for Christ, 
a similar college-age ministry based in Orlando, Fla. The group has 
urged its leaders to complete its annual regional holiday 
conferences for students before Dec. 31. Campus Crusade is spending 
$3 million to become Y2K-compatible by spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Promise Keepers also are scaling back plans for events Jan.  
1 at state capitals nationwide. To minimize travel, they now are 
encouraging in-home gatherings and events at local churches 
</P>
<P>
	The Assemblies of God has been working on Y2K for five years and  
is nearly finished. Leaders of the church warn members on its Web 
site that ``needless fear and alarmist tactics'' such as hoarding 
food and believing doomsday scenarios ``conflict with the teachings 
of our Lord himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, the 8.5  
million-member Church of God in Christ, installed a Y2K-friendly 
database six months ago at its headquarters in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Law, the denomination's chief financial officer, will  
meet with IBM and a software company to put together a new 
record-keeping package for local congregations and districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Small, local congregations with loose or no denomination  
affiliations must rely more on their members to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some computer-savvy leadership in our congregation,''  
said Rabbi Leonard Troupp of Temple Beth David, a Reformed 
synagogue in Commack, N.Y. The temple already has installed a 
Y2K-compliant database, in part because members had read up on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Imam Hassan Qazwini, the spiritual leader of the Islamic Center  
of America in Detroit, hasn't heard Y2K mentioned by other area 
mosque leaders. The center's private school in nearby Dearborn, 
Mich., has new computers which should not be affected. His mosque 
has a couple of administrative computers, but Qazwini didn't know 
if they were ready for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard something about computer problems, but I really didn't  
take it seriously,'' the leader said. ``I thought it was some kind 
of joke.''

<HEADLINE> General Challenge Wins for Baffert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert won the Santa Anita  
Derby for the second straight year on Saturday with General 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news for rival trainers is that Baffert also finished  
second with Prime Timber, a colt who almost didn't start because of 
a problem with his left hind foot.

	After Baffert's second straight 1-2 finish in the race, he was  
asked what was the secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good horses,'' he said. ``You've got to have good horses.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baffert now has three wins and three seconds in four Santa Anita  
derbies, and it was two of the second-place finishers, Silver Charm 
and Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby for him the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	His previous Santa Anita Derby winners were Cavonnier, second in  
the Kentucky Derby in 1996, and Indian Charlie, third last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber went off as the slight favorite, 2.40-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero, the 2.50-1 second choice who had won his only two  
previous starts, finished third in the eight-horse field as the 
2.50-1 second betting choice. Prime Timber was the favorite at 
2.40-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Honest Lady finished seventh and won't be going to  
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this race tells you is that you get to graduate,'' Baffert  
said. ``Now we get to go to the big show. This is where you start 
thinking Derby dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, a California-bred gelding, and Prime Timber,  
a Florida-bred colt, certainly have the ability to again make 
Baffert the star of the big show on May 1 at Churchill Downs by 
giving him an unprecedented third straight Kentucky Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will also have two top 3-year-old fillies -- Excellent  
Meeting, who won the Fantasy at Oaklawn Park on Friday, and 
Silverbulletday, who won the Ashland at Keeneland on Saturday -- in 
Kentucky. For now they are being pointed at the Kentucky Oaks on 
Derby Eve, and not the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, wearing blinkers for the first time, took the  
lead just at the half-mile pole, opened up daylight and won by 3 1/2 
lengths over Prime Timber, who had been fifth with a half-mile 
remaining in the 1 1/8-mile race. Desert Hero finished another 3 1/2 
lengths back and 1 1/4 lengths in front of Charismatic, a 40-1 shot 
trained by D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were asking a lot of him today, just coming right back from  
Louisiana,'' jockey Gary Stevens said of General Challenge, who was 
fifth in the Louisiana Derby on March 14 for his only loss in five 
career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of the blinkers was a big turnaround,'' Stevens  
said. ``It made him focus a lot more. He's got a lot of energy that 
can be used for a negative or a positive and it was a positive 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said Prime Timber must have stepped on something on the  
track on Friday and bruised his left hind foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think he was going to run today,'' Baffert said. The  
injury was soaked and treated overnight and, said Baffert, ``this 
morning he was fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber now has three seconds and three victories in six  
career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, owned by John and Betty Mabee, was timed in  
1:48.92 under scale weight of 120 pounds and paid $7.60, $3.30 and 
$2.80 while earning $450,000 from the $750,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, ridden by David Flores and owned by Aaron and  
Marie Jones, returned $3.40 and $2.40. Desert Hero, ridden by Corey 
Nakatani, paid $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Desert Hero, who didn't race as a 2-year-old, would go  
to the Derby, trainer Richard Mandella said: ``No idea yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Charismatic in fourth, the rest of the field in order was  
Walk That Walk, Capsized, Honest Lady and High Wire Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady carried 115 pounds.

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The coach looks at Jason Krog and sees  
Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog was very deserving of college hockey's top honor, the coach  
said, comparing the New Hampshire center's ability to control a 
game with that of basketball great Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	And that praise came from the coach of the rival team, Maine's  
Shawn Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an excellent player,'' Walsh said Friday after Krog  
received the Hobey Baker Award, the first time a New Hampshire 
player has been so honored. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Walsh's players, Steve Kariya, was among the 10 finalists  
for the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog and Kariya, both seniors, will play their college finale  
this evening as Hockey East rivals New Hampshire and Maine meet for 
the fifth time this season, with the NCAA championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools split their four earlier meetings, although New  
Hampshire won the last two by one-sided scores, 6-1 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed with the way the regular season wound up.  
We didn't play well, and give them credit, they've played 
excellent,'' Kariya said. ``We'll need a better performance against 
them if we're going to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said it's no surprise the teams are very familiar with  
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting to be playing against our neighbor and traveling  
partner,'' he said. ``We've been on the road together, seen these 
guys so much on the ice, in hallways and hotel lobbies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire coach Richard Umile added, ``This is obviously the  
rubber match. These are two teams that know each other real well 
and have a lot of respect for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh echoed that high regard, saying, ``It's turned into a nice  
rivalry instead of a bitter rivalry. The bottom line, though, is 
we're both going for the same prize and only one of us is going to 
get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance in the title game will be the first for New  
Hampshire, a 4-0 loser to Michigan in last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most satisfying things is that our team was picked  
to finish in the middle of our league. The guys really stepped it 
up and had career seasons,'' said Krog, who led the nation with 84 
points on 34 goals and 50 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire finished first in Hockey East by beating Maine  
twice and dropping the Black Bears to second, three points back. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, whose brother Paul plays on the same Arrowhead Pond ice  
with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, has 65 points this season, with 
27 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats (31-6-3) overpowered Michigan State 5-3 in the  
semis on Thursday, with Krog contributing two goals and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine (30-6-4) edged Boston College 2-1 in a semifinal match of  
Hockey East teams, with freshman Niko Dimitrakos tying the game in 
the third period, then setting up teammate Bobby Stewart for the 
winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Maine was banned from the tournament for three years for  
violating NCAA rules, the Black Bears won the 1993 national 
championship and lost in the title game to Boston University in 
1995.
