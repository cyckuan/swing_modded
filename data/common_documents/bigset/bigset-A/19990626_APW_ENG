<HEADLINE> Vancouver Picks Swedish Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Swedish twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin expressed  
their desire to play together on an NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver general manager Brian Burke wanted the pair, and that  
triggered a series of trades that reshaped the top of the NHL draft 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said (Friday night) that `I've got (the No. 3 pick overall)  
and no one is leaving here with both of them -- only I can','' Burke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Burke, who after a few moves ended up with the second and third  
picks, stepped to the podium and, in one announcement, said the 
Canucks had taken the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel and Henrik, identical twins, were ranked first and  
second, respectively, among the European players. They played 
together in the Swedish Elite League and, now, they'll have their 
wish -- a chance to be teammates in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for us,'' Henrik said. ``We've played together for  
five, six years. Of course we wanted to play together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke started the process when Chicago won the draft lottery May  
16. He immediately started talking with the Blackhawks in hopes of 
acquiring Chicago's pick, No. 4. He did, trading defenseman Bryan 
McCabe and Vancouver's No. 1 pick in 2000 or 2001 for the 
Blackhawk's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he moved that pick to Tampa Bay with the 75th and 88th  
choices overall for the Lightning's pick, No. 1 in the draft. 
Finally, the Canucks traded the first overall pick and a 
conditional third-round choice in 2000 to Atlanta for the 
Thrashers' choice, second overall. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Vancouver had its twins.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing came together maybe 15 minutes before (the  
draft started),'' Burke said. ``We paid a high price to get this 
closed in my opinion. To our way of thinking, one of them standing 
alone wasn't going to make it because they made it clear they 
weren't coming (next year) alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sedin twins aren't certain they'll be in the NHL next  
season. If they weren't selected together, though, they said they 
wouldn't likely come to the league for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't signed (with the Swedish League) yet, but we wanted  
to get this over,'' said the 6-foot, 2-inch Henrik. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Canucks haven't said to us we have to come over next year,  
so its our decision,'' said the 6-1 Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Canucks are happy to have the 18-year-olds.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were voted co-MVPs in the Swedish League,'' Burke said.  
``To have two people of their age be co-MVPs is (incredible). These 
kids are playing against men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke also was excited that they're coming to Canada.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a good day for the Canadian teams,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And a good day for the Sedin twins.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Lorenzo Manta came into Wimbledon with  
a record of 0-11 in ATP Tour, Davis Cup and Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell that to 1996 champion Richard Krajicek.  
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-seeded Krajicek, playing on the so-called ``Graveyard  
of Champions'' -- Wimbledon's Court 2 -- fell to the 196th-ranked 
Manta 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 4-6, 6-4 in Saturday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a point (two years ago) I was thinking about  
retiring, but I always felt I could do better than this,'' Manta 
said. ``It's nice that it happened in Wimbledon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manta, 24, has battled shoulder, elbow and hand injuries the  
last two years. In February his hand went numb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no blood circulation in my fingers, so I couldn't hold  
my racket anymore,'' he said. ``After two weeks it was OK again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been that kind of career -- until this week -- for Manta, who  
plays Gustavo Kuerten in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek was almost matter-of-fact about the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's just had a great tournament and it's just disappointing  
that I started off very poorly,'' he said. ``The last couple of 
games he returned unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AUSSIE, AUSSIE:* Australian Jelena Dokic, who shocked Martina  
Hingis in the first round, reached the fourth round by beating Anne 
Kremer 6-7 (6-7), 6-3, 6-4 Saturday. And she can see herself 
getting by Mary Pierce in the next match. ``Once it gets to the 
last 16, last eight, anything can happen and anybody can be there 
and go to the semis and the final,'' said the Belgrade-born 
16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new-name Aussie also reached the fourth round, as  
qualifier Wayne Arthurs, 28, beat Tommy Haas 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-3), 
7-6 (7-2). Arthurs will face French Open champion Andre Agassi in 
the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to be broken. It's my goal,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The surface makes everything even out there. If I'm serving  
well, I can go with probably most guys out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFENSE ON TRACK:* Two weeks ago, defending Wimbledon titlist  
Jana Novotna had serious doubts because of an ankle injury. On 
Saturday, the fifth-ranked Novotna cruised into the fourth round 
with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't really sure if I'm going to be here. So everything  
that I do here at Wimbledon for me is a bonus,'' Novotna said. 
``And, again, when I step on the court again I will play and fight 
for every ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna, who won the singles and doubles championship last year,  
said the pressure was on her rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel relaxed, and I feel that the pressure is now on  
somebody else, not on me, which is very pleasant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have won my first Grand Slam, and now I can just focus on  
playing and winning maybe another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NET MATES:* Former No. 1 Lindsay Davenport doesn't have time to  
spend on the phone talking to prospective doubles partners, so she 
surfs the internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go online a lot -- there are so many players on tour and it's  
hard to call and much easier to e-mail them. My last two doubles 
partners, Mary Pierce and Corina Morariu, I both got by the 
computer,'' the third-seeded Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it's a good luck thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Davenport has won 24 career doubles titles, including the U.S.  
and French opens, and been a finalist at every Grand Slam venue. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RIPOFF MERCHANTS:* Plain-clothes police officers will try to  
combat ticket scalpers, a yearly project at Wimbledon. Tickets for 
the final with a face value of 60 pounds ($95) have reportedly gone 
on the black market for 2,000 pounds ($3,160). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DREAM'S END:* Australian 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt lost in  
three sets to Boris Becker on Saturday, but said playing the 
three-time Wimbledon champion in his ``backyard'' was a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's any kid's dream growing up, idolizing Boris Becker, to be  
out there on Centre Court at Wimbledon where he's won three times, 
to be out there playing against him, just seeing how good he really 
is,'' Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly not the favorite to win, but he's got to be up  
there,'' Hewitt said of Becker. ``He's serving well now. If he 
keeps that up, he could go a long way.''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Denies Prosecutor's Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A man sentenced to life in prison for  
killing a family as part of a plot to set up a whites-only nation 
in the Pacific Northwest says there's no truth to prosecutors' 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no aims, no group, nothing of that nature,'' Chevie  
Kehoe, 26, said in a telephone interview from jail Friday after he 
was sentenced to five terms of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., and a co-defendant, Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., were convicted last month of racketeering, conspiracy 
and three counts of murder in the deaths of William Mueller, his 
wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter Sarah Powell in January 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors already have recommended the death penalty for Lee, who  
has a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At his sentencing, Kehoe maintained he was innocent. Asked  
afterward if he knew who had killed the Mueller family, Kehoe said 
he couldn't answer that question yet because of the complex nature 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lee and Kehoe wanted Mueller's guns to sell or  
use to further their conspiracy to overthrow the government and set 
up a new nation where people of Asian, black, Hispanic and Jewish 
descent would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe said he considered himself a white separatist, but not a  
white supremacist, because he believes that nature intended for 
different races to be separate. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he didn't expect his separatist beliefs to cause any  
problems for him in prison because he'd never had any problems 
getting along with people of other ethnic backgrounds.

<HEADLINE> LatAm Leaders Discuss Capital Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Diplomats worked feverishly  
Saturday to break an impasse over language on regulating the 
international flow of capital in advance of a summit of Latin 
American, Caribbean and European leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and Chile have pressed hard to include wording on capital  
controls in the Declaration of Rio de Janeiro to be signed at a 
two-day summit starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil was among the hardest hit by the financial crisis that  
swept from Asia two years ago, and argues that making it harder for 
capital to jump from country to country would reduce the world 
economy's volatility and curb the spread of crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The respected O Globo of Rio newspaper reported Saturday that a  
section on capital flow would be part of the summit's final 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilian Foreign Ministry sources were unclear. Spokesman  
Jose Alfredo Graca Lima said it might be included. But another 
ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it 
would not be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, diplomats said the overall declaration was nearly  
complete. The document is expected to cover a wide range of topics, 
from human rights to terrorism, illegal drugs and free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	They resumed work Saturday at Rio's Museum of Modern Art, the  
site of the summit, to complete a draft declaration for a meeting 
of foreign ministers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the final document contains broad, nonbinding language  
on capital controls, the mere mention would be a victory for 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a reference ``would express the concern of Europe to which  
this capital submits entire economies around the world,'' Francisco 
Gomes, Latin American director for the European Commission, was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thailand's economy crashed in 1997 and started a global  
panic, investors pulled their money out of emerging markets, 
including Brazil. The government lost $10 billion literally 
overnight and decreed a series of spending cuts and tax increases 
that slowed the economy to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the growing fear among investors that Brazil would  
default on debt payments prompted another run on the Brazilian 
currency, the real. The government was forced to devalue the real, 
which plunged 45 percent before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has proposed a  
``redesigning'' of the global financial system to make it more 
difficult for capital to jump around. Germany, Portugal and Spain 
reportedly have been sympathetic to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal is the so-called ``Tobin Tax,'' which would be  
a duty on financial operations with the income earmarked for a fund 
to help economies in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda are a proposal to start talks about a free  
trade zone linking the European Union and Mercosur, the South 
American trade bloc that comprises Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, 
Paraguay and associated members Chile and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the expected agreement on trade talks was hailed as a  
victory, EU Vice President Manuel Marin said Saturday there is no 
deadline for the talks to start or end. It was widely reported that 
the talks would start in 2001 and conclude by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The first leader to arrive in Rio on Saturday was Mexican  
President Ernesto Zedillo, who was scheduled to have lunch with 
Cardoso on Sunday. The others are expected Sunday and Monday 
morning.

<HEADLINE> Energy's Nuke Weapons Chief Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The Energy Department's top official  
overseeing the nation's nuclear weapons programs has resigned 
because of differences with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson over 
the department's organization, administration sources said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Reis, assistant secretary for defense programs, submitted  
his resignation in a letter to President Clinton on Friday, said 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis could not be reached immediately Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Reis is one of a number of officials targeted by an internal  
review into the mishandling of an espionage investigation involving 
a Taiwan-born scientist at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said, however, that Reis cited as the reason for his  
resignation his differences with Richardson over creation of a 
largely autonomous nuclear weapons agency within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson opposed such an agency, believing it will reduce the  
energy secretary's authority and create a ``fiefdom'' largely 
immune from outside scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not agree to an agency I cannot control,'' Richardson  
said last week when asked about pressure in Congress for DOE 
reorganization following the espionage and security problems at the 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis has told Richardson he supports legislation being proposed  
by three Republican senators, including Sen. Pete Domenici of New 
Mexico, to put all nuclear weapons programs under an agency that 
would report to Richardson, but would make its own budget and 
personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has suggested streamlining the lines of authority  
within the weapons program and raising its profile by making its 
head an undersecretary. Security and counterintelligence activities 
and budget decision and personnel decision making must remain 
elsewhere in the department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed to his post in 1993 by then-Energy Secretary Hazel  
O'Leary, Reis has been in charge of the nuclear weapons programs 
during a time when department security officials complained of lax 
security and concern about espionage at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those officials have told Congress that they were  
thwarted by senior Energy Department officials from pressing their 
case or discussing it with congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has acknowledged mistakes were made in the  
investigation, beginning in 1996, of the Los Alamos scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has been criticized particularly for not  
searching the scientist's computer early in the investigation and 
for not removing him promptly from his sensitive job. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired in March for security  
violations. He has not been charged with a crime and has denied 
through his lawyer providing secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal review of the handling of the security complaints  
and the Lee espionage investigation by Energy Department officials 
is expected to be completed within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said some DOE and Los Alamos lab officials will  
be fired and disciplined.

<HEADLINE> Top VMI Cadet Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The dismissal of Virginia Military  
Institute's top cadet for allegedly demanding sex from female 
cadets does not represent a widespread problem, the head of the 
formerly all-male school said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Webb II was expelled last month for conduct unbecoming a  
cadet after he was accused of seeking sexual favors from three 
freshmen. Webb, of Casper, Wyo., had previously been chosen as the 
regimental commander of the Corps of Cadets for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as these allegations came to light in the barracks,  
the cadet Honor Court and the administration moved with prudent 
rapidity to do what was necessary,'' VMI Superintendent Josiah 
Bunting said in a telephone interview Saturday. ``It was really the 
first major challenge we've had to the efficient working of 
co-education here so far as sexual misconduct, sexual harassment is 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we have a systemic problem,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The school was forced to admit women three years ago when the  
U.S. Supreme Court found its admission policy unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The school said the women involved in the accusations are  
expected to be back in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is unlikely to appeal his dismissal, Bunting said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response Saturday to a telephone message  
left at the home of the only Jerry Webb listed in Casper. 
</P>
<P>
	The regimental commander is expected to exemplify VMI's  
military, physical and academic standards.

<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Michael Johnson's day of decision is Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when the double Olympic champion will test his ailing  
right quadriceps and decide whether he'll go to Europe Tuesday for 
a series of European meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson injured the leg Thursday during a practice session for  
the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. At first, he thought 
it was a minor twinge and didn't even tell his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he warmed up and determined that it was too risky to  
compete in the championships and in the ballyhooed 200-meter 
showdown against 100-meter world record-holder Maurice Greene. On 
Saturday, Johnson returned home to Dallas to rest before making his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can sprint right now,'' Johnson said before  
departing. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted he was not ducking Greene.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to be here,'' Johnson, the world record-holder in  
the 200 and the Olympic gold medalist in the 200 and 400, said. 
``Nobody is paying me to be here. I'm in the world championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who will try to qualify for the world 200 Sunday, said  
Johnson's withdrawal didn't concern him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about that right now,'' he said. ``I still have  
a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are the qualifier for the U.S. team  
for the world championships at Seville, Spain in August. As 
defending champion in the 400, Johnson is already in the worlds. He 
had planned to use the nationals as a determining factor on whether 
to run the 200 or 400 in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's next scheduled race is a 400 at Lausanne, Switzerland  
on Friday. He also plans to run a 200 at Rome and 400s at Linz, 
Austria and Stockholm, Sweden in July. 
</P>

	 *BACK IN THE USA:* Just a few years ago, American Tom Petranoff  
was living in South Africa, his best javelin-throwing days behind 
him, and becoming a ``professional beer drinker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the 41-year-old got new life by finishing second in  
the javelin throw. His toss of 246 feet, 9 inches on his second 
throw trailed only Tom Pukstys, who threw 256 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a Neanderthal,'' the burly, 240-pound Petranoff  
said after his first international meet since the 1993 world 
championships in Stuttgart, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Petranoff moved to South Africa, which was barred from  
international competition because of its policy of apartheid. The 
ban was lifted in time for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, but 
Petranoff withdrew because black South African athletes were angry 
that he had citizenship and they did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Petranoff retired in 1993, and spent time raising his four  
daughters and developing a line of javelins, one for competition 
and a tiny plastic one for children. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his family moved back in December 1997 when violence in  
the country moved too close to his home in the suburbs of 
Johannesburg. A neighbor who lived up the street was murdered in 
her driveway in front of her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to go,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Petranoff, who lost 20 pounds for the national meet, said he  
plans to make a run at a spot on the U.S. Olympic team next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to get to around 225 to be lethal,'' he said. ``But  
that'll be next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *TOGETHERNESS:* Alan Culpepper won the 10,000 meters on  
Thursday, but he moved at a sprinter's speed after his wife, 
Shayne, came up limping after a third-place finish in the 1,500 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shayne Culpepper had been dealing with a painful foot injury the  
past few weeks, and it began acting up late in her race. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was coming down the last 75 meters, and she said it just  
popped,'' Alan Culpepper said. ``She ran really tough. We just hope 
we can get this taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shayne will take a couple of weeks off before running again, but  
the injury isn't expected to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran the race in 4:08.69, just over six seconds behind winner  
Regina Jacobs, but still good enough to join her husband for the 
world championships in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HAMILTON'S RETURN:* Middle-distance runner Suzy Hamilton, nine  
weeks removed from surgery on her left Achilles' tendon, hopes to 
be running again in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	She is still undecided whether to compete this year, or wait  
until next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The summer doesn't look good,'' Hamilton said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the 1998 national outdoor champion and 1999 indoor  
champion at 1,500 meters, indicated she might return to competition 
in some road races in the fall, then prepare for a big outdoor 
season in 2000, capped by the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to break the American record in the 1,500 and next year  
is the right year to do it,'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton watched the first two days of the USA Championships,  
but returned home to Madison, Wis., on Saturday, the day of the 
women's 1,500 final. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my race,'' she said. ``I couldn't bear to watch.''

<HEADLINE> Khrushchev's Son Happy in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRANSTON, R.I. (AP) -- Sergei Khrushchev is home.  
</P>
<P>
	Home, for the favorite son of the late Soviet leader Nikita  
Khrushchev, is a clapboard ranch house in the Providence 'burbs -- a 
two-bedroom model surrounded by look-alike houses, driveways full 
of Buicks and Dodges and finely Lawn-Boy'd grass. 
</P>
<P>
	And why is a rocket engineer who designed missiles that were  
pointed at the United States at the height of the Cold War now 
living out his years on the corner of Neptune and Laurelton, across 
from the Garden City school playground? 
</P>
<P>
	This half-acre of suburbia, he says, is ``retirement paradise.''  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, it's no Varadero, Cuba. But Cranston can sizzle in the  
spring, as on this June afternoon. Big, heavy sun. Cloudless sky. 
Temp pushing 88. It's enough to make a 63-year-old communist -- uh, 
former communist -- feel young again. 
</P>
<P>
	What could better illustrate how the Cold War has come full  
circle than the sight of this barbecue-loving, proud-to-be-a 
suburbanite dabbling about his American dacha? 
</P>
<P>
	This is no ordinary Russian immigrant. This is the son of the  
bald-headed nemesis who banged his shoe on the table at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The guy who declared, not too tactfully, ``We will bury you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The guy who oversaw the building of the Berlin Wall, who ordered  
Soviet tanks to crush a revolt in Hungary, who cost the world 
sleepless nights by sending nuclear missiles to Cuba in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	And now his son, Sergei, wants to become an American. Just days  
shy of his 64th birthday -- the same age his father was at the 
height of his power -- he is applying for U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	(He took the test in Providence on Wednesday and nearly aced it  
-- he got 19 of 20 questions right. His wife, Valentina, did him 
one better, with a perfect score. They will take their pledge of 
allegiance on July 12.) 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, he's shelved his U.S. history books and put aside  
the multiple choice practice quizzes (``How many stars are on the 
U.S. flag?'' ... ``For what famous Civil War speech is Abraham 
Lincoln known?''). He has slipped into clothes appropriate for 
South Florida: khaki shorts, leather moccasins and a short-sleeved, 
tangerine-colored shirt with embroidered, white swirls. A little 
something his wife, Valentina Golenko, picked up at the Rhode 
Island Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev sets a couple of plastic patio chairs down in his  
backyard under his latest achievement -- a latticework to 
accommodate three grapevines he's just planted -- and sinks into a 
chair, gingerly, as if settling into a hot tub. Arthritis in both 
hips makes sitting a chore. 
</P>
<P>
	He undoes a third shirt button.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ah, I love the heat,'' Khrushchev says in flutey,  
Russian-accented English. ``And this sky, it reminds me of Ukraine 
sky.'' He pours some Shaw's Lemon-Lime soda into a whiskey glass 
for his guest. What? No Stolichnaya? 
</P>
<P>
	``Too hot for vodka,'' he explains. Then a hefty chuckle. ``This  
is spring in Rhode Island, not Moscow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life, American style, could be worse.  
</P>
<P>
	It means waking to the chik-chik-chik of lawn sprinklers,  
shopping for mulch and paneling and paint at the Home Depot (``I 
love Home Depot -- it pushes you to some creation.''), browsing at 
flea markets, growing pink roses in the front yard and 
strawberries, gooseberries, lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev now has time to water his night violets, prune  
``Nicholas'' and ``Veronica,'' his pear trees, trim his two yews, 
and putter with his collections of African butterflies and Cuban 
seashells. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturdays, from November through late March, he and  
Valentina work up a sweat in their basement ``banya,'' the 
traditional Russian steam bath, thwacking each other's bare backs 
and bottoms with bundles of birch twigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did all of the paneling in the basement ourselves,''  
Khrushchev says in a proud moment while giving a visitor a tour of 
his home. ``We built our banya, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the paneled walls of his basement, on the walls of his study,  
living room, dining room, giants of history stare from 
black-and-white photographs taken during a time when the downing of 
a U-2 spy plane made a newly nuclear world hold its breath: 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita Khrushchev, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mrs. Nina Petrovna  
Khrushchev, grinning, albeit nervously, on the steps of the U.S. 
president's retreat at Camp David, Md.; Papa Khrushchev, Sergei, 
and his toddler, Nikita Jr., strolling the grounds of the premier's 
Moscow country gardens in 1962; Sergei with Yuri Gagarin, the first 
man to orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze ``X'' atop the fireplace mantel -- a gift from Ernst  
Neizvestny, the dissident Soviet sculptor who, despite a violent 
shouting match with the Soviet leader in 1963, designed the 
monument that has stood at Khrushchev's grave in Novodevich 
cemetery since his death in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows and rows of books on his father's life, reports and  
speeches, in Russian, lining shelves along the wall in his cellar. 
</P>
<P>
	A black, lacquered silverware box decorated with a hand-painted,  
Velasquez-like portrait of Nikita Khrushchev, the Champion of 
Communism, somber in his navy blue uniform, three gold stars pinned 
to his left breast pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	From the side, Sergei Khrushchev looks -- it's almost spooky --  
like Papa: the sapphire-blue eyes, the shoe-button nose, the white 
tufts of hair rimming square forehead, the round, beefy jowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The resemblance is so striking that when he first came to the  
United States to lecture at Brown University in September, 1991 -- 
nine months after the Soviet Union collapsed -- students, faculty, 
even mailmen, would stop and stare ``as if I were a white 
elephant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even today, he says, little old ladies with pushcarts sometimes  
stop him in the supermarket aisle and ask: ``Didn't I see you the 
other night on the History Channel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surname, the Nikita look, can sometimes be a nuisance:  
Khrushchev recalls having once had an invitation to a dinner party 
canceled because the host, a retired U.S. army general, wouldn't 
have a communist in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Sergei Khrushchev says he stopped believing in  
communism's ultimate triumph as early as the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``we will bury you'' remark was misunderstood, he insists.  
``He meant that capitalism would die and that the Soviet economic 
system would bury it. But my father was a part of the Cold War, a 
war of propaganda, and so these words were used against him and 
misunderstood by Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But all of us make mistakes. You can't live in paradise  
surrounded by barbed wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev harbors no bad feelings, though. He's gregarious,  
neighborly, charming. He often invites his neighbors over to show 
off his green thumb or for steak barbecues. He loves American 
steaks, but only those cooked at home on the grill, unless, of 
course, he's traveling in Kansas. ``Kansas steaks are the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, this is not the life young Sergei and his three sisters knew  
as Cold War kids in a world of Communist Party privilege: 
chauffeured limousines, massive downtown Moscow apartments, access 
to scarce Western goods and the best schools, hunting and fishing 
trips with Papa Khrushchev on the premier's country estate. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from being chief of the Soviet Missile Design  
Bureau from 1958 to 1968, first deputy director at the Control 
Computer Institute in Moscow, and a professor of missile guidance 
systems at Moscow Technical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's certainly beyond the glory days when he won the Lenin  
Prize and the Prize of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. for 
his work with missiles and computer-guidance control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the mornings, Khrushchev can rise when he wants (usually  
7 a.m.), have a cup of plain yogurt, perhaps some smoked fish and 
coffee, switch the tweeting phone to answering-machine mode, and 
sit at his mahogany desk to write. 
</P>
<P>
	For five hours at a stretch, he scratches out his memoirs in  
longhand. Then Valentina scoops up the scribble, sits on a stool in 
the kitchen and types it out on an electric Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
	In his three books published in America, Khrushchev does his  
best to soften history's verdict of his father. He describes Papa's 
love of family, Papa's fight to provide cheap housing for all 
Soviet citizens, Papa's attempt to get Soviet farmers to plant 
corn, Papa's push to produce more consumer goods and trim the 
military budget. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the peasant-turned-premier tumbled abruptly  
from power after 11 years, on Oct. 24, 1964, the first Soviet 
leader who didn't die in office. After his fall, the man with the 
hands-flying, jaws-working, piggie-eyes-darting style plunged into 
a deep depression, often dissolving in bathetic tears. 
</P>
<P>
	To pull him out his funk, his wife, Nina, gave him a German tape  
recorder and he took to dictating his memoirs on a bench in the 
family garden. Eventually, the tapes were smuggled out to the West 
and fashioned into a two-volume best seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita Khrushchev died an ``unperson,'' in classic Soviet  
fashion, unlamented and unloved by the general Soviet public, 
edited out of books, airbrushed out of photographs, the mere 
mention of his name a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, in a Rhode Island suburb halfway around the world,  
trumpeting the Khrushchev name is no longer a crime. So his son 
works and works and works to write ``more truthful portraits of my 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His fourth book, ``Creation of Superpower,'' by Penn State  
Press, is to arrive in bookstores in the winter of 2000. ``I feel 
pressure, on the inside, to fulfill an obligation to myself, my 
father, my country, to America, to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Khrushchev finishes his morning writing, he lunches, then  
climbs into his 1994 Buick Century and drives 20 minutes to a drab, 
colonial-style house on a leafy Providence street, Brown's Center 
for International Studies. There, he reads the Russian papers, 
maybe a passage from Gogol, Pushkin, Dickens. And he never misses 
the Moscow evening TV news, live in his tiny office via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Only on Fridays does he return home late. That's the one day a  
week he must lecture to undergraduate seniors on ``Relations Among 
Post-Soviet States.'' Otherwise, he's free to speak as he pleases, 
wherever he pleases. 
</P>
<P>
	And speak Khrushchev does: At CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.;  
at the Naval War College in Rhode Island; on Royal Olympic cruise 
ships; at farm forums in Montana, at political science conferences 
from Florida to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's one bad thing I picked up from my father,'' he  
says, ``it would have to be that I talk too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev has three sons: Nikita, 39, who works for a Moscow  
publishing house; Ilyad, 29, a computer engineer who sells 
communications equipment; Sergei Jr., 25, a college student in 
Moscow. Whenever they phone, they urge their parents to come home. 
</P>
<P>
	No way, says Khrushchev.  
</P>
<P>
	Not even for a visit?  
</P>
<P>
	He shakes his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, no. I want to live the rest of my life here. I'm  
comfortable here. I like the heat in Rhode Island. And what would I 
do in Russia? I cannot return to the job I left in 1991, at the 
Soviet Control Computer Institute. Someone else has the job. And my 
contacts? Well, there is no more Soviet Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His retirement rubles and pension have all been devoured by  
Russian inflation, he says. ``My son called me once, asking for a 
little money, and I said, 'Sure, take what's in my bank account. He 
said, 'Papa, it wouldn't be enough to pay for a Driver's-Ed 
course.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So what's next for Khrushchev?  
</P>
<P>
	After months of brushing up on Americana, he can't wait to get  
his hands on that U.S. passport. Not that he needed to bother with 
a citizenship test. Six years ago, Khrushchev received permanent 
resident status, thanks, in part, to supporting letters from former 
President Richard Nixon; Robert McNamara, defense secretary in the 
Kennedy and Johnson administrations; Thomas J. Watson Jr., chairman 
emeritus of I.B.M.; and a former C.I.A. official, David Gries. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Khrushchev, citizenship is special.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are living in a country, and you plan to live in that  
country for a long time, I think it is your obligation to become 
its citizen,'' Khrushchev says. 
</P>
<P>
	Would his father approve?	   ``I would hope that my father would be supportive,'' he says.  
``After all, it's not as if I am defecting.''

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law To Expire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side-by-side in rare harmonious agreement,  
President Clinton, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and Congress 
will watch the law that led to a presidential impeachment disappear 
on Wednesday into the dust bin of history. 
</P>
<P>
	The law's political and legislative legacy will live on for  
years, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the nation's second impeached president, still has 18  
months left in his term. Starr's investigation continues. The 
debate on Capitol Hill over who should investigate future charges 
against senior government officials is unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	After 21 years, nearly as many independent counsel  
investigations, and white-hot hostilities over Clinton's 
impeachment trial, lawmakers are not inclined to plunge into that 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Congress decides, Justice Department investigators will  
look into any such charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment is too politically complicated,'' said one of  
the law's original sponsors, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists the government cannot be trusted to investigate  
itself. Nonetheless, he acknowledged in a recent interview, ``We 
need to give it a bit of a rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's unprecedented five-year investigation united otherwise  
fierce political enemies in the notion that the law that empowered 
Starr is fatally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr stunned lawmakers of both parties in April when he adopted  
even his staunchest enemies' disdain for the statute. He blamed 
public outrage over his tactics on the structure of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``If politicization and the loss of public confidence are  
inevitable, then we should leave the full responsibility where our 
laws and traditions place it, on the attorney general,'' he said. 
The statute, he added, was ``constitutionally dubious'' and left 
room for abuse by counsels empowered by it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had been making that case for years, particularly  
during Lawrence Walsh's investigation of charges that the Reagan 
White House sold arms to Iran and diverted the proceeds to the 
Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Starr's $50 million investigation of Clinton, which  
moved from the president's land dealings to his statements under 
oath about an affair with Monica Lewinsky, that convinced 
Democrats, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I voted for it. I made a mistake,'' the Senate's top Democrat,  
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told reporters last week. ``I believe 
it was well-intended, but misguided. I would much prefer to handle 
(these) matters in the future within the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers complain the law does not hold such prosecutors  
accountable for the money they spend or the tactics they use, 
providing no politically practical way to fire overzealous 
counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of an independent counsel law, such  
investigations will revert to the Justice Department, where they 
were handled when the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	That night in October 1973, Justice's top two officials lost  
their jobs when they refused to carry out President Nixon's order 
to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the 
Watergate break-in. Attorney General Elliot Richardson quit and 
Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was fired. Solicitor 
General Robert Bork fired Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Jaworski was appointed Nov. 1 to replace Cox as special  
prosecutor. Four months later, an indictment was returned against 
seven former presidential aides in connection with the Watergate 
cover-up. Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials say that experience shows the  
country does not need the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a lonely band of senators, that experience shows  
the government cannot be trusted to investigate itself. Led by 
Levin, they are searching for a way to enact another independent 
counsel law that limits the scope and budget of future prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overwhelming majority of lawmakers believes the Saturday  
Night Massacre proved the system set up by the Constitution does 
work; Nixon, after all, resigned under threat of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,  
Republican Fred Thompson of Tennessee, plans to introduce 
legislation that would put such investigations under the Justice 
Department and require the Attorney General to get congressional 
approval to hire and fire special prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., has introduced a similar measure in  
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levin and the other senators insist there must be a way to  
write a law that prevents abuses. These lawmakers are not as 
certain, however, that such a bill would gain support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no illusions about this being an uphill battle,'' said  
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of two Republicans pushing to introduce legislation  
to modify the independent counsel law before it expires Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There does not seem to be any interest from our leaders to try  
to reform the law, and there seems to be no interest on the 
Democratic side either.''

<HEADLINE> Uncle of Wanted Man Doubts Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN NICOLAS TOLENTINO, Mexico (AP) -- The police have found the  
real Rafael Resendiz Ramirez. He is not the much-sought railroad 
killing suspect, but the man's 66-year-old uncle, ailing and fed up 
with the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept that I am the uncle of the suspected railroad killer,  
whose true name is Angel Resendiz Resendiz,'' the uncle said in a 
written statement his family was passing out at his cement block 
home in this sugar-farming village some 65 miles southeast of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The nephew is charged with two killings in Illinois and wanted  
for questioning about five more in Texas and one in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's 10 Most Wanted List identifies the suspect as Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez -- a variation of Resendiz Ramirez -- but the 
reputed hobo reportedly has used many aliases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Angel, if you have committed those errors, I beg you to  
confront them as men do'' by turning himself in, Resendiz said in 
an earlier telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncle said he doubts the guilt of the nephew who lived with  
him for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is the witness?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz said he had been interviewed by the FBI and Mexican  
police and had received numerous calls for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask all the news media to stop besieging me, because the  
family hasn't seen him for 27 years,'' the statement said, adding 
that Resendiz suffers from diabetes and eye trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, he complained: ``I am becoming famous because  
of you,'' saying the confusion over the name defamed him. ``I have 
not killed anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that the suspect is the  
son of a farmer, Juan Reyes, and was raised by his mother until he 
was 6. The uncle said the boy never used his father's name. 
</P>
<P>
	When his mother married a military man, Luis Maturino, the boy  
went to live with his uncle, staying until he was 12, according to 
the Tribune. The mother now reportedly lives in Ciudad Juarez, 
across the border from El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncle, a farmer and grocery store owner, said in the  
interview that Angel ``did not want to study'' anymore and 
``disappeared... with no information,'' in 1972. He said he had not 
heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy apparently had been close to his grandmother, who has  
since died. ``My mother cried a lot because of his disappearance,'' 
Resendiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncle gave few details about Angel's life with him, saying  
the boy was ``normal ... neither happier nor sadder than normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle reported from the northern Mexico town of  
Rodeo that the suspect's common-law wife, Julieta Dominguez Reyes, 
said her husband was ``absolutely normal'' and showed no tendencies 
toward extreme violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's the one, because he would have to be  
extremely cold and calculating,'' the newspaper quoted her as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported it had contacted the suspect's  
mother, Virginia Resendiz de Maturino, who also said she had not 
heard from him lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is full of hate, I ask God to cure him,'' she was quoted  
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe he traverses the country aboard freight  
trains. A common thread is that the crimes occurred in homes near 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force of more than 200 investigators is  
investigating the case. A $125,000 reward is posted for his 
capture.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Soap Opera Season Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A soap opera season had a sad ending for the New  
York Knicks, whose trip to the NBA Finals came up a couple of shots 
short in the last game. 
</P>
<P>
	They endured until the end after their general manager was  
fired, their coach came under fire and their season was in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	They survived a string of injuries that left their roster  
looking like an army in full retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	And they wound up losing when their best shooter missed two  
shots at the end of Game 5 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Latrell Sprewell was shooting Friday night, those two  
shots seemed simple -- first a 15-foot jumper with 29 seconds to 
play, and then a last-gasp 6-footer with one-tenth of a second left 
on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Both missed, and they took with them New York's last chance to  
extend the season. Sprewell wound up with 35 points, including 14 
straight and 18-of-23 down the stretch. They couldn't prevent the 
Knicks from losing 78-77. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all for nothing at this point,'' Sprewell said. ``I felt  
really good out there. I shot the ball really well. I'd rather have 
two points and have the victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was the antihero. Traded to the Knicks after sitting  
out a 68-game suspension last season, he was turned into a reserve, 
and was unhappy with his role. 
</P>
<P>
	But like the fortunes of his team, all that changed in the  
playoffs and with Patrick Ewing out because of a torn Achilles' 
tendon, Sprewell and Allan Houston became the team's main scoring 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a delicious turn of events for Sprewell, largely ignored  
early on by coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was on the hot seat when the 
Knicks were struggling at 21-21 and seemed unlikely to make the 
playoffs. That's when Ernie Grunfeld lost his job as general 
manager and the team seemed in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	All at once, New York turned it around. Seeded eighth in the  
Eastern Conference, they zoomed past Miami, Atlanta and Indiana, 
earning Van Gundy -- the coach who almost was fired -- a $3.5 million 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Spurs, though, they simply ran out of healthy  
bodies. Ewing was out. Larry Johnson sprained his right knee. Chris 
Childs sprained his left knee. Chris Dudley had a hyperextended 
elbow. Attrition caught up with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not go quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night against San Antonio, Sprewell went on a  
second-half tear, scoring 14 straight points, singlehandedly 
keeping the Knicks alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The end was hard to accept for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to get a layup from the out-of-bounds,''  
Sprewell said of the final shot. ``Charlie Ward threw an excellent 
pass. I was so far under the basket. I just tried to get the shot 
off, but it was far too short. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing once you know it's finally over and you  
know the shot didn't go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy paid tribute to Sprewell.  
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell made big big shots, got to the free-throw line and  
played outstanding,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So it stood to reason that when New York needed one more basket  
in the final minute, Sprewell was the shooter they went to. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, he came close.  
</P>
<P>
	Both times, the shot missed.  
</P>
<P>
	It was an appropriate finish to a strange season.

<HEADLINE> Elite Class Within Inkster's Reach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Juli Inkster wants to ride this wave as  
long as it will last. If she can stay on top for two more rounds in 
the LPGA Championship, it might carry her all the way to the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed like a long shot at the start of the year, her 16th  
season on the LPGA Tour. She had 17 victories, three of them 
majors, but was lost in the hype over younger stars like Se Ri Pak, 
Karrie Webb and Annika Sorenstam. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Inkster could be 36 holes away from joining a really elite  
class. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster had a 5-under-par 66 on Friday, giving her a four-way  
share of the lead in her bid to become only the second woman to win 
the LPGA's modern career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what can happen?'' she said. ``I just want a chance  
come Sunday to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her bogey-free round on the DuPont Country Club course was her  
15th round under par since the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship the 
last week in April. The U.S. Open was her third victory of the 
year, and she returned two weeks later to finish third in the 
Shoprite Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is probably going to be some point when I hit the  
wall,'' Inkster said. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't look that way on a breezy, cloudy Friday afternoon.  
Inkster finished the day at 8-under 134, tied with Liselotte 
Neumann (67), Jenny Lidback (67) and Cristie Kerr, whose 64 tied 
the course record for the LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	With 36 holes left, anything can happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Kuehne, the 22-year-old Texan who gave Inkster a spirited  
challenge in the U.S. Open, continued her amazing run with a 67 and 
was one stroke behind. Two-time LPGA champion Laura Davies isn't 
getting much out of her putter, but she still managed an even-par 
71 and was only two strokes back at 136. Pak, the defending 
champion, was at 137. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love a shot come Sunday,'' Inkster said. ``But there's  
a lot of time between now and then. There's a lot of good players 
behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster needs only three points to qualify for the Hall of Fame.  
She could pick up two by winning a major championship this week, 
and her second major of the year could help her lead to another 
point if she won player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The real challenge in the Grand Slam. Only Pat Bradley has won  
the Dinah Shore, U.S. Open, LPGA Championship and the du Maurier 
Classic in a career. Mickey Wright also won the Grand Slam when it 
consisted of the Open, LPGA, Titleholders and Western Open from 
1955-1966. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on my mind right now,'' Inkster said. ``There's a lot  
of golf left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not for Karrie Webb. Her modern record of 16 consecutive top-10s  
came crashing to a halt on Friday when she recorded another 1-over 
72 and missed the cut by one stroke. It was the first time Webb 
missed the cut in 33 tournaments, dating to the Standard Register 
Ping in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really played well here before,'' Webb said. ``It's  
not the course's fault, I just don't feel comfortable on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster made birdie on two of the first three holes with 15-foot  
putts, then held it together by saving par from the bunker with an 
8-foot putt. She joined the leaders with a 7-iron to 20 feet on No. 
17 for her fifth birdie of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'm doing differently, but it just all seems  
to be working,'' Inkster said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster was in about the same position three weeks ago after two  
rounds of the U.S. Open at Old Waverly -- tied for the lead after 
the second round, with several players close on her heels. She had 
a 67 in the third round and wound up winning by five strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it takes is one hot person,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Kuehne will be up to the challenge this time. She was  
paired with Inkster in the final round at Old Waverly and put a 
scare into her by looking at eight birdie putts on the front nine, 
but making only one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Inkster is the hottest player in women's golf, Kuehne isn't  
too far behind. Once she jump-started her season -- her career, for 
that matter -- during an important swing through Texas, Kuehne has 
been living up to her billing as the female version of Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the LPGA Corning Classic. She nearly won the Open. And  
here she is again, whistling and singing and belting it down the 
middle, making all the important putts and most of her birdie 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a whole lot more relaxed this year,'' Kuehne said. ``I  
think that's pretty evident.''

<HEADLINE> Mickelson: Baby Better Than Birdie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson had never been so close to winning a U.S. Open,  
or walking away from one. 
</P>
<P>
	A short birdie putt on the 18th hole brought him to within  
stroke of the lead after three rounds on Pinehurst No. 2. Still 
silent was the pager that linked him to an expectant wife in 
Arizona and a promise to leave -- no matter what -- if she went into 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	He was starting to believe it would never beep.  
</P>
<P>
	Daily reports from the doctor in Phoenix indicated the birth was  
still 10 days away. As each day passed, Mickelson began to lock in 
on his first major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm just a smidge away,'' he said Saturday evening  
after his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven hours later, Amy Mickelson felt her first contraction.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally in tears,'' she told The Associated Press. ``The  
worst thing that could happen was I have the baby Saturday night 
and he's leading the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they had a deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson wanted to be there, not just for the birth of their  
child, but for the entire process. Even if that meant leaving the 
U.S. Open with a chance to win. Even if that meant not going at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-time winner in only seven full seasons on the PGA Tour,  
Mickelson has never won a major championship. He had never missed 
one for which he has been eligible, except for the time he broke 
his leg skiing in 1994 and sat out the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't depart for Pinehurst until two days before the  
Open, and only then after an assurance that an early delivery was 
unlikely. If anything changed, she would punch in a secret code for 
his pager, and he would come home immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made me swear left and right, up and down, that I would  
beep him,'' Amy said. 
</P>
<P>
	She never did. Ultimately, she didn't have to.  
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart won the U.S. Open over Mickelson, making a 15-foot  
par putt on the last hole to win by one stroke. One day later, 
unaware of the early contractions, Mickelson was holding a prize 
far more precious -- Amanda Brynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't describe how special that feeling is when you see your  
own child come out of the woman you love,'' Mickelson said. ``It 
was amazing. I can't believe that people would want to miss that. 
There are few experiences in life that you always cherish, and 
those events are what you live for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, Mickelson became an icon for his indomitable desire to  
give up pursuit of his first major championship to experience the 
birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
	Only later did he realize the sacrifice his wife was willing to  
make for him. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The loophole in their deal was Tribulatin, a drug that slows the  
labor process. Amy went to the hospital that Saturday night begging 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just give me 24 hours,'' she told her doctor. ``I was telling  
my brother to tape my knees together. Just don't let her come for 
one more day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After about three hours, contractions that had been only 4  
minutes apart became irregular and eventually ceased. Mickelson 
woke up Sunday morning for the final round unaware of what had 
transpired in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy wasn't about to tell him.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had enough to think about,'' she said. ``He called me  
before the round and I started to cry. He said, 'Why are you 
crying?' I said, 'I just love you so much.' I didn't want to tell 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She watched the final round on the sofa, using pillows to prop  
up her pelvis and prevent the baby from dropping any farther. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson played brilliantly. One birdie and no bogeys gave him  
the lead with only three holes to play. But he missed an 8-foot par 
putt on the 16th to fall into a tie, and Stewart regained the lead 
with a 5-foot birdie on the par-3 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart hit into the rough on the final hole and had to play  
short of the green. After Mickelson missed a 25-foot birdie putt, 
Stewart had 15 feet left for par -- make it and win the Open, miss 
it and go to an 18-hole playoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	How did Amy handle such a pressure-packed moment?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching my stomach,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart made the putt, becoming the first player in the 105-year  
history of the U.S. Open to win with a final stroke of such length. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was on his way home.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult night,'' he said. ``That tournament meant a  
lot to me. I kept thinking about the last few holes, and I had a 
difficult time relaxing. At that point, I didn't think the baby 
would come until June 30. I didn't get to sleep until 7:30 in the 
morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't sleep long.  
</P>
<P>
	Amy's water broke about 9 a.m., when Mickelson and Stewart would  
have been shaking hands on the first hole had there been a playoff. 
Mickelson had a private plane and a copilot ready to take him home 
if the pager went off. The trip from Pinehurst No. 2 to the 
hospital would take five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't labor for five hours,'' Amy said. ``It's ironic how  
everything worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They rushed to the doctor, then to the hospital. Suddenly,  
Mickelson stopped thinking about the putts that slid by the hole or 
the domed greens by Donald Ross that he had navigated so well until 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling of a bump-and-run from 30 yards away to save par on  
No. 9 was not nearly as exhilarating as cutting the umbilical cord 
of his firstborn. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy cried just at the mention of seeing her husband hold their  
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been great,'' she said. ``We just sat in our hospital  
room for a couple of days and didn't answer the phone, having 
really great family time, just the three of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mickelson house doesn't include the championship cup from  
the U.S. Open, but it does have a baby to finally occupy the room 
Amy has been decorating for the past seven months -- the 
dark-stained wood furniture, the handmade crib and a dozen angels 
painted on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I'm disappointed about the Open, the excitement  
and memory I have of seeing my child born, and taking care of her, 
will far surpass any letdown I felt,'' Mickelson said. ``I've 
thought about the final round a couple of times, but not nearly as 
much as I thought I would.''

<HEADLINE> Film Violence Resolution Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fearing that lawmakers who blame Hollywood  
for recent acts of youth violence will strangle filmmakers' 
freedom, the Directors Guild of America voted Saturday to lobby 
against legislative restrictions and provide legal help to 
directors who become targets of ``government intrusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-member national board of directors unanimously approved a  
resolution that also calls for establishing a task force of leading 
directors to ``explore and research the issue of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force would devise methods to educate guild members,  
the ``creative community'' and the public on violence and the 
``rights and responsibilities of Hollywood,'' the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is both to ensure that the First Amendment rights  
of our members are not trampled upon by overzealous legislators and 
also to raise the consciousness level of the entertainment 
community with regard to the social responsibility of filmmakers,'' 
DGA President Jack Shea said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The guild represents about 11,000 film and television directors  
and assistants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 high school massacre at Littleton, Colo.,  
President Clinton and Congress have taken Hollywood to task, 
suggesting the industry has contributed to a culture of violence 
through bloody images. The Senate authorized an investigation into 
the marketing of violent games and shows to children and a federal 
study into the psychological effects on youths of violent video 
games and music. 
</P>
<P>
	It also passed a requirement that government agencies consider a  
show's violence level before granting a permit to film on federal 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea has said the First Amendment rights of filmmakers are as  
threatened now as during the 1950s era of anti-Communist 
blacklisting. 
</P>
<P>
	The DGA resolution states that ``the issue of the portrayal of  
violence in motion pictures and television should be decided 
between filmmakers and their audience,'' and that guild directors 
who are subpoenaed by government agencies will receive guild 
support and legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers must be protected from ``unwarranted and  
unconstitutional government intrusion,'' the resolution states.

<HEADLINE> Freak Accident Kills 5-Year-Old Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy died during his youth-league  
baseball game Saturday, collapsing after he was struck in the chest 
by a thrown ball, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cook was standing next to an adult pitcher about 4 p.m.  
when he was hit by a baseball that had been thrown back to the 
pitcher's mound by an adult catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy staggered and fell, took a few breaths and then stopped  
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Don Savage said a doctor came out of the stands to join  
others who unsuccessfully tried to revive the child.

<HEADLINE> Dreams Gallore Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dreams Gallore, the prohibitive favorite ridden  
by Robby Albarado, came from off the pace for a decisive 7 1/2-length 
victory in the 43rd running of the $250,000 Mother Goose Stakes for 
3-year-old fillies at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	What came without warning, however, was the tragedy which struck  
just prior to the running of the Mother Goose. Three Ring, 
considered one of the race's formidable entrants, reared up in the 
walking ring and fell, striking her head heavily. She was severely 
injured and was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact fractured her skull. It was not something that she  
could survive'' attending veterinarian Dr. Anthony Verderosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, winner of the Acorn Stakes at Belmont on June 4, was  
the only Mother Goose entrant still eligible for a sweep of the 
NYRA's Triple Tiara series. The daughter of Notebook won six of 10 
careers starts with two seconds and a third and earnings of 
$773,440. In addition to the Acorn, she won Gulfstream Park's 
Bonnie Miss and Davona Dale stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Gallore swept to the lead after entering the stretch and  
won with ease over Oh What a Windfall, who 1 3/4 lengths ahead of 
Better Than Honour. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second added-money victory this year for Dreams  
Gallore, who was second behind Silverbulletday in her prior two 
starts, the Black Eyed Susan at Pimlico and the Kentucky Oaks at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Gallore covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 3-5 to earn $150,000 for  
Gary A. Tanaka. It was the second victory in seven starts this year 
for the daughter of Silver Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coaching Club American Oaks (July 24 at Belmont) would  
probably be next for her,'' trainer Steve Asmussen said. ``We'll 
probably bring her back to Churchill Downs and have her train there 
because she's flourished in that environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Gallore returned $3.30, $2.50 and $2.10. Oh What a  
Windfall paid $6.90 and $2.10 and Better Than Honour was worth 
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearts At Risk sprang an upset in the co-featured Mike Lee  
Stakes for 3-year-olds. The son of Septieme Ciel came from far back 
to edge favored David by three-quarters of a length, with Brocco's 
Magick a half-length further back in third in the field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearts At Risk, ridden by Robbie Davis, earned $51,390 from a  
purse of $85,650 after going seven furlongs in 1:23 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearts At Risk, who has won three of six starts this year,  
returned $128, $24 and $10.20. David paid $2.70 and $2.40 and 
Brocco's Magick was worth $3.90. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second big payoff on Saturday's card. Valid Victor  
won the first race and paid $128.50.

<HEADLINE> High-School Star Heads for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PICAYUNE, Miss. (AP) -- Jonathan Bender is as gangly as a colt --  
a scant 200 pounds stretched out for 6-feet, 11-inches across 
matchstick legs and long, thin arms. His 18-year-old face still 
reflects small-town boyhood, soft, open, trusting. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's got that Southern habit of adding ``ma'am'' and ``sir''  
to his yes's and no's and the quiet confidence of being the big man 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, fresh out of Picayune High School in Mississippi, is  
expected to be an NBA first-round draft pick on Wednesday, leading 
to millions and millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous about it, but I'm not scared,'' Bender said. ``I  
know it will be hard, but I plan to just listen a lot. As good as 
you can listen to someone, that's what I'm going to do to 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and six blocked shots per  
game as a senior center at Picayune. But it was his performance in 
the March 25 McDonald's All-American Game that really caught the 
attention of scouts. Bender scored 31 points, breaking the record 
Michael Jordan set. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bender is a lottery selection as projected, and taken among  
the top 13 picks in the draft, he could make about $9 million for 
his first three seasons. If he goes between the 15th and 25th pick, 
he would make from $1 million to $850,000 a year, plus bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a concern when anyone gets a lot of money like  
that,'' said Thaddeus Fouchier, Bender's adviser and summer-league 
coach. ``It's a concern if you win the lottery, but we've got a lot 
of good advisers around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender enters the draft at a time when more and more players are  
jumping from high school straight to the NBA. Kevin Garnett, 
drafted out of high school in 1995, ended up with a record $126 
million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and he  
now stars with the Los Angeles Lakers, labeled a possible successor 
to Michael Jordan as the league's most exciting player. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the future is bright for Bender, although he's got a lot of  
work to do -- starting with that skinny body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of time before his body catches up with his  
talent,'' said Mississippi State coach Rick Stansbury, the coach 
who thought Bender would be playing for him before he decided to 
head to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed, of course, but I'm not resentful. Jonathan  
is so nice. He's a remarkable young man with a lot of promise and I 
look forward to seeing him realize it. But as good as he is as a 
player, he's better as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender is not expected to be an instant star in the NBA, where  
he'll be playing against men from five to 20 years older, 
established players who have more muscle, mass and savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	He's projected as a forward, although he's not yet strong enough  
to be a power forward, and he's an accurate shooter with good 
range, especially for a big man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's ready for the contact and the physical  
aspect of the league at this point,'' said Dick Van Arsdale, vice 
president of player personnel for the Phoenix Suns. ``He hasn't 
developed the strength he needs yet. But he has all that natural 
ability and shoots so well. If a team has the time and money to 
make an investment for the future -- Jonathan is it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That investment looks better under the terms of the new NBA  
contract that gives teams an optional fourth year on first-round 
draft picks rather than the old deal of three years. Teams also 
have the right of first refusal in the fifth year, when Bender 
would be 23, young and no doubt wider and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him say his work ethic should help him as he  
strives to succeed as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has amazing dedication for someone so young,'' said Mackie  
Shillstone, clinical director for the LSU Center for Sports 
Performance and Wellness, where Bender began working out as a high 
school junior. ``He is very, very hard working, very dedicated and 
very respectful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And despite Bender's size, Shillstone said the NBA veterans who  
worked with the teen-ager couldn't contain him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jonathan's balance and running ability was such that they  
couldn't get to him,'' Shillstone said. ``I think he's going to 
find that same thing when he's in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender gets much of his drive from his mother.  
</P>
<P>
	His father died when he was 13, so Willie Mae Bender raised four  
children, including a stepson, alone. She also worked at WalMart at 
night and attended college during the day, getting a bachelor's 
degree at age 44 as a community health educator. 
</P>
<P>
	``College was right for me,'' she said. ``That was my choice.  
But I raised my children to know that they had choices and should 
make the right ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his high school team, Bender was the biggest player and by  
far the best. He acknowledges that he carried the team and realizes 
that will soon change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to not being the big star. I'm looking  
forward to what I can learn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bender interests many NBA teams because of his natural  
talent and positive attitude, his youth and need to develop make 
just as many wish he had decided to play at Mississippi State 
before moving to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has tremendous potential. He's a very talented young man,''  
Van Arsdale said. ``But he would have benefited tremendously from 
college, both as a person and a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Bender is thinking about, however, is improving his body and  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to test me,'' he said. ``But I'm ready for  
it.''

<HEADLINE> No Fake Injuries at Wrestling Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) -- In a nondescript warehouse on the edge of  
the San Francisco Bay, the future of pro wrestling is getting 
body-slammed, clotheslined and pile drivered -- or is that pile 
driven? 
</P>
<P>
	From buffed-out bodybuilders to skinny kids with a dream, the  
young wrestlers cavort in a ring, practicing moves designed to wow 
spectators and minimize actual pain. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the All Pro Wrestling Boot Camp, where wannabe ``Stone  
Cold'' Steve Austins and ``Hollywood'' Hulk Hogans are learning the 
finer points of the, er, sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of my friends say it's fake, but it still hurts,'' said  
22-year-old student James Choi. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year program, which costs $6,000, weeds out the avid  
Monday night wrestling viewers who think, ``I can do that.'' Only a 
lucky few make it to the final bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of people who walk through the door, and they  
think they'll pay a fee and there's a table that says `gimmicks' 
and then there's another that says `nicknames.' They think that's 
all there is to it,'' Boot Camp founder Roland Alexander said. 
``The people I look for are the ones who love pro wrestling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boot Camp, and about two dozen similar schools around the  
country, are the minor leagues of pro wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduates perform in regional shows, developing their characters  
while vying for a tryout with one of the major leagues: the World 
Wrestling Federation or World Championship Wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Two graduates have made it that far, ``Vicious'' Vic Grimes and  
Erin ``The Leprechaun'' O'Grady. Both currently train in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no shortcuts to anything in life,'' Alexander said.  
``If you want to be a doctor, it takes time and study and years in 
school.'' He called wrestling ``a complex art form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander left a $50,000-a-year job as an accountant and started  
his school in 1991. But those were tough times for pro wrestling. 
There was talk about steroid abuse, and some promoters admitted 
that matches were ``predetermined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strangely, once everyone 'fessed up that the fights were fixed,  
it turned out the audience didn't care. They wanted to see the 
spectacle, anyway.

<HEADLINE> Century's Growth Leaves Earth Noisy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lester Brown, global watchdog, can cite enough looming  
catastrophes to spoil anyone's day: Water tables are falling, 
temperatures are rising, rain forests are shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Hempton, professional ``sound tracker,'' faces a simpler  
problem: It's getting awfully hard these days to find 15 minutes of 
peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Each man, in his own way, is talking about the same thing. A lot  
more people live on the planet than ever before, and by and large 
we're a hungry, needy, noisy bunch. Of all the changes the 20th 
century has seen, none is more far-reaching than the explosion of 
human population -- the one trend to which everybody contributes. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred years ago, 1.6 billion people lived on Earth. This  
year, world population will reach 6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	How to keep all those people alive without ravaging the planet  
is a question Brown addresses daily as president of the Worldwatch 
Institute, an environmental research group based in Washington, 
D.C. Yet even he remains awed by humanity's talent for 
multiplication. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been more population growth since 1950 than during  
the preceding 4 million years,'' Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brown's path to comprehension is paved with Big-Picture  
charts and graphs, Gordon Hempton has a more personal way of 
measuring how crowded the world has become. 
</P>
<P>
	He listens.  
</P>
<P>
	From his home in Port Angeles, Wash., Hempton treks to remote  
corners of the world with an expensive tape recorder in hand, 
seeking to capture nature's quiet symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, few places remain where human noise doesn't intrude.  
In rural glades of the southeastern United States, Hempton has 
tried in vain to escape the low drone of ``monster flutes'' -- the 
smokestacks of coal-fired electric plants dotting the landscape. In 
Wyoming, his quest for quiet has been interrupted by the rhythmic 
booming of oil-well pumps. Even in the Southwest's lonely deserts, 
he finds no peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you listen in the middle of the night, the desert landscape  
is actually rumbling,'' he says. ``A tremendous amount of sound is 
being pumped out from distant cities, highways, power transmission 
lines, industry and mining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years ago, Hempton documented 21 spots in Washington  
state where he could reliably capture 15 minutes of natural sounds 
uninterrupted by the likes of roaring jets, humming trucks and 
barking dogs. Now he finds only three. 
</P>
<P>
	He mourns the loss. When we can't escape noise, our senses start  
shutting down and life is not as sweet, Hempton believes. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, in his own quiet way, he reaches the crux of the  
population question: It's not whether 6 billion or 16 billion 
people can be crammed onto the planet. It's the quality of life 
those people enjoy, whatever their number. 
</P>
<P>
	Hempton craves solitude. Others want gasoline for their cars and  
electricity for their computers. Millions would settle for a daily 
loaf of bread or bowl of rice. Can the globe support us all in the 
manner to which we are accustomed? 
</P>
<P>
	Some perspective from the charts and graphs:  
</P>
<P>
	--Population growth accelerated during most of this century. It  
took all of human history to reach a world population of 1 billion 
in 1804. It took 123 years to reach 2 billion in 1927, 33 years to 
reach 3 billion in 1960, 14 years to reach 4 billion in 1974, and 
13 years to reach 5 billion in 1987. Adding the sixth billion, a 
milestone that United Nations demographers calculate will occur in 
early October, will have taken just 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The growth rate has started to slow, but world population still  
rises by 78 million each year, the U.N. Population Division says. 
That's like adding 1.5 million people, or a city the size of 
Philadelphia, every week. 
</P>
<P>
	--All those people consume a lot of resources. In 1900, only a  
few thousand barrels of oil were used each day worldwide. Today, 
humanity uses 72 million barrels a day, Worldwatch says. Use of 
metals has risen from 20 million tons a year to 1.2 billion tons, 
the group says. 
</P>
<P>
	--On average, people have never been healthier or wealthier, but  
the gap between rich and poor remains wide. Half of all American 
adults are overweight, yet elsewhere more than 13,000 young 
children die every day of malnutrition and related illnesses, the 
World Health Organization says. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown sees ozone depletion, global warming, overfishing and  
falling water tables as bills coming due from growth the Earth 
cannot sustain. He believes Americans and others living high on the 
hog should scale back their consumption to leave enough food and 
resources for others. 
</P>
<P>
	World grain production hovers just under 2 billion tons a year,  
Brown notes. How many mouths that can feed depends on how much is 
eaten directly vs. being fed to livestock, an equation that varies 
widely by nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 2 billion tons of grain, you can feed 10 billion  
Indians,'' Brown says. ``Or you can feed 5 billion Italians. Or you 
can feed 2.5 billion Americans. If we're all eating like Americans, 
we need another planet, basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some don't consider the century's near-quadrupling of population  
a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should celebrate it,'' says Jerry Taylor, director of  
natural resource studies for the Cato Institute, a conservative 
think tank in Washington. ``It's a product of improving human 
health, improving lifestyles and better nutrition. People are 
living longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While others worry that too large a population will exhaust  
natural resources, Taylor says human ingenuity is the true resource 
-- and that will only increase with more people around. 
</P>
<P>
	``People aren't just mouths to feed. They're creators of art and  
generators of technology,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	People can also be surprisingly adaptable. Last October, U.N.  
demographers reduced their population-growth estimates by about 2 
million a year, saying they hadn't anticipated how quickly women 
around the world would embrace the notion of having fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, the average woman gave birth five times during her  
lifetime. Today that global fertility rate is 2.7 births per woman 
and falling, the United Nations says. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty years from now, there will be 8.9 billion people on Earth,  
according to the United Nations' midlevel, ``most likely'' 
projection. Virtually all the gain will occur in the poorer 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Will resources be available, or life enjoyable, for that  
population, 50 percent greater than today's? 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Hempton answers with a story. He was in the Everglades  
one day, working against the odds to make an uninterrupted 
recording of an Eastern meadowlark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty seconds into the recording,'' he recalls, ``sure  
enough, the roar of a jet came in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hempton let the tape roll, and now the recording is one of his  
favorites. The sweet song of the lark and coarse thunder of 
technology speak to him of nature's grace and humanity's striving -- 
a duet affirming that even in a cramped and noisy world, there is 
music in the air.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Big Men Unite To Win Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The season that almost wasn't turned out to  
be the year everything finally came together for the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan demonstrated his dominance. David Robinson showed  
he's championship material. Proven veterans and unknown journeymen 
learned their roles and played them well. 
</P>
<P>
	The triumphant outcome for San Antonio was an NBA title captured  
Friday night at the expense of the underdog New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, the 5-foot-11 ``Little General'' who'd been cut  
by the Spurs twice in his career, proved to be a big hero in 
decisive Game 5 at Madison Square Garden. He hit a corner jumper 
with 47 seconds left to give San Antonio its 78-77 winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Spurs arrived back in Texas on Saturday, Johnson stepped  
off the charter plane first, hoisting the team's championship 
trophy above his head and smiling at thousands of cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is beating a thousand times a minute,'' Johnson said.  
``We love y'all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs had remained mostly straight-faced through their  
nearly two-month playoff run but celebrated wildly Friday night 
after silencing critics who'd maligned them for years as being 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for David Robinson. He's been taking a lot of flak  
throughout his career,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``I told Dave, `You 
shut everybody up, Dave. You ain't got nothing more to prove to 
anybody else.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson described the Spurs as ``a tough -- you heard me  
everybody -- tough basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio secured the first NBA championship for the franchise  
and the first NBA title for a former American Basketball 
Association team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio in 1973 as the former Dallas  
Chaparrals of the ABA and merged into the NBA in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Robinson and Sean Elliott comprised the core of the  
Spurs much of the 1990s. Duncan joined the squad in the 1997-98 
season as the No. 1 draft pick from Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Duncan became the team's key offensive weapon as  
Robinson, the top draft pick a decade earlier, shifted his emphasis 
to defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan lost out to Utah's Karl Malone as the season's Most  
Valuable Player, but the 7-foot Spurs star was named MVP of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible,'' Duncan said. ``It feels so good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach and general manager Gregg Popovich acquired veterans  
Elie, Jerome Kersey and Steve Kerr before this season to provide 
playoff grit. They didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, this season looked like it might not happen  
because of the league's prolonged lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't begin until February, and the 50-game schedule was  
compressed into three months. That meant quick turnarounds between 
games and little time for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio got off to a poor start, going 6-8 in February and  
stirring speculation that Popovich would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets on March 2,  
initiating a nine-game winning streak and a 31-5 stretch run that 
gave San Antonio a 37-13 record for the regular season and the top 
seed in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the postseason, the Spurs lost only one game in the first  
round to Minnesota then swept the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland 
Trail Blazers en route to the team's first trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Before losing Game 3 to the Knicks in the finals, San Antonio  
mounted a 12-game playoff winning streak, the longest in one 
postseason in the NBA's 52-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the championship and posting a 15-2 mark in the playoffs  
satisfied Robinson after years of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in anybody's mind who the best team is.  
That's what makes me feel the best about this team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs defeated the Knicks 4-1 in the best-of-7 series,  
overcoming some tremendous shooting by Allan Houston and Latrell 
Sprewell and taking advantage of the fact that New York was 
undermanned because of injuries to Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and 
Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	As it did all season, San Antonio stressed defense in the  
series, especially in the final minutes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we talked about in every huddle for the last 10  
minutes, was that our defense was going to win this game for us,'' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season Robinson embarks on his 11th year in the league.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing what it's like to be a winner, he wouldn't mind another  
taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we continue to work at it,'' he said, ``we should get  
better and better and better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- After 18 years as a CART event, next year's  
Cleveland race could be sanctioned by the rival Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources on both sides of the negotiations between race promoter  
International Management Group and CART have indicated Sunday's 
Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland will likely be the last 
sanctioned by CART. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Stanner, president of IMG, which has promoted the race since  
1992, declined to discuss details of the talks, as did CART boss 
Andrew Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is best for Cleveland is a profitable race,'' Stanner  
said. ``That is what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART, which increased sanctioning fees for all of its events  
this season, has upped the Cleveland payment from just over $1.4 
million to $2 million for 2000. An IRL event reportedly would cost 
IMG about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanner said his company is still talking with CART and the IRL,  
as well as with NASCAR about a possible truck event and the SCCA 
about its Trans-Am series. But he went on to say, ``We'll have 
things cleared up in a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race is currently run on a 2.106-mile, 10-turn temporary  
road circuit built on the runways and taxiways at Burke Lakefront 
Airport. If it becomes a venue for the all-oval IRL, IMG would 
erect a modified oval on the same site by connecting parallel 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
	CART currently has a 20-race schedule, including short and  
superspeedway ovals, as well as temporary and permanent road 
courses. Several tracks, including Road Atlanta, a permanent road 
circuit, and Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a 1 1/2-mile oval, are seeking 
CART races. 
</P>
<P>
	The current IRL schedule is 11 races run on nine tracks.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PENALTY PHASE:* Thanks to a slick, bumpy track, CART's rule  
penalizing drivers who cause red flag stoppages during qualifying 
came into play considerably more often than usual this week in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule states that any driver bringing out the red flag must  
park his car for eight minutes in that session. If the red flag 
comes out in the final 10 minutes of any session, the penalty is 
served at the end of the next session, whether the next day or at 
the next road race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, penalties were assessed against Max Papis, Dario  
Franchitti, Michael Andretti and Richie Hearn. During Saturday's 
qualifying, rookie Luis Garcia, Papis, Hearn and Gualter Salles 
were penalized for bringing out red flags for a variety of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Friday incidents involving Andretti and Franchitti  
came in the final 10 minutes, both were held out of the last eight 
minutes of Saturday's qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether it's right or wrong, but if you mess up  
the last 10 minutes of qualifying, you have to have some penalty,'' 
Andretti said. ``I just made a mistake and I paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties for Hearn's Saturday incident and Salles' fiery  
blown engine will be served in the first round of qualifying in two 
weeks at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG CHANGE:* CART drivers generally enjoy racing on Cleveland's  
flat, bumpy road circuit, but it is a big change from the race a 
week earlier at the natural-terrain Portland International Raceway 
road course in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Portland, it's nice and cool, the track is all green,''  
said Helio Castro-Neves, who started second in Portland. ``You come 
here and it's flat and hot. But it's changes like that which make 
this sport so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This track is much more demanding physically, due mostly to  
the bumpiness of the circuit. Mentally, it's different as well, 
because there's not much in the way of reference points between the 
corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That puts a premium on staying physically fresh and alert.  
</P>
<P>
	``I worked out more than usual in between the races to make sure  
I was good and ready for this weekend,'' Castros-Neves said.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO and Russian troops prepared  
today for the first arrival of flights at the Pristina airport 
since peacekeepers began deploying in Kosovo two weeks ago. Two 
planes were expected about noon: a Russian transport carrying an 
advance team of paratroopers and technicians and a NATO plane with 
air traffic control equipment. About 200 Russian troops seized the 
airport June 12, beating NATO into the province by hours and

	BEIJING (AP) -- China's legislature ruled today that a Hong Kong  
court violated the territory's constitution by not consulting 
Chinese lawmakers before deciding a case concerning China's state 
affairs. The dispute underscored tensions between authoritarian 
China and freewheeling Hong Kong. Opponents feared the case -- 
ostensibly about immigratio -- would undermine the autonomy and 
judicial independence Beijing promised the territory after 
regaining control from Britain nearly two years ago. Hundreds of 
people, many mainland Chinese without residency permits, gathered 
outside government offices in protest.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is proposing  
to create a division devoted solely to hunting spies, part of a 
government-wide review of counterintelligence, The New York Times 
reported today. The move comes amid suspicions that China stole 
nuclear secrets for two decades. American intelligence agencies 
have increasingly focused on threats of terrorism, causing 
counterintelligence efforts to dwindle, the newspaper said, citing 
unidentified government officials.

	Spurs Capture First NBA Title

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs captured their first  
National Basketball Association championship last night with a 
78-77 victory over the New York Knicks, who missed a final shot at 
the buzzer. Avery Johnson made a shot from the corner to put the 
Spurs ahead by one point with 47 seconds left in Game 5 in the 
best-of-seven series. But the title wasn't assured until the Knicks 
failed to score on the game's final play, an inbounds pass from 
Charlie Ward that found Latrell Sprewell too far under the basket. 
His awkward shot missed, and the Spurs stormed the court to 
celebrate.

skirmish that broke up the talks four days ago. Although it was

province, the military and the official Antara news agency said 
today. Violence has heightened in recent weeks in Aceh, a province

outdueling Randy Johnson in the Cardinals' 1-0 victory over the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. Jimenez also became the first rookie to pitch 
a no-hitter since Wilson Alvarez of the Chicago White Sox on Aug. 
11, 1991. Jimenez (4-7) struck out seven, walked two and hit a 
batter. No Arizona runner got beyond second base.

<HEADLINE> Sweden 2, Ghana 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sweden earned its way to the quarterfinals of the  
women's World Cup. Next is its biggest challenge -- defending 
champion and neighboring rival Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to get to the quarterfinals. Now we've done that  
and I think we'll meet Norway. This time we're going to win that 
game,'' Victoria Svensson said Saturday after her two second-half 
goals led a 2-0 victory over scrappy and physical Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has won the last seven meetings with Sweden, including a  
semifinal win in the 1991 World Cup. The teams will meet again 
Wednesday in San Jose, Calif. Norway ran its record in this year's 
tournament to 3-0 by routing Japan 4-0 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been several years and now we're closer than we've ever  
been. We played them in the Algarve Cup and it was closer than it's 
ever been,'' Sweden coach Marika Domanski Lyfors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Svensson scored on a header in the 58th minute Saturday, taking  
Malin Mostrom's crossing pass from the right corner and beating 
goalkeeper Memunatu Sulemana to put Sweden ahead 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The score came with Ghana one player down as defender Patience  
Sackey nursed an injury on the far sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought, `It's going to go over the goal.' Then I  
saw it and I was really happy because I missed a lot of chances in 
the first half,'' Svensson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana, in its first World Cup, just missed tying the game in the  
86th minute. As Swedish goalie Ulrika Karlsson tried to clear after 
a pass back from teammate Asa Lonnqvist, a sliding Elizabeth Baidu 
of Ghana blocked her kick and the ball deflected off the cross bar. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Black Queens stunned by their near-miss, Svensson raced  
to the other end, took a pass from Malin Gustafsson and scored 
again seconds later to make it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed. We didn't deserve to lose,'' Ghana  
coach E.K. Afranie said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also disagreed with the labeling of his team as overly  
``physical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer is a contact sport. When you talk about physical play,  
people make up their minds before we step on the field,'' he said. 
``People already think that African teams play physical, so their 
minds are already made up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final minutes were played in a driving rain as a  
thunderstorm socked and soaked a crowd of 34,256 gathered for a 
doubleheader at Soldier Field, the largest for a twin bill so far 
not involving the host U.S. team. On Thursday night, a crowd of 
65,080 watched the United States defeat Nigeria on the same field. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Svensson's first goal, Sweden missed a chance for a  
two-goal lead after Stella Quartey was called for a foul against on 
Svensson in the penalty area and the Swedes were awarded a penalty 
kick. But Sulemana miraculously stopped the penalty shot by Malin 
Andersson as well as a quick rebound attempt seconds later by 
Therese Lundin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, a loser in the World Cup quarters four years ago, is  
2-1-0 in Group D. Ghana is 0-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden midfielder Hanna Ljungberg, who scored two goals in an  
earlier victory over Australia, left in the sixth minute with a 
right knee injury that could keep her out of the rest of the 
tournament. She was scheduled to undergo an MRI and was replaced by 
Lundin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana played without two starters. Defender Regina Ansah had  
been red carded in the previous game against China and defender 
Rita Yeboah had been assessed yellow cards in the Black Queens' 
previous two games.

<HEADLINE>  Outage Delays Mets-Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The opener of a three-game series between the New  
York Mets and Atlanta Braves was delayed 45 minutes Friday night 
when an electrical problem knocked out a section of lights at 
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunction apparently occurred less than two hours before  
the scheduled 7:40 p.m. start, affecting a section of lights that 
hover above the upper deck on the right-field side. 
</P>
<P>
	Power remained on for the rest of the 49,000-seat stadium, where  
a sellout was expected as the Braves, leading the NL East by three 
games over New York, tried to hold off the streaking Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement was made to the crowd about five minutes before  
the scheduled first pitch. There was little reaction as fans sat 
patiently in their seats or milled about the concourse beyond the 
center-field scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't play a game,'' Braves president Stan Kasten  
joked. ``Everything else is working fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 7:45, the lights began to illuminate against the darkening  
sky, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Odalis Perez made the first 
pitch to Ricky Henderson at 8:25. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in nearly six years that a Braves home  
game was delayed for reasons other than inclement weather. On July 
18, 1993, a press box fire at the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium 
held up the start of a game for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 4 this season, a problem with the lights at Kansas  
City's Kauffman Stadium caused a game between the Royals and 
Cincinnati Reds to be postponed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Readies Medicare Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dropped a plan to charge  
well-to-do older people higher Medicare premiums, and White House 
and Cabinet officials are readying a public relations blitz on his 
still-secret Medicare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and top White  
House economic adviser Gene Sperling were being dispatched to TV's 
Sunday morning talk shows in an effort to build anticipation for 
Clinton's Medicare proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of how the president would fulfill promises to shore up  
Medicare in time for the baby boom generation's retirement in the 
next couple of decades, while adding a costly prescription drug 
benefit, are being accorded a Rose Garden debut Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough decisions on how to pay for billions of dollars worth of  
changes to the retiree health care program were completed Friday, a 
White House official said. But only a handful of the president's 
closest advisers knew the details, this official said Saturday, and 
they were ordered to let Clinton make the announcement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that a key  
element would dip into the federal budget surplus for $700 billion 
over the next 15 years, representing about 15 percent of the 
anticipated surplus over that period. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the president also will provide a number of  
administrative changes intended to enable Medicare to purchase 
goods and services cheaper than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the final 18 months of his presidency, Clinton has said  
he hopes to achieve major Medicare and Social Security reform as 
part of his historical legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, he abandoned one plan Friday that could have doomed  
him to failure: A proposal that would have, for the first time in 
Medicare's 34-year history, charged 39 million elderly and disabled 
beneficiaries different amounts for coverage of doctors' office 
visits and other outpatient medical care, depending on income. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, those premiums -- $45.50 a month in 1999 -- are the  
same for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	A top White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said administration officials floating the so-called ``means 
testing'' on Capitol Hill last week ran into too much opposition 
from both Democrats and Republicans to keep it as a viable part of 
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vice President Al Gore's urging, the official said, Clinton  
also scrapped a proposal to charge Medicare patients for home 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, Medicare pays the full cost of such services  
as part-time or intermittent skilled nursing for the treatment of 
homebound patients. A 20-percent coinsurance charge is imposed only 
on medical equipment such as wheelchairs or walkers.

<HEADLINE> 162-Year-Old Dam To Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- A 5-foot-long sturgeon leaps from the  
rippling water and arches into the air just below a dam on the 
Kennebec River, almost as if marking the site where history will 
soon be made. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, water will gush through an opening cut in the  
162-year-old Edwards Dam, which has blocked Atlantic salmon, 
shortnose sturgeon and other sea-run fish from upper stretches of 
the Kennebec since Henry David Thoreau was writing about Walden. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt plans to attend the dam  
breaching, an event long awaited by conservationists and anglers. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire 19-foot-high, 917-foot-wide dam will be dismantled  
and removed by Thanksgiving, creating ``potentially the strongest 
sea-run fishery in the eastern United States,'' says Maine Planning 
Director Evan Richert, whose agency is overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Dams have been taken out in other states, including North  
Carolina, California and Oregon, but Edwards, which produced a 
small amount of electricity, was the first ordered removed against 
an owner's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered  
Edwards Manufacturing Co., owners of the dam, not only to tear it 
down but also to pay for the removal and restoration, reasoning 
that Edwards had profited from a public waterway for generations. 
Edwards challenged the order and threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May 1998, Edwards agreed to give the dam and adjacent  
riverside acreage to the state, which accepted responsibility for 
the removal and cleanup as long as it was privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bath Iron Works, a U.S. Navy contractor 25 miles downriver, is  
contributing $2.5 million in a sort of environmental tradeoff to 
help balance the impact of its expansion onto nine acres of 
wetlands. And owners of several dams upstream agreed to pay $4.75 
million in exchange for delays in the required installation of fish 
passages along the Kennebec and some of its tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Removal of the Edwards dam is expected to cost about $5 million.  
Any money left over from the Bath and dams' contributions will be 
combined with public funds to restore several migratory fish 
species to the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Brooke, leader of a coalition that worked for the dam's  
removal, points to spots where increasing numbers of sturgeon, 
salmon and other species have been seen in recent weeks, almost as 
if they know the dam is coming down. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all been waiting,'' Brooke says. ``These rivers are so  
productive, if we give them a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sportfishing and conservation groups, including the Atlantic  
Salmon Federation, Trout Unlimited and American Rivers, have been 
pushing for dam removal since then-Gov. John McKernan first 
proposed it a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plan picked up momentum, support appeared from far-flung  
quarters. In 1992, actor Richard Dysart, who starred in the TV show 
``L.A. Law,'' returned to his hometown and clambered into a fishing 
boat to make a sentimental pitch to tear down a dam muscled into 
place by Irish and French-Canadian immigrants in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
	In that era before heavy machinery, workers with hand tools  
bolted together huge timber cribs, filled them with rock ballast 
and covered them with pine planks, stone and later concrete. For 
generations, the dam powered a riverside cotton mill; its 
electricity was later sold to a regional power company. 
</P>
<P>
	The structure has been modified and patched many times,  
especially after floods that breached it as recently as 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The last few weeks have been spent preparing the site for the  
dam's removal. Truck loads of dirt and gravel have been dumped into 
the Kennebec to make a temporary coffer dam just behind the 60-foot 
section that will be breached. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after 9 a.m. Thursday, the coffer dam will be  
broken. If all goes as expected, a surge of upstream water will 
sweep away the coffer dam and gush through the gap in Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will take seconds rather than minutes,'' says Terry  
Peacock of E-PRO, an engineering firm hired for the project. ``They 
go pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock says he expects the water level above the dam to drop 8  
feet within a day of the dam's removal then gradually ebb further 
as the river settles into a new, natural flow. Some people are not 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
	They complain the state is pulling the plug on an ecosystem that  
has developed over the last century and a half and is worth 
preserving in its own right. They predict an ugly expanse of slimy 
mud and rotted old timbers left over from the days of floating log 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Brown is the town manager in Vassalboro, just north of  
Augusta. His family owns an island that will become a peninsula for 
much of the year once the river level drops. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown suggests the decision to remove the dam was made more for  
politics than biology and that predictions sea-run fish will return 
to the river's upper reaches are dubious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a tremendous amount of guesswork involved,''  
Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that nine other dams block the river upstream of Edwards,  
Brown also scoffs at claims the Kennebec will return to its 
natural-free-flowing state once Edwards is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to do it with a straight face, take all the dams  
down,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Wrestling's Ultimate Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the bizarre world of professional wrestling,  
where the plot twists are increasingly twisted and no outrage is 
too outrageous, this grudge match is the real deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In this corner: World Championship Wrestling and Ted Turner --  
the billionaire philanthropist, America's Cup winner, Mr. Jane 
Fonda. His opponents: the World Wrestling Federation and Vince 
McMahon -- the third-generation promoter, P.T. Barnum acolyte, Mr. 
Take-No-Prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The mismatched gladiators are locked in a winner-take-all,  
no-holds-barred, steel-cage match for wrestling's real prize: a 
reported $1 billion in annual revenues, dominance of the 
pay-per-view market, control of cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an animosity. That's real,'' says longtime wrestling  
aficionado Bert Sugar, who pauses a few seconds before finishing 
his thought. ``You know, that might be the only thing that's 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real, and real ugly. Nobody pulls any punches in this unscripted  
match, a change from wrestling's usual choreographed challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's McMahon on Turner: ``I don't like Ted, and he doesn't  
like me. So we start from there. ... His vitriol is not to be 
believed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's WCW president Eric Bischoff on McMahon: ``Vince likes to  
put himself in some type of competition with Ted Turner. It makes 
him look better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics blame the brawl between the leagues for the May 23 death  
of WWF wrestler Owen Hart. The incessant battle to be the biggest, 
boldest and baddest led to Hart's fatal 70-foot plunge as he was 
lowered into the ring, say the critics, who include Hart's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My poor brother Owen was a sacrifice for the ratings,'' his  
sister Ellie said one day after his death. ``We figured sooner or 
later somebody was going to end up with a tragedy because of the 
direction wrestling was taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bischoff uncharacteristically defends the competition on that  
charge: ``It's unfair to point to the success of the wrestling 
industry and the competition ... as the reason the accident 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no competition until 1988, when Turner first entered  
the ring. The Atlanta businessman called McMahon to deliver the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon says he offered a quick response: ``Ted, I want nothing  
to do with you,'' and hung up on him. 
</P>
<P>
	A feud was born.  
</P>
<P>
	McMahon has recently drawn tremendous attention (and ratings)  
with his envelope-pushing story lines: a wrestling pimp with a 
stable of hookers; a beer-swilling, bird-flipping champion; 
fistfights with his son Shane. 
</P>
<P>
	His WWF, McMahon says unapologetically, gives the people what  
they want: a hybrid soap opera, talk show, rock concert, cartoon 
that he labels ``sports entertainment.'' Turner provides, McMahon 
says disdainfully, an antiquated product: ``rasslin'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not true, replies Bischoff. His group takes wrestling's high  
road, eschewing McMahon's preoccupation with sex and vulgarity for 
more traditional scenarios (although a recent WCW episode included 
wrestler Ric Flair checking into a mental institution). 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated Bischoff also accuses McMahon of swiping a recent  
WCW narrative that pitted the league's bosses against its 
wrestlers: ``It is absolutely a direct rip-off. Anybody that 
doesn't see that is either blind or on Vince's payroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each Monday night, people can see for themselves. An estimated  
10 million viewers tune in for the leagues' signature shows, the 
WCW's ``Monday Nitro'' and the WWF's ``RAW Is WAR.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nitro'' was top dog for 83 weeks between late 1996 and early  
1998, capturing the higher Nielsen numbers as McMahon languished. 
It wasn't until April 1998 that the reinvented WWF, with its new, 
nastier plots, drop-kicked Bischoff &AMP; Co. back to No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing they could do to compete was adopt the Howard  
Stern, Jerry Springer approach,'' Bischoff sniffs. ``It's very 
effective, but not very creative. It has everything to do with 
desperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desperation apparently sells. On May 10, the WWF garnered the  
highest rating for a regularly scheduled entertainment show in 
cable history, with more than 6.1 million homes tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bischoff isn't conceding, and the struggle continues. Both  
leagues aired their Monday night shows just 24 hours after Hart's 
death. This match could be a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the WWF airs in 9 languages and 120 countries, and  
Turner's stations beam his WCW worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were simpler when Vince McMahon entered the business in  
the mid 1960s. Pro wrestling was a kinder, gentler place: The good 
guys (baby-faces) battled the bad guys (heels). 
</P>
<P>
	The baby-faces won. Always.  
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling had what's now called a ``niche'' audience: folks who  
watched UHF channels and visited dimly lighted gyms for live shows. 
Its promoters divided the country into regions, each running his 
own fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation, not competition, was the catchword.  
</P>
<P>
	Vince McMahon smashed that concept to bits.  
</P>
<P>
	McMahon followed his grandfather, Jess, and dad, Vince, into the  
northeast's Capital Wrestling. He became a TV announcer for his 
dad's operation; when Vince Sr. retired in 1982, Vince Jr. bought 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Vince, with a mean streak more apropos of his ring  
creations, invaded his competitors' territories to create a 
national organization. He aggravated plenty of people and drew 
plenty of death threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``His was a scorched-earth policy,'' says Sugar, co-author of  
``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Professional Wrestling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Attila the Hun did any less damage.''  
</P>
<P>
	McMahon put more than a dozen regional operations out of  
business as he revamped the old World Wide Wrestling Federation 
into the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
	His Wrestlemania III drew a record 93,173 people to the Pontiac  
Silverdome in 1987. McMahon invited outsiders into the ring: pop 
star Cyndi Lauper, Liberace and baseball manager Billy Martin each 
participated in WWF events. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling insiders attacked McMahon's calculated crossover bid,  
which included the xenophobic hyping of bad guys from Iran and the 
Soviet Union, a swishy wrestler in pink tights, and a 
steroid-pumped superhero named Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``McMahon made wrestling trash,'' snapped Bruno Sammartino,  
heavyweight champion for 14 years under Vince Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	One vintage operation survived McMahon: Jim Crockett's  
Georgia-based National Wrestling Alliance. Before Crockett could 
surrender, he acquired an unlikely tag-team partner: Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The media mogul needed TV programming, so he bought some. The  
NWA, rechristened World Championship Wrestling, became a Turner 
property and joined his TV schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound the bell! Both sides were ready to rumble.  
</P>
<P>
	Turner fired the first shots, swiping WWF superstar Hogan (and  
several other McMahon wrestlers). Hulk became Hollywood, Hollywood 
became a bad guy, and the WCW mounted the first real challenge 
against McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW turned its heels into its heroes, rebels who paused  
briefly before assaulting any and all authority figures. Turner was 
soon ripped as a hypocrite: the philanthropist packaging antisocial 
violence for television. 
</P>
<P>
	``That Ted Turner owns the WCW while pledging $1 billion to the  
United Nations on behalf of world peace is sickening,'' wrote New 
York Post columnist Phil Mushnick. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon had his own problems: a 1994 trial (and acquittal) on  
steroid charges, allegations (but no charges) of sexual abuse 
within the WWF. McMahon notes that Hogan, a Turner employee, was 
one of the key government witnesses in the steroid trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW took advantage and began consistently whipping its  
competition. But then the script changed. McMahon came up off the 
mat and mounted his own comeback starting 18 months ago. The WWF 
story lines and its characters changed -- mutated, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	There were liberal doses of sex, Satanism, violence and  
vulgarity. The WCW, now chasing the leader, positioned itself as 
the baby-face to McMahon's heel. 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW fines wrestlers who mouth obscenities on television. The  
WWF encourages it. 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW's No. 1 star is an ex-NFL player named Bill Goldberg,  
who bills himself only as ``Goldberg.'' He's perhaps the last of 
the great baby-faces. The WWF's top attraction -- beer-swilling, 
gun-toting, head-banging ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin -- is as well 
known for extending his middle finger as for pinning opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	To his critics, McMahon offers the same gesture.  
</P>
<P>
	In a New York Daily News guest column, he dismissed detractors  
as ``out of touch moral crusaders who don't have a clue and egghead 
professors with flimsy studies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last shot was aimed at Indiana University communications  
professor Walter Gantz, who monitored 100 hours of WWF programming 
and saw: 
</P>
<P>
	--1,658 times that wrestlers grabbed or pointed to their crotch.  
</P>
<P>
	--434 uses of an obscene phrase.  
</P>
<P>
	--157 instances of flipping the bird.  
</P>
<P>
	--128 incidents of simulated sexual activity.  
</P>
<P>
	--47 incidents of simulated Satanic activity.  
</P>
<P>
	--42 incidents of simulated drug use.  
</P>
<P>
	Not mentioned by Gantz: the corresponding ratings surge.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The two leagues are warring outside the ring: They offer  
competing Web sites, merchandise, and -- coming soon -- theme 
restaurants. There's a pending lawsuit over wrestlers Kevin 
``Diesel'' Nash and Scott ``Razor Ramon'' Hall, who jumped from the 
WWF to the WCW in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon charged (and Turner denied) that the WCW was using his  
characters' trademarked names and personas. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Monday night where the two sides most prominently go  
head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	At precisely 8 p.m. on Turner's TNT, the WCW's ``Monday Nitro''  
begins. The action on a late May evening is typical: Ernest ``The 
Cat'' Miller is soon bashing his shoe against the head of an 
opponent, a slick '70s throwback dubbed ``Disco Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the greatest, baby!'' Miller proclaims before departing.  
</P>
<P>
	At 8:59 p.m., as ``Nitro'' hits its second of three hours, the  
WWF's two-hour ``RAW Is WAR'' begins with a tribute to Owen Hart. A 
lone bell rings 10 times as McMahon and the WWF's wrestlers stand 
silent in a sold-out St. Louis arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Leverage in the McMahon-Turner bout won't come from a leg lock  
or a pile driver. The word here is ``demographics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WCW boasts an audience that is 51 percent men above the age  
of 18. One in every four viewers has an annual income of $50,000 or 
more. Its pay-per-view events reach an average of 300,000 homes. 
Bischoff brags that its number of licensed products has gone from 
25 to 250; that includes a new cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF offers its own avalanche of statistics.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, its shows posted bigger Nielsen numbers than Jerry  
Springer among males aged 12-34. Its ratings have made USA the 
nation's No. 1 cable network. Its pay-per-view numbers in 1998: 4.6 
million buys, $142 million in sales. It has more than 150 
licensees, everything from neckties to greeting cards to action 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight for advertising is as brutal as anything inside the  
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon insists a WCW official made an angry phone call to the  
long-distance company MCI after an ad with Austin aired during the 
competition's ``Monday Nitro.'' Bischoff says that Western Union 
pulled advertising from ``RAW Is WAR'' over its content. 
</P>
<P>
	Mere posturing? Western Union said it advertises in both  
leagues. MCI could not confirm the McMahon story. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that wrestling's growing audience has wreaked havoc  
on real sports. Monday Night Football and the NCAA basketball 
finals both experienced ratings dips as the wrestling audience 
swelled. Wrestling routinely outdraws the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Does McMahon watch the competition? He hesitates.  
</P>
<P>
	``Very seldom,'' McMahon finally allows. ``Because from what I  
gather, they don't follow through on stories. They don't have the 
passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bischoff? A long pause.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' he finally says. ``I look for the good things they do.  
I try to find the interesting things. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it amazes me that they are successful with that product.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a New York Post gossip column item caught McMahon's  
fancy: A piece identifying a performer in ``Ted Turner's 
family-friendly'' WCW as the star of a porn film. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wrestling-porn connection has to be an embarrassment to  
Turner, who often criticizes the standards of his competitors,'' 
the Post story noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Ted didn't know, but that paragraph: `An  
embarrassment,''' McMahon says gleefully. ``I enjoyed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laugh now, says Bischoff.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that I'm going to enjoy more than having  
dominated Vince and the WWF for two years,'' Bischoff says, ``is 
coming back and beating them again.''

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Girl Found Dead in Prayer Room </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) -- Investigators say a note written in blood  
praying for ``compassion, love and kindness'' was found near the 
body of an 8-year-old girl beaten to death with a belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Tuong was found dead May 15 on the floor of a prayer  
room in her family's home in suburban Phoenix, according to a 
police report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A piece of paper on the altar was inscribed in blood. A Buddhist  
priest told detectives the inscription was the beginning of a 
2,500-year-old mantra usually recited as a chant. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives suspect Christine's parents hit her more than 17  
times, leaving injuries that match belt buckles seized from the 
family's home, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents then instructed their other daughters, ages 7 and 9,  
to lie to authorities about the death, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to charge the parents will be made after  
an outside expert helps the medical examiner's office review 
evidence gathered from the autopsy, said County Attorney Rick 
Romley. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents told police they do not beat their children and rely  
on verbal discipline, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's father, Tung Tuong, and mother, Minh Tuong, are  
Vietnamese refugees who came to the United States in 1980. They 
have refused to comment publicly about their daughter's death.

<HEADLINE> Gays Mark Stonewall Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years ago, police raids on gay bars were  
a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took them for granted the way you took being hated for  
granted,'' says Joan Nestle, a writer and activist who started 
going to Greenwich Village bars as a teen-ager in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the patrons of a bar called the Stonewall Inn fought  
back June 27, 1969 -- attacking police with rocks, bottles and fists 
--that startling act of defiance became an instant watershed event. 
Gay activists consider it akin to the Montgomery bus boycott or the 
lunch-counter sit-ins that galvanized the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, parades and rallies in New York, San Francisco and  
dozens of cities worldwide commemorate the Stonewall riot and mark 
three decades of remarkable change. 
</P>
<P>
	While gay people are not universally accepted -- a Time/CNN poll  
last fall found that 48 percent of Americans believe homosexuality 
is morally wrong -- lesbians and gay men are becoming increasingly 
integrated into American society. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a sea change in not just public opinion but public  
policy as well,'' says Kerry Lobel, executive director of the 
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying group based in 
Washington, D.C. ``We see that in areas like civil rights, hate 
crimes, family issues and sodomy repeal, we have more possibility 
of legislative change than ever before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobel cited Nevada, whose Legislature recently banned job  
discrimination against gays, and New Hampshire, where lawmakers 
repealed a 1987 law that barred gays from adopting children or 
serving as foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can sort of pick the state and measure progress in every  
state on the legislative front,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unimaginable in 1969 was the visibility of gay people today in  
politics, entertainment and everyday news coverage. Think Ellen 
DeGeneres, k.d. lang, Melissa Etheridge, Elton John, Ian McKellan, 
Rupert Everett. Three current members of Congress are openly gay -- 
Democrats Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Tammy Baldwin of 
Wisconsin and Republican Jim Kolbe of Arizona -- as are scores of 
other elected officials around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The love that dare not speak its name now won't shut up,''  
says Tom Ammiano, president of San Francisco's Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, Ammiano was a 27-year-old special education teacher and  
not yet ``out'' as a gay man, although, he says, ``it wasn't hard 
to surmise -- the wrists and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He subsequently became a stand-up comic and a member of the  
Board of Supervisors, where three of 11 members are openly gay. 
President of the board since November, he's considered a likely 
challenger to San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The progress made by lesbians and gay men has been accompanied  
by setbacks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen states still have sodomy laws on their books, five of  
which single out homosexual sodomy. Efforts to include gays in 
federal civil rights and hate-crime laws have stalled. Current law 
prohibits crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent murders of gay men -- Matthew Shepard, a University of  
Wyoming student who was beaten and tied to a fence last October, 
and Billy Jack Gaither, an Alabama textile worker who was beaten 
with an ax handle and set on fire -- raised awareness of the 
persistence of anti-gay violence. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS has decimated a generation of gay men, and nearly 20 years  
into the epidemic there is no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, few could dispute that lesbians and gay men in 1999 enjoy  
rights undreamed of in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Rusterholtz lives in Mission Viejo, Calif., with his  
partner and their two foster sons. They are active in their church, 
where Rusterholtz and his partner celebrated their union with a 
commitment ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that we're just pretty average,'' says  
Rusterholtz, 36, a microbiologist. ``We've gone to pride marches 
and stuff, but it's not our cup of tea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rusterholtz says he ``would like to see federal protection, that  
gays and lesbians would not worry about losing their jobs or losing 
their homes or losing their children.'' But his own experience 
negotiating the foster care system in conservative Orange County 
has been ``nothing but fabulous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Blankenbiller, 21, works in a florist's shop in Provo,  
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to hold my girlfriend's hand when we go  
out to dinner and not worry about someone slashing our tires,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, her family is supportive and her co-workers -- many of  
them members of the socially conservative Mormon church -- treat her 
lesbianism ``like it's pretty normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle, who founded the Lesbian Herstory Archives and is now 59,  
remembers when being a lesbian was anything but normal. 
</P>
<P>
	At one bar she frequented, Nestle and her friends had to line up  
to use the bathroom one at a time ``because we couldn't be 
trusted'' not to misbehave inside together. Toilet paper was doled 
out sheet by sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something in me was moving from knowing I was a freak to  
saying that someday I will refuse this moment of humiliation,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle has been chosen one of two grand marshals for Sunday's  
gay pride parade in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a very special moment,'' she says. ``I see it as the  
largest grassroots demonstration in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Drug Agent Convicted in Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Twelve days of deliberations in the case of a  
former drug agent accused of stealing 650 pounds of cocaine ended 
in a mistrial on the four most serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz declared a mistrial Friday on  
four charges that included burglary and possession of drugs with 
intent to sell after the jury deadlocked. Prosecutors did not 
immediately decide whether they would retry Richard Wayne Parker, 
44, on those charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker was found guilty of just one of the eight charges against  
him: tax evasion. Jurors acquitted him of two drug charges and a 
money laundering charge. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain in custody until July 6, when he is scheduled to  
appear for a hearing, said prosecutors' spokesman Thom Mrozek. 
Sentencing on the tax evasion conviction was not immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	The deliberations included a flare-up in which some jurors had  
to be restrained from fighting one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker was accused of stealing the cocaine from the state Bureau  
of Narcotics Enforcement's Riverside office in 1997. Prosecutors 
said he sold the cocaine through several ``conduits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also said officers who arrested Parker at his San  
Juan Capistrano home found $600,000 in cash in some of the eight 
vehicles he had recently bought. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's attorney, Richard Hamar, argued during the trial that  
drug informants were trying to frame Parker, who was a state agent 
for 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Greene Cruises in 200 Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Maurice Greene didn't need Michael Johnson  
running alongside to turn in a fast time in the USA Outdoor Track 
and Field Championships on Saturday. Marion Jones didn't need a 
reminder to run fast, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Johnson had been scheduled to meet in the 200-meter  
final Sunday, but Johnson withdrew Friday because of an injured 
quadriceps muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Greene, the world record-holder in the 100, as the  
sole star of the men's 200. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't disappoint, producing the fastest time of the six  
preliminary heats, 20.26 seconds, despite easing up with about 40 
meters remaining. He won his semifinal heat in a wind-aided 20.11, 
despite looking around with 15 meters left. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene discounted Johnson's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about Michael Johnson,'' he said. ``If I was  
hurt, I wouldn't have run either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, world record-holder in the 200, denied avoiding a  
confrontation with Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that at some point over the next couple of weeks I'll  
have the opportunity to run against Maurice and Maurice will have 
the opportunity to run against me,'' Johnson said before returning 
home. ``I look forward to running against anybody who wants to run 
against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohsaan Griffin, the 1999 indoor champion, won the other  
semifinal in a wind-aided 19.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, still smarting from Friday night's stunning upset loss in  
the long jump, sped to victory in her semifinal heat in the women's 
200 in a wind-aided 22.31, the faster of the two heats. Before 
slowing with 15 meters remaining, she showed no sign of the knee 
injury she received while long-jumping June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a great time, but it gets me to the final and one  
step closer to my first win of the championships,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's final is Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Twelve finals were held Saturday -- six each for men and women.  
</P>
<P>
	The most scintillating performance was Regina Jacobs' victory in  
the women's 1,500 in a meet-record 4:02.41, the fastest in the 
world this year. Jacobs led all the way in winning her eighth 
national title -- her first was in 1987 -- by about 40 meters. The 
previous meet record was 4:03.37, by Mary Slaney in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Jacobs, a silver medalist in the 1997 world  
championships, will attempt to complete a distance double Sunday, 
defending her 5,000 title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew what my plan was at the beginning of the race, and  
based on that plan, I knew I wouldn't have company,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the women's 1,500, the men's 1,500 was a tense,  
tight duel throughout. At the end, Steve Holman, who in the past 
has had numerous difficulties in big meets, held off 1997 winner 
and two-time NCAA champion Seneca Lassiter -- 3:39.21 to 3:39.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Holman survived a near-fall with 300 meters remaining. At that  
point, Karl Paranya fell in the closely bunched field and Holman, 
the best American 1,500-meter runner of the decade, appeared to get 
spiked and stumble, but recovered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men's champions were defending champion Jerome Young  
in the 400 at 44.24, second-fastest in the world this year; Angelo 
Taylor in the 400 hurdles in 48.49; Kevin Dilworth in the long jump 
with a wind-aided 26 feet, 7 3/4 inches; Anthony Washington in the 
discus at 222-11; and American record-holder Tom Pukstys in the 
javelin at 256-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The other women's champions were Maicel Malone-Wallace in the  
400 in 51.29, her third national title; Sandra Glover in the 400 
hurdles in 55.95; Libbie Hickman in the 10,000 in a meet-record and 
career-best 31:41.33, fastest by an American this year; Stacy 
Dragila in the pole vault with a meet-record 14-7 1/4; and Michelle 
Rohl in the 20-kilometer walk in an American-record 1:33:17. 
</P>
<P>
	After smashing the mark of 14-1 1/4 she set in 1997, Dragila went  
for a world record 15-1 1/2, but missed three times. On her final try, 
she barely brushed the bar on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
	Pukstys' victory, his sixth, tied the meet record shared by  
George Bronder and Bud Held. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Petranoff, the 41-year-old former world record-holder,  
finished second at 246-9 in his first appearance in the national 
championships in 11 years. Petranoff was a 1984 and 1988 Olympian 
and two-time U.S. champion before leaving the United States for 
South Africa. He became eligible to compete again for the United 
States last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great career,'' Petranoff said. ``I can still  
throw. ... I think I'll make the Olympic team next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I'm an inspiration to other throwers to come out and  
give it a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's time in the 400 just missed the fastest in the world  
this year, 44.21 by teammate Antonio Pettigrew. Pettigrew made a 
late surge to finish second, about five meters behind Young, in 
44.59. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 400 hurdles, Taylor came off the final hurdle to  
overtake Joey Woody, who wound up second in 48.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone-Wallace's victory in the women's 400 gave her bookend  
titles for the decade. She won in 1990, and also in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 hurdles, Kim Batten, the world record-holder,  
hit the eighth hurdle and fell. The mishap probably wouldn't have 
made much difference, since Batten, running with a chipped bone in 
her foot, was far out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickman beat a fast field in the 10,000 in shattering the meet  
record of 31:57.29 by Lynn Jennings in 1995. Runner-up Anne Marie 
Lauck (31:43.50) and third-place finisher Deena Drossin (32:00.72) 
registered the second- and third-fastest times by Americans this 
hear.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Facing Seats Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three car owners have filed a lawsuit against  
the nation's top automakers, alleging that seats in several makes 
of cars are defective and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs also accused the automakers -- DaimlerChrysler AG,  
Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and Saturn, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of GM -- of knowing that the seats were unsafe but doing 
nothing to fix them because of cost, according to papers filed 
Thursday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, who are seeking class-action status, say in  
court papers that the defect is a single recliner mechanism in 
about 1 million cars that causes a seat to collapse backward if the 
car is hit in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each seat is defective and unreasonably dangerous because it  
is unstable and susceptible to rearward collapse in the event of a 
rear-end collision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by three New York state residents who own  
cars made with the allegedly defective seats. Their lawyers said 
they have a 1995 Geo Metro seat as an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, Linda Frank of North Merrick, Joshua Horstein of  
Manhattan, and Ross Kass of Syosset, are asking for compensatory 
damages, measured by the cost of fixing the defect, not to exceed 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the suit to the automakers could skyrocket to $5  
billion if each of the 1 million cars allegedly made with the 
defective seats is included in the class action. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said the lawsuit had no basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example of frivolous lawsuit, where a large  
number of vehicle owners form a class when nothing is wrong with 
their vehicles,'' Rhadigan said. ``There's nothing wrong with the 
vehicles and there's nothing wrong with our seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Jim Cain said Ford will fight the lawsuit. He  
said the seats are designed to yield because testing proves it 
protects passengers from serious spinal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The other automakers could not immediately be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in court papers is a March letter from Saturn  
suggesting that its customers come in and get the seat fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Saturn issued a recall of 136,300 cars because their  
seat backs could recline or collapse suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
	The gear teeth on the reclining mechanisms of driver and front  
passenger seats in 1994 and 1995 models were to blame, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said at the time.

<HEADLINE> Singer Gosdin Recovers From Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Award-winning country music singer Vern  
Gosdin is recovering from his second stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old singer, whose hits include ``Chiseled in  
Stone,'' ``Set 'em Up Joe'' and ``I Can Tell by the Way You 
Dance,'' suffered the stroke on Wednesday while driving home. He 
remained hospitalized Friday, but his manager, Lacey Lynne, said 
the singer was ``doing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosdin suffered paralysis on his left side after his first  
stroke in 1995. No further paralysis resulted from the recent 
stroke, and doctors expect Gosdin to return home in up to three 
days, Lynne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All his limbs are in working condition,'' she said. ``He's  
just as ornery as he was before he went in. He's giving everybody a 
hard time.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Again Saves Pitt. Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- They've joked for years in pro sports that  
players made so much money, they would eventually own their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Guess what? At age 33, with no high school education but with  
plenty of hockey sense and business smarts, Mario Lemieux now owns 
the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lock, stock and Zambonis. 
</P>
<P>
	It's finally happened. After years of escalating player salaries  
and ever-growing contentiousness among players and owners, a player 
has crossed over and become an owner. If Lemieux's prediction is 
true, others such as Michael Jordan and John Elway and Wayne 
Gretzky might soon step over, too. 
</P>
<P>
	History has been written. For the first time in major U.S. pro  
sports annals, a recently retired player has taken the money he 
made in sports -- and the money he was owed -- and bought his team. 
</P>
<P>
	What an intriguing story it is, too: French-speaking Canadian  
moves to a foreign country at age 18, learns the language, wins six 
NHL scoring championships and two Stanley Cups, beats cancer, makes 
the Hall of Fame and buys his team at age 33. Whew! 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually, I'm sure you're going to see a lot more players  
become involved,'' said Lemieux, celebrating his Thursday takeover 
of the Penguins by playing this weekend in Jordan's celebrity golf 
tournament. ``The way players' salaries are going, players are 
making a lot more money, I'm sure you're going to see more of them 
buying into franchises.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, what Lemieux most wants to see are ticket buyers, as  
the new Penguins seek to increase their season ticket base from 
8,300 to 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux had to be encouraged Friday when, buoyed by the news  
that one of the most popular athletes in the city's history was 
officially their owner, the Penguins sold more than 200 season 
tickets. Lemieux expects a bigger spike in sales once he personally 
becomes involved in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to bring the ticket prices down, too, quite a  
bit,'' Lemieux said. ``We think it's important to get the fans 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that many have gone away. Despite the uncertainty over the  
team's fate and their October bankruptcy filing, the Penguins 
played to about 86 percent of the Civic Arena's 17,103 capacity 
last season. Lemieux's first priority is to get those other 14 
percent back. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the next goal might be harder to reach: Win a third  
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're close. We think we're about 4-5 players away,'' Lemieux  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins already have the game's best player, Jaromir Jagr,  
who unseated two-time winner Dominik Hasek to become the NHL's most 
valuable player. Coincidentally, Jagr was honored on the same day 
Lemieux was awarded the franchise in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard the news I was so happy, happy for Mario and  
happy for the city,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final piece of Lemieux's plan was fitted into place Friday  
night, when the Public Auditorium Authority and the Penguins 
finalized a Civic Arena lease with SMG, which had threatened to sue 
to remain as the arena landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal cuts the Penguins' rent from $6 million a year to $1.8  
million and also calls for SMG to invest $5 million in Lemieux's 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was strong-armed into place Friday under pressure  
from Mayor Tom Murphy, who is among the most pro-active mayors in 
America when it comes to pro sports. In 1996, he brokered the 
Pirates' sale to Kevin McClatchy and, earlier this year, led the 
successful fight to build new stadiums for the Pirates and 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no more professional sports franchises that we have  
to worry about keeping here,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins also will be allowed to sell naming rights to the  
Civic Arena and keep the estimated $5 million proceeds. The city 
also will forgive Lemieux's group of the $12 million owed for 
recent arena improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The next battle looms over building a new home for the Penguins.  
Lemieux's takeover plan calls, perhaps ambitiously, for a new arena 
by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	A likely site already exists -- where Three Rivers Stadium now  
stands, between the new Pirates and Steelers stadiums -- but the 
money has yet to be raised. However, Gov. Tom Ridge promised that 
if Lemieux succeeded, the state would likely provide partial 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	A new arena in Pittsburgh could be an easier sell to the public  
than the two stadiums, if only because an arena is used year-round 
for hundreds of events -- concerts, conventions, circuses -- other 
than pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who promises to be much more than a figurehead owner,  
also wants to sell the new Penguins to free agents. The prospect of 
playing for an owner young enough to be their linemate, one who not 
only can relate to them but is revered by most, would seem to be 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The last remaining date on Lemieux's takeover calendar: July 16,  
when the purchase is to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario saved hockey in Pittsburgh 15 years ago and now he's  
doing it again,'' Jagr said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Must Turn Over Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Linda Tripp's  
recordings of conversations with Monica Lewinsky must be turned 
over to Maryland prosecutors, clearing a potential roadblock to 
trying Ms. Tripp for breaking state wiretap laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's order that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr must  
turn over the recordings followed a request for the tapes by State 
Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, The (Baltimore) Sun reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp's attorney, Joe Murtha, said he will challenge any  
indictment brought against his client on the grounds that she is 
protected by federal immunity given to her in exchange for the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This in fact would taint their investigation to the point  
where it might be the basis for dismissal of an indictment,'' 
Murtha said, adding he doesn't feel the tapes will add to the 
prosecution's case because they shouldn't be admissible. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr granted Ms. Tripp federal immunity in the investigation of  
the president, but the protection doesn't spare her from state 
prosecution. The maximum penalty is five years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine for each wiretapping offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the judge that signed the order was not  
immediately clear, and Montanarelli refused to discuss the order. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp secretly taped conversations in which Ms. Lewinsky,  
the former White House intern, discussed her affair with President 
Clinton. Ms. Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who detailed the affair 
in evidence he presented to Congress. The president was impeached, 
but escaped removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland state law forbids anyone from intercepting phone  
conversations without the other party's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tripp has admitted in federal grand jury testimony that she  
taped Ms. Lewinsky in 1997 after she was warned that doing so was 
illegal in Maryland. Montanarelli has been seeking those tapes 
since the state's case began last July. 
</P>
<P>
	A Howard County grand jury has yet to indict Ms. Tripp, who  
lives in Columbia. The panel convened earlier this month for the 
first time since February.

<HEADLINE>  Wimbledon Medical Facility Knocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Jim Courier criticized Wimbledon  
Saturday, saying the biggest tennis tournament ``in the world has 
sub-par medical conditions for the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier was angered when Wimbledon officials elected to take him  
to a nearby hospital for intravenous fluids to treat dehydration 
after a 4 1/2-hour, five-set victory over Sjeng Schalken in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was told there were no facilities on site to  
administer an IV, although a spokesman for Wimbledon disputed his 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only tournament, the only country we play in where  
this is the case, from what our trainers tell us,'' Courier said. 
``I'd heard about this before from other players. They've run into 
the same brick wall of conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that a tournament that's the biggest in the world  
has sub-par medical conditions for the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Courier knew immediately after the match that he  
was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just realized when I came off the court that I was in  
trouble,'' he said. ``I know my body well. I know when I'm going to 
start cramping and I knew what I needed to do. So we ended up going 
to a hospital to get an IV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon spokesman Johnny Perkins disputed Courier's account  
and said there were facilities on site for the IV treatment. He 
said Dr. Peter Tudor Miles, who treated Courier at the club after 
the match, said the IV treatment wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier faces No. 6 Tim Henman in Monday's fourth round as the  
Briton tries to become the first home player in 63 years to win 
men's singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Henman will also be out to avenge a dramatic five-set loss to  
Courier in April in the Davis Cup in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court in Birmingham was quick, and the court here is very  
quick as well, and the footing is not as sure here,'' Henman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier will face a hostile crowd against Henman, the darling of  
British tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing in big crowds,'' he said. ``I've rarely played  
in situations where the crowds have been for me in those 
conditions, for whatever reason. So maybe that's why I'm used to 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Financier Has Checkered Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Marty Frankel's friends and family say they  
were as puzzled as anybody when he vanished amid accusations that 
he siphoned billions of dollars from a charity he set up to help 
sick kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say that even before he disappeared after a fire at his  
Connecticut mansion on May 5, the 44-year-old money manager had a 
history of conning people, and a past riddled with contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say that as a young person, Frankel had an insatiable  
appetite for learning and a brilliant mind. But he dropped out of 
high school and then took only a few business classes at the 
University of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a genius at gauging the stock market yet often based  
decisions on the alignment of the stars. He was a socially awkward 
loner who rarely left his house, but according to police had 
several women whom he met through personal ads living in a house 
near his main residence. 
</P>
<P>
	He told friends he would make them rich, only to steal their  
life savings, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a bundle of contradictions,'' said Ted Bitter, who sued  
Frankel after he lost a $65,000 investment in the mid-1980s. ``I 
think Marty didn't know whether he was telling the truth or a 
lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two met when Frankel worked at a brokerage firm where Bitter  
was a customer. They became friends and Bitter stayed with him even 
after Frankel was fired for not executing enough trades. 
</P>
<P>
	After setting up his own firm, Frankel turned to astrology to  
guide his investment decisions, Bitter says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a crutch so he could deal with his trading  
decisions,'' Bitter said. After the money disappeared, Bitter and 
another investor accused Frankel of fraud and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating and  
took Frankel's broker's license in 1992. No charges were filed, and 
the lawsuit was settled. After the controversy, Frankel moved to 
Connecticut and set up shop under an assumed name as a personal 
investor for several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	When he disappeared May 5 after a fire in a filing cabinet at  
his home in Greenwich, Conn., authorities found a handwritten to-do 
list with ``Launder Money'' at the top, according to a May 25 FBI 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, regulators say insurers in Oklahoma, Mississippi,  
Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas are missing at least $218 million. 
A lawsuit filed by some of the companies put the loss at $915 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which Frankel established in the British Virgin 
Islands in August. Investigators suspect the charity was only a 
front for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel apparently persuaded two Roman Catholic priests --  
the Rev. Peter Jacobs and Msgr. Emilio Colagiovanni -- to take part 
in the foundation, and to move funds in and out of a Vatican bank 
account, The New York Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men say Frankel fooled them. Vatican spokesman Joaquin  
Navarro-Valls told the Times that the Vatican had no connection 
whatsoever with Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents are trying to find Frankel, and his family members  
say they are mystified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just as puzzled as anybody else, more so,'' his mother,  
Tillie Frankel, 78, told The Blade, a Toledo, Ohio newspaper. The 
family is no longer talking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Another longtime friend from his hometown, Ed Krauss, said he  
can't believe Frankel what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could understand if it was an accounting error or sloppy  
bookkeeping but not this,'' Krauss told The Blade. ``It just 
doesn't make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Fund Computer System Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Claims that the Interior Department  
mismanaged billions of dollars in Indian funds are ``wildly 
overstated,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said as he unveiled 
a new computer system for tracking the trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $60 million project, introduced in the Bureau of Indian  
Affairs office here, is meant to address decades of mismanagement 
of the accounts containing money from leases and royalties on 
Indian land and from court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The inauguration of the Trust Asset and Accounting Management  
System comes as the government is defending itself in a 
class-action lawsuit filed by some account holders claiming the 
mishandling of the accounts has resulted in underpayments to 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said estimates of the money the government may owe  
Indians are less important than the Interior Department meeting its 
trust commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's $10 million or $100 million,'' he said.  
``The dollar figures are manageable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BIA handles 300,000 individual Indians' accounts worth $500  
million and another 1,600 tribal accounts worth $2.5 billion. But 
the accounts have been plagued by inadequate bookkeeping and 
information systems, and records have been lost or ruined over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computer system, condemned by the General Accounting  
Office as haphazard and possibly unworkable, is supposed to give 
Indians and tribes better access to their records and to link land 
ownership files with financial records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event is going to turn out to be one of the important  
moments in the history of government-tribal relations,'' Babbitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the poor condition of some account records will  
mean the new computer system will not be totally accurate: ``There 
is no such thing as 100 percent certainty; there is 99 percent 
certainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The computer system will be tested in Montana and Wyoming for  
two months before it is introduced in other parts of the country. 
The project is expected to be complete by 2001.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The party headed by a former military  
leader chose a former presidential candidate on Saturday to make a 
second run in the Nov. 7 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, a 47-year-old attorney, was chosen at  
a Guatemalan Republican Front assembly presided over by retired 
Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who took power in a March 1982 coup and was 
overthrown in another coup in August 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The Front is the first party to choose a candidate for the  
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios Montt's efforts to win election as president have been  
blocked by a constitutional clause against former coup leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo vowed to review the privatization of state companies  
and ``prosecute those responsible'' for any irregularities. The 
government's sale of the state telephone and electrical companies 
have been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo was the Front's candidate in the 1995 elections, which  
were won by Alvaro Arzu of the National Advance Party. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate wins 51 percent of the vote on Nov. 7, a second  
round between the top two finishers would be held on Dec. 26.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A woman regarded as Mexico's most colorful

ruling party candidate for president, newspapers reported Saturday.

<P>
	Sen. Irma Serrano, who has been among the most ferocious critics  
of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was 
quoted as saying she was ``disappointed'' with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
leader of her Democratic Revolution Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported that she will join the PRI to support the  
presidential campaign of former Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cardenas has changed and has taken a weak and fearful attitude  
to the system,'' she was quoted as saying by the daily Cronica. ``I 
am going to fight alongside those who do not fear the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano, a former actress and singer known as The Tigress, also  
is famous as the former mistress of several prominent politicians, 
including former President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.

<HEADLINE> Sonics' Baker Opts for Free Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle SuperSonics forward Vin Baker has decided  
to terminate the remainder of his contract by opting for free 
agency as of July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 27, a four-time All-Star coming off his worst season,  
will be free to sign with any club as of Thursday but has said his 
first choice is to remain with the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum he could receive would be a seven-year contract  
worth nearly $87 million from the Sonics. He could lose more than 
$20 million by signing with another club. The only ones with enough 
room under the salary cap to sign him are Toronto, Chicago and the 
Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 power forward would have received more than $2  
million under his current contract, scheduled to run through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last season, shortened by a players strike, Baker  
reported to training camp about 20 pounds overweight, missed 16 
games with thumb and knee injuries and averaged 13.8 points and 6.2 
rebounds. His previous lows were 13.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in 
his rookie season with Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Lopsided Results Mark Cup Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- While most of the coaches in the Women's  
World Cup proclaimed the competition would be even, skeptics 
pointed to the apparent discrepancy in talent from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle games of the opening round, which concludes this  
weekend, it was obvious who the ``haves'' are. And just how far the 
``have-nots'' must go to get to the top level. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, China and Norway, considered the top three  
teams in the tournament, each scored seven goals in their routs. 
The Americans connected seemingly at will against the porous 
Nigerian defense. China's speed and savvy was too much for neophyte 
Ghana. Norway ripped through Canada like a savage winter storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany and Brazil, who meet Sunday at Landover, Md., with first  
place in Group B at stake, probably are the next best among the 16 
teams. Each has a lopsided win to its credit. The Germans won 6-0 
over Mexico, which previously fell to the Brazilians 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which faced Canada today, won 5-0 over Japan in the  
middle game of its round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team has to be very good to get to the World Cup,'' U.S.  
star Mia Hamm said. ``Some of the countries with less experience 
are the ones who might have some big losses, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean they don't belong. All of these teams belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of them might even get into the quarterfinals, which  
will be filled by this weekend's matches: China vs. Australia and 
Canada vs. Russia at East Rutherford, N.J., this afternoon; Ghana 
vs. Sweden and Norway against Japan later at Chicago later in the 
day; the United States vs. North Korea and Mexico vs. Italy at 
Foxboro, Mass., on Sunday, along with Germany-Brazil and 
Nigeria-Denmark at Landover. 
</P>
<P>
	China, Norway and Brazil already have advanced. The United  
States would have to collapse against the Koreans not to move on. 
Denmark and Mexico are the only teams out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know North Korea that well,'' U.S. coach Tony  
DiCicco said of the upstarts from Asia who surprised the Danes 3-0 
Thursday. ``We'll watch them on film, and we'll put together a game 
plan. We might rest a couple of players. But we still want to come 
away with three points and reach the second round as the 
first-place team from our group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Koreans, who rarely venture outside their continent,  
complained about the tournament schedule. But it doesn't seem to 
have hurt them much, in view of a decent showing in a loss to 
Nigeria and the victory over Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players have done a good job in both defending and  
attacking, and individual players have done their jobs nicely,'' 
Korean coach Kim Hak Yong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ryu Song II, secretary general of North Korea's Olympic  
Committee, ``We are handicapped. The American team always stays in 
the Eastern area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans played in Pasadena, Calif., and Portland, Ore.,  
before making the cross-country trip to Massachusetts. The 
Americans played at Giants Stadium and Soldier Field.

<HEADLINE> Study: FBI Poor on Convictions Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The FBI obtains convictions in just one in  
four cases, the worst average among major federal law enforcement 
agencies, according to a new study of Justice Department 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993 through 1997, the FBI referred 222,504 cases for  
prosecution. Only 27 percent resulted in a conviction, said 
researchers at Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access 
Clearinghouse, or TRAC. 
</P>
<P>
	In about one-third of cases the FBI referred, federal  
prosecutors declined to take action because of weak or insufficient 
evidence, or after deciding there was minimal or no federal 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI spokesman called the study ``meaningless.''  
</P>
<P>
	TRAC, a research organization that analyzes U.S. Justice  
Department data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, is 
co-directed by David Burnham, a former New York Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham suggested the FBI may be asked to do too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has pushed the FBI into being all things to all  
people,'' he said. ``They've passed all these white collar crime 
laws. They've passed all these drug laws. There's heavy pressure 
from presidents, Congress and industry for the FBI to handle 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TRAC found that in 1997, half of the FBI's 12,324 convictions  
involved drug or bank theft cases, crimes that Burnham said could 
have been handled by state or local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released to the media Saturday night, found the FBI  
spent less time on cases where it has primary or exclusive 
responsibility: national security (12 convictions); official 
corruption (233), organized crime (400), civil rights (99) and 
white-collar crimes such as medical fraud (202) and embezzlement 
(66). 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are accurate, but do not provide a true reflection  
of the bureau's work because they are based on attorney's reports, 
which are different from the bureau's, said FBI spokesman Tron 
Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't understand how this agency works,'' Brekke said of  
Burnham. ``He doesn't establish an even playing field among the 
agencies. If we were all alike, the way we did business ... then 
maybe there's a valid way of comparing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with other selected federal agencies, the FBI's ratio  
of convictions-to-dismissals, its ``strike out'' average, was the 
poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service topped the list with  
18 convictions for every dismissal. The Drug Enforcement 
Administration had a 7-to-1 ratio. Even the IRS made good on a 
2-to-1 average, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these other agencies are singular mission agencies,  
like DEA,'' Brekke said. ``The FBI has approximately 300 separate 
violations that we look at, including drugs, where we have 
concurrent jurisdiction with DEA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TRAC noted that the FBI's conviction average was significantly  
more impressive when it was considered in terms of cases that were 
actually prosecuted -- 69 percent ended in convictions. Although 
complete 1998 figures were not available, TRAC reported that the 
FBI ended with convictions in 76 percent of its cases that were 
tried last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The data also showed that the proportion of FBI referrals  
prosecuted has steadily improved in recent years, going from 38 
percent in 1994 to 49 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the TRAC study reported that the FBI, with 11,269  
agents, has more agents per capita than at any time in its history.

<HEADLINE> 2 Indicted for Selling Ramsey Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury has indicted a private  
detective and his wife for providing what authorities say was 
confidential information to news organizations about the JonBenet 
Ramsey murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	James Joseph Rapp, 39, and Regana Rapp, 29, also allegedly  
furnished the media with private information about the victims of 
the Columbine High School shooting, and used subterfuge to get 
everything from unlisted telephone numbers to bank records, 
according to the indictment, unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be allowed to make a profit by selling personal  
information about the victims of tragedies when the information is 
illegally obtained,'' said Jefferson County District Attorney Dave 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp and his wife were charged with multiple counts of  
racketeering, and face up to 24 years in prison and fines up to $1 
million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at the couple's home outside Denver on Friday, Mrs. Rapp  
declined to comment on the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in the basement of  
her Boulder home on the day after Christmas in 1996. Her murder, 
yet unsolved, sparked a frenzy of media interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Hall, the prosecutor who led the JonBenet Ramsey grand  
jury investigation, said investigators have seized the Rapps' 
client list. 
</P>
<P>
	The list shows the Rapps have more than 1,200 clients, most  
located outside of Colorado. They include private investigators 
acting on behalf of news media, various tabloids, banks and 
insurance companies, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are media organizations who used his services,'' said  
Hall. ``The supermarket tabloids -- both here and abroad -- used him, 
many in England. If they knew how Rapp was getting the information, 
they may well have broken the law.''

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Wins U.S. 100 Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Considering his career could have ended  
after accusations of doping, Dennis Mitchell listed his U.S. 
100-meter title as one of his proudest accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality, this could be my last national championship,''  
Mitchell said after his wind-aided 9.97 won the title on the second 
day of the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. ``I think 
that's why this race was so emotional for me. I've had some very 
exciting moments in this sport. This race is something that's in a 
whole different category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, the bronze medalist at the 1992 Olympics and a member  
of the gold medal-winning U.S. 400-meter relay team, was banned for 
two years last April after testing positive for a high level of 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA Track &AMP; Field drug panel cleared him of the charges in  
December, but the sport's world governing body, the International 
Amateur Athletic Federation, has not yet exonerated him. His case 
will be heard by the IAAF on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	If the federation votes against Mitchell, he could be barred  
from the World Championships at Seville, Spain, in August. Mitchell 
claims his high testosterone level was caused by drinking beer and 
having sex four times the night before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even begin to explain the emotional trauma I went  
through this year,'' Mitchell said. ``It hurt me to go out to the 
track knowing this could be all gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable luster was lost from the event by the absence of  
Maurice Greene, who smashed the world record last week with an 
electrifying 9.79 in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in Friday evening's competition came word that Michael  
Johnson had withdrawn from the 200 because of an injury to his 
right quadriceps, destroying an expected showdown with Greene in 
Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very disappointed,'' said Johnson's agent, Brad Hunt.  
</P>
<P>
	Hunt and coach Clyde Hart said Johnson, the world record-holder  
in the 200, injured the leg Thursday doing the final sprint of his 
workout. On Friday, Johnson got a massage from his therapist, 
warmed up, then told Hart he could not compete. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning upset Friday, Marion Jones' two-year reign as  
national long-jump champion was ended by Dawn Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, the younger sister of Leroy Burrell, the former world  
record-holder at 100 meters, soared a career-best 22 feet, 10 
inches, in handing Jones her first defeat by an American since 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, competing in her first meet since spraining her right  
knee in a meet at Raleigh, N.C., on June 12, had a best of 22-3 on 
her first attempt and finished second. After fouling on her second 
try, Jones, who was leading, tried to protect the knee and not risk 
further injury by passing her next two jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Burrell burst into the lead in round five, Jones,  
ranked No. 1 in the world last year, rejoined the competition, but 
she couldn't match the leading jump. On her final two attempts, she 
leaped only 21-4 1/4 and 21-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to put anything off on the knee,'' Jones said.  
``I felt very good today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Inger Miller, a member of the gold medal-winning 400  
relay team at the 1996 Olympics, won the women's 100 in a 
wind-aided 10.96 seconds, beating two-time Olympic gold medalist 
Gail Devers by .01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller used a late rush in the final 10 meters to overtake  
Devers, who was competing in the 100 for the first time in two 
years, following a series of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling to come back like this and run the way I  
did,'' Devers said. ``It helps to get my confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's other women's winners were Connie Price-Smith in the  
shot put at 61-10 1/2, her eighth consecutive title; Stacey Bowers in 
the triple jump at 44-9 3/4; and Shelia Burrell in the heptathlon with 
6,101 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's champions were Adam Goucher in the 5,000 in 13:25.59,  
as he outkicked American record-holder Bob Kennedy down the 
stretch; Olympic gold medalist Charles Austin in the high jump at 
7-5 3/4; Lance Deal in the hammer throw at 263-7, the longest throw by 
an American this year; and Chris Huffins in the decathlon with 
8,350 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-Smith, winner of every national women's shot put title  
since 1992 and 10 overall, almost had her string ended. Going into 
the final throw of the competition, she was in second place, behind 
Teri Tunks' 61-8 1/4. She then beat Tunks by 2 1/4 inches, keeping alive 
the longest active streak at the outdoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelia Burrell was in second place going into the final event of  
the seven-event, two-day competition, 37 points behind 1997-98 NCAA 
champion Tiffany Lott-Hogan. But Burrell overcame the deficit by 
winning the 800 meters in 2:11.82 for her first national heptathlon 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott-Hogan was fourth at 2:22.50 and wound up second with 6,026  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Goucher and Kennedy waged a rousing two-man duel in the 5,000,  
before Goucher broke away over the final 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, winning his fifth consecutive high jump title, tried to  
break his Hayward Field record of 7-8, but missed three times at 
7-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal's victory gave him his second straight hammer throw title  
and seventh overall. A resident of Eugene, he was one of the most 
popular winners, receiving huge applause from the crowd. In return, 
Deal stopped and bowed to the stands during his victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins, capitalizing on the absence of world record-holder and  
Olympic champion Dan O'Brien for the second straight year, won his 
second consecutive title. He led all the way in the two-day, 
10-event competition.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Mania Hits Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Star Wars mania has struck in Japan, where fans  
turned out in droves at theaters around the country Saturday for a 
sneak preview of the hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in costume and others toting light sabers, the movie-goers  
began lining up as early as Thursday to see ``Star Wars: Episode I 
-- The Phantom Menace'', which officially opens on July 10, more 
than five weeks after its U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a festival,'' said Yuki Nishijima, a 19-year old  
student who had been waiting seven hours for one of three 
late-night showings at the Nihon Gekijo theater in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Around him, hundreds of people sat in the theater's sweltering  
entryway, fanning themselves and passing the time with everything 
from backgammon to beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, the world's second largest movie market, is home to  
legions of Star Wars fans, and the film has been heavily hyped by 
the media in the weeks leading up to its first showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the  
Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was based loosely on ``The Hidden  
Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Akira 
Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize this has sort of become a media event,'' said  
Chitose Koike, a 37-year old pianist who was waiting to see the 
sneak-preview. ``But I wanted to see it before everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nihon Gekijo officials said advance ticket sales had already  
surpassed previous records for the theater.

<HEADLINE> Charity Deal Defaults on Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The son of Feed The Children founder Larry  
Jones defaulted on nearly $1 million in a business deal that the 
Oklahoma City-based charity had financed, according to a newspaper 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Oklahoman said that Jones' son, Michael ``Allen''  
Jones, ran the charity's frame shop before and after the shop, 
known as Carousel Trading Ltd. and later as Tassels, Inc., was sold 
to a retired police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Jones eventually became part owner of the shop and  
personally guaranteed the debt, the Oklahoman reported. Within a 
year, he filed for personal bankruptcy and listed himself as owing 
his father's charity $950,000 for a ``business loan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look good, I'll be the first to say that,'' Larry  
Jones told the Oklahoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokespeople for Feed The Children told The Associated Press  
that the charity did not sell the frame shop directly to Allen 
Jones, did not give any money to him and will not be harmed by the 
failure of his business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Feed The Children was protected,'' spokeswoman Emilee Truelove  
said. ``Feed The Children didn't lose any money. Feed The Children 
is not harmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure comes on the heels of reports that employees at  
Feed The Children's office in Nashville, Tenn., apparently were 
caught taking food intended for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jones said he is frustrated by the negative publicity and  
that the reports have distracted him from his charity's mission -- 
feeding children. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jones' attorney, former Attorney General Larry Derryberry,  
said Feed The Children expects to recover the full amount of the 
debt after the business' assets are sold, including inventory and 
equipment. The building in which the business operated has already 
been sold for $575,000.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs' Big Men Unite To Win Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The season that almost wasn't turned out to  
be the year everything finally came together for the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan demonstrated his dominance. David Robinson showed  
he's championship material. Proven veterans and unknown journeymen 
learned their roles and played them well. 
</P>
<P>
	The triumphant outcome for San Antonio was an NBA title captured  
Friday night at the expense of the underdog New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, the 5-foot-11 ``Little General'' who'd been cut  
by the Spurs twice in his career, proved to be a big hero in 
decisive Game 5 at Madison Square Garden. He hit a corner jumper 
with 47 seconds left to give San Antonio its 78-77 winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Spurs arrived back in Texas on Saturday, Johnson stepped  
off the charter plane first, hoisting the team's championship 
trophy above his head and smiling at thousands of cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is beating a thousand times a minute,'' Johnson said.  
``We love y'all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs had remained mostly straight-faced through their  
nearly two-month playoff run but celebrated wildly Friday night 
after silencing critics who'd maligned them for years as being 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for David Robinson. He's been taking a lot of flak  
throughout his career,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``I told Dave, `You 
shut everybody up, Dave. You ain't got nothing more to prove to 
anybody else.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson described the Spurs as ``a tough -- you heard me  
everybody -- tough basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio secured the first NBA championship for the franchise  
and the first NBA title for a former American Basketball 
Association team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio in 1973 as the former Dallas  
Chaparrals of the ABA and merged into the NBA in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Robinson and Sean Elliott comprised the core of the  
Spurs much of the 1990s. Duncan joined the squad in the 1997-98 
season as the No. 1 draft pick from Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Duncan became the team's key offensive weapon as  
Robinson, the top draft pick a decade earlier, shifted his emphasis 
to defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan lost out to Utah's Karl Malone as the season's Most  
Valuable Player, but the 7-foot Spurs star was named MVP of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible,'' Duncan said. ``It feels so good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach and general manager Gregg Popovich acquired veterans  
Elie, Jerome Kersey and Steve Kerr before this season to provide 
playoff grit. They didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, this season looked like it might not happen  
because of the league's prolonged lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't begin until February, and the 50-game schedule was  
compressed into three months. That meant quick turnarounds between 
games and little time for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio got off to a poor start, going 6-8 in February and  
stirring speculation that Popovich would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets on March 2,  
initiating a nine-game winning streak and a 31-5 stretch run that 
gave San Antonio a 37-13 record for the regular season and the top 
seed in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the postseason, the Spurs lost only one game in the first  
round to Minnesota then swept the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland 
Trail Blazers en route to the team's first trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Before losing Game 3 to the Knicks in the finals, San Antonio  
mounted a 12-game playoff winning streak, the longest in one 
postseason in the NBA's 52-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the championship and posting a 15-2 mark in the playoffs  
satisfied Robinson after years of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in anybody's mind who the best team is.  
That's what makes me feel the best about this team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs defeated the Knicks 4-1 in the best-of-7 series,  
overcoming some tremendous shooting by Allan Houston and Latrell 
Sprewell and taking advantage of the fact that New York was 
undermanned because of injuries to Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and 
Chris Childs.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs' Big Men Unite To Win Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The season that almost wasn't turned out to  
be the year everything finally came together for the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan demonstrated his dominance. David Robinson showed  
he's championship material. Proven veterans and unknown journeymen 
learned their roles and played them well. 
</P>
<P>
	The triumphant outcome for San Antonio was an NBA title captured  
Friday night at the expense of the underdog New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, the 5-foot-11 ``Little General'' who'd been cut  
by the Spurs twice in his career, proved to be a big hero in 
decisive Game 5 at Madison Square Garden. He hit a corner jumper 
with 47 seconds left to give San Antonio its 78-77 winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Spurs arrived back in Texas on Saturday, Johnson stepped  
off the charter plane first, hoisting the team's championship 
trophy above his head and smiling at thousands of cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is beating a thousand times a minute,'' Johnson said.  
``We love y'all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs had remained mostly straight-faced through their  
nearly two-month playoff run but celebrated wildly Friday night 
after silencing critics who'd maligned them for years as being 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for David Robinson. He's been taking a lot of flak  
throughout his career,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``I told Dave, `You 
shut everybody up, Dave. You ain't got nothing more to prove to 
anybody else.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson described the Spurs as ``a tough -- you heard me  
everybody -- tough basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio secured the first NBA championship for the franchise  
and the first NBA title for a former American Basketball 
Association team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio in 1973 as the former Dallas  
Chaparrals of the ABA and merged into the NBA in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Robinson and Sean Elliott comprised the core of the  
Spurs much of the 1990s. Duncan joined the squad in the 1997-98 
season as the No. 1 draft pick from Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Duncan became the team's key offensive weapon as  
Robinson, the top draft pick a decade earlier, shifted his emphasis 
to defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan lost out to Utah's Karl Malone as the season's Most  
Valuable Player, but the 7-foot Spurs star was named MVP of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible,'' Duncan said. ``It feels so good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach and general manager Gregg Popovich acquired veterans  
Elie, Jerome Kersey and Steve Kerr before this season to provide 
playoff grit. They didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, this season looked like it might not happen  
because of the league's prolonged lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't begin until February, and the 50-game schedule was  
compressed into three months. That meant quick turnarounds between 
games and little time for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio got off to a poor start, going 6-8 in February and  
stirring speculation that Popovich would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Spurs defeated the Houston Rockets on March 2,  
initiating a nine-game winning streak and a 31-5 stretch run that 
gave San Antonio a 37-13 record for the regular season and the top 
seed in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the postseason, the Spurs lost only one game in the first  
round to Minnesota then swept the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland 
Trail Blazers en route to the team's first trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Before losing Game 3 to the Knicks in the finals, San Antonio  
mounted a 12-game playoff winning streak, the longest in one 
postseason in the NBA's 52-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the championship and posting a 15-2 mark in the playoffs  
satisfied Robinson after years of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in anybody's mind who the best team is.  
That's what makes me feel the best about this team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs defeated the Knicks 4-1 in the best-of-7 series,  
overcoming some tremendous shooting by Allan Houston and Latrell 
Sprewell and taking advantage of the fact that New York was 
undermanned because of injuries to Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and 
Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	As it did all season, San Antonio stressed defense in the  
series, especially in the final minutes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we talked about in every huddle for the last 10  
minutes, was that our defense was going to win this game for us,'' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season Robinson embarks on his 11th year in the league.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing what it's like to be a winner, he wouldn't mind another  
taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we continue to work at it,'' he said, ``we should get  
better and better and better.''

	Potential Clash Averted in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A potential clash between Serbs and  
ethnic Albanians was averted at the last minute today when the 
leader of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, persuaded 
about 500 ethnic Albanians to call off a march into Kosovska 
Mitrovica, where Serbs and ethnic Albanians control separate parts 
of the town. Ethnic Albanians have been seeking revenge for 
atrocities committed by Serb-led Yugoslav forces since President 
Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Kosovo separatists in February 
1998. NATO peacekeepers have been struggling to rein in widespread 
ethnic unrest.

	Clinton Announces Plan To Hire Teachers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his weekly radio address, President Clinton  
announced $1.2 billion in grants to hire 30,000 teachers for the 
new school year. Congress approved the program with bipartisan 
support last year, when lawmakers were up for re-election. This 
year, Clinton said, ``unfortunately there are some in Congress who 
are backing away from their commitment to reduce class size'' by 
financing a total of 100,000 new teachers. Clinton has asked 
Congress for a total of $12 billion over seven years to pay for 
those new teachers.

	Starr Must Turn Over Tripp Tapes  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Linda Tripp's  
recordings of conversations with Monica Lewinsky must be turned 
over to Maryland prosecutors, clearing a potential roadblock to 
trying Ms. Tripp for breaking state wiretap laws. The judge's order 
that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr must turn over the 
recordings followed a request for the tapes by State Prosecutor 
Stephen Montanarelli, The (Baltimore) Sun reported today. Ms. 
Tripp's attorney, Joe Murtha, said he will challenge any indictment 
brought against his client on the grounds that she is protected by 
federal immunity given to her in exchange for the tapes.

	Nuremberg Laws To Be Exhibited  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A small California library announced it  
possesses the original text of the Nuremberg Laws, the decrees 
signed by Adolf Hitler that made discrimination against Jews part 
of Germany's national policy. The documents will go on display 
beginning Tuesday at the Skirball Cultural Center, a Jewish 
cultural museum, Skirball president Uri Herscher said today. The 
Nuremberg Laws, signed by Adolf Hitler on Sept. 15, 1935 ``for the 
safeguard of German blood of German honor,'' prohibited relations, 
marriage and cohabitation between ``Aryans'' and Jews. They also 
defined citizenship in the German Reich and mandated loyalty to the 
Nazi flag.

	Holbrooke's Approval in Jeopardy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's nomination as U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations has hit a snag, blocked by a 
senator upset over the punishment of a bureaucrat who accused the 
State Department of waste and mismanagement. Holbrooke appeared 
headed for approval until the case of Linda Shenwick drew Sen. 
Charles Grassley's attention. Shenwick worked as a budget 
specialist at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York 
until her recent transfer to Washington. Grassley, R-Iowa, said he 
will not allow a vote on the Holbrooke nomination until the State 
Department agrees to rescind the transfer.

	China Overpowers Hong Kong Courts  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After two years of mostly hands-off control of  
Hong Kong, China showed its power today, telling Hong Kong's 
highest court it had ruled wrongly in an immigration case and had 
to start interpreting the law differently. The Hong Kong government 
had asked China to intervene in the case that threatened to flood 
the territory with migrants from the mainland, saying it hopes this 
was a one-time plea for help from Beijing. But critics said the 
territory was surrendering some of its autonomy in a dangerous 
precedent. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 
1997.

	Yankees Beat Orioles, 7-4  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- David Cone pitched eight innings of five-hit  
ball to earn his first victory at Camden Yards, and Tino Martinez 
homered and drove in three runs as the New York Yankees extended 
their winning streak to five by beating Baltimore 7-4 today. Cone 
(8-3) struck out six, walked one and allowed one run in lowering 
his ERA to 2.60. The right-hander, who retired 13 straight at one 
point, was 0-4 with a 5.40 ERA in six lifetime starts in Baltimore.

	Agassi Advances at Wimbledon  
</P>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Andre Agassi defeated Alberto Martin  
6-2, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3 at Wimbledon today. Agassi is seeking his second 
Wimbledon title, and is just a few weeks off from winning his first 
French Open. In other action, Lorenzo Manta, a qualifier ranked No. 
196, ousted 1996 champ and No. 5 seed Richard Krajicek 6-3, 7-6 
(7-5) 4-6, 4-6, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Discord Marks Baptists' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The convention of American Baptist  
Churches USA ended with discord caused by the decision to cast out 
four churches for their pro-homosexual leanings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in worship, the strife in the denomination was evident  
Friday. Following the program's opening procession of local, 
regional and denominational leaders, protesters entered the arena 
at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 200-voice choir and the assembly sang, marchers held high  
four crosses, representing the four California churches severed 
from the denomination last week for ``welcoming and affirming'' 
gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying banners and ribbons and holding aloft stones, about 200  
members and supporters of the exiled congregations walked to the 
front of the arena, then filled the center aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	After the song ended, the marchers quietly left or returned to  
their seats, to delayed and scattered applause. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Baptist Churches USA board's votes expelling the  
churches were held last weekend just before the denomination's 
biennial nationwide meeting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Expelled in separate votes were Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church  
in Oakland, First Baptist Church of Berkeley, New Community of 
Faith in San Jose and San Leandro Community Church in San Leandro. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the decision to banish the churches said the  
denomination had to uphold its view on authority of the Bible and 
homosexual practice as sinful. 
</P>
<P>
	Others called for peace.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to believe that we could all humbly seek Jesus'  
face together,'' said the Rev. David Frey of Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baptist body is one of more than 20 in the United States and  
has about 1.5 million members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Readies Medicare Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dropped a plan to charge  
well-to-do older people higher Medicare premiums, and White House 
and Cabinet officials are readying a public relations blitz on his 
still-secret Medicare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and top White  
House economic adviser Gene Sperling were being dispatched to TV's 
Sunday morning talk shows in an effort to build anticipation for 
Clinton's Medicare proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of how the president would fulfill promises to shore up  
Medicare in time for the baby boom generation's retirement in the 
next couple of decades, while adding a costly prescription drug 
benefit, are being accorded a Rose Garden debut Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough decisions on how to pay for billions of dollars worth of  
changes to the retiree health care program were completed Friday, a 
White House official said. But only a handful of the president's 
closest advisers knew the details, this official said Saturday, and 
they were ordered to let Clinton make the announcement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that a key  
element would dip into the federal budget surplus for $700 billion 
over the next 15 years, representing about 15 percent of the 
anticipated surplus over that period. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the president also will provide a number of  
administrative changes intended to enable Medicare to purchase 
goods and services cheaper than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the final 18 months of his presidency, Clinton has said  
he hopes to achieve major Medicare and Social Security reform as 
part of his historical legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, he abandoned one plan Friday that could have doomed  
him to failure: A proposal that would have, for the first time in 
Medicare's 34-year history, charged 39 million elderly and disabled 
beneficiaries different amounts for coverage of doctors' office 
visits and other outpatient medical care, depending on income. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, those premiums -- $45.50 a month in 1999 -- are the  
same for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	A top White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said administration officials floating the so-called ``means 
testing'' on Capitol Hill last week ran into too much opposition 
from both Democrats and Republicans to keep it as a viable part of 
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vice President Al Gore's urging, the official said, Clinton  
also scrapped a proposal to charge Medicare patients for home 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, Medicare pays the full cost of such services  
as part-time or intermittent skilled nursing for the treatment of 
homebound patients. A 20-percent coinsurance charge is imposed only 
on medical equipment such as wheelchairs or walkers.

<HEADLINE> Van Damme Marries for Sixth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) -- Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme remarried his  
third wife Saturday in a church service attended by Hollywood's 
glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Damme and Gladys Portugues also held a civil ceremony Friday  
in this small northern Belgian village, the hometown of both the 
bride and Van Damm's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 38-year-old actor's sixth marriage. His first  
marriage to Portugues ended in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people attended the church service, including  
Sylvester Stallone. He and Eddie Murphy were among the 150 
Hollywood actors and producers invited to attend the reception 
following the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Damme's movie career spans 15 years and includes such films

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Justice Reviews Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist reviewed  
the Supreme Court's 1998-99 term for judges and lawyers Saturday, 
citing six cases he said made important legal points but received 
little media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases ranged from procedural decisions, such as the  
unanimous ruling that a lawyer cannot appeal a court punishment 
while the underlying case is in progress, to constitutional, 
international business and sovereign immunity questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the judicial conference of the 4th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals, Rehnquist said the relatively obscure cases 
``were born to blush unseen and waste their sweetness on desert air 
were I ... not to talk about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Rehnquist discussed the 5-4 decision he wrote in a  
Minnesota narcotics case that narrowed individual privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved two men who were allowed by a woman in Eagan,  
Minn., to use her house to pack cocaine in exchange for some of the 
drug. A police officer saw them through a window, and they were 
arrested as they exited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the window-watching  
constituted an illegal search under the 4th Amendment and 
overturned the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist said his court reversed the Minnesota decision because  
the suspects were business visitors, not overnight guests, which 
are protected under Minnesota law. Thus, he said, ``Their 4th 
Amendment rights were not violated even if the looking through the 
window was a search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, a look back at the just-ended Supreme Court  
session, drew judges and lawyers from throughout the 4th U.S. 
Circuit. It includes Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South 
Carolina and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Planes Land in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Russian jet carrying paratroopers  
and airport technicians touched down at Pristina's airport today, 
the first airplane to land in Kosovo since NATO began its 
peacekeeping mission two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was followed moments later by a French transport carrying  
equipment to help make the airport fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 Russian paratroopers and 18 technicians will join about  
200 Russian troops who seized the airport June 12 after traveling 
overland from Bosnia, beating NATO into Kosovo by hours and forcing 
protracted negotiations on Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all part of bringing Kosovo back to normality and the  
better future that we all hope for all the people of Kosovo,'' said 
British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, the NATO commander in Kosovo, as he 
welcomed the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, who led the Russian land convoy onto  
the airfield two weeks ago, said the day marked ``the start of the 
air bridge which will serve in the future as a delivery point for 
all the things we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia plans to send about 3,600 peacekeepers to Kosovo to serve  
alongside a NATO-led force that eventually will include 55,000 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians will join a peacekeeping mission that so far has  
been unable to curb unrest sweeping the province. Ethnic Albanians 
have been seeking revenge for atrocities committed by Serb-led 
Yugoslav forces since President Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on 
Kosovo separatists in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, had demanded its own zone  
of control within Kosovo. That was firmly rejected by NATO, which 
worried it would lead to a partition of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a compromise was reached in which the Russians will be  
deployed in separate zones within three areas assigned to U.S., 
German and French peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes that arrived today are the first of 12 flights -- six  
Russian and six NATO -- expected at Pristina's Slatina Airport over 
the next 10 days, NATO spokesman Jan Joosten said. The transports 
will bring technicians and equipment to make the airport fully 
operational for flights to ferry in humanitarian supplies and 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, potential violence was narrowly averted this morning  
in the northern mining town of Kosovska Mitrovica when the leader 
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, persuaded about 
500 ethnic Albanians to call off a march into the Serb-held part of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to solve our problems peacefully,'' Thaci said. He was  
accompanied by the U.N. special envoy for Kosovo, Sergio Vieiria de 
Mello, who said the march ``would be a disaster'' if it proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is divided by a bridge between areas now held by Serbs  
and ethnic Albanians. Some of the would-be marchers today said they 
had been forced from their homes and a hospital in the Serb-held 
area. Thaci and de Mello said they hoped to resolve the impasse 
through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, gunmen opened fire on a U.S. Marine outpost near  
the center of Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo. The Marines returned 
fire and called for reinforcements, who found one wounded gunman 
nearby. He later died, according to the U.S. European Command. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second sniper attack this week against the Marines,  
who killed one Serb and wounded two others in a gunbattle 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also reported more widespread looting in Pristina,  
primarily of Serb-owned shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Looters ``know we can't be all over the place, but that will  
change,'' Joosten said. ``We have stepped up the number of 
patrols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called a meeting  
next week to find ways to bolster the NATO operation. Only half the 
NATO peacekeepers have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the permanent personnel who are going to administer  
and carry out the mission,'' Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethnic Albanians have been openly vengeful since a peace  
agreement ended the Yugoslav crackdown this month and forced 
Serbian troops and police to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They burned my house, so I don't care about this one,''  
Mohammed Azemi said as he stood near a blazing house in the village 
of Belo Polje. ``I'm happy in some way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pec, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church in medieval  
times, weeping Serbs abandoned the city, alleging that they were 
being chased out by ethnic Albanians. Of hundreds who had taken 
refuge in a church complex, only about 50 remained Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Veriq, Ymer Delija looted lumber, hoses and  
mirrors from a Serb house. He said Serbs killed his wife and three 
of his four children last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a kind of revenge. I burned two or three already,'' he  
said. ``That's enough for today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the main hospital in Pristina, the provincial capital, 247  
Kalashnikov automatic rifles have been seized in the past few days, 
according to Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse and guard were wounded Thursday when a patient being  
treated for a gunshot wound opened fire when he saw his alleged 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute between Serb and Albanian doctors over who should  
control the Pristina hospital deteriorated after reports that the 
chief Serb physician had been killed, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Human Rights Watch said a one-week investigation  
indicated Kosovo Liberation Army members were involved in the 
murders, rape and other abuses of Serbs and Roma, also known as 
Gypsies. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch said there was insufficient evidence to  
accuse the KLA leadership of orchestrating the attacks, but urged 
rebel commanders to discipline its ranks and punish offenders.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Lineman Enters NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Rob Murphy, an All-American offensive  
lineman dismissed from Ohio State for poor grades, will make 
himself eligible for the NFL's supplemental draft July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will petition to get into that draft,'' Murphy said on  
Friday. ``These things happen, and now I have to move on, just like 
Ohio State will move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, a 6-foot-5, 300-pound guard, was suspended from the team  
last spring for academic reasons before Ohio State dismissed him 
from school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to take summer classes to be eligible for the 1998-99  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy thought about passing up his senior year to enter the NFL  
draft, but announced he would stay after the Buckeyes' Sugar Bowl 
win over Texas A&AMP;M in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I wish this hadn't happened, but I'm not crushed or  
anything,'' Murphy said. ``You take everything in stride. You just 
deal with it and get on with your life.''

<HEADLINE> Jurors Say They Voted Against Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Several jurors have ended their silence about the  
Reggie Lewis malpractice trial, shedding light on the impasse that 
forced a judge to order a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlocked panel voted 9-6 on their final ballot to clear  
cardiologist Dr. Gilbert Mudge of charges he was careless in 
treating the late Celtics captain, juror Marian Regan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan, who is white, said race wasn't an issue during  
deliberations. Some of the seven minorities on the jury voted with 
Mudge, while some of the eight whites voted against him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said deliberations focused on medical evidence  
presented during the trial -- evidence that convinced her Mudge had 
treated Lewis appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly two-month-long trial against Mudge ended Thursday  
after jurors said twice they could not reach a verdict. Lewis' 
widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, had accused Mudge of mistreating and 
misdiagnosing Lewis before his death in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan, who voted for Mudge, told The Boston Globe evidence  
introduced by Mudge's attorneys of alleged cocaine use by Lewis was 
not credible. Mudge alleged Lewis admitted he had used cocaine two 
weeks before he died. The cardiologist contended the late 
confession made an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis denied the cocaine allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no substantiated proof so I didn't even use it in my  
deliberations,'' Regan said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a May 10, 1993 news conference marking Lewis' discharge from  
Brigham and Women's Hospital, Mudge said Lewis suffered from 
neurocardiogenic syncope and had a normal heart with ``no evidence 
of (heart disease) or abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Mudge testified at the trial that when he spoke to the media  
he was concerned Lewis might have an arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the medication Lewis took twice daily was meant to treat  
both the fainting disorder and the possible cardiac condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Dr. Mudge's fault,'' Regan said of Lewis' death at  
age 27. ``It wasn't Reggie Lewis's fault. I just don't feel he was 
negligent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regan said the jury needed only one vote to decide consultant  
Dr. Mark Creager was not negligent and two votes to determine the 
second consultant in the trial, Dr. Peter Friedman, wasn't 
negligent. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mudge, the jurors voted four times, according to Regan,  
needed 13 of 15 votes in order to reach a verdict. The jury split 
evenly on the first vote before finally settling into a 9-6 
division after 35 hours of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, juror Iris Mederos said the panel did the right  
thing in not reaching a verdict on whether Mudge was negligent in 
caring for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any regrets about the decision because I think  
that we did the best job we could,'' Mederos told WFXT-TV (Channel 
25). 
</P>
<P>
	Another juror, who asked not to be identified, told the Boston  
Herald that if the jury had stayed for another two weeks, it still 
would have remained deadlocked.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Leaves With Ankle Sprain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mark McGwire left Saturday night's game against  
the Arizona Diamondbacks in the top of the fourth inning with a 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis team officials said the injury occurred in Jose  
Jimenez's 1-0 no-hit victory over Arizona Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	They said McGwire playing availability would be evaluated on a  
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire fouled out in the first inning, then failed to get in  
front of Brian Anderson's grounder at first base for an error in 
the bottom of the third. McGwire walked to lead off the fourth, 
then was replaced by Willie McGee as a pinch runner. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee was promptly picked off by Anderson a moment later.  
McGwire has played in 71 of the Cardinals' 74 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Entry Draft May Benefit Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers didn't find many goal  
scorers in the NHL expansion draft. There were plenty to choose 
from in today's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers had the second pick, behind the Tampa Bay  
Lightning, the lowest-scoring team last season. And the first three 
players expected to be picked -- Patrik Stefan, Pavel Brendl and 
Daniel Sedin -- all have a knack for putting the puck in the net. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a skill the Thrashers can use after they took 26 players  
in Friday's expansion draft. None scored more than nine goals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got the list (of unprotected players), immediately  
defense showed up as the strength of this draft,'' Atlanta general 
manager Don Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be the weak point of the entry draft, a nine-round  
process that might not yield more than two players, Stefan and 
Brendl, ready to play in the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Sedin said he and his twin brother Henrik probably will  
play two more years in Sweden to get stronger. In no rush to get to 
the NHL, they have leverage in achieving their desire to play on 
the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a good chance,'' Daniel said. ``We're working  
hard to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan might have been a shoo-in for the top pick if not for two  
concussions suffered last season with Long Beach of the 
International Hockey League. But he says he's fine and has resumed 
workouts since the last injury on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit too much, everybody talking about it,'' he  
said Friday. ``But I know how I feel. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concussions limited him to 33 games in which he had 11 goals  
and 24 assists in an IHL in which he was among the youngest 
players. Brendl, playing for Calgary in the less competitive 
Western Hockey League, piled up 73 goals and 61 assists in 68 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the top goal scorers chosen by Atlanta on Friday  
were Terry Yake of St. Louis and Mike Stapleton of Phoenix with 
nine each. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waddell is happy with his goaltending. His starter is Damian  
Rhodes, obtained last week in a trade with Ottawa. On Friday, he 
drafted Detroit's Norm Maracle, the backup to Chris Osgood, to play 
behind Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also chose goalies Corey Schwab of Tampa Bay and Trevor  
Kidd of Carolina. As expected, he dealt Kidd to Florida for 
defensemen Gord Murphy and Daniel Tjarnquist, forward Herbert 
Vasilyev and a sixth-round pick in today's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers also sent Peter Ferraro, who they drafted from  
Boston, back to the Bruins for Randy Robitaille, who had been 
protected in the draft, in an exchange of forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	They also made six other draft deals in which they gave future  
considerations for Detroit defenseman Ulf Samuelsson; Phoenix 
goalie Scott Langkow; minor-leaguers Sergei Vshedkevich from New 
Jersey and Dean Sylvester from Buffalo; Calgary's Andreas Karlsson, 
who played in his native Sweden last season; and entry picks in the 
fourth and ninth rounds from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	In the expansion draft, Atlanta took one player from each of 26  
teams. Nashville didn't have to part with anyone because it was an 
expansion team last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell said his philosophy was ``getting good character players  
to build around our young players.'' Forwards Ed Ward from Calgary 
and Kelly Buchberger from Edmonton fill that role. 
</P>
<P>
	The other forwards chosen included Jody Hull from Philadelphia,  
Sylvain Cloutier from Chicago, Tomi Kallio from Colorado, Johan 
Garpenlov from Florida, Matt Johnson from Los Angeles, Phil Crowe 
from Ottawa, Alexei Yegorov from San Jose and Steve Staios from 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 defensemen drafted were Darryl Shannon from Buffalo,  
Jamie Pushor from Anaheim, Petr Buzek from Dallas, Brett Clark from 
Montreal, Kevin Dean from New Jersey, David Harlock from the New 
York Islanders, Chris Tamer from the New York Rangers, Maxim 
Galanov from Pittsburgh, Yannick Tremblay from Toronto and Mark 
Tinordi from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about our goaltending as I stand here now  
with Rhodes and Maracle,'' Waddell said. ``I feel good about our 
defense. We got the bangers and the checkers we wanted. Now we have 
to find some goal scorers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's entry draft promised to provide some.

 *Carolyn Craig    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Carolyn J. Craig, a former personnel executive for  
The Associated Press who touched hundreds of AP staffers worldwide 
with her concern for their lives and careers, died Saturday of 
cancer. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	For a dozen years after she joined the AP's Personnel Department  
(now Human Resources) in 1981, Mrs. Craig -- then Carolyn Turolla -- 
was probably the department's most recognized name and face. She 
interviewed hundreds of job applicants, many of whom joined the AP 
and credited her for launching their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was host to scores of staffers who visited AP headquarters  
in New York -- from the most junior news staffer to the most senior 
executive -- often inviting a guest to her home, a restaurant or a 
Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
	She participated in labor negotiations, established orientation  
and training programs, coordinated the transfers of hundreds of 
staffers across states or oceans, and listened patiently and 
compassionately to the complaints or concerns of any AP staffer who 
walked into her office. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1985 kidnapping in Beirut of AP Middle East  
Correspondent Terry Anderson, Mrs. Craig was the AP's liaison with 
his family in Beirut, New York and Japan. She played this often 
emotionally draining role for seven years, traveling to Germany 
with Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, to welcome him back from 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, a sister, four stepchildren, two  
nieces and a nephew. 

</P>

 *Jiri Pelikan    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Jiri Pelikan, a former communist who was stripped of  
his citizenship by Czechoslovakia after the failed attempt at 
sweeping government reform in 1968, died Saturday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelikan was head of Czechoslovakia's state-run television in  
1968 during the ``Prague Spring,'' the popular reform movement that 
ended with the Soviet-led invasion of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Moravia in 1923, he grew up in a family of intellectuals  
and artists. In 1939, he joined the Czech Communist Party and took 
part in the resistance against the Nazis and was imprisoned by the 
Gestapo. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Pelikan was the head of a Communist party youth  
commission that screened students for admission to universities and 
denied admission to thousands of non-communists. Pelikan later 
called the episode the ``greatest shame'' of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Soviet tanks rolled through Prague in 1968,  
Pelikan fled to Italy, where he eventually became an Italian 
citizen and went on to serve in the European Parliament as a 
Socialist.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Fans Welcome Champions Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs came home Saturday to  
share their NBA championship trophy with a city starved for a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won their first NBA title in the franchise's 26-year  
history, beating the New York Knicks in five games in the finals. 
San Antonio clinched the series with a 78-77 victory Friday night 
that touched off a downtown celebration for which fans had ached. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Spurs won the series in New York's Madison Square  
Garden instead of the Alamodome mattered little to the thousands 
who greeted the team's plane at San Antonio International Airport 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did it matter that the championship capped a  
lockout-shortened season in which the league was often criticized 
for sloppy play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about showing that nice guys do finish first. Hopefully,  
this is the start of a dynasty. There's a lot of pride with this. 
It's as important as the Alamo,'' fan Frank Cassiano said. 
``Remember the Alamo! Remember the Spurs!'' 
</P>
<P>
	City merchants agreed. Downtown stores were fully stocked with  
Spurs championship T-shirts, and congratulatory banners hung in 
shop windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs returned the appreciation with a full-page ad in the  
San Antonio Express-News thanking fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Police measured some of that support at more than 12,000 fans  
strong when the team arrived Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd alternated between chanting ``Go, Spurs, Go!'' and  
singing Queen's ``We Are The Champions'' as the plane taxied onto 
the runway and pulled up to the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Avery Johnson, who hit the winning shot, was the first to  
emerge from the plane holding the gold NBA Championship trophy over 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Center David Robinson was right behind, and carried the trophy  
to a makeshift stage and thrust it over his head before passing it 
down so that fans could touch it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be home. You deserve this championship, San  
Antonio, you deserve this!'' Robinson exclaimed. ``We worked so 
hard to get here. I waited 10 years, the city waited 26.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he has yet to settle down from his  
championship-winning shot with 47 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is beating a thousand times a minute,'' he told the  
crowd, who greeted him with chants of ``M-V-P! M-V-P!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for people who make $12,000 a year and have been Spurs  
fans forever. This is about everybody in San Antonio, it's not just 
about us,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he had immediately after the game Friday, Tim Duncan  
recorded the celebration on a video camera. Guard Steve Kerr, who 
won three championships with the Chicago Bulls, said post-game 
celebrations are becoming old hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is getting old for me,'' Kerr joked. ``Thank you. This is  
a thrill for me. I feel like it just landed in my lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team made only a 15-minute appearance before leaving in  
three team buses. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours before the team's arrival, 3,000 fans were  
already waiting to greet the team on the tarmac. The throng happily 
withstood a slight drizzle, cheering and mugging for TV cameras 
long before the Spurs touched down. Later, fire trucks sprayed the 
crowd with water to take a little edge off the 88-degree heat that 
was up near 100 on the heat index. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Hargrave said she dropped her season tickets in part  
because of the lockout. But by season's end, Hargrave was back on 
the bandwagon. She got to the airport three hours early for the 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the season started, we were back with them,''  
Hargrave said. ``Everybody know the lockout was about business. We 
love the Spurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postgame victory celebration lasted into the early hours  
Saturday as thousands of fans poured onto downtown streets. Unlike 
other cities where sports celebrations have turned violent, San 
Antonio police reported no major incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decade of repeat champions -- the Chicago Bulls and Houston  
Rockets won eight titles between them in the 1990s -- talk of a 
repeat had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about it already. ... We'll be back in it  
again,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (winning) shuts up the critics who said they were too soft  
and could not win the championship. We're going to do it again,'' 
fan Mike Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs moved to the city in 1973 from Dallas as part of the  
American Basketball Association. The team merged into the NBA in 
1976 and had never before advanced to the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's celebrations were scheduled to continue Sunday with a  
downtown parade and a pep rally at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Fire Department treated about 500 people for  
heat-related illnesses, but none of the cases were considered 
serious.

<HEADLINE> FBI Proposing Spy Hunting Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is proposing  
to create a division devoted solely to hunting spies, part of a 
government-wide review of counterintelligence, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes amid suspicions that China stole nuclear secrets  
for two decades. American intelligence agencies have increasingly 
focused on threats of terrorism, causing counterintelligence 
efforts to dwindle, the newspaper said, citing unidentified 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the FBI's national security division had added  
counterterrorism to its emphasis on combating espionage, and these 
efforts seemed to earn a higher priority as the battle against 
terrorism became more important in the post-Cold War era, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh has proposed splitting the national  
security group into two divisions: one focusing on terrorism, and 
the other aimed at rooting out spies, the officials said. Attorney 
General Janet Reno has approved the request and forwarded it to the 
White House, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	At risk is both the theft of military secrets and economic  
espionage aimed at stealing technology or information to help 
foreign goods compete with American products. Foreign governments 
and military intelligence services are joined by corporations in 
the new forms of espionage, which can occur between scientists and 
at academic conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's review also includes the Pentagon and the  
Central Intelligence Agency and is expected to lead to an overhaul 
of all counterintelligence. This represents the first time the 
three agencies have collaborated on a systematic assessment of 
espionage threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to criticism of its handling of suspected Chinese  
espionage at nuclear weapons labs, the government is changing 
procedures, including adding special squads of FBI agents at the 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers said the FBI and the Justice Department had  
failed to aggressively investigate cases including that of Wen Ho 
Lee, the nuclear scientist suspected of helping the Chinese acquire 
advanced thermonuclear technology. Lee has denied he spied for 
China, and Chinese officials have denied stealing nuclear secrets.

<HEADLINE> Audit Finds Legal Aid Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent investigation showing that  
Legal Services Corp.'s five largest offices overstated their 
workloads has renewed Republican complaints that the agency misled 
Congress about how many people it has helped. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans first leveled the accusation two months ago when  
Legal Services -- which provides free legal help to poor Americans 
with civil cases such as tenant problems or court protection from 
domestic violence -- said a few of its local offices had overstated 
by tens of thousands the number of cases they handled in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a General Accounting Office draft report says that five  
other offices of the federally funded agency reported 75,000 cases 
they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers say they use the number of cases when deciding how  
much money the agency should receive. Republican critics of Legal 
Services said the GAO report shows case-reporting problems are more 
serious than the agency initially suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the GAO has confirmed our suspicions of the  
significance and pervasiveness of the problem underscores the need 
to question whether they were hiding this from Congress,'' said 
Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, a member of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials say that even with the new findings, the number  
of overstated cases is small compared with the total number of poor 
people -- more than 1.7 million -- who have been helped. They denied 
the agency was hiding anything and said that case reporting 
practices have been changed to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services affiliates in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles,  
New York and Puerto Rico overstated the number of cases they 
handled by 75,000 in 1997, according to a summary of the GAO report 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO is the investigative and auditing arm of Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	The figure represents one-third of the 221,000 cases that the  
groups said they handled. Cases were double-counted, cases that 
should have been closed were counted as open, and cases paid for 
from nonfederal sources were included with the federal count, the 
summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also found that some programs had no records to verify  
their clients' income and citizenship eligibility. Such 
documentation is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is doing an internal review of case-reporting  
problems and is investigating whether any provided legal aid to 
ineligible clients, said John McKay, Legal Services president. 
</P>
<P>
	``LSC is completely committed to ensuring all congressional  
restrictions and laws are followed,'' McKay said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Legal Services gave $283 million in federal money to  
about 260 local affiliates to finance legal help for low-income 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers asked the GAO to look into Legal Service's  
case reporting after The Associated Press reported in April that 
the agency overstated tens of thousands of cases handled in 1997. 
An AP review of five other offices among the agency's 269 regional 
programs found officials had overstated their caseload by at least 
90,000.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- To the surprise of Jewish scholars and  
theologians, a small California library announced it possesses the 
original text of the Nuremberg Laws, the decrees signed by Adolf 
Hitler that made discrimination against Jews part of Germany's 
national policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, which have been tucked away for more than 50  
years inside a vault at Huntington Library in suburban San Marino, 
will go on display indefinitely beginning Tuesday at the Skirball 
Cultural Center, a Jewish cultural museum, Skirball president Uri 
Herscher said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised to learn that they were there, but I was  
looking forward, with some trepidation, to seeing the documents,'' 
said Herscher, who lost 18 members of his family in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The original documents were meant to be the blueprint of the  
extermination of the Jewish people,'' he said. ``But it signifies 
that Hitler's Final Solution was not the final word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuremberg Laws, signed by Adolf Hitler on Sept. 15, 1935  
``for the safeguard of German blood of German honor,'' prohibited 
relations, marriage and cohabitation between ``Aryans'' and Jews. 
They also defined citizenship in the German Reich and mandated 
loyalty to the Nazi flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The text, wrapped in brown paper and sealed with swastikas  
stamped in red wax, has been hidden inside a vault since 1945, when 
Army Gen. George S. Patton Jr. presented the artifacts to the 
chairman of the library's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars were pleased that the documents will be displayed, but  
they questioned the delay of the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to its being concealed for more than 50 years, I think  
we're going to have to find out what was going on,'' Jewish 
theologian Michael Berenbaum said. ``I think we'll find it was a 
case of nobody really gave a damn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Skotheim, president of the Huntington Library, said he  
was told about the documents when he took the position 11 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Skotheim said he chose to keep them locked away because German  
history is irrelevant to the library, which showcases British and 
American art and antiques at the one-time estate of railroad 
magnate Henry E. Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have anything to do with the kind of research that  
goes on here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Maj. Gen. J.A. Van Fleet, whose troops had seized the  
papers in the closing days of World War II in 1945, gave the 
documents to Patton after his men found them in a vault during a 
siege of Eichstadt, near Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, who was born and raised in nearby Pasadena, was a friend  
and next-door neighbor of Huntington.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Waited 26 Years for NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Red McCombs admits he was a little naive when  
he and a few fellow businessmen brought the Dallas Chaparrals to 
town to become the San Antonio Spurs in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like we would probably win a national championship  
within three or four years,'' McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six years later, McCombs and the city finally get to  
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs defeated the New York Knicks 78-77 on Friday to win  
the NBA championship, a feat long coveted by a former American 
Basketball Association franchise that always seemed to lag behind 
other teams in profits, publicity and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put San Antonio on the map like this, just awesome,'' said  
Spurs center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jubilant fans jammed downtown streets Friday night, high-fiving  
strangers, honking car horns and waving Spurs banners to cheer the 
first NBA title by an old ABA team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 26 long years. This is the best thing to happen to  
San Antonio and the best thing to happen to the San Antonio 
Spurs,'' team chairman Peter Holt said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating the victory, local leaders planned the official  
championship party even before Friday's game. A river parade and 
Alamodome pep rally are set for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration is a long way from the days of the old ABA.  
</P>
<P>
	McCombs and Angelo Drossos led an investor group that agreed to  
bring the Dallas Chaparrals to South Texas. The group would lease 
the team for $1 and assume $400,000 in debt while taking a year to 
decide whether to buy and keep the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	At their first game in October 1973, the Spurs drew 5,879  
spectators to HemisFair Arena to watch San Antonio lose to the San 
Diego Conquistadores. 
</P>
<P>
	By acquiring Swen Nater and then George ``Iceman'' Gervin, the  
Spurs grabbed fans' attention the first season. But crowds were 
rarely large. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA floundered and ultimately folded. San Antonio political  
and business leaders lobbied to make sure the Spurs were one of the 
four ABA teams selected to merge into the NBA in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Mayor Lila Cockrell remembers calling NBA owners to ask for  
a few minutes to talk up the Spurs. She also persuaded the City 
Council to hire local attorney Pat Maloney to attend NBA 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not wishing to intimidate, but we just wanted to send  
a message that we really wanted to be considered very seriously,'' 
Cockrell said. ``I just kind of think that did some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its entrance into the NBA, the city raised the roof  
of HemisFair Arena to accommodate 6,600 additional seats. By its 
final years of use in the early 1990s, the arena's capacity was 
about 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under head coach Doug Moe, and with Gervin's finesse and  
signature finger-roll, the Spurs enjoyed some playoff success 
during their early tenure in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most disappointing moments, though, came in the 1979  
playoffs when the Spurs beat Washington Bullets 118-102 to take 3-1 
lead in their first-ever conference finals. San Antonio lost three 
straight and was eliminated one victory shy of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's trip to the championship round wouldn't come until  
1999, after No. 1 draft pick Tim Duncan joined fellow top draft 
pick Robinson in the Spurs' Twin Towers lineup featuring the two 
7-footers. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning an NBA title has enormous implications for the Spurs and  
for San Antonio, sports and civic leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real exciting for the city,'' said Mayor Howard Peak.  
``It's been a unifying experience. It crosses every conceivable 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economically, the championship run has been a boon for the team  
and the city through ticket sales, extra revenues for the 
city-owned Alamodome and hotel rentals and other expenditures by 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Finals have given the city national media attention that  
might boost its tourism industry and could prompt major 
corporations to look more closely at San Antonio as a place to do 
business, Peak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people don't know anything about San Antonio,'' the mayor  
said. ``What they are learning now is San Antonio is a big city and 
it has a lot to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what McCombs had in mind when he brought the Spurs to  
town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning a championship in a major-league sport really has legs  
under it,'' McCombs said. ``This will have a life of several 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs, a car dealer who also made a fortune owning radio  
stations, bought the Spurs from fellow investors in 1988 then sold 
it in 1993. Now the owner of the Minnesota Vikings, McCombs remains 
a Spurs front-row fan. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes delight in the fact that San Antonio -- the smallest  
media market in the NBA -- defeated the team from the biggest media 
market, New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the drama here is so real, it is so American,''  
McCombs said. ``It'll bring the city great recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also could be the Spurs' ticket out of the Alamodome.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs moved into the cavernous building in 1993, and almost  
immediately the team said it needed public help to construct a 
smaller venue built for basketball and equipped with moneymaking 
luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a hard sell in working-class San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	Holt acknowledges other cities are interested in relocating the  
franchise. But Holt insists he and other local investors want to 
keep the team in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said he will help put together an arena construction  
package. It would almost certainly involve some public money and 
must be put before the voters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peak wants to emphasize private funding over public. And, he  
added, citizens will need to be assured it's a sound financial 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the championship could be the ``icing on the cake'' that  
persuades voters to get the arena built, Peak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People now see there's more to the Spurs than just  
basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Astros Get Funky With 70's Stripes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It was a time when 25 players could be louder  
than 25,000 fans, simply by donning their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1970s returned to the Astrodome on Saturday as the Houston  
Astros wore their infamous bright orange-and-yellow ``rainbow 
stripe'' jerseys some would just as soon see burn in a disco 
inferno. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are bad,'' Astros closer Billy Wagner said, grimacing,  
as he examined the jersey and pylon-orange hat he prepared to wear. 
``That's really bad right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros paraded out the most recognizable duds in club  
history on a Fox telecast that might have been mistaken for a rerun 
of ``That '70s Show.'' In honor of their last season in the 
Astrodome, they broke out the uniforms worn from 1975 through 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they were great, but some guys didn't like them.  
Mainly the fat guys,'' broadcaster and former catcher Alan Ashby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buttonless jerseys were a response to other fashion oddities  
in baseball during the 1970s, started by the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros last wore the rainbows during the thrilling 1986  
National League Championship Series, won in six games by the New 
York Mets. The switched to rainbow-sleeved uniforms until they 
unveiled the current blue-and-gold look in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, who finished 43 games behind the Big Red Machine the  
year the rainbows debuted, didn't fare much better Saturday. 
Cincinnati won 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions from today's players, most of whom were children when  
the Astros were rainbow warriors, varied from Wagner's ``clown 
suit'' analogy to Jose Lima's Saturday afternoon fever, complete 
with 70s-style big-hair wig. 
</P>
<P>
	One Astro not resplendent in his old threads was longtime player  
and current manager Larry Dierker, who is recuperating from brain 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember those uniforms,'' he said last week. ``And I'm  
happy that on the day they're going to wear them I'm not going to 
be involved.''

<HEADLINE> Manistique Wins Vanity Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Manistique extended her unbeaten streak  
in California to eight races Saturday night with a 4 1/2-length 
victory over Yolo Lady in the $400,000 Vanity Handicap for fillies 
and mares at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris McCarron, the 4-year-old filly covered 1 1/8 miles  
in 1:48. 
</P>
<P>
	Manistique's seven previous wins at Southern California tracks  
have been by an average of more than five lengths and include the 
Santa Margarita Handicap and La Canada at Santa Anita and the 
Bayakoa Handicap and Hollywood Oaks at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	She picked up a purse of $240,000 to boost her career earnings  
for 505 Farms to $916,700. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1-2 favorite, Manistique paid $3, $2.60 and $2.10, while  
Yolo Lady paid $5.60 and $3.60 and Bella Chiarra was $4.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, General Challenge defeated Desert Hero by two  
lengths as they made their first starts since the Kentucky Derby in 
the $125,000 Affirmed Handicap for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-5 favorite, General Challenge paid $3.20, $2.40 and $2.10.  
Desert Hero returned $3.40 and $2.20, while Crowning Storm paid 
$2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the fifth in seven starts for General Challenge,  
who picked up a purse of $75,000 to increase his earnings for 
Golden Eagle Farms to $717,900.

<HEADLINE> Uncle of Wanted Man Doubts Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN NICOLAS TOLENTINO, Mexico (AP) -- The police have found the  
real Rafael Resendiz Ramirez. He is not the much-sought railroad 
killing suspect, but the man's 66-year-old uncle, ailing and fed up 
with the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept that I am the uncle of the suspected railroad killer,  
whose true name is Angel Resendiz Resendiz,'' the uncle said in 
front of his cement block home. 
</P>
<P>
	The nephew is charged with two killings in Illinois and wanted  
for questioning about five more in Texas and one in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's 10 Most Wanted List identifies the suspect as Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez -- a variation of Resendiz Ramirez -- but the 
reputed hobo reportedly has used many aliases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Angel, if you have committed those errors, I beg you to  
confront them as men do'' by turning himself in, Resendiz said in 
an earlier telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz said he doubts the guilt of the nephew who he said  
lived with him for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not defending him, but who are the witnesses?'' he asked  
as a man wearing an FBI patch entered the Resendiz home to 
interview other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz said he had been interviewed by the FBI and Mexican  
police and had received numerous calls for interviews. He said he 
hadn't seen his nephew for 27 years, since he disappeared at age 12 
from this sugar-growing town some 65 miles southeast of Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had given him up for dead,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz described his nephew as a normal boy who grew up in a  
one-room adobe house with his uncle and grandmother, played marbles 
in the dirt roads and helped work in the sugar-cane fields. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't sure why his nephew left home.  
</P>
<P>
	He apparently ``did not want to study'' anymore. However, he  
added, ``many times kids don't understand why a parent, or someone 
who isn't a parent, hits them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz suffers from diabetes and eye trouble, but is still  
vigorous and leads the local farm cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that the suspect is the  
son of a farmer, Juan Reyes, and was raised by his mother until he 
was 6. However, the uncle said the boy had lived with his 
grandmother since birth, and never used his father's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother now reportedly lives in Ciudad Juarez, across the  
border from El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was close to his grandmother, who has since died.  
</P>
<P>
	``My mother cried a lot because of his disappearance,'' Resendiz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle reported from the northern Mexico town of  
Rodeo that the suspect's common-law wife, Julieta Dominguez Reyes, 
said her husband was ``absolutely normal'' and showed no tendencies 
toward extreme violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's the one, because he would have to be  
extremely cold and calculating,'' the newspaper quoted her as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported it had contacted the suspect's  
mother, Virginia Resendiz de Maturino, who also said she had not 
heard from him lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is full of hate, I ask God to cure him,'' she was quoted  
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe he traverses the country aboard freight  
trains. A common thread is that the crimes occurred in homes near 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force of more than 200 investigators is  
investigating the case. A $125,000 reward is posted for his 
capture.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Cyclists Win Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mari Holden and Danny Pate, both of Colorado  
Springs, Colo., won elite road race titles Saturday at the U.S. 
Cycling Federation's National Road Cycling Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Holden pulled away on the last of eight laps over a 55-mile  
course that covered downtown and crossed the Ohio River into 
northern Kentucky. Her time of 1 hour, 57 minutes was 62 seconds 
faster than Julie Young of Sacramento, Calif. Kendra Wenzel of 
McKenzie Bridge, Ore., was 69 seconds back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Holden has won three of the past four national time trials and  
had emphasized the elite race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win this so bad,'' she said. ``Ever since not  
making the 1996 Olympic team, I wanted to prove to everyone that I 
could become a complete road cyclist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pate won the 19-to-22-year-old title over a similar course in  
Cincinnati last year and finished second in the elite road race. He 
won that 111-mile event Saturday in 88-degree heat and high 
humidity in 4:28. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Michael Creed led a break with about 30 miles left,  
helping position Pate for the win. Creed finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Wilkerson, also from Colorado Springs, finished second, 52  
seconds behind Pate. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last year, I wanted to come back and win both titles,''  
Pate said. ``Knowing the course was a definite advantage.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Likenesses of entertainment greats such as Frank  
Sinatra and Stevie Wonder are protecting Radio City Music Hall's 
landmark neon marquee while renovations to the famed theater 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The marquee -- one of the building's best-known features since  
its 1932 opening -- was dismantled Friday as part of Radio City's 
extensive refurbishing. The venue's reopening is set for October. 
</P>
<P>
	While work on the marquee is under way, the midtown Manhattan  
fixture is now covered by scaffolding wrap -- huge wooden walls 
painted with some of the performers who've played Radio City. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sinatra and Wonder, the wrap includes portraits of  
Tony Bennett, Tina Turner and the Rockettes.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Aid for Aging Foster Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foster children forced out of the system and  
into the world at age 18 would receive help for such necessities as 
housing and health care under legislation advancing in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 380-6 Friday in favor of the measure, which now  
goes to the Senate for approval. President Clinton supports the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is expected to cost $500 million over five years and be  
paid for, in part, through savings in other government benefit 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect are  
supported by the government until age 18. About 20,000 are cut from 
the rolls annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers fear too many are unprepared to begin fully  
independent lives and end up jobless, drug-addicted, pregnant or in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds don't finish high school, 61 percent lack job skills  
and 38 percent are diagnosed as emotionally disturbed, said Rep. 
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., the House Ways and Means human resources 
subcommittee chairwoman and co-sponsor of the bill with Maryland 
Rep. Benjamin Cardin, the panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its provisions, the legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide double funding for the Independent Living Program,  
which teaches foster children such skills as how to find an 
apartment or balance a checkbook, from $70 million to $140 million 
a year to serve both younger and older children. For the first 
time, states could use some of the money to help them pay for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states to extend Medicaid coverage for foster children  
until age 21, at a cost of up to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Permit foster care children to save up to $10,000, instead of  
the $1,000 now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce fraud and abuse in the Supplemental Security Income  
program, which serves poor Americans with disabilities, by 
tightening eligibility. The savings would be applied to the foster 
care program. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against the bill were Republican Reps. Christopher Cannon  
of Utah, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Joel 
Hefley of Colorado, John Hostettler of Indiana and Ron Paul of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nuremberg Laws To Be Exhibited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MARINO, Calif. (AP) -- The original documents that codified  
Nazi discrimination against Jews are to be exhibited for the first 
time since Gen. George Patton presented the artifacts to a small 
California museum at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuremberg Laws, signed by Adolf Hitler in 1935, have been  
stored at the Huntington Library since 1945, and not even Holocaust 
scholars knew they were there. Some questioned the delay in 
revealing the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder why they didn't give them away or lend them out years  
ago,'' Saul Friedlander, a University of California at Los Angeles 
history professor, said Friday. ``They have such importance for the 
community of victims and give more completeness to events that 
recede with time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The library is to announce Monday that the manuscripts will be  
loaned indefinitely to the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Middlekauff, who served as president of Huntington from  
1983 to 1988, said the library never tried to keep historical 
information from the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel like we were suppressing any revelations  
because the text had been published,'' he said. ``And since the 
world was -- and still is -- coming to terms with the Holocaust and 
wholesale genocide, finding an appropriate venue was a stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Skotheim, Huntington president for 11 years after  
Middlekauff, said he knew of the artifacts but didn't think to 
display them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It simply never occurred to me,'' Skotheim said. ``Perhaps  
that was a lack of imagination on my part. I was told of them when 
I came to the Huntington, but I never looked at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum, founded by railroad magnate Henry Huntington, houses  
a collection of British and American art and antiques, as well as a 
research library. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuremberg Laws, typed in German on four plain white pages of  
paper, have been in storage since Patton, a neighbor of the 
Huntingtons, donated them to the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Patton made this presentation, not only was there no  
Skirball, there was no Holocaust Museum ... there was no Israel,'' 
said library director David Zeidberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have made a special case for them, put them someplace  
that said, 'Oh, look at this.' But it would have been so totally 
out of context with Lord Ellesmere's Chaucer,'' he said, referring 
to a manuscript of ``The Canterbury Tales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. J.A. Van Fleet, whose troops had seized the artifacts  
in the closing days of World War II in 1945, gave the documents to 
Patton after his men found them in a vault during a siege of 
Eichstadt, 40 miles south of Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The three laws, passed in September 1935, were drafted at a  
meeting of German leaders. One defines citizenship in the German 
Reich, another prohibits marriage, cohabitation and other relations 
between Aryans and Jews, and the third mandates loyalty to the Nazi 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Skirball will display the edition of Hitler's  
``Mein Kampf'' that Patton inscribed and donated to the library. In 
a letter to the library, Patton said he believed that 100 copies 
were made of the edition, published by a man named Max Amann. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the No. 3 bad man in Germany,'' Patton wrote. ``I have  
him in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skirball President Uri Herscher said his reaction when he first  
saw the documents in March was ``revulsion.'' Herscher lost 18 
members of his family in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was viewing the first draft of the death warrant  
that led to the demise of one-third of world Jewry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Afterwards, however, I felt a sense of victory. What Hitler  
thought would be the Final Solution is now in the hands of the 
persecuted. Though he wanted to put an end to our story, we have 
the last word.''

<HEADLINE> Harvard Offers Course on Animal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard Law School is going to the dogs.  
For the first time, the school will offer a course on what some 
consider an emerging field: animal rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	The elective class next year will discuss fundamental rights --  
why humans are entitled to them and why animals have been denied 
them -- and whether legal rights should be extended beyond people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is this thick legal wall with humans all on one side and  
all non-human animals on the other side,'' said attorney Steven 
Wise, who will teach the course next spring as an adjunct faculty 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	While the law currently protects pets from abuse and endangered  
species from extinction, animals do not actually have rights -- an 
age-old position of the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the last 50 years, science has shown that some animals  
-- chimps in particular -- have extraordinary mental capacities 
beyond what the ancient Greeks, Romans and Hebrews ever imagined, 
said Wise, whose forthcoming book is called ``Rattling the Cage: 
Toward Legal Rights for Animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they have a human-like intelligence, Wise said, shouldn't  
that entitle them to human-type rights? 
</P>
<P>
	While the concept may sound far-fetched, it wasn't too long ago  
that women and blacks were denied rights because they were 
considered, to some degree, less than human, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's new course was initiated by students, who convinced a  
faculty committee that it would enrich the curriculum, said Alan 
Ray, the school's assistant dean for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a 13th Amendment to the Constitution for us to outlaw  
slavery at a time when people were treated as property because of 
the color of their skin,'' Ray said. ``There are occasions in the 
law for taking a very fundamental look at the treatment of other 
living things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar class has been a popular offering at Hastings College  
of the Law at the University of California-San Francisco, said Leo 
Martinez, the school's dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people who aren't familiar with the course think  
it is knee-jerk and assume it is the province of wild-eyed 
radicals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten students have signed up for an animal law class at  
Northwestern University's law school in Chicago next fall. Wise has 
taught the course as well at the John Marshall Law School, also in 
Chicago, and at Vermont Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Many feel that more law schools will offer such courses now that  
Harvard has jumped into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I know that teaches animal law was absolutely  
thrilled to hear that Harvard was going to offer it,'' said Pamela 
Frasch, who teaches the class at Northwestern School of Law of 
Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just reality that if Harvard is going to teach it, that  
other schools that might have looked askance at it as a legitimate 
area of study might take another look.''

<HEADLINE>  Haskins To Leave Minn. Coaching Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins, national coach of the year in  
1997 after taking Minnesota to the Final Four, is out of a job 
although investigators found no evidence implicating him in an 
academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But university President Mark Yudof, who announced a $1.5  
million buyout of Haskins' contract, said it is ``extremely 
likely'' that fraud did occur and said a change was necessary to 
restore confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that on his watch, substantial, numerous  
violations of our academic conduct code have occurred,'' Yudof 
said. ``We thought it's time for a management change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins will step down June 30, three years before his 10-year  
contract was to expire. He compiled a 240-165 record in 13 seasons. 
The Gophers lost to Kentucky in the semifinals of the Final Four in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said they will begin searching for a  
permanent or interim coach immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has been under pressure since March, when former tutor  
Jan Gangelhoff said she did more than 400 pieces of course work for 
at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months since then, the investigation has widened to  
include accusations of improper payments, travel irregularities and 
improper relationships between the team and university police 
investigating possible crimes involving players. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins asserted his innocence when the scandal broke on the eve  
of the Gophers' first-round NCAA game against Gonzaga. Four players 
were made ineligible for that game, a loss that ended Minnesota's 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has maintained since then that he had no knowledge of  
wrongdoing. Phone calls to his suburban Minnetonka house Friday 
went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	But several players stopped by to visit Haskins, and McKinley  
Boston, vice president for student development and athletics, 
talked to the coach at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's disappointed, obviously, in the outcome, but he is not  
bitter,'' Boston said outside Haskins' home. ``He remains loyal to 
the university. He wants to see the players rally and support each 
other. He's hoping there is no exodus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a statement saying he had been honored to coach  
the Gophers and would continue to support them. The statement made 
no mention of the allegations or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players held a news conference to express their  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past few weeks leading up to this has been tough on me,''  
Gophers center Joel Przybilla said. ``Not just for me, for 
everyone. And today it just broke my heart. I just love the guy to 
death,'' . 
</P>
<P>
	Interim reports from investigators make it ``extremely likely  
there will be numerous findings of academic fraud, primarily and 
entirely connected to the writing of papers for students,'' Yudof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no evidence links Haskins to fraud, ``it is clear that  
public confidence in the academic integrity of the university has 
been eroded by the allegations. In order to restore that public 
confidence, a change in leadership is warranted,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is expected to report on its investigation to the  
NCAA in September. Yudof said earlier this week that the university 
was likely to sanction itself if its investigation showed 
wrongdoing. Enforcement records show the NCAA generally is less 
harsh on universities that deal decisively with rule-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof acknowledged that people, including Gangelhoff, say  
Haskins knew about academic cheating by players. But he said ``when 
it comes to direct, provable evidence today -- maybe not for all 
time, but for today -- that evidence does not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a matter of decency and fairness, Yudof said, he felt the  
university should honor Haskins' contract. The buyout will be paid 
with money from the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyout agreement calls for Haskins to cooperate with any  
investigation and have a joint news conference with the university 
at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lord, an attorney for several people who have alleged  
wrongdoing in Minnesota athletics, called the buyout bad public 
policy without considering a challenge to Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He orchestrated the scandal and in return they stuffed his  
pocket so full of money he has to waddle out of Williams Arena,'' 
Lord said.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Soap Opera Season Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A soap opera season had a sad ending for the New  
York Knicks, whose trip to the NBA Finals came up a couple of shots 
short in the last game. 
</P>
<P>
	They endured until the end after their general manager was  
fired, their coach came under fire and their season was in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	They survived a string of injuries that left their roster  
looking like an army in full retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	And they wound up losing when their best shooter missed two  
shots at the end of Game 5 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Latrell Sprewell was shooting Friday night, those two  
shots seemed simple -- first a 15-foot jumper with 29 seconds to 
play, and then a last-gasp 6-footer with one-tenth of a second left 
on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Both missed, and they took with them New York's last chance to  
extend the season. Sprewell wound up with 35 points, including 14 
straight and 18-of-23 down the stretch. They couldn't prevent the 
Knicks from losing 78-77. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all for nothing at this point,'' Sprewell said. ``I felt  
really good out there. I shot the ball really well. I'd rather have 
two points and have the victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was the antihero. Traded to the Knicks after sitting  
out a 68-game suspension last season, he was turned into a reserve, 
and was unhappy with his role. 
</P>
<P>
	But like the fortunes of his team, all that changed in the  
playoffs and with Patrick Ewing out because of a torn Achilles' 
tendon, Sprewell and Allan Houston became the team's main scoring 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a delicious turn of events for Sprewell, largely ignored  
early on by coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was on the hot seat when the 
Knicks were struggling at 21-21 and seemed unlikely to make the 
playoffs. That's when Ernie Grunfeld lost his job as general 
manager and the team seemed in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	All at once, New York turned it around. Seeded eighth in the  
Eastern Conference, they zoomed past Miami, Atlanta and Indiana, 
earning Van Gundy -- the coach who almost was fired -- a $3.5 million 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Spurs, though, they simply ran out of healthy  
bodies. Ewing was out. Larry Johnson sprained his right knee. Chris 
Childs sprained his left knee. Chris Dudley had a hyperextended 
elbow. Attrition caught up with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not go quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night against San Antonio, Sprewell went on a  
second-half tear, scoring 14 straight points, singlehandedly 
keeping the Knicks alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The end was hard to accept for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to get a layup from the out-of-bounds,''  
Sprewell said of the final shot. ``Charlie Ward threw an excellent 
pass. I was so far under the basket. I just tried to get the shot 
off, but it was far too short. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing once you know it's finally over and you  
know the shot didn't go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy paid tribute to Sprewell.  
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell made big big shots, got to the free-throw line and  
played outstanding,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So it stood to reason that when New York needed one more basket  
in the final minute, Sprewell was the shooter they went to. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, he came close.  
</P>
<P>
	Both times, the shot missed.  
</P>
<P>
	It was an appropriate finish to a strange season.

include accusations of improper payments, travel irregularities and 
improper relationships between the team and university police 
investigating possible crimes involving players. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins asserted his innocence when the scandal broke on the eve  
of the Gophers' first-round NCAA game against Gonzaga. Four players 
were made ineligible for that game, a loss that ended Minnesota's 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has maintained since then that he had no knowledge of  
wrongdoing. Phone calls to his suburban Minnetonka house Friday 
went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	But several players stopped by to visit Haskins, and McKinley  
Boston, vice president for student development and athletics, 
talked to the coach at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's disappointed, obviously, in the outcome, but he is not  
bitter,'' Boston said outside Haskins' home. ``He remains loyal to 
the university. He wants to see the players rally and support each 
other. He's hoping there is no exodus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a statement saying he had been honored to coach  
the Gophers and would continue to support them. The statement made 
no mention of the allegations or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players held a news conference to express their  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past few weeks leading up to this has been tough on me,''  
Gophers center Joel Przybilla said. ``Not just for me, for 
everyone. And today it just broke my heart. I just love the guy to 
death,'' . 
</P>
<P>
	Interim reports from investigators make it ``extremely likely  
there will be numerous findings of academic fraud, primarily and 
entirely connected to the writing of papers for students,'' Yudof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no evidence links Haskins to fraud, ``it is clear that  
public confidence in the academic integrity of the university has 
been eroded by the allegations. In order to restore that public 
confidence, a change in leadership is warranted,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is expected to report on its investigation to the  
NCAA in September. Yudof said earlier this week that the university 
was likely to sanction itself if its investigation showed 
wrongdoing. Enforcement records show the NCAA generally is less 
harsh on universities that deal decisively with rule-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof acknowledged that people, including Gangelhoff, say  
Haskins knew about academic cheating by players. But he said ``when 
it comes to direct, provable evidence today -- maybe not for all 
time, but for today -- that evidence does not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a matter of decency and fairness, Yudof said, he felt the  
university should honor Haskins' contract. The buyout will be paid 
with money from the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyout agreement calls for Haskins to cooperate with any  
investigation and have a joint news conference with the university 
at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lord, an attorney for several people who have alleged  
wrongdoing in Minnesota athletics, called the buyout bad public 
policy without considering a challenge to Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He orchestrated the scandal and in return they stuffed his  
pocket so full of money he has to waddle out of Williams Arena,'' 
Lord said.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Dominate NHL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Maybe they should rename the National Hockey  
League entry draft the European Hockey League entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Europeans were chosen with the first four  
picks Saturday. And for only the third time, a European was taken 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more scouting being done in European countries,'' New  
Jersey general manager Lou Lamoriello said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top pick was Patrik Stefan, a powerful forward from the  
Czech Republic selected by the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers hope he can, eventually, provide offense they  
couldn't get when they chose 26 players in Friday's expansion 
draft. They obtained the choice, originally held by Tampa Bay, as 
part of a flurry of pre-draft trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver had the next two picks and chose twins Daniel and  
Henrik Sedin, who play in the competitive Swedish Elite League and 
wanted to stay together in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having all the Europeans is a little bit of a coincidence,''  
said Toronto assistant general manager Anders Hedberg, also from 
Sweden. ``It doesn't matter where they come from. They're chosen on 
projection (to play in the NHL) and talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Brendl from the Czech Republic was chosen by the New York  
Rangers with the fourth pick, obtained in a trade with Tampa Bay. 
He had 73 goals in 68 games last season with Calgary of the Western 
Hockey League, one of the Canadian Juniors leagues that consistenly 
turns out top NHL talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan had 11 goals in 33 games with Long Beach of the  
professional International Hockey League but had his season 
shortened by two concussions. That apparently didn't bother Atlanta 
and Stefan said he's fine now. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan and Brendl are considered the only two drafted players  
likely to play in the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brendl's not European. He played in Calgary,'' Philadelphia  
general manager Bobby Clarke said. ``It's ridiculous to say that 
they are European when they have to get trained in Canadian junior 
hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first non-European taken was Tim Connolly with the fifth  
pick by the New York Islanders, who play not far from his 
Baldwinsville, N.Y. home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor being the highest U.S. player drafted,''  
Connolly said. ``I don't feel pressure. Pressure is when you don't 
have a job and have six kids to feed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first five players taken were all forwards. Then Nashville  
chose goalie Brian Finley of Barrie of the Ontario Hockey League 
with the sixth pick. The first defenseman drafted was Branislav 
Mezei of Belleville of the OHL by the Islanders with the 10th pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The 272nd and final player chosen was defenseman Mihail Donika,  
who played for Yaroslavl in Russia. He was picked by Dallas, ending 
the 9-hour, 24-minute draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 28 players chosen in the first round, 15 were from  
Europe, although some of them played junior hockey in Canada or the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Stefan, the only Europeans drafted No. 1 were Mats Sundin  
of Sweden by Quebec in 1989 and Roman Hamrlik of the Czech Republic 
by Tampa Bay in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a trend,'' Hedberg said of the European emphasis in  
Saturday's draft. ``That may not be the case next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a distinct trend Saturday toward deals. Seven of the  
first 11 picks were made by teams who traded for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest names changed teams later when Anaheim sent the 15th  
pick and center Travis Green to Phoenix for defenseman Oleg 
Tverdovsky. Green had 13 goals and 17 assists last season, while 
Tverdovsky was one of Phoenix's top defensemen with seven goals and 
18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay originally had the first pick for the second straight  
year -- it chose Vincent Lecavalier in 1998 -- but ended up without a 
first-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it got two picks in Saturday's third round from Chicago  
and obtained from the Rangers goalie Dan Cloutier, right wing 
Niklas Sundstrom and their picks in the first and third rounds next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades changed the order of the first four picks from Tampa Bay,  
Atlanta, Vancouver, Chicago to Atlanta, Vancouver, Vancouver, 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	That jockeying centered on the desire of the Sedins to play  
together and Vancouver's resolve not to part with the third pick 
that would give another team a chance to get them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said (Friday) night, `I've got (the third pick) and no one  
is walking out of here with both of them. Only I can,' '' Vancouver 
general manager Brian Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Sedin, considered the better prospect, had said Friday he  
thought he and his brother would remain in the Swedish Elite League 
for at least another season. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, that didn't seem as firm.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks ``haven't said to us we have to come over next year,  
so it's our decision,'' Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said his trades were contingent on him not taking Stefan,  
the top-rated player by the NHL's Central Scouting Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to put a projection on a player 18 years old,''  
Atlanta general manager Don Waddell said. ``It's going to take 
three or four years to see what you want out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unbelievable,'' Stefan said. ``It has been my dream to  
be No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't care if I went No. 1 or No. 4,'' Brendl said. ``I'm  
really happy to be in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made two Europeans drafted in the top four who probably  
will continue their development next season in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not being trained in their own country,'' Clarke said.  
``They're just born there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining first-round picks were center Kris Beech of  
Calgary of the WHL to Washington (No. 7), left wing Taylor Pyatt of 
Sudbury (OHL) to the Islanders (8), center Jamie Lundmark of Moose 
Jaw (WHL) to the Rangers (9), center-left wing Oleg Saprykin of 
Seattle (WHL) to Calgary (11), right wing Denis Shvidki of Barrie 
(OHL) to Florida (12), wing Jani Rita of Jokerit (Finnish Elite 
League) to Edmonton (13), defenseman Jeff Jillson of the University 
of Michigan to San Jose (14); center Scott Kelman of Seattle (WHL) 
to Phoenix (15), and defenseman David Tanabe of the University of 
Wisconsin to Carolina (16). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, defenseman Barret Jackman of Regina (WHL) to St. Louis  
(17), wing Konstantin Koltsov of Cherepovec (Russian National 
League) to Pittsburgh (18), defenseman Kiril Safronov of St. 
Petersburg (Russian National League) to Phoenix (19), left wing 
Barrett Heisten of the University of Maine to Buffalo (20), 
defenseman Nick Boynton of Ottawa (OHL) to Boston (21), goalie 
Maxime Ouellet of Quebec (Quebec Major Junior Hockey League) to 
Philadelphia (22), defenseman Steve McCarthy of Kootenay (WHL) to 
Chicago (23), center Luca Cereda of Ambri-Piotta (Swiss League) to 
Toronto (24), left wing Mikhail Kuleshov of Cherepovec (Russian 
National League) to Colorado (25), center-wing Martin Havlat of 
Trinec (Czech Senior League) to Ottawa (26), goalie Ari Ahonen of 
Jyvaskyla (Finnish Senior League) to New Jersey (27), and 
defenseman Kristian Kudroc of Michalovce (Slovak Division One) to 
the Islanders (28).

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Coppinger Stays in Majors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Gone today, here tomorrow.  
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles on Saturday rescinded their decision to  
option pitcher Rocky Coppinger to Triple-A Rochester, less than 12 
hours after the right-hander ripped management for sending him to 
the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball rules require that Coppinger must pass through  
revokable waivers to be optioned to the minors because he made his 
major-league debut more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we optioned him in May, we didn't need waivers. This time  
we will need waivers,'' general manager Frank Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, made after Friday night's 9-8 loss to the New York  
Yankees, also included the recall of reliever Gabe Molina. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina set up shop in Coppinger's locker Saturday morning and  
spoke about sticking around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be back up,'' Molina said. ``I'd like to stay up  
the rest of my career if I could,'' Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour later, Molina's nameplate was removed from the  
cubicle and replaced by Coppinger's. Molina was given an apology 
and whisked from the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Now you see him, now you don't.  
</P>
<P>
	Coppinger, meanwhile, was back in the same clubhouse where he  
had a more than a few complaints about his up-and-down career with 
the Orioles. He won 10 games as a rookie in 1996 but has since 
bounced back and forth between Rochester and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm too young for this (stuff). The manager has never been a  
fan of Rocky Coppinger and never will be,'' Coppinger said. ``He 
thinks I'm a mopup guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller said Coppinger can fit into Baltimore's plans  
if he shows more consistency. This year he's 0-1 with a 9.19 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get sent out, obviously there's a lot of feelings  
that come out,'' Miller said. ``He's gotten his chances. There's a 
little bit of accountability for the player -- he's pitched 15 
innings and given up 20 hits and 16 walks. It makes it a little 
tough to put him in a one-run game in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maturation takes a while. There's a lot of pressure here when  
you're a young man. The arm is there, the ability is there. That's 
why he was called up twice this year, especially after he had a 
terrible spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coppinger planned to spend the day with his kids before getting  
a call from the Orioles to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring all five batters he faced Saturday, Coppinger  
said, ``It's been a rollercoaster. I was 10 minutes away from going 
to the zoo, and then I end up pitching in a big-league game. It was 
a weird day.''

<HEADLINE> Clash 2, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce broke an 11-game  
scoring drought with a first-half header that lifted the San Jose 
Clash to a 2-1 victory over the Miami Fusion on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce, Major League Soccer's leading career scorer entering  
this season, broke a 1-1 tie in the 35th minute by heading home a 
cross from El Salvador countryman Ronald Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second goal this season for Diaz Arce, who came  
to the Clash from New England before the season. Jeff Baicher 
scored in the 21st minute as the Clash (9-6) claimed only their 
second win this season in regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton's 12th-minute goal was the only scoring for Miami (4-12),  
which has lost four consecutive games and nine of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce's goal began with a run down the left flank by  
Cerritos and ended with an open header from six yards. It was Diaz 
Arce's first goal since April 3 against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon preserved the lead in the 65th  
minute with a diving save on a header by Miami's Jay Heaps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion took a 1-0 lead on Welton's goal, only the third time  
this season Miami has scored first. Henry Gutierrez threaded a pass 
between three defenders to Welton, who easily beat Cannon for his 
first goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clash tied it nine minutes later on Baicher's left-footed  
shot from the top of the penalty arc. The ball deflected off 
Miami's Arley Palacios to beat goalkeeper Garth Lagerway, who was 
starting for the injured Jeff Cassar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion missed two clear chances to reclaim the lead within a  
four-minute span midway through the first half. Jeremy Aldrich had 
a header cleared off the goal line by San Jose's Joey Martinez, and 
Cannon thwarted a one-on-one chance by Diego Serna.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dissidents Kept on Terror List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two dissident groups hostile to the  
governments of Iran and Sri Lanka have lost a legal bid to be 
removed from the State Department's list of terrorist 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court, in an opinion released Friday, said the  
law left the judges little room to decide whether Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright acted properly in declaring the groups 
have engaged in terrorist acts that threatened the national 
security of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel said it was not for the court to decide  
whether the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran and the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam committed terrorist acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we see it, our only function is to decide if the secretary,  
on the face of things, had enough information before her to come to 
the conclusion that the organizations were foreign and engaged in 
terrorism,'' wrote Judge A. Raymond Randolph of the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her conclusion might be mistaken, but that depends on the  
quality of the information in the reports that she received -- 
something we have no way of judging,'' he wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a group goes on the list, its bank accounts become subject  
to seizure and it becomes illegal for U.S. citizens knowingly to 
contribute financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	The law governing the list does not require the government to  
present information that would qualify as ``evidence'' in a court, 
the appeals panel said, and any classified information the 
secretary of state used in reaching a conclusion may continue to 
remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``That we cannot pronounce on the question does not mean that we  
must assume the secretary was right,'' the court said. ``It means 
we cannot make any assumption, one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unclassified information presented to the court said the  
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was founded in 1976 to push for a 
separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka. According to the State 
Department, the group has used violent means, including bombing and 
political assassination, to achieve its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Mojahedin Organization is Iran's largest and most  
active Iranian dissident group, according to the State Department. 
Its primary goal is the overthrow of the Iranian government and the 
establishment of a secular republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was formed in the 1960s and ``its history is studded  
with anti-Western activity,'' that has included violence and 
terrorism, according to a CIA Intelligence Research Paper quoted in 
the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court,  
said in a statement the State Department's accusations ``are 
completely unfounded and solely seek to appease and placate the 
religious, terrorist dictatorship ruling Iran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Towns, D-N.Y., said the department's allegations of  
terrorism were ``merely politically motivated echoes, devoid of any 
factual basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, 220 House members signed a statement calling on  
the administration to remove the Mojahedin Organization from the 
list of terrorist organizations. ``It was not Congress' intent that 
a legitimate opposition to the Iranian regime be included within 
that particular list of terrorist groups,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said neither group appears to have property or  
accounts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``A foreign entity without property or presence in this country  
has no constitutional rights, under the due process clause or 
otherwise,'' it said.

<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes is accusing Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush of relying on money from special interests groups to 
win the Iowa Republican straw poll Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes swung though a county GOP barbecue to mingle with  
activists Saturday, but his mind was clearly on Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo leaked last week showed Bush is seeking to line up 50  
prominent interest groups to commit to delivering backers to the 
straw poll, and that drew Forbes' ire. 
</P>
<P>
	The approximately 12,000 activists who show up for the poll will  
not pick any delegates, but they could narrow the field of serious 
candidates for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates who fare poorly could find attention hard to get and  
money scare as the contenders move closer to February caucuses than 
open the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Saturday that Bush's effort coupled with a big  
Washington fund-raiser last week give lie to any claim that Bush is 
an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof is in the actions of the people around him,'' Forbes  
said. ``They're showering him with money and they're trying to have 
him win the Iowa straw poll by getting mobilized with their 
resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is seeking to raise $1  
million by the end of the month for the event, and former Vice 
President Dan Quayle's backers have sought to organize Indiana 
college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes declined to predict the backing he will get.  
</P>
<P>
	``All you can do is go all out. The key is not let it be  
hijacked by the lobbyists,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is making his second bid for the Republican presidential  
nomination, and approaching far differently this time. While he 
relied almost exclusively on attack television in his last 
campaign, he has been working patiently for months to build a 
grass-roots organzation this time.

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A veteran of Democrat Charles Schumer's  
successful 1998 Senate campaign has been chosen as press spokesman 
for first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate exploratory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Saturday, Mrs. Clinton said Howard  
Wolfson's experience and his knowledge of New York ``will be 
invaluable as I consider a run for the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very lucky to help (Rep.) Nita Lowey and Chuck  
Schumer and I'm very excited about the possibility of assisting 
Hillary Clinton,'' Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson, who served as communications director for Schumer's  
winning run against three-term Republican incumbent Alfonse 
D'Amato, has been New York Rep. Nita Lowey's chief of staff since 
1995 and was her press secretary for two years before that. He took 
a leave from his job with the congresswoman from Westchester County 
to work on the Schumer campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has said she will announce her exploratory  
committee early next month as she continues to prepare for an 
expected run for the Senate seat being vacated next year by New 
York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	She faces no major opposition for the nomination. Lowey had  
considered running for the Senate seat herself, but bowed out in 
favor of Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is being eyed on the Republican side by New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, among 
others.

	Winson Blount, the Alabama state party chairman, sent  
fund-raising letters to 10,000 party donors last week seeking 
donations from $50 to $500 ``to help our friends in New York in 
their battle with Hillary.'' Money raised also will help Republican 
candidates in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount plans to deliver a check to the New York Republican  
Party, which he said needs financial help in opposing Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why? Because Bill and Hillary's liberal friends in Hollywood  
and on Broadway, the labor unions, the anti-gun lobbyists, NOW, and 
the environmental extremists are going to pump every dollar they 
have into Hillary's campaign,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We greatly appreciate their offer of support,'' said Brendan  
Quinn, executive director of the New York Republican State 
Committee. ``This is the first organized state effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the New York Democratic State Committee, Matthew  
Hiltzik, called the appeal ``very creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the outside money and fund raising won't change the fact  
that Democrats are right on the issues and Republicans are out of 
ideas,'' Hiltzik said Friday.

 *John McCain 
</P>
<P>
	TILTON, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain didn't mention any of his  
Republican rivals for the GOP's 2000 presidential nomination on 
Saturday during a trip to New Hampshire, preferring to focus his 
criticism on President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Although polls put McCain far behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
he has been urging his fellow Republicans to refrain from attacking 
each other. He puts no limits on attacking Clinton and Gore, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	The country needs a president who evokes pride, not shame, he  
told about three dozen breakfast customers at a Tilton, N.H., 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aren't you ashamed when the president of the United States  
treats the Lincoln Bedroom like Motel Six and he's the bellhop?'' 
he said. ``Are we proud when the vice president of the United 
States asks monks and nuns to commune spiritually with him for 
thousands of dollars?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, cosponsor of a campaign finance bill that died in the  
Senate last year, said he plans a major announcement on the subject 
next week. When pressed for details, he repeated his goal of a 
comprehensive finance reform package that includes a ban on both 
labor union and corporate donations to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he blames lawmakers, not special interest groups, for  
the undue influence such contributions produce. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain planned to head to New Hampshire's North Country on  
Sunday.

 *Elizabeth Dole    	
</P>
<P>
	LACONIA, N.H. (AP) -- If Elizabeth Dole has her way, she will be  
the next woman in the White House telling Americans to ``Just Say 
No'' to illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	During her latest campaign visit to the state with the earliest  
primary, the Republican presidential hopeful criticized the Clinton 
administration Saturday for missing an opportunity to fight drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole suggested President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore  
had not tackled the issue because public opinion didn't warrant it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has criticized the administration before for placing  
too much emphasis on public sentiment for other issues, such as the 
Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pollsters will tell you drugs are not very high on  
people's priority lists. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't get my 
passion from polling,'' Mrs. Dole told a crowd at a local 
Republican picnic. ``This is a cancer on our society. How can we 
not have it as a top priority?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has lacked the leadership that former first lady Nancy  
Reagan exhibited with her anti-drug campaign in the 1980s, Mrs. 
Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 'Just Say No' worked, no question. In fact drug use  
went down when Nancy Reagan's program was underway. And then in 
'92, we saw a reversal,'' she later said after a tour of the 
Concord Boys and Girls Club in Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	Her experience with the Coast Guard's drug interdiction efforts  
while she was transportation secretary gave her valuable experience 
fighting the supply side of a war on drugs, Mrs. Dole said. She 
said she also would emphasize education and treatment.

 *Dan Quayle    	
</P>
<P>
	MADRID, Iowa (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle said  
Saturday he will propose a dramatic expansion of the child care tax 
credit to encourage at least one parent to stay home with children. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle didn't' specify which parent, but cast the issue in terms  
of ``stay at home moms'' who he said have come under fire from 
``radical feminists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he will deliver his proposal Monday in a speech in  
Washington, D.C., focusing on strengthening the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, parents can take a tax credit for child care costs  
only if a traditional day care provider is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Quayle's proposal, one parent can stay at home to care for  
a child and take a credit for what the day care costs would have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, the plan would allow families to take a credit for  
services they would have paid for had both parents been working. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle didn't put a price tag on his proposal which he said  
would be only half the effort to strengthen families. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to do is create an environment and a public  
policy that will give families more choices,'' Quayle said. ``The 
choice would be one parent staying home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle made his comments during his latest swing through Iowa in  
pursuit of the GOP presidential nomination.

 *Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes    	
</P>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls Pat  
Buchanan and Alan Keyes tried to raise doubts Saturday about the 
strength of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign despite his 
success at raising money and picking up endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Both spoke at news conferences prior to a Republican rally at  
Johnson County Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a former White House aide, columnist and television  
commentator, said Bush's early success is due to his famous name 
and to polls showing him beating the Democratic front-runner, Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply because the Republican establishment and the Beltway  
media have designated George W. Bush the candidate of the 
Republican Party does not mean he is that candidate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's a globalist, as his father is, and a new world  
order man,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this emperor has no clothes,'' Keyes said of the Texas  
governor. ``And I don't care who follows him around. He does not 
have grass-roots support, and he doesn't have it because he doesn't 
speak with principle. He doesn't stand with conviction for the 
things America needs to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said his own message is that America is going through the  
greatest moral crisis in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to address that crisis and the issues involved in  
it, starting with issues like abortion, as a matter of top 
priority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 *John Kasich 
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush finished first in a  
presidential straw poll released Saturday at an annual convention 
of the Young Republican National Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who did not appear at the convention, got 43 percent of  
the vote. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio got repeated applause when he 
addressed the gathering Saturday night and received 23 percent in 
the straw poll, which was taken over a three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other GOP presidential candidates reached  
double-digit support in the poll of 655 delegates. Elizabeth Dole 
was at 7 percent, Pat Buchanan got 6 percent and three candidates 
were at 4 percent: Steve Forbes, John McCain and Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich invested far more time at the convention than any other  
candidate. He met the Young Republicans at a reception on Thursday, 
held a news conference and then attended a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, who is hoping to emerge as an alternative to Bush, gave  
the keynote speech Saturday night during a dinner as the convention 
wound up. 
</P>
<P>
	His half-hour speech drew loud applause 18 times as he touched  
briefly on a wide range of issues including school choice, free 
enterprise, limited government, social security and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the loudest rounds of applause came early on, when Kasich  
urged the Young Republicans to ``take a chance, take a risk'' and 
pursue their dreams.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Have Some Options in Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It's been a long time since draft day meant  
anything to the Chicago Bulls. This year, it means everything. 
</P>
<P>
	A year removed from their sixth NBA championship, the Bulls are  
rebuilding. And the future of the team comes courtesy of a pingpong 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	With the No. 1 pick in the draft, general manager Jerry Krause  
can do just about anything. Pick first, and he might get the 
cornerstone of the franchise for years to come. Trade it for 
another pick or two, and he's got himself a solid supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, what Krause does Wednesday will be the most  
important move the Bulls have made since picking Michael Jordan 
third overall in the 1984 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a chance to get some building blocks,'' Krause said.  
</P>
<P>
	The big question, of course, is what Krause is going to do with  
the pick. He won't say, but the rumors are flying that he's trying 
to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke's Elton Brand and Maryland's Steve Francis are both  
excellent players and have impressed teams in their workouts, there 
isn't a superstar in this year's draft. There's no Tim Duncan, who 
helped lead his team to the NBA Finals in his second season. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a good draft for specific needs, said Stu Jackson,  
president and general manager for Vancouver, which has the second 
overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Need a bruising forward? Brand's your man. Looking for a guard  
who can do it all with flair? Pick Francis. Want someone to run 
your offense? UCLA's Baron Davis fits the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But need a player who can work miracles for your struggling  
team? This might not be your year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is a franchise player or player who's  
going to translate into 30 more wins,'' Jackson said. ``Depending 
on your needs, I think you can get a player who will help your 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By trading the No. 1 pick, Krause could get the Bulls an  
additional pick, possibly still in the top 10. Different scenarios 
have Charlotte (No. 3), Toronto (No. 5) and Washington (No. 7) all 
trying to trade up, with Toronto and Charlotte wanting a shot at 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chicago trades, the Bulls could take Wally Szczerbiak, who  
reportedly has impressed Krause. But Szczerbiak's stock has been 
rising, and Chicago has to make sure it doesn't drop too far and 
lose him. With another pick, the Bulls might try and grab Chicago 
native Corey Maggette, whose worth has dropped after some 
less-than-impressive workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we leaning one way or the other? We've had some very  
interesting conversations,'' Krause said. ``You don't make a 
decision before you have to. We'll talk or listen to anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With six championships in eight years, the Bulls certainly  
haven't had to deal with lottery picks recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they've had first-round selections, but they've been so  
far down they were almost irrelevant. Remember Corie Blount? Jason 
Caffey? Mark Randall? 
</P>
<P>
	Their last ``important'' pick was way back in 1989, when they  
took Stacey King with the sixth pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chicago is a world away from the team that won the NBA  
Finals last year. With no Jordan, Scottie Pippen or Dennis Rodman, 
and no real talent to replace them, Chicago bottomed out quickly. 
Its 13-37 finish was the worst in team history, and third worst in 
the NBA this season. Chicago finished 20 games behind Indiana in 
the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls caught a break when the first pingpong ball in the  
draft lottery had their name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some idiot said I looked happier when we won the lottery pick  
than when we won the championships,'' Krause said. ``There's 
nothing better than winning championships, and my feelings were 
never suppressed when we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also have the 16th pick in the first round and the  
third pick in the second round, No. 32 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's what the Bulls do with that first pick that everyone  
will be watching. The draft is an inexact science, and there's no 
guarantee the best player will be taken first. Just look at 1984. 
Hakeem Olajuwon went No. 1, followed by Sam Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3? A skinny kid out of North Carolina by the name of Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	``Can you afford a miss in this situation? I don't know how deep  
this draft is,'' Krause said. ``You try to do all you can to reduce 
that to an exact science, and then a lot of that is gut feeling 
from the scout and the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're trying to look into a young man's heart,'' he added.  
``You can't take an X-ray of his heart and say how much heart is 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the Bulls do, it will have a domino effect. Vancouver  
has talked about trading its pick, but Jackson said he hasn't 
gotten an offer he likes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers, who have the fourth pick, want Davis.  
He's worked out for the Bulls and the Golden State Warriors, but 
he's turned down requests from other teams because he wants to stay 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest questions of the draft concerns Lamar Odom,  
who flip-flopped on whether he wanted to leave college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rhode Island star had team executives drooling over his raw  
talent and power. He's got great ball-handling skills, a nice shot 
and can play defense. His workout for the Grizzlies impressed 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an exceptional talent,'' Jackson said. ``He has a great  
deal of versatility. There's not a whole lot he can't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Odom began to have second thoughts. He skipped a workout at  
the pre-draft camp and blew off an interview session for projected 
top picks. He didn't show up for scheduled workouts with teams and 
then announced he'd fired his agent and wanted to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island considered filing an appeal on his behalf, but  
decided not to after a short investigation. So, it appears Odom is 
back in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson believes he'll end up being taken in the top five.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's good enough to take a chance on,'' Jackson said. ``Just  
because his talent can't be denied.''

<HEADLINE> Counting Heads Imprecise Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As of Oct. 12, there will be exactly 6 billion people on Earth.  
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	The date might be July 19. Or was it in April?  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say exactly when,'' Corrie Shanahan concedes, though  
that has not stopped her agency, the United Nations Population 
Fund, from declaring Oct. 12 to be the official ``Day of Six 
Billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The date was chosen as much for convenience as accuracy,  
Shanahan says. Demographers with the United Nations' Population 
Division narrowed down the 6 billion milestone to some time in 
early October. But that vague estimate lacked punch in 
proclamations, so officials at the Population Fund, a 
U.N.-sponsored agency similar to UNICEF, chose Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not entirely arbitrary, but it is definitely symbolic,''  
Shanahan says. ``We can't say it's that day, or even narrow it down 
to within a day or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're even further off than that, according to the U.S. Census  
Bureau's International Programs Center, which projects July 19 to 
be the 6 billion day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both agencies use the same census figures from around the world.  
But different methods of analyzing the data, including the Census 
Bureau's assumption of a slightly higher fertility rate, help 
explain the three-month discrepancy, says Census Bureau demographer 
Tim Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither figure should be mistaken for hard fact. Putting a  
number on the planet's bustling multitudes is less like toting up 
coins in a piggy bank and more like counting bees in a hive. 
</P>
<P>
	Any current estimate of world population is actually a  
projection based on census figures up to a decade old. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have any data for 1999,'' Fowler says. ``For a  
lot of countries, the most recent information is from around 
1990.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demographers run census figures through a ``smoothing'' process,  
trying to correct data-collection errors particular to each 
country. Then they extrapolate into the future from the date of the 
census, using each nation's estimated fertility, mortality and 
migration rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Add up all the countries, and the result is a world population  
figure that's stronger on precision than accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about the global village, but we don't have as much  
information as we sometimes think we have,'' Shanahan says. ``It 
says something about how vast the Earth still is, and how 
immeasurable some things are.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Score 11 Runs in 1st Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox scored 11 first-inning runs  
Saturday for the first time in 66 years. And Pedro Martinez, the 
best pitcher in baseball, was the beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since August 13, 1933 that the Red Sox  
have scored 11 runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Offerman opened the inning with a double off Chicago White  
Sox starter James Baldwin. Lou Merloni singled and Brian Daubach 
homered to give Boston a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, Troy O'Leary singled, Mike Stanley doubled, and  
Jason Varitek doubled to make it 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin got one more out but was pulled after walking Trot  
Nixon. Scott Eyre replace him and issued a walk to Offerman and a 
bases-clearing double to Merloni for an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Daubach's RBI single made it 9-0 and Nomar Garciaparra finished  
the first-inning barrage with a two-run homer to give Boston an 
11-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Red Sox scored 11 in an inning was May 31,  
1998 against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have scored 10 or more runs in an inning a record 27  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the White Sox gave up more than 10 runs was April  
2, 1998 against Texas. The most runs Chicago has allowed this 
season in one inning was eight runs on May 11 against Texas.

<HEADLINE> Russian Soccer Women Beat Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Elena Fomina scored twice after  
entering the game early in the second half and Russia advanced to 
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup with a 4-1 win over Canada 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Irina Grigorieva and Olga Karasseva also scored for the Russians  
(2-1), who played a defensive game in the first half and then 
attacked to score four times in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada (0-2-1) controlled the play at times playing in front of  
a small crowd at Giants Stadium -- the same venue that attracted 
78,792 fans, a record for women's sports event in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	After Grigorieva and Fomina scored on shots from the top of the  
penalty area in the 54th and 66th minutes, respectively, the 
Canadians came close to tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Charmaine Hooper outjumped four other players to score on a  
header right in front of Russian goalkeeper Svetlana Petko in the 
76th minute. Two minutes later, second-half replacement Silvana 
Burtini was just wide of the right goalpost with another header. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the Canadians last chance. Fomina ran into the box and  
took a great pass from Olga Letuchova to beat goalkeper Nicci 
Wright in the 86th minute and Karasseva scored off another 
Letuchova assist in the first minute of injury time. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, which was beaten 7-1 by Norway on Wednesday, dominated  
play in the opening 40 minutes, creating several scoring chances 
with crossing passes from the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	A cross from the right wing set up Geri Donnelly right in the  
middle of the penalty area but her shot sailed way over the 
crossbar. Tanya Franck forced Petko to make a diving save at the 
left goalpost with a shot from the right edge of the box in the 
35th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Letuchova, who just missed the corner of the net with a 40-yard  
blast in the 11th minute, had the Russians' best first-half scoring 
chance with a header in the box in the 43rd minute.

<HEADLINE> Petty Recovering From Ulcers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- Former stock car star Richard Petty is  
recuperating from an attack of bleeding ulcers that put him in a 
hospital earlier this week, according to his son, Kyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty, who is competing in Sunday's Save Mart-Kragen 350  
Winston Cup race, said a family friend had stopped by to visit his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I don't feel so good,' and by the time he said `I  
don't feel so good,' he just fainted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The friend got him to a hospital in Greensboro, N.C., where it  
was determined that he had lost 40 percent of his blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a couple of ulcers that were bleeding pretty bad. They  
had to give him a couple pints of blood,'' Petty said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said doctors stabilized the bleeding on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing pretty good. He has a cut on his face and a black  
eye from the fall. He'll be home tomorrow morning before the race. 
He'll be watching the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty said his father hadn't been feeling well recently and  
had lost about 40 percent of his stomach to ulcers in 1978, but the 
current illness came on suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently he ate something or he didn't eat something and one  
of the ulcers ruptured,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty, 61, the most successful Winston Cub driver with  
200 victories and seven championships, retired from competition in 
1992.

	Ethnic Unrest Continues in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The NATO peacekeeping mission so far  
has been unable to curb mounting unrest between ethnic Albanians 
and Serbs in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians have been seeking revenge for 
atrocities committed by Serb-led Yugoslav forces since President 
Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Kosovo separatists in February 
1998. One flashpoint is the northern mining city of Kosovska 
Mitrovica, where Serbs and ethnic Albanians control separate parts 
of the town. A potential clash was averted at the last minute today 
when the leader of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army persuaded about 
500 ethnic Albanians to call off a march into the Serb-held area.

	Pakistan Tacitly Admits Kashmir Activity

<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan appeared to admit for the  
first time today that it had a hand in troops battling Indian 
forces in the disputed Kashmir region, but it rebuffed U.S. calls 
to withdraw its forces. Since hostilities began in early May, India 
has contended Pakistan had troops among hundreds of fighters who 
seized mountain positions in the Kargil region of Indian-held part 
of the divided Kashmir. Until today, Pakistan denied any role with 
the fighters, saying they were Kashmiri Muslims battling for 
independence from India.

	Clinton Readies Medicare Overhaul  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has dropped a plan to charge  
well-to-do older people higher Medicare premiums, and White House 
and Cabinet officials are readying a public relations blitz on his 
still-secret Medicare overhaul. Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala and top White House economic adviser Gene Sperling 
were being dispatched to TV's talk shows tomorrow morning in an 
effort to build anticipation for Clinton's Medicare proposal. 
Facing the final 18 months of his presidency, Clinton has said he 
hopes to achieve major Medicare and Social Security reform as part 
of his historical legacy.

	Independent Counsel Law To Expire  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr and Congress will watch the law that led to a presidential 
impeachment disappear on Wednesday into the dustbin of history. The 
debate on Capitol Hill over who should investigate future charges 
against senior government officials is unresolved. After 21 years, 
nearly as many independent counsel investigations, and hostilities 
over Clinton's impeachment trial, lawmakers are not inclined to 
plunge into that debate. Until Congress decides, Justice Department 
investigators will look into any such charges.

	World War II Bombs Found in Germany  
</P>
<P>
	GOETTINGEN, Germany (AP) -- About 7,000 people were evacuated  
from their homes in this central German city today after two 
American-made World War II era bombs were uncovered near railway 
tracks. A home for the elderly was evacuated early in the afternoon 
and patrol cars used loudspeakers to order other residents in the 
area to leave for temporary quarters set up for them in public 
buildings. More than 50 years after the war, old bombs and 
ammunition are still regularly found in Germany. Most recent finds 
have been in former East Germany, where excavation for new 
construction projects have often uncovered leftover bombs since 
reunification in 1990.

	'Star Wars' Mania Hits Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Star Wars mania has struck in Japan, where fans  
turned out in droves at theaters around the country today for a 
sneak preview of the hit movie. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace'' officially opens on July 10, more than five weeks 
after its U.S. debut. Some say the space fantasy series holds a 
special appeal for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version 
of classic samurai films. The first ``Star Wars'' movie was based 
loosely on ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's 
journey by Akira Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's 300th career home run was not enough  
for Chicago today as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Cubs 6-2. 
Bobby Abreu and Rico Brogna each hit two-run homers in the first 
inning and Robert Person (1-1) won for the first time in four 
starts for Philadelphia. Person left after allowing Sosa's 
NL-leading 27th home run with one out in the sixth. Sosa became the 
83rd player to reach 300 home runs.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- In one of his best starts of the season, Tom  
Glavine allowed just four hits in seven innings and the Atlanta 
Braves pushed their lead in the NL East back to three games tonight 
with a 7-2 victory over the second-place New York Mets. Ryan Klesko 
hit a three-run homer in the first as the Braves pounced on New 
York starter Octavio Dotel, making his major-league debut. The 
23-year-old right-hander was knocked out in the fifth after 
allowing three more runs. The Mets lost for only the fourth time in 
19 games.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Fight Heads to Senate Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agriculture spending bill in the Senate is  
becoming the battleground for a rancorous fight over letting groups 
of states band together to set milk prices in their region. 
</P>
<P>
	Two senators from Vermont, one of six states in the Northeast  
Dairy Compact, want to expand that alliance and create a new one in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as this week, Sens. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, and Jim  
Jeffords, a Republican, intend to offer their changes in an 
amendment to the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers also are pushing to rework a new Agriculture  
Department proposal for the way the federal government sets the 
price of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The big battle, however, is over the future of dairy compacts  
established by Congress as part of the farm reform law in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The compacts allow states to join together and set what they  
consider a ``fair price'' for fluid milk. A commission funded with 
dairy producer contributions controls the operations and 
establishes a price higher than the federal government's for the 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight pits lawmakers from the Midwest against colleagues in  
the Northeast and the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast compact -- the only one now operating -- is set to  
expire Oct. 1 unless Congress agrees to reauthorize it. Meantime, 
southern states are pushing for congressional approval to start 
their own a Southern Dairy Compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest lawmakers complain that the Northeast compact frustrates  
farmers from their states who might want to sell milk in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	``It troubles me to contemplate killing the bill,'' said  
Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, ranking member of the 
Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture. ``However, I will do 
just that if dairy compact amendments are added to the bill while 
it's being debated on the Senate floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed amendment would expand the Northeast compact --  
which includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, 
Rhode Island and Vermont -- with Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New 
York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would create a Southern group made up of Alabama,  
Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas could  
join if their state legislatures agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both compacts would expire in 2002, when Congress is set to  
revisit the farm bill, according to the Vermont lawmakers' 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compact has been studied, audited and sued, and despite  
what opponents may say, the compact has always come through with a 
clean bill of health,'' they wrote colleagues last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity here to give the states the right to  
help protect their farmers with no cost to federal government,'' 
the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not the way opponents see it.  
</P>
<P>
	They argue compacts serve the interests of a few states while  
raising the price of a gallon of milk for consumers. Another 
concern is that overproduction of milk in compact areas would lower 
prices for Midwest producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say compacts help stabilize milk prices and protect  
producers from wild swings in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has served as a model for the entire country,'' Leahy and  
Jeffords wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Their amendment has the support of 38 other senators, but its  
fate on the Senate floor remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Midwest lawmakers had written the chairman of the  
Senate Appropriations Committee, Republican Ted Stevens of Alaska, 
and the top Democrat, Robert Byrd of West Virginia. They also 
enlisted the support of the Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, 
Richard Lugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``These compacts would have a much greater potential to lower  
milk prices received by dairy farmers in non-compact areas,'' 
Lugar, R-Ind., wrote Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar noted that the eligible compact states account for 36  
percent of national milk production and 62 percent of consumption. 
``We should strive toward the creation of national, not regional 
dairy policies.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Draws Battle Lines With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, racing against the 2000  
political calendar, promises ``to be working right up to the very 
end'' of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	But as he draws deep battle lines with Republicans on issues as  
diverse as gun control and class size with only 19 months left in 
his presidency, he acknowledges reality: ``The closer you get to 
the election the more difficult it will be to pass anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address today, Clinton announced $1.2  
billion in grants to hire 30,000 teachers for the new school year -- 
a program approved by Congress with bipartisan support last year, 
when lawmakers were up for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Clinton said, ``unfortunately there are some in  
Congress who are backing away from their commitment to reduce class 
size'' by financing a total of 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a promise made in an election year should be kept in  
the years when there are no elections,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president answered questions for 74 minutes Friday at a news  
conference meant to showcase his commitment to domestic issues now 
that Kosovo is no longer a preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he is due to unveil a proposed Medicare prescription  
drug benefit, which aides will work through the weekend to 
finalize. 
</P>
<P>
	As for concerns about the billions of dollars his prescription  
benefit would cost, Clinton said, ``we should do it in a way that 
we're quite clear that it won't and can't break the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that he has been open since 1992 to the controversial  
idea of a means-testing requirement that links premium costs to 
beneficiaries' incomes for doctor visits and services. But The 
Washington Post reported today that Clinton has dropped that idea 
from the prescription plan in the face of strong opposition in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The president cracked jokes and laughed at times, but thumped  
the podium and wagged his finger at other moments. On questions 
about his moral leadership and what responsibility he personally 
bears for the Washington partisanship he so decried, he adopted a 
husky, profound tone of voice. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ``shattering effect'' of the high school shooting at  
Littleton, Colo., troubled Americans more than the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal and impeachment ordeal ever did. ``I think people are 
worried when they see ... the fabric of life still under great 
strain, in spite of the fact that we have quite a lot amount of 
prosperity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his legacy, ``I'll be remembered when I'm gone,'' said  
the second U.S. president ever to be impeached. ``Right now I'm not 
gone. I've got lots to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged what he characterized as a do-nothing GOP-run  
Congress to approve his proposals for Medicare, Social Security, 
gun control, education, child care and campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans pre-empted the president with a Friday morning  
appearance on the Capitol steps, showcasing their own priorities to 
bolster national security, improve education, cut taxes and 
safeguard the Social Security surplus for improving that program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the president: Please include tax relief in your  
agenda,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., joined by 
dozens of rank-and-file Republicans. 
</P>

the issue ``seriously'' but the Secret Service dictates much of her 
travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Lewinsky scandal will not hurt his wife's political  
ambitions or the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``All elections are about the future and all candidates are  
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American 
people know the country is in good shape.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Income Birth Center Gets Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with an infant mortality rate more than  
twice the national average, District of Columbia officials are 
turning to certified nurse midwives to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams and other city leaders will help dedicate  
a facility Monday that could offer prenatal care at 40 to 60 
percent less cost than current Medicaid rates. The city is 
contributing $785,000 to help establish the birthing center, but 
the effort is headed by a women's health advocate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prenatal care is in a state of some confusion in the district,  
and this is a novel approach,'' said Richard Monteilh, the director 
of the district's Department of Housing and Community Development.	   Ruth Lubic, who cofounded the Childbearing Center in the Morris 
Heights section of New York City's South Bronx in 1988, has spent 
the past five working to gain support and raise money for a similar 
facility in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the worst infant outcomes in the country and the  
Congress is here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a nearly $1.5 million renovation, a long-vacant  
supermarket will house not only a birthing center, but a well-baby 
clinic, and a child care facility. Job training and substance abuse 
services for women also will also be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for the neighborhood,'' said Bernard Richardson, the  
district's neighborhood commissioner for the area. ``We have a lot 
of young teenagers having kids who need the care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia's infant mortality rate is 14.9 deaths  
per 1,000 live births -- the worst in the nation. According to 
figures released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids Count 
survey, more than 14 percent of the babies born in the district are 
low birth-weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubic said other organizations are working to establish similar  
family service operations in Atlanta, Nashville and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The D.C. Developing Families Center will begin offering prenatal  
care through an agreement with Howard University Hospital by 
September. Within six months, women will also have the option of 
delivering at Howard.

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Presbyterian leaders have rejected a  
measure that could have led to the ordination of non-celibate gays 
and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual meeting of the 2.6-million-member Presbyterian  
Church (U.S.A), delegates decided 389 to 198 not to allow the 
church's regional governing bodies to vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the vote ends an attempt to strike a church rule that  
requires clergy to maintain ``fidelity within the covenant of 
marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That clause prohibits single non-celibate heterosexuals, gays  
and lesbians from being ministers. Because the church does not 
recognize homosexual marriages, gays and must remain celibate if 
they wish to be ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Stephen Moss of Salem, N.C., opposed the change in the  
church constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is also about not ordaining heterosexual sex outside the  
bounds of marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether sexually active homosexuals should lead within the  
church has been debated for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	David White, a youth advisory delegate from St. Augustine, Fla.,  
broke down in tears as he urged church members to try to amend the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to deal with it. We can't keep pushing it off,  
pushing it off. We can't discriminate no matter what,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Hurting Hip Forces Nicklaus Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- First he put aside his pride and rode a  
cart, yet the pain in his hip was just too much. The Bear could no 
longer bear it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, who used a cart in competition for the first time  
Friday, withdrew from the Senior Players Championship after nine 
holes of the third round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it's certainly not my choice,'' Nicklaus said.  
``I've always finished. But I felt like I could have caused too 
much damage today. When they start talking about nerves, that was 
what bothered me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who had hip-replacement surgery in January, rode all  
nine holes at the TPC of Michigan -- a course he designed. He said 
he decided to quit after the seventh hole, feeling something 
pinching a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the guys, `I'll finish nine with you, and that will be  
the easiest place for the transition,''' Nicklaus said. ``I think 
it's kind of foolish for me to go on and just aggravate something 
beyond what I should do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his discomfort, however, Nicklaus curled in a 12-foot  
putt for birdie on the ninth hole, giving him a 2-over-par 38 for 
the side. He had gone 71-74--145 during the first two rounds, 
heading into the third round nine strokes behind leader Graham 
Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it finally got to where I could not get into my left side  
hitting golf balls the last three or four holes,'' Nicklaus said. 
``It was about as much as I could handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus said he would return home and try to take it easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll be all right for the U.S. Senior Open (July  
8-11 in Des Moines),'' Nicklaus said of the event scheduled for 
July 8-11. ``I'll play it by ear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the third time in his long and distinguished career  
that Nicklaus has withdrawn from a tournament. The first was the 
1980 World Series of Golf, where he had to be carried from the 
practice area. A sore back also forced him from the 1983 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, returned to competition with a titanium left hip  
at the Senior Tour's Bell Atlantic Classic in May, four months 
after surgery at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston and played 
three rounds on a hilly course, the 6,961-yard Hartefeld National 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, he played at his Memorial Tournament in  
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, -- and made the cut. He 
also played in the U.S. Open -- where he missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I wanted to do, which was play the Memorial and the  
U.S. Open,'' Nicklaus said. ``I got through that, which was my 
goal. But I didn't realize that I'd pay a price for that, which I'm 
paying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus has won 18 majors, plus two U.S. Amateurs and 70 times  
he's finished in the top 10 in a major. He was granted an exemption 
into the Senior Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And, despite all that happened this week, he still was defiant  
about the use of carts in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never used a cart in a tournament, when a cart wasn't part  
of the rules,'' Nicklaus said. ``My position has not changed. I 
hate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was one of several golfers who spoke out against the  
court ruling that allowed Casey Martin to use a cart on the PGA 
Tour and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Carts have always been part of the scene on the Senior PGA tour,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senior Tour is the Senior Tour -- it's not the walking  
tour,'' Nicklaus said. ``It's the walking wounded, that's what it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should know.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pick Christensen Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ben Christensen apologized again to Anthony  
Molina on Saturday. It won't be the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, who hit Molina in the eye with a pitch while Molina  
was in the on-deck circle during warmups of a college game, 
addressed the media before Saturday's game between the Chicago Cubs 
and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs drafted Christensen in the first round and signed with  
the team on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen had requested the time to face the media, Cubs  
general manager Ed Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obviously a bad accident that happened and I feel  
horrible about it, that I could hurt somebody like that, so I can 
see how it can get to where it is now,'' Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people knew me, they'd know I'm not that kind of person who  
would do anything intentionally to hurt anybody. I've been brought 
up to respect people. If they knew me, they'd know it was an 
accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 23, Christensen was on the mound warming up for Wichita  
State's game against Molina's Evansville team. Molina was about 15 
feet away near an on-deck circle and Christensen threw a ball that 
hit Molina in the left eye. Christensen was allegedly upset that 
Molina was timing his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen was suspended and did not play the rest of the  
season. He was 9-1 in 11 starts for Wichita State and finished his 
collegiate career 21-1 with a 3.59 ERA in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of pending litigation, Christensen could not comment on  
any specifics of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll accept my consequences for what happened because that's  
what has to be done,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it will all get behind 
me and for him as well so we can get on with our lives. Hopefully 
it won't ruin me forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied Saturday by his parents, his agent and his  
girlfriend, the 21-year-old pitcher said he has sent Molina a 
letter apologizing for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina has not responded to the letter.  
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said the Cubs decision to draft Christensen does not  
legitimize or condone what the young pitcher did. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be consequences,'' Lynch said. ``The incident will  
not go unaddressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also will not change Christensen's approach at the plate. He  
said he's not afraid to throw inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to keep me from pitching in. You have to  
establish yourself on the mound and be aggressive,'' he said. ``You 
have to be able to do it to keep hitters off balance. I'm going to 
hit a guy. It's part of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen will report to the Cubs' rookie league team in Mesa  
on Tuesday, said scouting director Jim Hendry. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not thrown in a game since the incident April 23, but has  
stayed in shape throwing in scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready to start playing again,'' Christensen said.

<HEADLINE> FTC: Media Probe To Avoid Censorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Better self-regulation by the  
entertainment industry -- and not government censorship -- will 
improve efforts to shield children from harmful depictions of 
violence, said the head of the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, we will not judge the content of these  
products,'' Robert Pitofsky said Friday in a speech at a national 
convention of District Attorneys General. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not the modern embodiment of the thought police, and we  
don't want to be,'' Pitofsky said. ``Our goal is to work with -- not 
against -- the entertainment industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, President Clinton ordered the FTC and  
Justice Department to investigate whether -- and how -- the 
entertainment business markets violence to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million review is due in 18 months, but Pitofsky said he  
anticipates a report will be ready within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky said improved policing by entertainment companies of  
their own products is the goal. And he makes no apologies to 
critics who call that a ``cop out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen industry self-regulation work in industries as  
divergent in economic terms as the advertising industry and the 
funeral directors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for the study in the wake of a deadly spate of  
school shootings. He said children ``are being fed a dependable 
daily dose of violence'' that amounts to witnessing 40,000 deaths 
by their 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a barrage blurs the line between fantasy and reality  
violence for too many children, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Granholm, a prosecutor from Michigan, said she expects  
the study to find ``explicit marketing to children of extremely 
violent video games, movies, etc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She offered Pitofsky her state as a testing ground if a lawsuit  
is deemed necessary to stop such marketing.

<HEADLINE> 'Hoop Life' Set for Showtime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- So you thought the basketball season was  
finally over. Not on Showtime Networks, where you can spend the 
summer and much of next season following the on- and off-court 
antics of the New England Knights of the United Basketball 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England who of the United what?  
</P>
<P>
	The weekly dramatic series is called ``The Hoop Life,''  
brainchild of writer Sean Jablonski, and begins with a two-hour 
movie Sunday, July 4 at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	But send the kids out of the room if you don't want them to see  
female nudity or hear locker-room language. 
</P>
<P>
	These New England Knights couldn't be more dysfunctional if they  
had a starting lineup of five Dennis Rodmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players: Marvin Buxton (Mykelti Williamson), who blew  
the seventh game of the championship by brawling with a hated 
opponent; heartthrob Greg Marr (Rick Peters), a womanizer going 
through a messy divorce; high school sensation Curtis Thorpe 
(Cirroc Lofton), a rookie tryout plagued by his pushy 
uncle-manager. 
</P>
<P>
	There's trouble in the front office, too. A conglomerate has  
bought the Knights, the beleaguered coach (Dan Lauria) faces big 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the real coaches behind ``The Hoop Life'' are executive  
producer Joe Cacaci and Tom Fontana, partner in a producing company 
with director Barry Levinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were asked if they qualified as jocks.  
</P>
<P>
	Fontana laughed. ``The only sport I have done religiously is  
rowing. In my family, being an oarsman was a rite of passage into 
manhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to be a center on the Knicks; I was the only Italian  
center,'' Cacaci claimed unconvincingly. ``I played baseball mostly 
when I was a kid. I was 5 feet 8, so I didn't have much of a chance 
at basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casting ``The Hoop Life'' presented a challenge. The stars had  
to be professional actors as well as look credible on a basketball 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, who played Bubba in ``Forrest Gump'' and is 6 feet 3  
inches tall, ``was the only guy we went to and made an offer... . 
We knew he had played a little ball and knew his way around 
basketball courts,'' Cacaci said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other two lead players, Rick Peters and Cirroc Lofton,  
really stood out when we auditioned actors. One day I went to see 
Rick play at the Y in L.A. He had all his friends there to make him 
look good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cirroc, who plays the high school star who gets into the  
league early, is actually a phenomenal player. If he weren't 
acting, he'd be on the UCLA basketball team for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 6 feet 4 inches, Peters is half an inch taller than Lofton.  
</P>
<P>
	The company hired an Olympic basketball star, Sylvia Sweeney,  
who trains actors to play the game. She conducted a ``boot camp'' 
for the recruits, and she choreographs the court action. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of today's TV movies, ``The Hoop Life'' is filmed in  
Canada, where costs are lower. The show hires a semipro ice hockey 
arena in Toronto for the basketball scenes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Push Agendas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republicans squared off  
Saturday on issues they see as winning ones for the 2000 campaign: 
The president appealed to parents with his plan for more teachers 
and smaller classes while a popular governor touted GOP success at 
cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, broadcast while the president and  
his family spent the weekend at Camp David, Clinton announced $1.2 
billion in grants to hire 30,000 teachers for the new school year. 
Congress approved the program with bipartisan support last year, 
when lawmakers were up for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Clinton said, ``unfortunately there are some in  
Congress who are backing away from their commitment to reduce class 
size'' by financing a total of 100,000 new teachers. Clinton has 
asked Congress for a total of $12 billion over seven years to pay 
for those new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a promise made in an election year should be kept in  
the years when there are no elections,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In far too many of our schools, 30 or more students are  
pressed desk-to-desk in a single classroom,'' Clinton said. And 
teachers spend too much time maintaining order. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House  
Republican Conference, replied with a statement that did not 
directly address the teacher-hiring proposal, but said generally: 
``Republicans believe we should give parents and local school 
officials independence from federal mandates so that education 
dollars can be spent on students rather than wasted on abstract 
theories or heavy-handed Washington mandates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their formal radio rebuttal to the president's broadcast,  
Michigan Gov. John Engler spoke for Republicans, spotlighting 
efforts of the 31 GOP governors to cut taxes, improve education and 
streamline government. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the average American had to work until July 2 to  
cover taxes and the cost of government regulation, Engler said. He 
noted that the date this year fell on June 22, crediting Republican 
governors with shortening the time period by 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``And just as important, GOP governors are reforming welfare and  
fixing our public schools so taxpayers get more for their money, 
more families can escape poverty and more children can get a 
high-quality education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler also took a dig at the president's wife, Hillary, who is  
considering running for the Senate from New York, a state where 
Engler said Republican Gov. George Pataki has signed 36 tax cuts 
into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Governor Pataki puts it, New York has gotten so much better  
with Republican leadership, first lady Hillary Clinton is thinking 
of moving there,'' Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, when it comes to the 2000 election, it looked like  
Republican governors might be sticking with their own -- for now, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	When he taped his radio speech Friday, Engler changed a line in  
his prepared text -- promising governors would ``work hard to help 
elect a Republican president to help us get the job done'' -- to 
read: 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working hard to tell all Americans about the differences  
Republican governors are making in state after state.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Budget a Target for Pruning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blending the tactics of a presidential  
campaign with a marketing pitch out of corporate America, an 
alliance of business leaders is trying to reorder the federal 
budget to cut defense spending in favor of education, health care 
and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an unlikely mission for big business executives, easily  
labeled as part of the military-industrial complex that pushes 
defense budgets and benefits from weapons contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than 400 corporate leaders, retired military officers  
and former government officials have signed on with Business 
Leaders for Sensible Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not peaceniks,'' says Ben Cohen, the Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice  
cream man who is the president and the major donor to the 
organization. ``We are businessmen and military types.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizations bent on pruning defense spending are nothing new.  
And the debate about budget priorities between military and 
domestic needs has been going on for decades, especially the last 
one, since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	This debate claims to be different because it isn't coming at  
the issue from the left, although there certainly are liberals on 
its roster. Leaders of the group say that its members and support 
come from across the political spectrum, that even boardroom 
conservatives want to do something about defense spending they 
consider wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is different for the way it is trying to change minds,  
not by lobbying inside the Beltway but by campaigning outside. 
Cohen said the budget for that campaign will be $3 million this 
year, $6 million next. 
</P>
<P>
	And the first target is Iowa, where Cohen said there will be  
television ads comparable to those of the candidates competing for 
the opening caucuses of the 2000 campaign next winter. The group 
plans to spend about $800,000 to make its issue seen and heard 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the organization has six staffers in the state now.  
It also is going to be the scene of a showy bus tour, with street 
theater, music and giant, inflatable visual aids on the way federal 
money is being spent. And as an added attraction, free ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the organization is trying to market an issue  
instead of a product or a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Their case is that without a Cold War, the United States still  
has a Cold War defense budget. ``We are now, literally, in an arms 
race with ourselves,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their blueprint for changing that was drawn by Lawrence Korb, an  
assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, in an 
alternative budget that would cut Pentagon spending by $48 billion 
without, he says, diminishing needed capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress, and the administration, are going in the opposite  
direction, increasing defense spending. The House has just approved 
nearly $290 billion for defense next year. That's $1.4 billion more 
than the increased budget President Clinton recommended. There's 
more to come for peacekeeping forces in Kosovo -- $1.5 billion to $2 
billion a year by administration estimate, twice that according to 
outside analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's defense budget seeks an increase of $112 billion over  
the next five years, to $319 billion in 2005. Republicans in 
Congress said it wasn't enough. And that was before the bombing 
campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not a promising setting for another effort to reduce  
Pentagon spending. But the leaders of Business Leaders for Sensible 
Priorities say theirs is not just another effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Their backing, background and techniques make this one  
different, they say. They believe they can put their issue on the 
public agenda, using professional market research, paid 
advertising, public relations and other corporate tools to mobilize 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	To do all that, they are going to have to create a market. There  
is no sign now of a national mood favoring defense cuts. When 
Clinton proposed increasing the defense budget, the polls found 
that a majority agreed with him. Cuts aren't a topic in the 2000 
presidential campaign; increases are.

<HEADLINE> Jimenez No-Hits the Diamondbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Comedian Bill Dana built his act around a  
laughable loser called Jose Jimenez. Baseball's Jose Jimenez hadn't 
fared so well, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Friday night, when Jimenez pitched a no-hitter and beat  
Randy Johnson at his best. After the St. Louis Cardinals' 1-0 
victory over Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks, nobody is 
laughing at the 25-year-old Dominican right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think next start I'll forget what I did,'' Jimenez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fat chance. Jimenez (4-7) pitched the first Cardinal no-hitter  
in 16 years and the first by a St. Louis rookie since Paul Dean did 
in the nightcap of a doubleheader on Sept. 21, 1934. Paul's brother 
Dizzy pitched a three-hitter in the opener, then said afterward 
that ``If I'd known Paul was going to throw a no-hitter, I'd have 
thrown one too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rare is the day that great pitching is the story for the 1999  
Cardinals. In fact, pitching, or lack of it, is a big reason the 
Cardinals aren't contenders, despite a powerful offense centered 
around Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The big crowd showed up early Friday to watch McGwire slam a few  
into the seats in batting practice, then saw an old-fashioned 
pitching duel as good as any you'll find. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need Big Mac to hit a home run,'' catcher Alberto  
Castillo said in the heady aftermath of Friday night's victory. 
``We are a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one night anyway, it was true.  
</P>
<P>
	With his array of sliders, curves and changeups and his  
unflappable cool, Jimenez showed why the Cardinals consider him so 
important to their future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came from Double-A a year ago,'' manager Tony La Russa  
said. ``You watched him tonight. Did he look like he was rattled?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Johnson at his overpowering best, striking out 14 to  
reach 2,500 for his career, Jimenez never cracked. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jimenez seemed calm on the outside, he was never too  
confident, not with Johnson mowing down the opposition in what was 
a scoreless tie until St. Louis broke through with a run in the 
ninth, when Thomas Howard broke his bat on Johnson's 96-mph 
fastball but got the ball to drop in for an RBI single in left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I couldn't lose it, that they couldn't take it  
away,'' Jimenez said, ``until the 27th out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He struck out eight, walked two and hit a batter. Only one  
runner got as far as second base. Speedy leadoff hitter Tony Womack 
was the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez said he felt ``a little terror'' when Womack stepped to  
the plate that last time. ``I said, `I'm going to keep the ball 
low. I just need a ground ball. I don't need a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack hit the ball harmlessly to second baseman Joe McEwing,  
who tossed it to McGwire for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Jimenez, who turns 26 on July 7, was just 18 years  
old when he signed with the Cardinals. He played three seasons in 
the Dominican Summer League, one year in rookie ball and another in 
Class A. 
</P>
<P>
	His breakthrough season came last year, when he was 15-6 with  
Double-A Arkansas, including a no-hitter against Shreveport, and 
was named the Texas League pitcher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Called up by the Cardinals late last season, Jimenez was 3-0  
with a 2.95 ERA. In his first three starts this year, he was 2-0 
with a 2.95 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The success may have been too much, too soon, La Russa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez went into a tailspin. He lost seven in a row before  
getting the victory in a 3-2 win over Montreal on June 15. In his 
last 11 starts, the Cardinals had lost 10 times. He was tied for 
the NL lead in earned runs allowed with 60. In those last 11 
starts, his ERA was an ugly 8.04. The worst came on May 25, when he 
lost to the San Francisco Giants 17-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cardinals knew he had the tools to succeed, La Russa  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has Kevin Brown-type movement,'' the manager said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, who lead the National League in batting  
average, runs, hits and home runs, had to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``He frustrated a lot of hitters,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	La Russa gave much of the credit to catcher Alberto Castillo for  
calling pitches that kept the Diamondbacks guessing, usually wrong. 
And to Eric Davis, who made two sensational catches in right field, 
despite a seriously sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had been part of one other no-hitter in his career, Tom  
Browning's perfect game for Cincinnati in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	As the celebration wound down in the visitor's clubhouse at Bank  
One Ballpark, the Cardinals watched highlights of the game being 
shown on ESPN. Davis, who has battled back from cancer, who knows 
how to cherish those rare moments like Friday night, looked up and 
saw himself make the diving grab of David Dellucci's soft liner in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nice catch,'' Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Everybody laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Down the hall in the interview room, though, Castillo was  
reminding everyone this was just one game in a sport where there's 
almost always another game tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight Jose was the man,'' Castillo said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``Jose has a long way to go to learn how to  
pitch.''

<HEADLINE> China 3, Australia 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Sun Wen scored twice to move into a  
tie for the overall goal-scoring lead in the Women's World Cup and 
China completed a perfect first round with a 3-1 victory over 
shorthanded Australia on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ying also scored as China went undefeated in winning Group  
D, outscoring opponents 12-2 in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia (0-2-1) was at a disadvantage almost the entire game  
as forward Alicia Ferguson received a somewhat questionable red 
card from United States referee Sandra Hunt in the second minute 
for a late sliding tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	The elimination of Australia from the World Cup means that one  
of the eight quarterfinals will not get an invitation to the 2000 
Olympics. As the host for the Summer Games, Australia automatically 
gets a spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The other seven spots in the eight-team field will go to the  
four winning quarterfinalists and the three teams that lose by the 
lowest margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, whose five goals ties Sissi of Brazil for the scoring lead  
in the tournament, gave China the lead in the 39th minute with a 
header right in front of goalkeeper Belinda Kitching, who was 
outstanding in defeat. Zhao Lihong set up the tally with a no-look 
crossing pass from the left corner that found Sun in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Six minutes into the second half, Sun increased China's lead to  
2-0 with a blast from in close. Zhao also started that play with a 
cross from the left side that went a little too far. Pu Wei got the 
ball near the goalline and sent it back in front to Sun for a shot 
against a defenseless Kitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia ended a 253-minute shutout streak by China goalkeeper  
Gao Hong when Cheryl Salisbury scored in the 66th minute. She 
chested a pass down in the penalty area and powered a shot through 
Gao's fingertips with the ball just getting over the goalline. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu closed out the scoring in the 73rd minute with a hard shot  
that deflected past Kitching off an Australian defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitching was spectacular in the opening half stopping Jin Yan  
twice in the box on point blank shots. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 29,401 fans attended the doubleheader at Giants  
Stadium. Russia beat Canada 4-1 in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was the largest crowd at this World Cup for a game not  
involving the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it was a far cry from the 78,792 who came here last  
week to see the United States play Denmark in the World Cup opener. 
That was the largest crowd to see a women's sports event in the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Makes Splash at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson, probably the  
least known of the American women making a splash at Wimbledon this 
year, is ready to start making a name for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old from San Diego upset No. 11 Julie Halard-Decugis  
6-3, 6-3 Saturday to reach the fourth round in her Wimbledon debut, 
winning 12 of her last 13 matches on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``My serve was the big key because my goal in this match was to  
hold my serve,'' she said after the victory. ``I stayed really 
focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, who has just announced she will turn pro, entered  
Wimbledon as an amateur and is ineligible for prize money. But that 
doesn't mean she won't try to win the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I have a goal to win this tournament,'' Stevenson said  
after her latest victory. ``Actually, I set the goal when I was 
nine to win Wimbledon at the age of 19, so ... it'll be really cool 
if I beat my goal by a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager has had the kind of coaching needed to meet that  
goal, the type of guidance young players only dream of. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Budge and Tracy Austin have worked with her, and so has Pete  
Sampras' sister, Stella. She received a lesson on how to hit a 
one-handed backhand from 1932 Wimbledon champ Ellsworth Vines. 
Bobby Riggs once put hundred-dollar bills under cones on the court, 
and challenged her by saying she would get the money if she knocked 
the cone over with her serve. 
</P>
<P>
	She works now with Craig Kardon, who guided Martina Navratilova  
until her retirement, and it's all paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	But life is so full for Stevenson that you wonder how she's ever  
found time for tennis. She's taken ballet, tap and jazz dance 
lessons since the age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
	She takes gospel singing lessons, and sang and danced in her  
high school's production of ``Guys and Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	And while many players spend hours on tour watching soaps or  
wandering the shopping malls, Stevenson wrote a play for her drama 
class. 
</P>
<P>
	She graduated from high school on May 28 and was on a plane to  
England the next day, reaching the quarterfinals in a Wimbledon 
grass-court warmup three weeks ago in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson dreams of attending Yale's School of Drama when her  
tennis career is over, but she is putting off that college 
education for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to college any more. I want to go later in  
my career, maybe when I'm 30 or 35 but not right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is tennis that has opened up a whole new world.  
</P>
<P>
	``You travel everywhere and I'm very excited I get to go to  
cities I've never been to,'' she said. ``It's a great life.''

<HEADLINE> Wittman Interviews For Cavs' Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves assistant coach Randy  
Wittman returned Saturday for a second interview for the Cleveland 
Cavaliers' head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the second candidate invited back for a follow-up  
interview. Former Charlotte coach Dave Cowens had a second 
interview on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, a Minnesota assistant for the past six years, told  
WOIO-TV in an airport interview that he was excited to get a second 
interview because it means he's still in the running to replace 
Mike Fratello, who was fired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I've been waiting for since I retired as a  
player seven years ago,'' Wittman said. ``Whatever happens, it's 
really good experience for me. I've learned a lot in this process. 
It's exciting to have this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others believes to have had initial interviews with the Cavs  
include former Lakers coach Del Harris and former Notre Dame and 
NBA coach John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Cavaliers, who have largely conducted the  
coaching search in secret, could not be reached for comment 
Saturday night. A message seeking comment was left at team offices.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just before their Women's World Cup opener against Denmark last  
weekend, the married U.S. players were told by a FIFA official to 
take off their wedding rings. That was one battle the international 
organizing body for soccer was going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This FIFA guy was having a cow about our rings and told us we  
had to take them all off before we could go on the field,'' 
co-captain Julie Foudy said Saturday. ``That's a joke. The men have 
all these chains they wear when they play, and in international 
friendlies, we can wear jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we stood in the tunnel and just kept smiling as he talked  
and nodded and said, `OK.' I looked over at Mich (Michelle Akers) 
and we said to each other, `We're not taking them off.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess, theoretically, they could do something.''  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, another FIFA official came along and said it was fine  
for the women to keep their wedding rings on. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO SUPPORT:* Oleg Lapshin, the president of the Russian women's  
soccer association, had a short response when asked about the 
popularity of women's soccer in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very weak support, quite frankly,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, Lapshin noted that Russia has a professional  
women's league that includes eight teams, from which most of 
Russia's national players are picked. 
</P>
<P>
	That should offer some ammunition for those who support  
establishing a professional league in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT:* When the U.S. women's team arrived in  
Boston on Friday, it was greeted by, of all things, a marching 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine that!'' Sara Whalen said. ``It's out of  
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few weeks ago, people didn't even know about us. Now, we're  
met by marching bands at the airport. The attention has been out of 
this world to me. It's great reaching out for the population and 
having this kind of response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's practice session at Babson College in Wellesley,  
Mass., a suburb of Boston, was attended by about 300 fans, even 
though the workout was not publicized. 
</P>
<P>
	``How great is this?'' said Whelan, who made her World Cup debut  
as a substitute in Thursday's 7-1 win over Nigeria. ``We did not 
expect it to be like this, with sellouts at the games and big 
crowds coming to our practices. It says a lot about women's 
soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOURING THE USA:* In the old days, seeded teams in a World Cup  
had the advantage of staying in the same city. The others had to 
travel. Now, everybody has to travel, some much more than others. 
</P>
<P>
	China isn't happy about having to criss-cross the United States  
twice, and Russia now will have to do it three times -- five times 
if it reaches the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, our No. 1 opponent was the heat,'' Russian coach Yurii  
Bystritzkii said after his team played in 88-degree weather and 65 
percent humidity Saturday in a 4-1 victory over Canada at Giants 
Stadium. ``The second was having to travel on a tight schedule, to 
put it mildly. We checked the schedules and Russia has the most 
disadvantageous position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia started out in Foxboro, Mass., for its opener against  
Sweden, flew to Portland, Ore., for a game against Japan, then came 
back to the East Coast for its game Saturday in East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a quarterfinal date on Wednesday against China, Sweden or  
Ghana, in San Jose, Calif. If it wins there, it would have to go 
back to the East Coast one more time for a semifinal in Foxboro, 
and then back to Pasadena, Calif., for the title game or 
third-place match.

<HEADLINE> SunJet Unexpectedly Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- The discount travel service SunJet  
International canceled all its flights without explanation, leaving 
ticket-holders without rides to a half-dozen cities. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message on SunJet's toll-free telephone line Saturday  
said it also was no longer taking reservations and promised 
would-be passengers a refund within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Web site still advertised charter flights  
connecting Detroit and Newark, N.J., and connecting Newark with the 
Florida cities of Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa-St. Petersburg 
and West Palm Beach for fares starting at $79. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, operated as a public charter by World Technology  
Systems, had arranged flights connecting the cities since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from the company on the cause of the  
cancellation, its financial status or how many passengers had been 
booked when the shutdown was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated calls to SunJet's headquarters in Smyrna, an Atlanta  
suburb, were not returned Friday or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people showed up Friday morning at Fort  
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for a $79 flight to 
Newark. They were twice told the flight would be delayed, and late 
in the afternoon a sign was posted saying all flights had been 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration had no information on  
SunJet, said spokeswoman Katherine Creedy. She said her agency 
monitors airlines, but not charter travel companies such as SunJet.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law To Expire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side-by-side in rare harmonious agreement,  
President Clinton, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and Congress 
will watch the law that led to a presidential impeachment disappear 
on Wednesday into the dust bin of history. 
</P>
<P>
	The law's political and legislative legacy will live on for  
years, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the nation's second impeached president, still has 18  
months left in his term. Starr's investigation continues. The 
debate on Capitol Hill over who should investigate future charges 
against senior government officials is unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	After 21 years, nearly as many independent counsel  
investigations, and white-hot hostilities over Clinton's 
impeachment trial, lawmakers are not inclined to plunge into that 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Congress decides, Justice Department investigators will  
look into any such charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment is too politically complicated,'' said one of  
the law's original sponsors, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists the government cannot be trusted to investigate  
itself. Nonetheless, he acknowledged in a recent interview, ``We 
need to give it a bit of a rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's unprecedented five-year investigation united otherwise  
fierce political enemies in the notion that the law that empowered 
Starr is fatally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr stunned lawmakers of both parties in April when he adopted  
even his staunchest enemies' disdain for the statute. He blamed 
public outrage over his tactics on the structure of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``If politicization and the loss of public confidence are  
inevitable, then we should leave the full responsibility where our 
laws and traditions place it, on the attorney general,'' he said. 
The statute, he added, was ``constitutionally dubious'' and left 
room for abuse by counsels empowered by it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had been making that case for years, particularly  
during Lawrence Walsh's investigation of charges that the Reagan 
White House sold arms to Iran and diverted the proceeds to the 
Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Starr's $50 million investigation of Clinton, which  
moved from the president's land dealings to his statements under 
oath about an affair with Monica Lewinsky, that convinced 
Democrats, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I voted for it. I made a mistake,'' the Senate's top Democrat,  
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told reporters last week. ``I believe 
it was well-intended, but misguided. I would much prefer to handle 
(these) matters in the future within the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers complain the law does not hold such prosecutors  
accountable for the money they spend or the tactics they use, 
providing no politically practical way to fire overzealous 
counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of an independent counsel law, such  
investigations will revert to the Justice Department, where they 
were handled when the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	That night in October 1973, Justice's top two officials lost  
their jobs when they refused to carry out President Nixon's order 
to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the 
Watergate break-in. Attorney General Elliot Richardson quit and 
Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was fired. Solicitor 
General Robert Bork fired Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Jaworski was appointed Nov. 1 to replace Cox as special  
prosecutor. Four months later, an indictment was returned against 
seven former presidential aides in connection with the Watergate 
cover-up. Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials say that experience shows the  
country does not need the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a lonely band of senators, that experience shows  
the government cannot be trusted to investigate itself. Led by 
Levin, they are searching for a way to enact another independent 
counsel law that limits the scope and budget of future prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overwhelming majority of lawmakers believes the Saturday  
Night Massacre proved the system set up by the Constitution does 
work; Nixon, after all, resigned under threat of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,  
Republican Fred Thompson of Tennessee, plans to introduce 
legislation that would put such investigations under the Justice 
Department and require the Attorney General to get congressional 
approval to hire and fire special prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., has introduced a similar measure in  
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levin and the other senators insist there must be a way to  
write a law that prevents abuses. These lawmakers are not as 
certain, however, that such a bill would gain support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no illusions about this being an uphill battle,'' said  
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of two Republicans pushing to introduce legislation  
to modify the independent counsel law before it expires Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There does not seem to be any interest from our leaders to try  
to reform the law, and there seems to be no interest on the 
Democratic side either.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO, Russia Planes Land in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Russian jet carrying paratroopers  
and airport technicians touched down at Pristina's airport today, 
the first airplane to land in Kosovo since NATO began its 
peacekeeping mission two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was followed moments later by a French transport carrying  
equipment to help make the airport fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 Russian paratroopers and 18 technicians will join about  
200 Russian troops who seized the airport June 12 after traveling 
overland from Bosnia, beating NATO into Kosovo by hours and forcing 
protracted negotiations on Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all part of bringing Kosovo back to normality and the  
better future that we all hope for all the people of Kosovo,'' said 
British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, the NATO commander in Kosovo, as he 
welcomed the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, who led the Russian land convoy onto  
the airfield two weeks ago, said the day marked ``the start of the 
air bridge which will serve in the future as a delivery point for 
all the things we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia plans to send about 3,600 peacekeepers to Kosovo to serve  
alongside a NATO-led force that eventually will include 55,000 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians will join a peacekeeping mission that so far has  
been unable to curb unrest sweeping the province. Ethnic Albanians 
have been seeking revenge for atrocities committed by Serb-led 
Yugoslav forces since President Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on 
Kosovo separatists in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, had demanded its own zone  
of control within Kosovo. That was firmly rejected by NATO, which 
worried it would lead to a partition of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a compromise was reached in which the Russians will be  
deployed in separate zones within three areas assigned to U.S., 
German and French peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes that arrived today are the first of 12 flights -- six  
Russian and six NATO -- expected at Pristina's Slatina Airport over 
the next 10 days, NATO spokesman Jan Joosten said. The transports 
will bring technicians and equipment to make the airport fully 
operational for flights to ferry in humanitarian supplies and 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, potential violence was narrowly averted this morning  
in the northern mining town of Kosovska Mitrovica when the leader 
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, persuaded about 
500 ethnic Albanians to call off a march into the Serb-held part of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to solve our problems peacefully,'' Thaci said. He was  
accompanied by the U.N. special envoy for Kosovo, Sergio Vieiria de 
Mello, who said the march ``would be a disaster'' if it proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is divided by a bridge between areas now held by Serbs  
and ethnic Albanians. Some of the would-be marchers today said they 
had been forced from their homes and a hospital in the Serb-held 
area. Thaci and de Mello said they hoped to resolve the impasse 
through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, gunmen opened fire on a U.S. Marine outpost near  
the center of Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo. The Marines returned 
fire and called for reinforcements, who found one wounded gunman 
nearby. He later died, according to the U.S. European Command. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second sniper attack this week against the Marines,  
who killed one Serb and wounded two others in a gunbattle 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also reported more widespread looting in Pristina,  
primarily of Serb-owned shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Looters ``know we can't be all over the place, but that will  
change,'' Joosten said. ``We have stepped up the number of 
patrols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called a meeting  
next week to find ways to bolster the NATO operation. Only half the 
NATO peacekeepers have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the permanent personnel who are going to administer  
and carry out the mission,'' Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethnic Albanians have been openly vengeful since a peace  
agreement ended the Yugoslav crackdown this month and forced 
Serbian troops and police to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They burned my house, so I don't care about this one,''  
Mohammed Azemi said as he stood near a blazing house in the village 
of Belo Polje. ``I'm happy in some way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pec, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church in medieval  
times, weeping Serbs abandoned the city, alleging that they were 
being chased out by ethnic Albanians. Of hundreds who had taken 
refuge in a church complex, only about 50 remained Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Veriq, Ymer Delija looted lumber, hoses and  
mirrors from a Serb house. He said Serbs killed his wife and three 
of his four children last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a kind of revenge. I burned two or three already,'' he  
said. ``That's enough for today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the main hospital in Pristina, the provincial capital, 247  
Kalashnikov automatic rifles have been seized in the past few days, 
according to Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse and guard were wounded Thursday when a patient being  
treated for a gunshot wound opened fire when he saw his alleged 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute between Serb and Albanian doctors over who should  
control the Pristina hospital deteriorated after reports that the 
chief Serb physician had been killed, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Human Rights Watch said a one-week investigation  
indicated Kosovo Liberation Army members were involved in the 
murders, rape and other abuses of Serbs and Roma, also known as 
Gypsies. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch said there was insufficient evidence to  
accuse the KLA leadership of orchestrating the attacks, but urged 
rebel commanders to discipline its ranks and punish offenders.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The party headed by a former military  
leader chose a former presidential candidate on Saturday to make a 
second run in the Nov. 7 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, a 47-year-old attorney, was chosen at  
a Guatemalan Republican Front assembly presided over by retired 
Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who took power in a March 1982 coup and was 
overthrown in another coup in August 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The Front is the first party to choose a candidate for the  
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios Montt's efforts to win election as president have been  
blocked by a constitutional clause against former coup leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo vowed to review the privatization of state companies  
and ``prosecute those responsible'' for any irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's sale of the state telephone and electrical  
companies have been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Portillo was the Front's candidate in the 1995 elections, which  
were won by Alvaro Arzu of the National Advance Party. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate wins 51 percent of the vote on Nov. 7, a second  
round between the top two finishers would be held on Dec. 26.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A woman regarded as Mexico's most colorful  
politician said she will quit an opposition party to support a 
ruling party candidate for president, newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Irma Serrano, who has been among the most ferocious critics  
of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was 
quoted as saying she was ``disappointed'' with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
leader of her Democratic Revolution Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported that she will join the PRI to support the  
presidential campaign of former Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cardenas has changed and has taken a weak and fearful attitude  
to the system,'' she was quoted as saying by the daily Cronica. ``I 
am going to fight alongside those who do not fear the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano, a former actress and singer known as The Tigress, also  
is famous as the former mistress of several prominent politicians, 
including former President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and  
television executive Wendi Deng were married aboard his yacht in 
New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-two guests attended the private ceremony Friday evening  
aboard ``Morning Glory,'' which left from Chelsea Piers as a string 
ensemble played Mozart. The couple were married by state Supreme 
Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guests were family members and friends including  
Michael Milken and Russian entrepreneur Boris Berezovsky. Welsh 
singing prodigy Charlotte Church performed three songs at the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's divorce from his second wife, Anna, was finalized June  
8, ending their 32-year marriage. Details of the settlement were 
not disclosed, but in a joint statement the couple described the 
agreement as amicable, and said management of Murdoch's media

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Norway lost captain Linda Medalen to a broken  
nose early in the match. That didn't slow the defending champions 
one bit Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians scored three first-half goals and rolled to a 4-0  
victory over Japan to stay unbeaten through three games of the 
women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Unni Lehn had two assists and was responsible for Norway's  
second goal when her shot went off Japan's Hiromo Isozaki and into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate the victory, Norway's players raced around the  
soggy turf and did belly flops and bowed for the fans who were left 
at rainy Soldier Field. Attendance for the doubleheader was 34,256. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway will face Sweden, a 2-0 winner Saturday over Ghana, in  
Wednesday's quarterfinals at San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway got started early as Hege Riise scored on a penalty kick  
in the eighth minute after teammate Monica Knudsen was taken down 
in the penalty area by Isozaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes later, Medalen, once a big-time scorer who is now a  
tough defender, had to leave the game after butting heads with a 
Japanese player as they positioned for a header. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 2-0 when Lehn's shot from the right side went off Isozaki  
and deflected into the goal in the 26th minute. The lead increased 
when Lehn lobbed a shot into the box where Ann Kristin Aarones 
stopped the ball, let it drop and then beat goalie Nozomi Yamago in 
the 36th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagny Mellgren's header from Lehn's pass gave Norway a 4-0 lead  
in the 61st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan was 0-2-1 in Group C competition.

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians Reject Gay Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Presbyterian leaders have rejected a  
measure that could have led to the ordination of non-celibate gays 
and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual meeting of the 2.6-million-member Presbyterian  
Church (U.S.A), delegates decided 389 to 198 not to allow the 
church's regional governing bodies to vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the vote ends an attempt to strike a church rule that  
requires clergy to maintain ``fidelity within the covenant of 
marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That clause prohibits single non-celibate heterosexuals, gays  
and lesbians from being ministers. Because the church does not 
recognize homosexual marriages, gays and must remain celibate if 
they wish to be ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Stephen Moss of Salem, N.C., opposed the change in the  
church constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is also about not ordaining heterosexual sex outside the  
bounds of marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether sexually active homosexuals should lead within the  
church has been debated for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	David White, a youth advisory delegate from St. Augustine, Fla.,  
broke down in tears as he urged church members to try to amend the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to deal with it. We can't keep pushing it off,  
pushing it off. We can't discriminate no matter what,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Security Upgraded at 6 US Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All six U.S. embassies in Africa closed  
because of terrorism concerns received security upgrades after the 
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the 
State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassies in Gambia, Togo, Madagascar, Liberia, Namibia and  
Senegal were temporarily closed Thursday after suspicious 
individuals had conducted surveillance at the site, the State 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	American embassies worldwide are on heightened alert due to  
increased security concerns, including U.S. intelligence suspicions 
that Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire, was in the final 
stages of planning a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a pattern of activity indicating continued  
planning for terrorist attacks by members of Osama bin Laden's 
network,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``And we 
take reporting of such threats seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision will be made over the weekend on whether to reopen  
the six shuttered embassies in Africa on Monday, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, who is on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list, is accused  
of masterminding the Aug. 7, 1998, attacks on the U.S. embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania, which killed a total of 224 people, including 
12 Americans. He and nine of 15 suspects on trial in New York 
remain fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bombing anniversary on the horizon, U.S. officials are  
stepping up vigilance, although some critics say security 
precautions have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you close six embassies in a region in the world, you  
send a message to the world that not only have the terrorists made 
us blink but we have written off a large number of people in a part 
of the world,'' said Harvey Kushner, chairman of the Criminal 
Justice Department at Long Island University's C.W. Post campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the twin bombings, security at many U.S. embassies  
worldwide, including the six in Africa, has been improved by adding 
physical barriers, installing video cameras and building walls, 
fences and barricades, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of local guards has increased and embassies have  
worked with the host countries to close streets or change traffic 
patterns. Property surrounding embassies was acquired in some 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The State department has added 140 special security agent jobs  
overseas and temporarily sent hundreds of diplomatic security 
officers to foreign posts. U.S. officials also are moving to hire 
and train 200 new diplomatic security agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, all of the closed embassies -- except in Banjul,  
Gambia, and Windhoek, Namibia -- received security upgrades in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission chaired by retired Adm. Bobby Inman recommended  
better embassy protection after bombings at embassy sites in Beirut 
and Kuwait in 1983 and 1984 that killed a total of more than three 
dozen Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Gambia, the embassy is a cultural center and the residence  
of the U.S. ambassador. It is located in Fajara, a suburb of the 
capital, Bajul. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Togo, the embassy is located at an intersection. A guard  
stationed outside its gates said already tight security had not 
been beefed up. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the Senegalese capital of Dakar, the embassy is located in a  
bustling downtown. Gendarmes cordoned off three streets surrounding 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	American embassies have been closed before in response to  
terrorist threats or concerns they might be targeted. Most U.S. 
embassies in sub-Saharan Africa were ordered closed for two days in 
December, following U.S. military strikes on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., urged Congress to  
complete action on the State Department appropriations bill that 
provides $583.5 million to improve embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg, chairman of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, added  
$105 million in security money to the administration's request for 
embassies. ``The sudden closing of six U.S. embassies in Africa 
yesterday underscores the need to improve security overseas for our 
personnel and facilities,'' he said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Player Sought for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Wash. (AP) -- Anthony Simmons, the Seattle Seahawks'  
first-round draft pick last year, has been accused of assault, 
battery and outrage and is being sought after failing to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint against Simmons, a 6-foot-1, 230-pound linebacker  
from Spartanburg, S.C., and three-time All-American at Clemson, was 
filed Friday in King County Superior Court by Vernetta Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Simmons said he was acting on a  
dare by friends when he ``grabbed her throat with one hand and he 
grabbed her crotch with his other hand'' on April 1 at H.D. 
Hotspurs, a nightclub in the Seattle suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with fourth-degree assault but failed to appear  
for arraignment May 28 in Municipal Court. On June 2, a Municipal 
Court judge issued a warrant for Simmons' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, 23, who has a 6-year-old daughter, appeared in 12 games  
in his rookie season last year but was hampered by knee injuries. 
His best performance was Dec. 6, when he started against the New 
York Jets, intercepted a pass and returned it 36 yards for a 
touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Gov. Praises GOP Colleagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The average American worked 173 days this  
year to cover the cost of taxes and government regulation, but 
Republican governors are reducing that burden, Michigan Gov. John 
Engler said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler used the Republican Party's weekly radio address to  
praise the efforts of the 31 GOP governors to cut taxes and improve 
education and government. 
</P>
<P>
	``My colleagues ... are cutting taxes and reducing the size of  
government,'' Engler said in the address, taped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And just as important, GOP governors are reforming welfare and  
fixing our public schools so taxpayers get more for their money, 
more families can escape poverty and more children can get a 
high-quality education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the average American had to work until July 2 to  
cover taxes and the cost of government regulation, Engler said. He 
noted that the date this year fell on June 22, crediting Republican 
governors with shortening the time period by 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler also took a dig at President Clinton's wife, Hillary, who  
is considering running as Democratic candidate for the Senate from 
New York, a state where Engler said Republican Gov. George Pataki 
has signed 36 tax cuts into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Governor Pataki puts it, New York has gotten so much better  
with Republican leadership, first lady Hillary Clinton is thinking 
of moving there,'' Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among GOP successes, Engler mentioned the income and business  
tax cuts he has pushed through in Michigan this year, as well as an 
income tax cut promoted by Colorado Gov. Bill Owens and a phase-out 
of the Virginia personal property tax by Gov. Jim Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler also boasted of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's efforts to set  
higher education standards for students and teachers, and praised 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's efforts to boost teacher salaries and 
set up an early intervention program to make sure all children 
become good readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether the issue is fixing our children's schools, fighting  
crime or facing down the special interests who want to grow 
government, Republican governors are making a difference in the 
lives of average American families,'' Engler said.

<HEADLINE> Boxer 'Bonecrusher' Smith Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUIES CREEK, N.C. (AP) -- James ``Bonecrusher'' Smith will  
announce his retirement because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old Smith dislocated his right shoulder in a bout  
with Joe Bugner in Australia on July 4, 1998, and had to stop the 
fight after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	He once again encountered shoulder problems in his Legends of  
Boxing heavyweight bout against Larry Holmes in Fayetteville on 
June 18, and finally signaled his corner to halt the fight two 
minutes into the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the shoulder checked at the hospital the day after the  
fight and it wasn't dislocated,'' Smith said. ``It was very 
painful, and they said it would probably be a recurring 
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has announced his retirement before but this is the first  
time such a decision has been based on physical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to continue as a consultant to Legends of Boxing,''  
Smith said. ``The next time they have a news conference, I will 
make a formal announcement about my retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has a career record of 43-16-1 with 31 knockouts. He  
stopped Tim Witherspoon in the first round at Madison Square Garden 
on Dec. 12, 1986, for the WBA title.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Broadcaster To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs radio broadcaster Ron Santo will  
undergo heart bypass surgery Monday at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital in Chicago, team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former third baseman for the Cubs suffered a mild heart  
attack last Monday and admitted himself into a Denver hospital. He 
was in Colorado to broadcast the Cubs' three-game series with the 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Chicago on Thursday, Santos has been  
receiving treatment at Northwestern Memorial. It was unclear 
whether Santo would remain in the hospital over the weekend, a Cubs 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman referred all questions about Santo to the  
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, a nine-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove winner,  
became the team's radio announcer 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, has a history of diabetes and recently underwent an  
angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one artery. 
</P>
<P>
	While Santo recovers, his commentator's job in the radio booth  
is being handled by Randy Hundley, Santo's former teammate on the 
Cubs.

<HEADLINE> Some Top Prospects for NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Top players in Wednesday's NBA draft, by position:  
</P>
<P>
                             *Centers    	
</P>
<P>
	--Aleksandar Radojevic, 7-foot-3, Barton (Kan.) CC. A true  
project who would have benefited from a season or two at Ohio 
State, but the NCAA ruled him ineligible. He'll be spending a lot 
of time in the weight room and in one-on-one teaching situations in 
the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Todd MacCulloch, 7-0, Washington. The Canadian native led the  
nation in field goal percentage the last three seasons, finishing 
at 66 percent for his career. Obviously, solid down low; his open 
court speed is his biggest detriment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Calvin Booth, 6-11, Penn State. A true shot-blocker who led the  
Big Ten at 3.5 per game last season. Has long arms, and his great 
patience kept him out of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Power Forwards    	
</P>
<P>
	--Elton Brand, 6-8, Duke. The consensus national player of the  
year can cause matchup problems with his strength down low and an 
impressive offensive arsenal that includes a very solid jump shot. 
If he continues to improve as he did in his two years at Duke he 
could be a star in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jonathan Bender, 6-11, Picayune, Miss. He made a name for  
himself by breaking Michael Jordan's scoring record in the 
McDonald's All-America game, but he has a lot more to offer. Scouts 
praise his defense as well as his offense, which includes a solid 
jump shot. He may end the run of high school players who didn't get 
much run. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lee Nailon, 6-9, Texas Christian. Pulled his name out of the  
draft last year and returned to school but didn't have a great 
senior season. Still, he's a good scorer in the post, and having 
played for Billy Tubbs he is comfortable in an uptempo offense. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Small Forwards    	
</P>
<P>
	--Lamar Odom, 6-10, Rhode Island. One college season was enough  
to see how talented and versatile this New York native is. He may 
start his pro career as a small forward, but his skills point 
toward a long future at shooting guard and plenty of time at the 
point as well. His ``I'm in-I'm out'' last-minute attitude toward 
the draft won't scare anyone away. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wally Szczerbiak, 6-8, Miami, Ohio. Probably the most mature  
player in the draft, Wally World, came up big in every big 
situation as a senior, from the Goodwill Games where he banged with 
bigger guys, to the NCAA tournament, where he scored 43 points 
against Washington, to the predraft camps, where he left a lot of 
open mouths with 3-point shooting shows. 
</P>
<P>
	--James Posey, 6-8, Xavier. One of those quiet, solid types whom  
fans know and coaches covet. He's a ferocious rebounder and very 
quick. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Shooting Guards    	
</P>
<P>
	--Richard Hamilton, 6-6, Connecticut. A true scorer who can shoot  
squaring up or on the break. He goes to the basket pretty well, 
too. A little on the lean side, but he made it through the Big East 
and its man-to-man style, so he must be tougher than most. The wait 
for him in the weight room will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Trajan Langdon, 6-6, Duke. A pure shooter who goes as deep as  
you need, as proven by his exhibition from the 25-foot range 
against Temple's zone in the NCAA tournament. He has to learn to 
get his own shot, but he still would be a great situational pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kris Clack, 6-5, Texas. He was a standout in Tom Penders'  
run-and-gun style with the Longhorns then showed he can play 
defense and still score at a slower pace under Rick Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Point Guards    	
</P>
<P>
	--Steve Francis, 6-3, Maryland. In his one year with the  
Terrapins he led the world in highlight clips. He is one of those 
special talents who can also make others better, and his quickness 
makes him a good defender. It won't be long before kids in parks 
are imitating his crossover first step. 
</P>
<P>
	--Baron Davis, 6-3, UCLA. What scares teams is the major knee  
surgery he had after his freshman season. What impresses them is 
his sophomore season when he showed the same explosiveness and 
attitude as the year before. No player in the draft has as much 
on-court confidence as Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Andre Miller, 6-2, Utah. A four-year college player who is as  
solid as they come. If a team needs flash it will pass on Miller. 
If a team needs a mature winner it will find a way to draft him.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Giving Girl AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A man accused of having sex with a  
13-year-old girl and giving her the virus that causes AIDS was 
convicted of felonious assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 14, said that Henry Couturier, 47, did not tell  
her he had the virus when they had sex in May 1998. She tested 
positive for HIV about three months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued the girl was a prostitute who could  
have contracted the virus from a customer. They also said Couturier 
told her he was HIV-positive and that he had used a condom every 
time he had sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Couturier was also convicted Friday on three counts of  
corruption of a minor and corruption with drugs. Sentencing is 
scheduled for July 28. Couturier faces up to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Todd W. Barstow said he will urge Couturier to  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl had been convicted last year of a delinquency count of  
soliciting for prostitution and admitted working as a prostitute. 
She testified that she didn't know how many men she had sex with 
before Couturier.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jesse Orosco, the Baltimore Orioles'  
left-handed relief specialist, pitched in his 1,051st game Friday 
night, breaking Kent Tekulve's record for career appearances by a 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco, 42, a 20-year veteran, was summoned by Orioles manager  
Ray Miller with one out in the eighth inning to protect an 8-7 
Baltimore lead over the New York Yankees.

<P>
	Orosco surrendered a game-tying single to Bernie Williams and  
got Paul O'Neill on a grounder to shortstop. He then issued an 
intentional walk to Chili Davis before being lifted in favor of 
right-hander Mike Timlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco has pitched in 1,055 games, 16 short of the record held

<HEADLINE> 10-Year-Old Charged in Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Tenn. (AP) -- A 10-year-old boy has been charged with  
raping a 5-year-old boy while the two were playing videogames. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the incident happened June 16. The younger boy's  
father left the two alone in the apartment for about 30 minutes to 
go to the grocery store and returned to find his son being 
assaulted, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The older child, who had been staying with the younger boy's  
neighbors, confessed and said he learned how to do it by watching 
his parents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A juvenile judge released the 10-year-old to his mother's  
custody and scheduled a court hearing for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the 10-year-old probably won't be incarcerated but  
will be required to receive counseling and may be assigned a 
probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most difficult cases I've ever had to deal  
with,'' said Dayton Police Investigator Billy Cranfield.

<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Sparks have fired  
general manager Rhonda Windham, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Johnny Buss informed Windham of his decision  
following an 86-73 loss to Minnesota on Thursday, Los Angeles' 
third straight and fourth in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss will assume Windham's responsibilities as general manager  
on an interim basis while he conducts a search for a permanent 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very high expectations for this very talented Los  
Angeles Sparks team,'' Buss said in a statement. ``That we do not 
have a winning record, nor a history of making the playoffs is not 
acceptable in a city that prides itself on its history of 
basketball championships. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Windham was the team's GM since the WNBA team's formation in  
1997.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Postpones Biowarfare Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Scientists have postponed indefinitely a  
planned Monday open-air release of bacteria that would have been 
used to test biowarfare detectors intended for battlefield use. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned tests at Los Alamos National Laboratory have raised  
questions about the lab's openness with the public as scientists 
expand their research into identifying and defending against 
biowarfare agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners in nearby White Rock complained to senior lab  
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials did not reveal the exact nature of the concerns in  
White Rock but agreed last week to postpone the tests indefinitely. 
They scheduled a public meeting for July 7 at White Rock Town Hall 
to discuss the tests and have invited state health officials to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had planned to release about an ounce of Bacillus  
globigii spores six times Monday night. The brownish-yellow clouds 
of bacteria spores were to have been released near the end of 
Frijoles Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab scientists wearing full-face respirators were to be downwind  
with a new suite of biowarfare detectors linked by computer and 
intended to be refined for battlefield use. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacillus globigii, or Bg, lives in local soils and is harmless  
to healthy adults. But the bacteria, in theory, could cause lung or 
eye infections in people with dramatically weakened defenses 
against bacterial disease, such as cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Season Still a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They went from being Team Turmoil to a Team of  
Destiny to a team that finished second in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it's over, the New York Knicks' season can be  
considered a success, even if it didn't end with the ultimate 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there was an obstacle in front of us, we knocked it  
down,'' forward Kurt Thomas said. ``We made it to this point, we 
had a chance to win the championship, it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great team here, we just have to regroup, have a  
great offseason and come back next year and try again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it seems certain that Jeff Van Gundy will return as  
coach, the biggest offseason question for the Knicks will be what 
they will do about their point guard situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The playmaker spot has been a problem for three years, with  
Chris Childs too erratic and Charlie Ward too prone to making bad 
decisions offensively. New York picks 15th in Wednesday's draft, 
and one of the top five available point guards should still be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The offseason also will allow enough time for Patrick Ewing's  
torn Achilles' tendon to heal, along with various other injuries -- 
Larry Johnson's sprained knee, Chris Dudley's hyperextended elbow, 
Childs' sprained knee -- that hurt the Knicks in the final round 
against San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody gave the Knicks much of a chance in the finals,  
the players believed in themselves and expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has been fighting all year, the ups and downs, and it  
was right there for us to win the championship,'' Ward said. ``So 
we have to look at it as an experience and look forward to next 
year and understand what we need to do in order to be a 
championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a topsy-turvy season of change and distraction for the  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season even began, two of the team's most popular  
players, Charles Oakley and John Starks, were dealt away in trades 
meant to make the team younger and more athletic. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley was traded for Marcus Camby, a move that remained widely  
unpopular in New York until Camby began asserting himself in the 
playoffs against Atlanta and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Starks was part of the deal that brought Sprewell to New York,  
and it turned into one of the better trades the Knicks have ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Injecting the club with a dose of raw skill and superstar  
presence, Sprewell was accepted right away by the fans in New York 
despite his checkered past that included a attack on his former 
coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been very supportive of the organization and of  
myself, personally. And that's one of the reasons why I want to be 
here next year,'' Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The season of ups and downs hit a low point in mid-April when  
the team was 21-21 and in serious danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ernie Grunfeld, who pulled off the Camby and  
Sprewell trades, was demoted. Van Gundy was put on notice that his 
job wasn't safe, either, and team president Dave Checketts held a 
clandestine meeting with former Bulls coach Phil Jackson to gauge 
his interest in coaching the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The season began look different a few days later when the  
Knicks, playing without Ewing, came back from a 20-point deficit in 
the second half to defeat the Heat at Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the turning point of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks met up with that very same Miami team in the first  
round of the playoffs and won a thrilling Game 5 on a last-second 
shot by Allan Houston that bounced off the front of the rim and 
fell through. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up was a sweep of the Atlanta Hawks in the second round and  
a matchup with the rival Indiana Pacers in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked bleak when Ewing went down after the second game,  
but the Knicks took Games 3, 5 and 6 to stun the Pacers and make it 
to the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, New York had no answer for the inside presence of  
Tim Duncan and David Robinson, falling in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Knicks were relentless, and it's scary to think what would  
have happened if they had a healthy Johnson and Ewing,'' the Spurs' 
Mario Elie said. ``It probably would have been a different 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, it was a season New York won't soon forget,  
and one the Knicks walk away from proud of themselves.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Rally Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- A demonstration by American Indian  
activists turned violent Saturday as people ransacked a store and 
set fires. Two news photographers were roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-hour American Indian Movement rally Saturday started  
peacefully in Pine Ridge and ended with a two-mile walk to nearby 
Whiteclay, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	At Whiteclay, a group of people stormed VJ's Market and threw  
soda pop, cigarettes and other merchandise onto the street. Two 
fires were also set in the store but were quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone also threw rocks at law officers when they arrived. At  
least two news photographers were roughed up, including one from 
the Los Angeles Times, who had his camera and film stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble apparently started when several people took down the  
``Welcome to Nebraska'' sign at the border and carried it down 
Whiteclay's main street. 
</P>
<P>
	Vic Clarke, the owner of VJ's Market, told the Star-Herald of  
Scottsbluff, Neb., that police had told him told him to close for 
the day, fearing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was gone when his store was stormed, and returned late  
Saturday afternoon to find it shambles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told it was a peaceful march, and then it got ugly,''  
Clarke said. ``Windows in coolers were smashed, gondolas were 
overturned and a lot of product was ruined,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said he was told about 50 to 60 people began tearing down  
street signs and breaking windows in several businesses along the 
street at about 1:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores in Whiteclay, population 22, sell $3 million of beer a  
year. Most of the sales are to Indians from Pine Ridge, who can't 
legally drink on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the reservation have long complained of shoddy  
treatment from business owners and law enforcement in Whiteclay. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally, three of the nation's best-known American Indian  
activists said Saturday they intend to respond to racial tensions 
along the South Dakota-Nebraska border -- including taking back part 
of northern Nebraska that is legally part of the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Means, Dennis Banks and Clyde Bellecourt said the rally  
was aimed at calling attention to alleged anti-Indian prejudice and 
racism which they allege has contributed to the unsolved slayings 
of Indians along the state line. 
</P>
<P>
	The editor of the Star-Herald, Steve Miller, said he had gotten  
a call on Saturday from someone in Pine Ridge who threatened to 
``take over the town'' unless Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns arrived by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor doesn't deal with demands,'' said Chris Peterson,  
a spokesman for Johanns. ``Making a demand that the governor travel 
two miles or two hours seems foolish, considering the governor's 
open-door policy. His home phone number is listed and he is always 
willing to listen and work with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally took place less than two weeks before a scheduled  
visit by President Clinton to the reservation, which includes 
Shannon County, one of the poorest in the nation. A reservation 
villages, Oglala, was hit by tornadoes earlier this month that 
killed one man and destroyed about 160 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Means, Banks and Bellecourt want the presidential trip to  
include discussion of issues other than poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will respond to a tornado. Why don't you respond to the  
tornado of murders?'' Bellecourt yelled at the several hundred 
people.

<HEADLINE> Mormons Emphasizing Child Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Candidates seeking entrance into the  
Mormon church's temples will now be asked if they are keeping up 
with child support. 
</P>
<P>
	The change underscores a growing concern of leaders in The  
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about divorce among 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we see increasing strains on families everywhere, church  
leaders have felt it necessary to place additional emphasis on 
meeting all family responsibilities and obligations,'' Mormon 
officials said in a prepared statement this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Members are interviewed before receiving temple ``recommends''  
which deem them worthy to participate in the most sacred 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	While a question about child support has been asked since 1985,  
new changes in the wording specifically ask: ``Do you have 
financial or other obligations to a former spouse or children? If 
yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the old wording, members were first asked if they had been  
divorced or separated. Only if the answer was yes did the questions 
go on to determine if candidates were current in financial 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	AMCAP president Lane Fischer said 1999's emphasis on child  
support is important, because the church can help establish a 
standard of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want this privilege and this blessing to go to the  
temple, then this is the expectation, just like paying tithing or 
being morally honest,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of San Antonio Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs, formerly the Dallas Chaparrals, moved to  
the city in 1973 as part of the American Basketball Association. 
Here are some franchise highlights leading up to their first NBA 
title in 1999: 

</P>
<P>
	Oct. 10, 1973 -- Spurs play their first game in San Antonio,  
losing to the San Diego Conquistadors 121-106 in front of 5,879 
spectators in HemisFair Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 30, 1974 -- San Antonio acquires George Gervin from the  
Virginia Squires in exchange for cash after legal battles among the 
Spurs, the Squires and the ABA. At one point, the 21-year-old 
Gervin went into hiding for a week as the three parties feuded. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 13, 1974 -- Bob Bass is hired as coach to replace Tom  
Nissalke. 
</P>
<P>
	June 17, 1976 -- Spurs are officially accepted into the National  
Basketball Association along with three other ABA franchises -- 
Denver, Indiana and the New York Nets. 
</P>
<P>

	SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- He's not known for his surfing. He doesn't  
greet pals with ``Hey, dude.'' But Jeff Gordon is a proud native 
Californian. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon grew up just a short distance from Sears Point Raceway in  
Vallejo. Each year he returns home for the Save Mart/Kragen 350, 
and is hailed as a hometown hero, even though he hasn't lived here 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my hometown,'' Gordon said. ``This is where I was born  
and I'm just glad to get back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon started racing quarter midgets in California as a  
youngster. By 13 he was in sprint cars, but was too young to race 
them in the state, so his family moved to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he still has fond memories of his time in the Golden  
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funny thing is, I never saw Sears Point when I lived out  
here,'' he said. ``I knew about it, but I never laid eyes on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving California to seek his fame and fortune, Gordon  
has won three NASCAR Winston Cup championships, his most recent 
coming last year. He is the youngest driver ever to win three 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the defending champion isn't doing so well. He's  
fifth in the points race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year it was like, `How long can this go on? Is it ever  
going to stop?''' he said. ``This year, it's like `How can we get 
back on?'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND CHANCE: Ward Burton shaved some meaningful time Saturday  
from what he'd run Friday to lead second-round qualifying with a 
speed of 97.134 mph. That would have put him 13th on the grid if he 
had mustered it in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he moved, from 39th to 26th.  
</P>
<P>
	Winston West racer Butch Gilliland, an infrequent Winston Cup  
campaigner, qualified a surprising 27th for Sunday's race, followed 
by Brett Bodine and Winston Cup series leader Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, whose bobble in Friday's qualifying left him 30th,  
gained one spot on Saturday to 29th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset anytime I don't wind up on the pole,'' he said. ``I  
haven't been that far back for a while, but it's a pretty long 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Little, Kevin Lepage, Steve Park, Ernie Irvan, Rich Bickle,  
Robert Pressley and David Green made the field through 
provisionals. 
</P>
<P>
	R.K. Smith, sitting in for the injured Dave Marcus, missed the  
cut as did Austin Cameron, Sean Woodside, John Metcalf, Mike 
Borkowski, David Murry, and two veterans of other series -- 
road-course expert and truck racer Boris Said and defending Winston 
West champion Steve Portenga. 

</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DON'T TELL BOBBY: History makes Kyle Petty the long shot for a  
victory on Sunday, and he says everybody who qualified slower than 
he did can just start packing for home. 
</P>
<P>
	No driver has ever won at Sears Point from lower than the 13th  
spot -- which Petty occupies -- on the grid in a decade of Winston 
Cup racing. The late Davey Allison went on to victory from No. 13 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Not reading up on history this weekend will be the No. 14  
qualifier, Bobby Labonte, who left 42 drivers watching his dust a 
week ago at Pocono. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just lost grip, but I think we're going to be OK,'' Labonte  
said. ``We'll concentrate on getting her ready to race now.'' 

</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Jimmy Spencer, no admirer of road courses, got it  
right this time. After nary a top-10 start in qualifying for all 15 
previous races this year on the ovals, Spencer twisted around the 
lefts and rights here at 98.127 mph for fifth spot on the grid ... 
Terry Labonte won the final first-round qualifying spot at No. 25 
on Friday to assure his 618th consecutive Winston Cup start ... 
Sears Point challenges drivers for 71-72 seconds around 11 turns 
and 1.949 miles, yet less than one second separates pole sitter 
Jeff Gordon from No. 16 qualifier Mike Skinner.

<HEADLINE> Va. Gadfly Attacks Council Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP) -- ``Facts are fine, fer as they go, but  
they're like water bugs skittering atop the water.'' So said 
Grandpa Beebe, the late local sage. ``Legends, now they go deep 
down and bring up the heart of a story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What started as a search for some facts -- uncomfortable ones, to  
be sure -- is turning into the stuff of legend in this normally 
laid-back island town. The tale folks will tell for years has the 
requisite ``bad guys,'' the moment of comeuppance, and, of course, 
the unlikely hero. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter is local boat dealer Charlie Kambarn, the guy who got  
the whole thing stirred up. ``It's really turned into something 
next to a circus,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Till now, this Eastern Shore town of 3,500 was best known for  
the volunteer fire company's wild pony swim and auction, an annual 
event that gave rise to Marguerite Henry's ``Misty'' books. But now 
even Jay Leno's calling to hear about the homegrown scandal that 
cost the mayor, town manager and police chief their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started in March, when some of the city fathers went to  
Orlando, Fla., for a conference on hurricanes, a subject of great 
interest to a coastal island in the Atlantic's hurricane alley. No 
sooner had Mayor Harry S. Thornton, Town Manager T. Stewart Baker 
and Police Chief Willis Dize returned than rumors started flying 
about Hooters dinners and Crown Royal lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Charlie Kambarn.  
</P>
<P>
	At 48, with thinning hair, speckled green eyes and a ruddy  
complexion, this youngest son of a famously frugal father has 
earned a reputation as a likable playboy. He has a diamond cluster 
and two other gold rings glinting from his fingers. On an island of 
rugged fishermen, he'd rather use his green-and-white Sea Ray to 
troll the tiki bars along the shore than to fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I eat my tuna out of a can,'' he says with a laugh as he blows  
smoke from a White Owl Miniature through the sunroof of his gold 
Lexus. ``I couldn't make a living working on the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kambarn hadn't been to a city council meeting in 10 years. He  
swears he'd never spoken in public before. But when he heard about 
the spending spree -- which came on the heels of the council's 20 
percent water rate hike -- he wanted information. 
</P>
<P>
	When he didn't get it, he started filing Freedom of Information  
requests. City officials tried to discourage Kambarn with 
photocopying fees -- $1,300 in all. OK, he said, and he paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Kambarn's persistence paid off with a trail of credit  
card receipts that set the townsfolk on their ears. 
</P>
<P>
	A $364 bar tab from the Orlando hotel pool.  
</P>
<P>
	A $319 bill for dinner at Charlie's Lobster House (the tip alone  
was $42). 
</P>
<P>
	And $420 for a rental car that took the officials to Key West,  
hundreds of miles away, during some of the conference's most 
important sessions -- evacuation routes, shelter management, rescue 
and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at council meetings swelled from the usual dozen to a  
couple hundred. When it was all over, Chief Dize was fired, manager 
Baker had resigned and a judge suspended Mayor Thornton pending 
further review. The latter two have declined comment. Dize's 
attorney says his client wasn't given a fair hearing and will sue 
if not reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in town are divided about all of this.  
</P>
<P>
	The locals don't begrudge a little financial latitude on these  
trips, says Donald Leonard, a former councilman. But for a town 
with a budget of $3 million, he says, this looked like ``raw 
extravagance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a couple of glasses of booze on the town,'' the  
73-year-old retired motel operator says. ``I don't think most 
people in town are opposed to two or three drinks with dinner. I 
think they oppose sitting around the bar and running up a $300 
tab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some see another factor at work here. No one cared much to check  
on public expenditures, they say, until it came time to choose a 
location for the island's new bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of state Highway 175, a 50-year-old swing bridge  
crosses Chincoteague Sound and gently drops vehicles into downtown, 
right between the Roxy Theater and Bill's Restaurant, where Dize 
and a group of old-timers gather for coffee and cigarettes every 
morning and afternoon. But the state said the bridge needs 
replacing and asked city and county officials for a recommendation 
on one of two options. 
</P>
<P>
	One location for the $30 million span would be to the north of  
the old bridge. The other would funnel traffic toward the south end 
of town -- and smack-dab into the beloved two-story brick firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Mason says the skinny around town was that the council  
supported the southern bridge, as she does. She says getting rid of 
the three officials was ``a way to circumvent it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A short blond woman with bare shoulders and big hoop earrings,  
she went to school with Kambarn and resents the implication that 
her being in favor of the southern bridge is a vote against the 
firemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire company, that's used as a whip,'' says Mason, owner  
of the Waterside Motor Inn. ``If you're against the fire company, 
that's like the American flag and Mom's apple pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't condone the spending spree but hates what the  
scandal and the bridge fight have done to her town. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like this divisiveness,'' she says. ``We love where we  
live. We all have that common denominator. ... Why would we want to 
change that to where none of us would want to live here anymore?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Kambarn, he got his $1,300 back -- and a whole lot more  
attention than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	His stock in trade is Johnson marine motors, but he's been too  
busy to get much grease under his nails lately. He's talked to lots 
of reporters -- but not to Leno. That would be ``like making a 
mockery of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People were coming in my office, calling me, thanking me,''  
says Kambarn. ``My son says I'm starting to SOUND like a 
politician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wish he'd left well enough alone. ``I've lost some friends  
over this,'' he says. ``Some people don't even nod their head to me 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still thinks he only did what needed to be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I did was ask for a little information.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Author King's Recovery Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Horror writer Stephen King is continuing  
to recover from surgery, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	King endured nearly 10 hours of surgery to repair his right hip  
socket on Wednesday. Minor surgery scheduled for Friday was 
postponed to next week to give the author more time to recover, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	King remained in serious but stable condition on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	He was hit by a minivan last Saturday and suffered multiple  
broken bones in his right leg and hip, along with a collapsed lung 
and a head gash. He is expected to recover fully, though his 
doctors anticipate months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the driver who hit King will not face charges.

<HEADLINE> Leonardo's Horse Is Finally Born </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEACON, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly five centuries after the death of  
Leonardo da Vinci, a majestic bronze horse towers above this tiny 
town, a tribute to what some scholars say was one of the greatest 
heartaches of the famed artist's life. 
</P>
<P>
	As the story goes, da Vinci cried on his deathbed at the thought  
of never having completed the 24-foot bronze horse he was 
commissioned to sculpt for the Duke of Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	His work on ``Il Cavallo'' -- Italian for ``The Horse'' --  
progressed as far as a massive clay model, which brought him 
widespread acclaim when it was placed in a palace courtyard in 
Milan in 1493. 
</P>
<P>
	But his dreams for the project were shattered when French troops  
invaded the city and used the horse for target practice. To make 
matters worse, the bronze intended for casting the horse was used 
to make cannons. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Vinci fled to France, the molds to the horse were lost, and  
the artist died in 1519, still wishing he had finished the massive 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 500 years later, the tale of da Vinci's lost horse caught  
the attention of Pennsylvania airline pilot and amateur artist 
Charles Dent, who read about the horse in a 1977 edition of 
National Geographic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dent loved Italy and he loved art, so it came as no surprise to  
his friends when he decided to dedicate his life, as he said, to 
``give Leonardo back his horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, Dent's dream becomes reality. The towering $6.5  
million ``Il Cavallo'' statue that stands on display next to its 
foundry about 70 miles north of New York City will be dismantled 
and shipped to Milan in appreciation for da Vinci and the 
Renaissance legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Dent founded Leonardo da Vinci's Horse, Inc., a  
nonprofit organization to raise funds for the project. He recruited 
board members and commissioned the Tallix foundry to create the 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie was a great lover of the Renaissance, and he was a  
great student of art. These things came to him, and somehow, he'd 
make it happen,'' said Rod Skidmore, a member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Vinci left behind no complete drawings of the horse, so Dent  
worked with artists and sculptors to create an 8-foot clay model. 
</P>
<P>
	Then tragedy struck. With the project still in its infancy, Dent  
died on Christmas Day 1994 of Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terribly sad time,'' Skidmore said. ``Since then,  
we've tried to make decisions we think Charlie would have made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skidmore and the other board members pressed on, and in 1996  
they shipped the model to Tallix to be turned into a full-scale 
rendering. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later when they stepped back to look at the  
finished product, they weren't pleased. Some scholars commented 
that the horse's anatomy wasn't quite right. 
</P>
<P>
	They turned to sculptor Nina Akamu to create a completely new  
model. Having spent 12 years in Italy and having been a rider and 
trainer of horses, Akamu was judged to be the perfect savior for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``She came in and I just knew she could do it,'' Skidmore said.  
``What we were asking her to do would have driven most people into 
a rubber room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two-and-a-half years, Akamu spent her days working with clay  
at the foundry and her nights poring over thousands of da Vinci 
drawings and scholarly writings to complete the details of the 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it faithful to da Vinci's vision?  
</P>
<P>
	``This horse is not a recreation of Leonardo's Il Cavallo, and  
it never could be, nor is it a Renaissance piece of art,'' said 
Akamu. ``It's a contemporary sculpture that is faithful to the 
character and spirit of Leonardo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the 15-ton sculpture was pieced together on a huge  
lawn outside the foundry, drawing hundreds of people each day into 
what one passerby called an otherwise ``one horse town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the town is celebrating the horse's sendoff with a  
``da Vinci Days'' Renaissance festival before it's taken apart next 
week and shipped to Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials plan to unveil it Sept. 10 at its new  
permanent home -- a cultural center adjacent to a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Tallix have started construction on a second,  
identical horse to be featured at the Frederik Meijer Gardens 
sculpture park in Grand Rapids, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Tells Critics To 'Shut Up' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has told his critics  
to ``shut up'' about his busy travel schedule and frequent media 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all those naysayers out there that say, 'Oh, the governor  
shouldn't be standing in front of the cameras, the governor 
shouldn't be bringing attention to himself' ... y'all can shut 
up,'' he said Friday during his radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he is able to use all the attention focused on  
him to highlight important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said other politicians should come in for the same  
criticism. He referred to Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. 
George Bush ``cavorting around the whole country'' and first lady 
Hillary Clinton traveling to New York while considering a run for 
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Truck Driver Finds Wife, Son Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANGER, Calif. (AP) -- A tow-truck driver making a routine stop  
at a wreck Friday discovered that his wife and son had been killed 
in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Gonzalez was called by the California Highway Patrol to tow  
cars from the wreck at about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Brenda Lee, 28, and their son, Jacob Paul, 3, were  
killed when her car suddenly lost control, turned on its side and 
skidded into another vehicle, the patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's daughter, Heather, 2, was hospitalized in critical  
condition Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the other car, Betty Almanzar, 63, was airlifted  
to a hospital with major injuries, the patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Hudson, who runs a towing company, said the highway patrol  
chooses towing companies at random from a list. Gonzalez, who also 
runs an upholstery business, just happened to be chosen that day, 
Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul's got one child in the hospital right now, so he's just  
trying to do his best to regain his composure and to deal with 
this,'' Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanger is about 200 miles southeast of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Artist Makes Plea for Driver Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A mild-mannered contractor by day, Ken  
Kelton becomes a graffiti artist on a mission after darkness falls, 
a crusader painting the outlines of crumpled bodies on the pavement 
wherever pedestrians have been killed by cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelton has painted about 50 of the outlines and says he will  
keep at it until people take notice of what he likens to mass 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a serial killer out there, everyone would be  
jumping into action,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelton is not sure how to solve the problem, but believes the  
police, the city and drivers could be doing more to ensure the 
safety of pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something wrong with the whole traffic layout, the  
whole system,'' Kelton says. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine pedestrians have been killed in San Francisco since  
July 1, 1998, according to police. That's about an average year for 
the city and far below the 41 in 1997-98, according to Nick Carr, 
pedestrian and bicycle safety coordinator for the city's parking 
and traffic department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem specific to San Francisco,'' Carr says.  
``It's a product of our time. There are longer commutes. People 
seem to be more competitive at the wheel and drive at increased 
speeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelton has no direct personal connection to pedestrian  
fatalities, no friend or relative who has been killed, but says he 
``grumbled silently'' for years about how automobiles seemed to 
have taken over the streets and society. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the fleeting nature of the deaths that bothers Kelton. ``It  
doesn't seem to matter. It doesn't even make the paper,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He found his calling when he read about a man in New York who  
painted spots where bicyclists had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	On a map in his office, red pins represent pedestrian fatalities  
and yellow pins mark injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been passionate about things,'' says his wife,  
Sue. ``When you look at the map, how can you not support it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out on the streets one recent morning, Kelton puts on an orange  
reflective vest while his son Jesse, 23, sets up a construction 
barrier, complete with flashing yellow light, on a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrier makes them look like a road crew and gives them some  
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Dewayne Tully says Kelton would be subject to  
citation for vandalism if he were caught in the act, even though 
the white painted outlines usually wash away with the next shower 
or street cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sensitive area,'' Tully says. ``Here's someone trying  
to bring attention to a problem. But technically he is in violation 
of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As his son places a wood stencil of a human figure on the  
crosswalk at 21st and Mission streets, Kelton draws his sprayer and 
quickly paints ``4-15-99, woman 71'' on the pavement. Then he 
sprays around the edges of the stencil and over cutout letters that 
read ``KILLED HERE, BY TRAFFIC.'' The last item is the address of 
his Web site: www.pedsafe.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they're off to another next site.  
</P>
<P>
	``A 71-year-old woman crossing the street,'' Kelton says in  
disgust. ``Maybe she didn't cross in time. Is this what she 
deserves?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Fifth and King streets, the he paints ``nameless man killed  
on 5-15-99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A picture is worth a thousand words,'' Kelton says. ``I'm  
trying to underscore that this is life and death.''
