<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi today criticized some western
countries for imposing taxes on crude oil and warned that the
carbon tax would only harm its advocates.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the official Saudi Press Agency that such a
tax would also destabilize the international oil market, which he
hoped would remain a free commercial market.
</P>
<P>
His criticism is primarily directed against European countries
where taxes on oil, mainly gasoline, have been rising steadily
as a means to discourage the use of fossil fuels in favor of
more environment-friendly energy sources such as natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world top oil producer and exporter, and
other oil producing countries including other Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states, have been complaining bitterly about high
European taxes on oil which range from between 50 to 70 percent
of oil's original value.
</P>
<P>
They complained that these oil importing countries are making
more money from taxing oil than the exporters do from producing
it.
</P>
<P>
These oil-producing countries considers this tax as a
"single-minded approach" from the side of consumer states with no
observation of the interests of producing states and their
dependency on oil to promote their economies.

<HEADLINE> More Funds on Human Development Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of Consumer
Council of Zimbabwe Muchaneta Nyambuya today said it should be
possible to get rid of extreme poverty both nationally and
internationally over the next 20 years if the will is there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a seminar on ''20/20 Initiative -- a New
Budget Concept'', Nyambuya said this would be a better approach
to tackling poverty rather than to bring the numbers of the very
poor down to three to four percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Decent levels of human development, he said, could be achieved
in Zimbabwe if the government allocated more funds to human
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
had appealed to governments to allocate an average 20 percent of
public spending to human development resources.
</P>
<P>
''On average, especially in low-income countries, many of
these being African, more than 20 percent would be needed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''Donors can then be called upon to fill the gap by allocating
20 percent of their aid budgets to human development
priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The 20/20 initiative, he said, was a way to increase
efficiency in the allocation of available national resources and
donor funds.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the World Bank Ebrahim Jassat told the
seminar, ''human resource development and poverty reduction are
fundamental to long-term sustainable growth.''
</P>
<P>
He said members of civil society, the government and the World
Bank would be meeting on July 14 in Washington for the launch of
the structural adjustment initiative.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe was chosen as one of the case examples where civil
society and the state came together to review the positive and
negative aspects of the economic structural adjustment
programs,'' said Jassat.

<P>
MADRID, July 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO has decided to invite the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland to join the alliance, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solona said here today at the end of the
first day meeting of a two-day summit in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
As for other candidates, especially Romania and Slovenia,
Solana said: "We reaffirm that NATO remains open to new members
under Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"No European democratic country whose admission would fulfil
the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from consideration,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The initial row over whether to admit Romania and Slovenia
along in the first wave ended with a concession by France and
other eight nations to the United States' demand that the two
should wait until the next wave.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to the three former Warsaw Pact countries to
join NATO marks the official implementation of NATO's eastward
expansion plan, which came into being three and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO's initial arrangements, the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland will respectively begin three-month
negotiations on their accession to NATO in September. If the talks
go smoothly, a protocol would be signed in December and the 16
NATO members will begin their ratification process early next year.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are expected to become
NATO's new members in April 1999 if nothing goes wrong, when NATO,
the only military alliance existing after the end of the Cold War,
marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
NATO's current members are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Intelligence: Hamas Not Planning Massive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army intelligence head
Moshe Yaalon today painted a relative positive picture of
Israel's security situation, saying the militant Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) is not planning massive terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon gave his assessment to the Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He noted that Hamas was
playing a passive role in the Palestinian territories and
refraining from taking part in the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) policy of controlled violence in Hebron and other places.
</P>
<P>
He said Hamas was gaining strength in the territories by
attacking PNA leader Yasser Arafat's policies for failing to
deliver peace dividends to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon listed two reasons for Hamas' reluctance to launch
terror attacks against Israel at this stage: Firstly, the PNA is
cracking down on organized terrorism; secondly, Hamas is blamed
for the economic hardship in the territories caused by Israeli
closure as a result of the terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that another anti-Israeli militant organization
the Islamic Jihad was planning terror attacks at any time.
</P>
<P>
While commenting the PNA's efforts to crack down on organized
terrorism, Yaalon said Arafat was interested in keeping the
Palestinians on the international agenda by waging limited
violence in Hebron and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police refused to restrain the rioters in Hebron,
and the situation would not change before Israel halted the
expansion of settlements and confiscation of Palestinian land,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the continued deadlock in the peace process to
the total lack of confidence between Israel and the PNA. However,
he disclosed that there was not total stalemate in the security
area as the two sides have been in quiet contacts over security
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon added that Arafat had sought to contact Israel over
the building of the Dahaniya Airport in Gaza in order to rebuild
confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today
once again blasted the PNA for stalling the peace process and
violating the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with a German television, Netanyahu
said that, despite the clashes in Hebron these days, the Israelis
today felt more secure than they did one year ago before he came
to power.

<HEADLINE> Discussions on China's Reunification Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A discussion on China's
reunification was held here today between the Liaison Committee
for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots and Overseas Chinese
under the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a delegation from the US
Committee of One Hundred.
</P>
<P>
The US Committee of One Hundred, established in New York in
1991, consists of outstanding Chinese Americans from all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here on a visit at the invitation of the
CPPCC National Committee
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, briefed the
visitors on the negotiation process over Hong Kong issues and the
content of "one country, two systems." The concept of "one
country, two systems," which accords with the actual conditions
both in Hong Kong and China's inland area, would be unswervingly
carried out in Hong Kong, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the questions raised by the US visitors, Tang
Shubei, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council, said that China's sovereignty belongs to all the
Chinese including Taiwan compatriots. Although the two sides
across the Taiwan Straits have not reunified yet, the sovereignty
has never been split, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China would continue to focus on its economic
construction, strictly abide by the terms set in the Sino-British
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and implement well the "one country, two
systems" policy in Hong Kong. "We will also make the Taiwan
compatriots understand this policy better," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that the reunification across the Taiwan
Straits needs time, but China's sovereignty can never be allowed
to be split under the pretext that the country is not reunified
yet.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities would be
honest and the two sides across the straits conduct political
negotiations in a proper atmosphere and increase the links across
the straits to reach the goal of reunification eventually.

MADRID, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) aims to sign the protocol of accession with
its invitees, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, at the time
of NATO's ministerial meetings in December, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana announced here today at the end of the first day
meeting of a two-day summit in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by Solana, NATO leaders formally extended
invitations to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to begin
accession talks with NATO. They hoped that the three former Warsaw
Pact countries would become NATO's new members in April 1999, when
NATO marks its 50th anniversary of the Washington Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that NATO would continue to welcome new
members in a position to further the principles of the treaty and
contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic area. "The alliance
expects to extend further invitations in coming years," it said.
</P>
<P>
NATO promised to maintain an active relationship with those
nations that have expressed an interest in NATO membership as well
as those who may wish to seek membership in the future. To keep
its promise, the statement said, NATO foreign ministers have been
directed to keep that process under continual review and report to
NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
The invitations to three former Warsaw Pact countries to join
NATO mark the official implementation of NATO's eastward expansion
plan, which came into being three and a half years ago. According
to NATO's initial arrangements, the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland will respectively begin three-month negotiations on their
accession to NATO from September. If the talks could go smoothly,
a protocol would be signed in December. Then, from early next
year, NATO's current 16 members will begin their ratification
process.
</P>

If nothing goes wrong, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
will become NATO's new members in April 1999 when NATO, the only

the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Washington.

NATO's current members are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders were at first split over if Romania and Slovenia
should be included in the invitation in the first wave of NATO's
expansion eastwards. Nine members led by France and Italy intended
to include Romania and Slovenia but six other members led by the
United States wanted the two to wait for the next wave. The latter
finally leaned towards the U.S position.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen today pledged to do his best to restore public order and
asked the international community to understand his efforts.
</P>
<P>
In his third radio and television speech in three days, Hun Sen
said the international community should allow the Cambodian people
solve their own problems without external interference and
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Fightings with armed forces loyal to the country's First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh had ended, he noted, adding that he
hoped everything would be back to normal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he had phoned Loy Sim Chheag, acting president of
the National Assembly (parliament) and secretary-general of the
FUNCINPEC Party, to discuss the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to convene a parliamentary session within a week
and work out new electoral and party laws within one month to pave
way for the general elections scheduled in May 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC Party should nominate one person to take over
Ranariddh's position and parliamentarians who had not followed the
first prime minister will remain their posts, Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Acting head of state Chea Sim had already sent letters to King
Norodom Sihanouk and Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United
Nations, to brief them about the situation in Cambodia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Good Prospects for Cyprus Stock Exchange: Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange will
witness a better performance in the near future, as the
government intends to introduce new incentives and measures which
will strengthen investment activity, Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the inauguration ceremony of the new
floor of the Cyprus Stock Exchange here.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Stock Exchange's course and its contribution to
the Republic's economic development are satisfying, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Cyprus Stock Exchange must be upgraded
on a solid basis in order to become the stock exchange of the
region, and not only that of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Stock Exchange was officially inaugurated in March,
1996 in a bid to upgrade Cyprus' monetary system and establish
itself as a regional exchange to serve a wider area.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present state of the economy, Christodoulou
said that the difficulties in the first three months of the year
are decreasing, thanks to the measures taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is already recovering, and this recovery is
expected to continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that the 1998 state budgets will
reflect the government's development aims, as expenditure for
development and infrastructure will increase by 10 percent
compared with that of 1997, reaching 250 million Cyprus pounds
(about 500 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Conglomerate Starts Billion-Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait state-owned National
Industries Company has started a new investment plan of one
billion U.S. dollars through the year 2005, chief executive
manager of the conglomerate Robert Kottritsch said today.
</P>
<P>
He said in an exclusive interview with Kuwait News Agency
that the 10-year executive strategy is aimed at expanding its
activities in the international market and competing for grand
specialized projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait National Industries Company is the second largest
industrial group in the Gulf region after the Saudi Arabian Basic
Industries Company. Its capital reached 1.21 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of 1996 with a net profit of 82.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far the company has investments in the Gulf Cooperation
Council states, Egypt and other Middle East countries and some
western and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Kottritsch said his company is vigorously seeking to put
into action its executive strategy in the globalization
campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the company first planned to increase its investment in
 the Gulf region, mainly in iron and steel sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the company's plans in the Middle East region,
Kottritsch said it would try to expand its investments despite
difficulties in executing its plans due to lack of clear
investment and tax laws in some regional countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the company's global strategy, it would tap markets
in the southeastern Asian and the Pacific region, giving
priority to Singapore and Malaysia, while continuing to boost

and overhauling the financial and administrative structures to
meet the requirements of its expanding strategy.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Urges Mutineer Soldiers to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Sierra Leone leader Tejan
Kabbah today appeared on a radio, urging soldiers in the armed
forces "to report to the nearest ECOMOG base without arms and
declare their loyalty" to his deposed government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a new fm radio station set up by Nigeria and based
near the international airport, 10 miles across the Sierra Leone
river, Kabbah said soldiers who report "will not be treated as
mutineers."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also appealed to junta leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma
"to hand over power and spare themselves and the people of Sierra
Leone further pains and suffering."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria-led West African Peace-keeping Force known as ECOMOG
has threatened to use force to drive out Koroma and re-establish
Kabbah as the legitimate leader of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Hand over now and you will be forgiven by the people," he
said in a voice choked with emotion.
</P>
<P>
But Kabbah warned, "if you persists and caused force to be
used, let me assure you that no western or African country shall
offer you asylum and we shall not rest until you are brought to
justice."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah is in neighboring Guinea where he took refuge after the
May 25 coup. He said he had seen "babies and young people, old
men and women and the sick go into refugee camps."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the broadcast, junta Secretary General, Colonel
Abdul Sesay accused Nigeria of "providing the logistics for the
setting up of the station."
</P>
<P>
"It is an infringement of our territorial sovereignty and this
must not be allowed," Sesay said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the station as a pirate radio which will not
succeed.
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the station within the capital has been mixed. One
lawyer said he doubts "whether it could achieve anything as
people realize it will only paint the ousted government good."
</P>
<P>
Yet a university student welcomed the new station, saying, "it
will present an alternate view from the propaganda stuff dished
out by the government station."

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Africa's Sustainable Development Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An international workshop started
here today with an aim of promoting sustainable rural and
urban development in Africa through participatory approaches.
</P>
<P>
Rwabeire Baira, the director for Community Development in
Ugandan Ministry of Gender and Community Development, while
opening the one-week workshop, said it requires participatory
approaches to eliminate poverty which predominates African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Baira told community experts from 10 countries from within and
outside Africa to increase awareness among the people so that
they can manage their own resources.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty should not be taken as lack of money or
materials but should be considered as a result of lack of
confidence and awareness of hidden resources in the communities.
</P>
<P>
Baira asked the participants to promote community development
projects for use by workers throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
Stan Burkey, senior advisor to Uganda Change Agnet Association
said sustainable development cannot be imposed on from outside
but should come from the actions of individuals.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development is also an important issue in present
Africa, due to environmental degradation caused by deforestation
and over-grazing in most parts of Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Catholics Angry over Document Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Catholics were
getting angry today over a leaked official document which
suggested the government ignored their objections to a weekend
Protestant parade.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo
Mowlam, went into a new round of Northern Ireland peace talks in
the provincial capital Belfast, but overshadowed by Catholic fury
over the document, which concluded that allowing the parade along
Portadown's Catholic Garvaghy Road was "the least worst outcome."
</P>
<P>
However, the annual march that began on Sunday turned into the
worst riot seen in the divided province for years, with many
injuried and cars burned.
</P>
<P>
"Nationalists are very angry. Nationalists are thinking about
whether to talk to me or not so my use may be limited after my
failure in Garvaghy. I accept that," Mowlam said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary added that Catholic residents groups opposed to
Protestant weekend marches were not speaking to her after the
authorities allowed an Orange Order parade last Sunday over the
objections of Catholic residents who felt it was intimidation.
</P>
<P>
But she vowed to seek an agreement to avert further violence
when the Protestant Orange Order marches along Belfast's Lower
Ormeau Road on Saturday at the climax of the annual marching
season by pro-British Protestant organizations.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Catholic anger continued till today. A
policeman patrolling disturbances on Portadown's Garvaghy Road was
shot and wounded as Catholics kept up a barrage of protest across
the province.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, which had been fighting
to end British rule of the province, was believed responsible for
his injuries and for a series of armed attacks on British troops
and police during overnight Catholic riots.
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday night there have been 776 attacks on the
security forces, 1,444 petrol bombings and 363 hijackings. A total
of 60 police and 49 civilians have been injured and police and
troops have fired 2,400 plastic bullets to quell riots.

AMMAN -- A fierce price war resulted in a loss of 750,000
Jordanian dinars (about 1 million U.S. dollars) to Jordan's major
tourist transport companies in the first half of the year,
according to the general manager of the Jordanian Investment and
Tourism Transport Company (Alfa), Isam Aridah.
</P>
<P>
Giving an example, Aridah said that a one-way journey from the
capital city of Amman to Petra, one of Jordan's historical sites,
is 500-kilometer long and cost 311 dinars (about 439 dollars), but
due to competition and abundance of buses, companies charge as low
as 150 dinars (about 212 dollars) which means a 161 dinars (about
227 dollars) loss per journey.
</P>
<P>
The price is the lowest in the Arab world, the general manager
said.
</P>
<P>
The major tourist transport companies will go bankrupt within
five years if they do not come together to agree on a pricing
formula in cooperation and coordination with the ministry of
tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aridah said a meeting will be held this week among
all the parties concerned to discuss a mechanism to stop the
financial bleeding of the tourist transport companies.
</P>
<P>
There are now altogether 240 tourism buses operating in the
kingdom, but the operational rate is no more than 50 percent on
average.

<HEADLINE> UK Threatens to Block Spain's Full Entry into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
threatened to block Spain's full integration into NATO's command
structure unless British military aircraft are allowed to make
full use of the airport on the contested British colony of
Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview early today, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook put forward conditions for Spain to become a
full NATO member, saying "our case is that if Spain wishes to come
fully into the (NATO) Alliance and into the integrated command
structure, then it must behave as an ally when we want our
military aircraft to go in and out of Gibraltar."
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that the Spanish government was restricting the
access of British military aircraft to the airport on Gibraltar, a
rocky peninsula at the southern tip of Spain that dominates the
western entrance to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
"Spain, at the moment, makes that very difficult because it
does not provide proper air space for our military planes, or
indeed our civilian planes, to take off there," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar was ruled by Spain in the mid-15th century and merged
into Spanish territory in 1501. In 1704 Austria captured
Gilbraltar with the joining of Britain and the Netherlands. Under
the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Gibraltar formally became a British
colony, but Spain has claimed it ever since, generating regular
tensions with Britain.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar expressed his hope on
Monday that Spain would join NATO's military command later this
year, but he admitted there would be some hurdles to be overcome
first.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government has made it clear that Spain would
insist on a sub-regional Iberian command that would encompass all
its territory, including the disputed Gibratal.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Spanish initiative, Cook said: "We have never
said, never recognized and do not recognize any probability of any
Spanish sub-regional command having any direct command over
Gibraltar. That's not on the cards."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether London would block Spain's integration into
NATO's command structure without a deal over Gibraltar, Cook said:
"Yes, we can and yes, we will, unless there's an agreement."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Produces 26 Million Doses of Veterinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Debre-Zeit Veterinary
Institute of Ethiopia produced 26 million doses of various
vaccinations and distributed them to customers both inside and
outside of the country during the just ended 1996/97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The institute, about 40 kms away from Addis Ababa, was
established 33 years ago with a capacity of 4 million doses
annually.
</P>
<P>
According to director of the institute Antonio, the increase
of production last fiscal year was the result of the construction
of a new building for vaccination production center and
installation of new and modern equipment at a total cost of 2.5
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the institute is now producing 14 types of
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
The vaccinations are being exported to Eritrea, Angola, Yemen
and Rwanda, he said, adding that although certain middle east
countries have requested to buy vaccinations, it has not been
realized due to transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
The institute has planned to produce 56 million doses in
1997/98 fiscal year starting on July 8, 1997, according to the
director.

<HEADLINE> Short Calls for Business Partnership on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Clare Short, Britain's International
Development Secretary, today called for a partnership of business
leaders to discuss ways of tackling world poverty and urged
business to give strong backing to the growing ethical movement.
</P>
<P>
"Business must be a partner with government and others in the
great development challenge", the secretary told an audience at
the Institute of Directors.
</P>
<P>
In a key speech where she set out Britain's new broader
approach to international development, she stressed the central
role the private sector played in eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary also warned business against complacency,
particularly in the face of growing public concern over human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Short said: "Consumers are increasinly using their power.
Two-thirds of people now say they consider a company's ethical
stance when purchasing. Clearly business cannot afford to ignore
this. Ethical business makes good business sense."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary called on business to forge a "new partnership"
with government to take up the objective of halving world poverty
by 2015 and help small and medium scale enterprises to access
developing country markets.
</P>
<P>
Short also called on them to release finance for microfinance
schemes for very small businesses and develop regional
partnerships betweek UK regions and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary said that international development was not just
a "business for soft hearts", "it requires also the hardest of
heads".
</P>
<P>
It was time, said the Secrtary, to recognise the importance of
the private sector in eliminating world poverty, and to help
harness the power of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It was true that private investment did account for vast
amounts of development assistance to the developing world, but
that, she maintained, was no cause for complacency.
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that we can increasingly work together towards a
shared sense of purpose in eliminating poverty from the globe,"
the Secretary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ratings Affirmed for Hongkong's Hang Seng Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- IBCA, Europe's international credit
rating agency, has affirmed the Individual rating assigned to Hang
Seng Bank of Hongkong at A/B.
</P>
<P>
The highest Individual rating awarded by IBCA is A.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the agency today also affirms the bank's
Legal rating of 3, which reflects Hang Seng's role as an important
member of the HSBC group.
</P>
<P>
Legal ratings are evaluated on the basis of the likelihood of
support for an institution from owners or government authorities
if it ran into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to IBCA, Hang Seng is an exceptionally profitable
bank with a highly liquid, low risk balance sheet and strong
capital ratios. Its cost to income ratio, at 25.7%, is one of the
world's lowest, and results from efficient management and a focus
in the loan book on residential mortgage loans, with high volumes
and relatively low costs.
</P>
<P>
While Hang Seng has a significant proportion of its loans
exposed to Hongkong's property market, the downturn in this market
during 1994 and 1995 did not have a significant impact on asset
quality.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng did experience an increase in bad debt levels in 1996
but its operating performance and financial condition remain
exceptionally strong by any standard.

ADDIS ABABA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian parliament,
House of People's Representatives, has approved measures to be
taken against deputies when they lose public credibility, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, a constituency can recall its deputy if
15,000 voters endorse the request or if the majority of members
of the District Council vote to recall the deputy, said the

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils Advanced Armored Fire-Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel has developed an advanced
armored fire-control system which allows tanks to shoot attack
helicopters out of the sky, according to a report of the state-run
Israel Television this evening.
</P>
<P>
The system, called the Baz, enables armored vehicles to shoot
in all conditions at moving targets on land and in the air. The
Baz was developed by El-Op Electro Optics industries and Elbit
Systems Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The project was led by Yisrael Tal, who in the 1970s initiated
the development of the Merkava tank and is now a senior official
in the Defense Ministry. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Armored
Corps, Tank Development Authority, and Ammunition Corps, also were
involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Baz is meant to be installed in the Merkava Mark-3 tank and
industry executives said it will significantly improve the tank's
performance.
</P>
<P>
"There are many benefits of this system compared to the fire
control systems of the previous generation," said Avi Azrad,
deputy director-general of El-Op, "among them the ability to carry
out battle missions during the day, night, in difficult weather
conditions, the ability to fire at moving targets such as tanks,
and those flying at altitudes such as attack helicopters."
</P>
<P>
The system received Israel Prize for Defense at the
Presidential Residence in Jerusalem Monday. "This is a unique
system, the fruit of original and advanced ideas," said Ya'acov
Hazan, one of the developers of the Baz at El-Op.
</P>
<P>
"Integrated with other Merkava tanks, the Baz places the
Merkava in the first line of the top tanks in the world,"
said Hazan.

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has approved a package of
emergency medical aid worth 700,000 ECUs (some 910,000 U.S.
dollars) for Bulgaria, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO), will enable European non-governmental organizations to
supply and distribute medicines and medical supplies over the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
The grant will enable Deutsche Artzgemeinschaft fur
medizinische zusammenarbeit of Germany and Medecins sans

centers in Bulgaria over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has had a turbulent transition since the collapse of
one-party rule in 1989. Medicines and medical supplies are among
the country's most urgent needs, for both hospitals and
government-run institutions such as homes for the elderly and
children.
</P>

LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will line up with U.S. President Bill Clinton in demanding that
NATO's planned expansion should be limited to only three
countries, according to British government sources.
</P>
<P>
Blair is intending to take a robust line against France and
other NATO members which are pushing for five countries to join in
the first wave of NATO enlargement, Downing Street sources were
quoted as saying on the eve of the NATO Summit opening today in
Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that Blair will veto any attempt to include
Romania and Slovenia along with the preferred front-runners,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister is also to tell NATO leaders at the Madrid
summit that adding three more nations to the NATO alliance is a
"bold step", insisting on the American and British position on
"only three" must prevail.
</P>
<P>
The only concession Britain is prepared to make will be to go
along with the French commitment in the summit communique relating
to the next phase of the enlargement program, provided that no
countries are specifically named for the second wave, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair is unlikely to propose any countries for NATO
membership except Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, they
added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defends its Record on Fight Against Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has defended its record on
the fight against money laundering, saying strict Central Bank
supervision ensured that dirty money was consistently turned
away from the island.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Central Bank Afxentis Afxentiou announced at an
international conference on money laundering, which opened Monday
here, that "in the international fight against money laundering,
I am proud to say that Cyprus can be a model for many countries
of the world."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has signed both international conventions on money
laundering, namely U.N. Vienna Convention of 1988 and the Council
of Europe Convention of 1990, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus "has in place a very modern money laundering
legislation, extremely tight regulations and a vigorous policy
against money laundering," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Philippou, the central bank's chief senior manager,
who outlined the measures Cyprus is taking to fight international
financial crimes, said that Cyprus set up a special unit in
December 1996 to investigate cases of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Central Bank introduced a monthly reporting
system of large cash deposits in excess of 10,000 U.S. dollars
and unusual transfers routed through Cyprus, Philippou said.
</P>
<P>
Both statements by Afxentiou and Philippou, which are
available today, were designed to counter allegations in Western
media and by the U.S. State Department that Cyprus was not doing
enough to counter money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"All the indications available so far point to the fact that
Cyprus has not yet experienced a money laundering problem," said
Philippou.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is examining issues such as the
impact of organized crimes on national and international financial
systems, and suggestions for developing a response to
international organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Afxentiou has put at 500 billion to 1 trillion U.S. dollars
the amount of money laundered every year across the world, of
which, he said, 70 percent is drug-related.

JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) told a press conference in
Windhoek, Namibia today that he was not opposed to the United
Nations investigating alleged human rights abuses in his country.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabila also insisted that the UN investigations must
not ignore the violations of human rights committed during the
Mobutu era.
</P>
<P>
"If they (UN Human Rights Commission) have to start their
investigation, they must start... when (former Zairean president)
Mobutu (Sese Seko) was in power," Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who ruled Zaire for 32 years, was forced to leave the
country before the military forces led by Kabila conquered the
capital of Kinshasa in May.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in Windhoek on Monday for a two-day visit to
Namibia, which is his second official visit out of his new DRC
since taking power in May.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Kabila and his Namibian counterpart Sam
Nujoma held talks over the possibility of Namibia drawing water
from the Congo River, bilateral cooperation in the fields of
transport, communications and economic relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two state leaders signed a general cooperation treaty
before the press conference was held, informed sources said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Feels Urgent Need for Pan-Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership feels the
urgent need for holding a Pan-Arab Summit in the pinch of Israeli
arrogance, the Egyptian MENA news agency today quoted a
Palestinian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it urgent that such a summit to be held to counter
Israel's arrogance, repeated aggression on our sanctities,
confiscation of land and freeze of the Mideast peace process,"
said Mohamed Sobieh, the Palestinian permanent delegate to the
Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Sobieh was quoted as speaking to Saudi newspaper "Al Riyad" in
an interview that such a summit is necessary "at this difficult
moment for the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
Venue and date of this summit will be set through recent
consultations, contacts and coordination among Arab leaders, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is pushing the region
into danger, he said, noting that the Palestinian people will
continue to defend their rights and land by all means.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli talks have been bogged down since March
by the Jewish state's construction of a new settlement in the
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The West Bank town of Hebron has been the scene of almost daily
clashes since an Israeli woman put up posters on Palestinian shops
a week ago depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a pig.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have also accused Israeli troops and Jewish
settlers of breaking into an Arab school in Hebron and ransacking
and tearing copies of Koran.
</P>
<P>
In face of escalating clashes in the Palestinian territories,
the Cairo-based Arab League is considering the possibilities of
holding an Arab summit to discuss the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Zakareya
Mohammed Ismail, said Sunday that the diplomatic moves and
bilateral contacts taking place among Arab leaders send a message
on the dangers of the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab League has not yet received any Palestinian
request to convene the summit, he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Situation Improves Greatly in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- With the July 19 general election
drawing near, it is possible to traverse the entire length and
breadth of Liberia without any fear of attack or molestation, the
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A NAN correspondent who entered into Liberia through a village
on the border with Cote d'Ivoire said people now moved freely
both day and night.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the tremendous efforts by the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to restore normalcy in the
country, the incidence of armed banditry and pervasive
lawlessness has ceased everywhere, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The more than 400-km journey from Nimba county at the border,
where former warlord Charles Taylor launched his anti-government
rebellion thus igniting the civil war seven years ago, showed the
ECOMOG has full and firm control.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOMOG checkpoints are a regular
feature along the entire route that cuts through thickly wooded
forests of lush-green vegetation and leads to the capital
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
With the presence of the ECOMOG, some drivers and passengers
who regularly ply the road said the fear of attack has for long
become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, night clubs at the city center are usually open
even on week days, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The multinational ECOMOG, after its success in disarming and
demobilizing the warring factions in the country earlier this
year, has promised to ensure security for Liberians.
</P>
<P>
It currently concentrates on keeping a safe environment
favorable for the country's first post-war elections.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Textile Makers Fight Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Textile Manufacturers
Association (NTMA) has called on the federal government to
disallow foreign textile fabrics destined for neighboring west
African countries to be shipped through Nigerian ports.
</P>
<P>
Such fabrics were never taken out of the country and the
practice should thus be stopped, said NTMA President Walid
Jibrin, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence has shown that such fabrics do not leave Nigeria and
in the absence of any mechanism to ensure that they get to their
countries of destination, we consider it in the national interest
that their transhipment should be stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has made a decision recently that
escorts would accompany such goods to their destinations to
ensure that they are not dumped in the local market.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it would stem the spate of dumping," the NTMA
president said, adding that the computerization of import duty
assessment by the department of customs and excise would stem
sharp practices of some importers of finished textiles.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which boasts several large textile companies mainly
set up by businessmen from Hong Kong, has been textile production
and export base in west Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Vacationing in Karelia Russian
President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday signed four decrees, including
ordering to pay off all back wages owed to state employees by the
end of the year, according to a report reaching here from
Petrozavodsk.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax said that in compliance with the decree arrears to
servicemen are to be paid off by September 1.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also signed a decree to reform state-owned unitary
enterprises involved in housing construction for military
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the other two decrees deal with the
implementation of the federal Law on Production Sharing Agreements
and measures to reduce debts of oil companies to the federal
budget and state extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the fourth decree, also concerning quotas on oil
sales, would deal "a serious blow to banditry."
</P>
<P>
Before signing these decrees Yeltsin met with First
Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov, who regarded the fourth decree as
important as "the decree to renounce authorized banks".
</P>
<P>
The president said the decrees on production sharing
agreements and measures to cut down oil companies debts to the
state were of "international importance".

<HEADLINE> Cameroun to Tighten Measures to Curb Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun is going to take tighter
measures to curb illegal drug traffic and production, an official
from the National Assembly of Cameroun told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the Educational, Information and
Social Affairs Committee of the National Assembly started meeting
this afternoon to examine a new draft bill on drug control.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill was submitted to the assembly by Cameroun's
Ministry of Public Health, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local newspaper "Cameroun Tribune",
Public Health Minister Charles Etoundi has to defend the bill in
the committee.
</P>
<P>
If the bill sails successfully through the committee and
eventually through the house, a new classification and rules
binding the production and sale of drugs and similar products
will be put in place, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that Cameroun could not be left behind after
all other countries are grappling with the adverse effects of the
illegal production and traffic in drugs.
</P>
<P>
The central African sub-region and Cameroun in particular are
at a transit point between production areas of cocaine, canabis
and other drugs, and the European and North American markets.
</P>
<P>
These natural settings as well as the fact that few or no
legislative and judiciary measures exist to stamp out or
forestall the trade, have rendered the region a fertile area for
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The paper also noted that the absence of strict control
measures on the importation and the sale of these drugs on the
streets contributes largely to their abusive use in the country.

The fire, started Saturday by a man using illegal fireworks,

<HEADLINE> US Ships on Alert for Possible Cambodian Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has yet to
decide whether to evacuate its citizens from Cambodia, but three
ships carrying marines and helicopters are put on alert in Japan
in case an order comes forward for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The commander-in-chief of the Pacific Command in Hawaii has
ordered the three ships, the Belleau, the Fort McHenry and the
Dubuque, on alert "for their potential use (for) evacuating
non-combatants and maybe third country nationals" from Cambodia,
Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Com. Karen Jeffries said at a briefing
today.
</P>
<P>
The three ships, carrying several hundred marines and
helicopters, are now based at Sasebo in Japan. It would take them
four days to reach athe Cambodian coast if they receive the order
for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
But some other officials said the evacuation looks less likely
as the situation is actually easing after days of ferocious
fighting between rival factions in Phnom Penn, the capital of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The Pentagon is preparing for possible contingency if
something were to be necessary but so far the situation is
becoming more calm rather than less calm," they said.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is prudent preparation for a possible future need
but not something that's actually going on right now," they added.
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh fighting began Saturday after troops loyal to
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen moved against those supporting First
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- French investment in Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries will promote
regional economy, South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin said today.
</P>
<P>
When opening the French Technologies '97 Exhibition in
Midrand, Gauteng Province today, Erwin said the prospects for
French investment in South Africa and the SADC are good.
</P>
<P>
"This (the SADC) is not just an area that absorbs aid. The
objective is to become a major meaningful economic power in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is growing cooperation between South Africa and France,
especially in the area of joint production, which should be
actively pursued in the future, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Foreign Trade Jacques Dondoux, who opened
the exhibition, said the French presence in South Africa has
greatly increased since 1994, noting "France has become the
fourth most important investor in South Africa."
</P>
<P>
However, Dondoux added that France still has more work to do.
"Our companies supply under four percent of South African
imports, an inadequate percentage compared to the results
achieved by our main European partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 145 French companies, including Michelin, Peugeot,
Dassault and Total are represented at the exhibition. Eighty
percent of exhibitors are small and medium-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Britain Makes New Efforts to Ease EU's Beef Export Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- British Agricultural Minister Jack
Cunningham announced a new two-pronged effort today to ease the
European Union ban on Britain's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Last month EU veterinary scientists rejected a British proposal
for a scheme allowing cattle from herds which never suffered from
the fatal disease to be certified safe for export.
</P>
<P>
The EU vets said they were concerned about the government's
ability to identify and trace all cattle at risk, but that if the
proposals were amended to address five weaknesses which they
identified, the scheme would prove acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham told parliament that the proposal was now being
revised to take account of the vets' criticisms.
</P>
<P>
"Eligibility for the scheme would be more restricted than
originally proposed, but it would still be open in principle to
producers in all parts of the United Kingdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that in parallel the government was
developing a new proposal for an export scheme based on the age of
cattle, details of which would be announced after exploratory
talks with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
</P>
<P>
"We have put our ideas to the Commission about both schemes,
and will press them with equal vigor," Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been trying in vain to persuade the EU to allow it
to export beef since March of last year when the EU decided to ban
Britain's beef export for fear of getting "mad cow disease."

PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- France today called for a "return of
legal and constitutional order" to Cambodia and urged the two
conflicting parties to resume dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the use of violence and we are very attentive to it
that fundamental liberties be respected," French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anita Limido said.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the two parties for dialogue, and for a return to
the 1991 Paris accords (which renounced violence)," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the elections, scheduled for next May, should be held
as planned and it should be "just, equitable and organized under
incontestable conditions."
</P>
<P>
But Limido refrained from saying whether the French government
will continue to make contacts with Cambodia's First Prime
Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who has fled to France after
heavy fighting broke out last Saturday between his troops and the
troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Limido said that so far no plan has been made to evacuate some
2,000 French expatriates living in Cambodia, most of them in or
near the capital Phnom Penh. There are also an unknown number of
French tourists in other parts of Cambodia.
</P>

Ranariddh today flew to Washington and New York to seek support

<HEADLINE> Canada's Ontario Hydro Dumps Metal into Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Ontario Hydro has admitted
dumping thousands of tons of metal emissions into the Great
Lakes, media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The crown corporation has shown " a lack of respect for the
environment", President Allan Kupcis admitted following the
release of a report on metal emissions at power plants on the
Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
The report said the corporation had released 1,813 tons of
six common metals -- copper, zinc, arsenic, iron, lead and tin --
from the brass condensers at six power stations.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, more than two-thirds has been released from the
Pickering nuclear station since it went into operation in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned in late May, was conducted by two
senior Hydro staffers, a medical officer and a university
professor.
</P>
<P>
It concludes that there does not appear to be a strong
environmental ethic within the nuclear-power side of the business.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is quick to point out that testing has shown there is
evidence to suggest risk to human health.
</P>
<P>
Kupcis called the situation "disappointing and unacceptable".
He promised that his corporation will immediately fix the main
problem in its nuclear and fossil-fuel-powered generating
stations.
</P>
<P>
It will involve replacing old and inadequate copper pipes used
to carry cooling water, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Canadians Use Debit Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- More and more Canadians use debit
cards in transactions, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A survey of more than 2,000 adults found that debit card was
second only to cash as the preferred means of payment in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of those surveyed said they preferred to pay by
cash. 22 percent said they preferred to pay by debit card, up from
only 9 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The credit card was the preferred means of payment by 17
percent of those surveyed. Seven percent preferred to pay by
check, down from 12 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
With a credit card, the user gets up to 7 weeks of free credit.
Yet, the user ends up paying hefty interest if he or she fails to
pay the balance on time.
</P>
<P>
With a debit card, the amount of the purchase is withdrawn at
once, electronically, from the card user's bank account.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canadians made 676 million purchases with debit
card. This year, close to one billion purchases with debit card
are expected.
</P>
<P>
The number of purchases using credit cards is expected to be
about the same in Canada, the reports said.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Norodom Chakravuth, son of
Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, together
with several members of his staff, arrived here today, as fighting
continued in Cambodia, said a Foreign Ministry Spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's assistance is based on humanitarian consideration
and done with the clearance and concurrence of the Cambodian
authorities and Singapore is even-handed about this," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has in fact allowed relatives of both parties to the
current conflict in Cambodia to enter Singapore as and when they
have requested to do so," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 385 Singaporeans have been taken back from Phnom
Penh to Singapore with the assistance of the Singaporean Air Force
because of the deterioration of the situation there, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and 50 others injured when
fighting broke out on Saturday in the Cambodian capital between
forces loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> France Agrees with New U.N. Mission on Massacre in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed agreement with
the decision by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to
send a new mission to investigate alleged massacre of Hutu
refugees by the troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila in Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRCongo).
</P>
<P>
But France warned that the new mission must have the same
mandate of a previously planned mission by the U.N. Human Rights
Commission which was rejected by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Annan Tuesday yielded to the demand by Kabila to replace the
previous investigation team with a new team of experts, because of
the presence within it of a Chilean lawyer, Roberto Garreton, who
said he had enough evidence of massacres to warrant a full
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"France is driven by a double concern: on the one hand, the
mission of inquiry should take place as quickly as possible to
answer the preoccupations of the international community, " said a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman warned that the United Nations should not
"create a grave precedent by giving up a mission given mandate by
the Human Rights Commission, at the request of the accused state,
or to change its mandate."
</P>
<P>
He also deplored what he described as "the attitude of refusal
by Mr. Kabila" toward the U.N. investigation into alleged
massacres of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Be Better Tomorrow: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
 the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), today said
with confidence that Hong Kong will become better in the future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Ninth Assembly of the Lutheran World Federation
held here, Tung said that Hong Kong entered a new era just over a
week ago. "On July 1, after 156 years of separation, Hong Kong
celebrated joyfully its reunification with China."
</P>
<P>
"The historic event filled Hong Kong people with pride and
confidence," "because for the first time in our history, Hong Kong
 people took on the solemn responsibility of managing our own
affairs" and "because we know that under the 'one country, two
systems' concept, Hong Kong will be even better tomorrow," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive stressed that the smooth and peaceful
handover of Hong Kong represents a new testament to the vision and
 ingenuity of the "one country, two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, which provides the constitutional
framework for the HKSAR, the central government of the People's
Republic of China has granted Hong Kong a high-degree of autonomy
and has guaranteed the continuation of its previous systems and
way of life for many years to come, he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
"The HKSAR government will preserve the existing freedoms and
lifestyle, and ensure that the people of Hong Kong will continue
to enjoy the freedoms of speech, assembly, association, press and
other freedoms," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, "one of the important freedoms that my
government will preserve is, of course, the freedom of religion."
</P>
<P>
Article 141 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates that the HKSAR
government shall not restrict the freedom of religious belief,
interfere in the internal affairs of religious organizations or
restrict religious activities which do not contravene the laws of
Hong Kong, Tung added.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Passes Immigration Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Legislators of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today pushed through an
immigration bill in all three readings.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration (Amendment) No 5 Bill was tabled to the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) for passage into law today
at the interim body's first sitting at the Legislative Council
Building in Central, Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bill, a certificate of entitlement scheme is
introduced for children born, in the Chinese inland areas, to Hong
Kong permanent residents. These children are entitled to the right
of abode in Hong Kong, according to the Basic Law of the HKSAR,
but they must come in a legal and orderly way.
</P>
<P>
When entering Hong Kong, they are required to have one-way
permits -- the valid documents to migrate to Hong Kong issued by
concerned departments in the inland areas, plus a "certificate of
entitlement" issued by the Immigration Department of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Joint investigations on the status of applicants will be
conducted by the inland and Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
In moving the Bill to the interim legislature, Peter Lai, the
secretary for security, said that the scheme would ensure that an
estimated 66,000 inland-born children with the right of abode
would enter the SAR legally and in an orderly manner, and would
enjoy their entitled rights and welfare.
</P>
<P>
A bills committee under the PLC went through the legislation
clause-by-clause at a six-hour meeting Tuesday, after the Bill was
 endorsed by the Executive Council during its first post-handover
sitting early in the day.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, French Oil Companies Sign Technical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), the
oil producing arm of the state-owned umbrella Petroleum
Corporation, and French Total Oil Company signed here today a
consultancy agreement for technical services in the fields of gas
and oil.
</P>
<P>
The three-and-half-year agreement was signed after several
months of talks, KOC's board chairman and managing director Khalid
Yusif Al-Fleij said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the French company would supply
technical expertise and know-how to the KOC in developing oil
reservoirs in the Gulf oil rich state.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fleij said the deal would provide a good opportunity for
training Kuwaiti employees on modern techniques along with the
operational methods which have enabled Total to be one of
the successful oil companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal would also allow the KOC to use the modern
technologies available at Total, which became the first French
company to sign a deal with the KOC concerning operations inside
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the deal stipulates that Total would
make available to KOC its technology, expertise and know-how
to help KOC select the most effective approach to develop
its oil reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement mainly involves the provision of
technical consultancy and advice for the neutral zone oil
field which straddles the border with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The neutral zone produces about 240,000 barrels of oil per
day, which is shared by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia under a
boundary agreement which dates back to 1922.
</P>
<P>
The KOC currently has a sustainable production capacity of 2.4
million barrels of oil per day and plans to raise that to 3
million barrels per day by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait actually produces about 2 million barrels of oil
per day in line with the quota set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The KOC has similar technical service accords with British
Petroleum and U.S. firm Chevron.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng To Open New Inland Area Branch After HK Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank has become the
first bank in Hong Kong to win permission from the People's Bank
of China to open a branch in Shanghai after Hong Kong's return to
its motherland on July 1, a press release said today.
</P>
<P>
In the press release circulated here, the bank announced that
it has been permitted to upgrade its representative office in
Shanghai to a branch, marking a significant strengthening of its
presence in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch will be the second inland area branch to be
set up by the bank, following the opening of its Guangzhou branch
in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai has become the key financial center on the mainland,
given its strategic location and the vast investment opportunities
the city offers to foreign investors," said Chairman of the bank
Lee Quo-wei.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The bank will be located in Pudong, the flourishing
financial hub which is the Chinese government's pilot site for the
conduct of RMB (China's currency) operations by overseas banks."
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, major projects financed by the
bank in Shanghai include the construction of Yangpu Bridge, the
Shanghai container port, the reconstruction of old districts, the
development of residential and commercial property projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Pudong branch is expected to be opened before the
end of this year. It will have an initial working capital of
convertible foreign currencies equivalent to RMB 100 million and a
staff of about 30.
</P>
<P>
The bank's presence in the inland areas dates back to 1985,
when it opened its first inland area representative office in
Shenzhen, South China. Its Xiamen (a big city in South China) and
Shanghai representative offices were established in 1986 and 1991,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Respects Poll Body's Decision on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today he respected the decision made by the Commission on
Elections (Comelec) to reject the petition seeking to alter the
constitution so that Ramos can run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said the Comelec has all
the prerogative in exercising its decision throwing the petition
of the People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action
(Pirma), a pro-Ramos private group.
</P>
<P>
The poll body Tuesday voted unanimously to dismiss the PIRMA's
petition signed by about 5.6 million people, who support changes
to the country's 1987 constitution to lift term limits on all
elective government officials, including the president.
</P>
<P>
"The Comelec decision speaks for itself and the Comelec should
be given the due credit for exercising their prerogatives in that
manner," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Comelec made the decision based on the ruling
issued by the Supreme Court which permanently stops the Comelec
from entertaining any people's initiative to change the charter.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that it is now up to the PIRMA whether to seek a
review of the high tribunal's ruling or not.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, which was enacted in 1987 to prevent
dictatorship in the country, stipulates that the president can
only serve one single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
But the PIRMA, established by Ramos' supporters in late 1996,
said Ramos' term should be extended due to his contribution to
economic boom in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has claimed on many occasions that he will step down
after his term of office expires in June 1998. But he also
clarified that the people has the legal right to propose
amendments to the constitution.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov said today that the government's total wage
debt to state employees and army personnel amounts to 30.4
trillion roubles (about 5,287 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov told a briefing that the debt to state employees and
extra budgetary funds makes 25 trillion roubles (about 4,347
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Tuesday setting
September 1 as the deadline for clearing the wage debt totalling
5.4 trillion roubles (about 939 million U.S. dollars). The debt
include 4.5 trillion roubles to the army and 900 billion roubles
to the Interior Ministry's services.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said wages are paid regularly or delayed for a month
only in 15 regions of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The worst situation is in some of Russia's Far East regions,
where wages have not been paid for six or seven months.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Yeltsin also ordered the government to collect due
tax from the Russian oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said that this is bound to curtail the tax arrears of
oil companies by three trillion roubles by the end of this year.

MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the Philippines, together with other members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), is deeply
concerned with the situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference at the Presidential
Palace, President Ramos said that although there was a lull in the
fighting in Cambodia at present, its fundamental political
situation remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Ramos urged the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Hun Sen, to exert every effort to set aside their
differences and work together in the interests of the whole
nation's reconciliation, peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that Cambodia might be rejected by ASEAN,
Ramos called on all parties and people to stop making speculations
on this sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the seriousness and sensitivity of this matter, I
would suggest that we all await the results of the meeting (of
ASEAN foreign ministers) and until the foreign ministers shall
have submitted their views and recommendations to their respective
leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers are expected to meet Thursday in
Kuala Lumpur to discuss the situation in Cambodia and its planned
entry to ASEAN this month.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It plans to admit Burma, Cambodia
and Laos into the community this month.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today expressed optimism about the reform of the
Russian Armed Forces, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a session of the commission for the military reform,
Chernomyrdin said the reform envisaged cutting defense
spending and minimizing losses before 1998.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the army reform cannot be carried out without
"taking into account the economy, without thorough and accurate
calculation, without putting into order the finances of the Army
and the Navy."
</P>
<P>
This economy drive should result in the changing of the
numerical strength of the Armed Forces and of the existing
armaments program, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the third session of the commission, will discuss
how to carry out President Boris Yeltsin's instructions on the
army reform among other topics.

<HEADLINE> NATO Faces Risks, Challenges and Opportunities, Says Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is facing risks, challenges and opportunities
in the Euro-Atlantic region, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
told a news briefing at the end of the two-day summit here.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's summit meeting of the newly-established
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) was the first of its kind
between the heads of states and governments of NATO and its
Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus today was on the risks, challenges and opportunities
for effective cooperative security in the Euro-Atlantic area,"
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
EAPC, set up in May 1997, replaced the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council established at the end of 1991. It provides
the overarching framework for political and security-related
consultations and for enhanced cooperation under PfP.
</P>
<P>
Solana told reporters that the participants talked about how
EAPC could most effectively serve the interest of its 44 member
countries and contribute to their security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting reinforced the conviction that the security
of all allied and partner countries was inseparably linked. "EAPC
will be of fundamental importance in developing NATO's
relationship with Partners," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Welcomes DPRK's Decision to Join Four-Way Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
today welcomed the decision of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) to join the four-party talks with South Korea, the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
"It is inspiring that an agreement to open a preliminary
meeting to the four-party talks has been made," Kim told an
unification conference in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from South Korea, the DPRK, the United States and
China will meet in New York on August 5 to work out the details of
the four-way talks, such as the agenda, level of representation,
venue and date.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he hoped that the four-party talks will be opened as
soon as possible and that the meeting will enable his country and
the DPRK to begin sincere discussions on ways to establish
permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring solid peace of the peninsula is an urgent task not
only for the future of our people but also for the stability of
Northeast Asia as a whole," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Kim said another important task is to reduce tension and
restore mutual confidence between his country and the DPRK by
promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that trade between South Korea and the DPRK is steadily
growing. South Korea is expanding investments in its northern
neighbor, supporting the construction of nuclear reactors there
and providing civilian food aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we plan to discuss ways to help the North (DPRK)
solve its food shortage problems fundamentally at the four-party
talks," said the president.

<HEADLINE> Bill Moved To Suspend Seven Pre-handover Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A bill to suspend seven
pre-handover laws was tabled to the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for
the first and second readings here today.
</P>
<P>
At the Council's inaugural sitting in the Legislative Council
Building starting at 2:30 this afternoon, Anson Chan, the Chief
Secretary for Administration, moved that Legislative Provisions
(Suspension of Operation) Bill 1997 be read the second time.
</P>
<P>
The Bill aims to suspend seven Ordinances passed at the last
sitting of the pre-handover Legislative Council, Chan told the
legislators. The seven laws include five labor-related Ordinances,
Protection of the Harbor Ordinance and Hong Kong Bill of Rights
(Amendment) Ordinance 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that most of these Ordinances have far reaching
implications for government policies and operations, but they have
not been fully considered before enactment.
</P>
<P>
"As they represent a major departure from government policies,
we consider it prudent to review each piece of legislation
carefully to assess the social, economic and political
implications," the chief secretary for administration told the
Council.
</P>
<P>
She urged the PLC members to proceed as quickly as possible
with the Bill in order to minimize the changes effected by the
seven Ordinances that have already come into force.
</P>
<P>
Chan appealed to the PLC members to resume the second reading
debate on the Bill at the Council's sitting next week and to pass
the Bill.
</P>
<P>
Three other Bills were also moved today for the first and
second readings, including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Passport Bill, Chinese Nationality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill
and United Nations Sanctions Bill.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Report on European Demographic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- There will be more people leaving
the workforce than entering it in the European Union (EU)
countries after the year 2010, a report adopted today by EU's
executive body, the European Commission, shows.
</P>
<P>
The demographic report, which covers the period from 1995 to
2015, focuses on three main areas -- the impact of demographic
change on the labor market, the regional dimension of aging, and
the demographic situation in the countries which have applied to
join the EU.
</P>
<P>
The significant decrease in birth rates from 1970 onwards has
resulted in fewer people joining the labor force since 1990, says
the report.
</P>
<P>
Over the period from 1995 to 2005, the active population in the
15 EU member states may moderately increase by some 6.9
million. In the decade beginning from 2005, a drop of 2.1 million
is expected, it says.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that the countries which have applied to
join the EU will also experience a significant fall in the working
population after 2010.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan can hold the future in its
hand and pursue a route of peaceful development only if it can
correctly recall its role in history, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin told former Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata here today.
</P>
<P>
"The unforgotten past will be a lesson for the future," Jiang
told Tsutomu this afternoon in Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of
the central government.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Tsutomu, who is also the leader of the Taiyoto, or
Sun Party of Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral relations have been greatly expanded in
all fields since the two countries normalized their diplomatic
relations 25 years ago. The two sides should pay twice as much
attention to the hard-won friendly relationship and cherish it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that leaders and statesmen of both countries should
proceed from a strategic perspective and handle bilateral
relations so as to secure a long-term, steady development of the
relations along a healthy track.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates Tsutomu for his active participation in
the work to push forward the development of relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he wishes that Tsutomu and his party will exert even
more influence and play a bigger role in promoting the
good-neighborly ties between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu congratulated Jiang on Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
He said that late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's great concept
of "one country, two systems" will go down in history as being a
successful formula for Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu said that in the year that marks the 25th anniversary
of the normalization of bilateral relations between the two
countries, Japan should examine itself even more closely and
correctly recognize the history, so as to secure a healthy, stable
development of relations with China.
</P>

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Hijacks a DPRK Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy was closely
monitoring a cargo ship of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), which was abducted by a Tamil rebel suicide squad on
Tuesday afternoon, security sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that one of the 38 DPRK crew members on board
the ship of Morang Bong was killed by the rebels of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and any attack on the ship would
harm the unarmed 37 other crew members.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross has been approached by the ship
owners to secure the release of the vessel and the crew, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has not been any report from the LTTE as to why
it abducted the vessel and crew or as to what their demands are,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been chartered by traders from Colombo to carry
essential goods to Point Pedro for civilians in the North of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It was returning from Point Pedro after unloading its cargo to
north of Mullaitivu, over 200 kilometers from Colombo, when the
LTTE rebels hijacked it.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- About 19 of the 45 districts in
Uganda are facing a famine caused by a prolonged drought,
according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision paper said the drought which started early this
month is likely to last into mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The drought has been aggravated since rains failed to fall
during the rainy season in March and April this year.
</P>
<P>
The drought, forecasted in June by weathermen, had come almost
one month earlier in some parts of eastern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Members of the parliamentary Committee on Social Service will
begin a three-day tour of eastern Uganda to assess the situation
there, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Booming in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing has
had a total of 74.41 billion yuan of GDP in the first half of this
year, a year-on-year increase of 11.2 percent, according to Tang
Long, director of the city's Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture increased by 3.2 percent, industrial production,
11.9 percent, while the service sector reported a growth of 11
percent, indicating sound economic development, Tang told a news
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rapid industrial increase to state
enterprises, especially those that are technology-intensive in the
Zhongguancun High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, known as
China's Silicon Valley, which contributed 60 percent to the growth
produced by the state industrial sector in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets was kept at a low level, with
investment in real estate dropping 7.1 percent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Exports were expected to collect 1.1 billion US dollars, an
increase of 1.4 percent, while imports totaled to 1.46 billion US
dollars, up 5.1 percent. The city used overseas investment 930
million US dollars, rising 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residents' incomes grew steadily, with an average increase of
8.5 percent in workers' wages, and of two percent in farmers'
revenues in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Tang said, however, that this economic foundation still is not
good enough for sustained and steady development of Beijing's
economic performance, and an insufficient demand and irrational
economic structure remain the major problems.

<HEADLINE> China Emerges as Mastercard's Second Largest Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second
largest market for Mastercard International, next only to the
United States, according to sources at a company meeting held here
today.
</P>
<P>
In yet another effort to tap the China market, Mastercard today
signed an agreement with the Shanghai Golden Card Project, under
which more than 1,000 membership machines in this economic center
of China will link up with the international card issuer's global
ATM network.
</P>
<P>
Mastercard has successfully expanded its business in China
over the past ten-odd years. Its members in China include the
country's big-four state banks -- the Bank of China, the China
Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and
the Agricultural Bank of China -- and the new commercial banks
such as the Bank of Communications, the Guangdong Development Bank
and the Merchants Bank.
</P>
<P>
Official reports show that Mastercard had issued 15 million
cards in China by the first quarter of this year and its card
business in China reached 75 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Andre Sekulic, vice chairman of Mastercard in the Asia-Pacific
region, said that as more overseas people visit China and do
business in China, together with an increasing number of Chinese
going abroad, Mastercard will have greater prospects for
development in the country in the future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mastercard opened its third China office here, with
the other two in Hong Kong and Beijing.

</P>
<P>
With a daily water-supply capacity of 400,000 cubic meters, the

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Varsity Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- the University of Nairobi was shut
down today as Opposition parties continue to call for more
actions to press for constitutional reforms before the coming
General Elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Francis Gichaga, Vice-Chancellor
of the university, said despite the appeal for calm in the
circular released on Tuesday, the situation on the main campus
had continued to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the closure was necessitated by the
violent actions taken by students since last weekend when
political unrest broke out in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, students from the university took to the
streets to demonstrate following reports carried by Daily Nation
which said four fellow students had died of wounds in the Monday
clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
However, police spokesman Assistant Commissioner Peter
Kimanthi denied the report, saying that it was "pure falsehood".
</P>
<P>
He said only two students died in incidents which were
completely unrelated to the confrontations between riot police
and Opposition supporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that one student died yesterday at
Kenyatta Hospital. "We do not know what caused his death but we
are investigating," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Another student was knocked down by a hit-and-run lorry. It
was a road accident and we are also investigating the accident,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
When the students blocked the main road in the capital city of
Nairobi this morning at the height of the morning rush hour,
Kenyan police moved in to confront the rioting students.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Bourse Nosedives on Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market today
continued to nosedive on rising fears that the Central Bank will
have to further raise its interest rates to protect a possible
devaluation of the country's currency peso.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Philippine composite index (Phisix), which began
to decline Monday due to fears over the volatility of the foreign
exchange market, surprisingly breached the 2,600 psychological
support level today.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix, the main index for the Philippine Stock Exchange,
plummeted by 109.46 points or 4 percent, the biggest drop in two
and a half years, to 2,589.2 points. The broader all shares index
also declined by 33.84 points to 845.25.
</P>
<P>
All subindices suffered decline, with the mining sector
incurring the biggest drop of 252.3 points to 3,680.42. The
previously-battered property sector also sank by 88.2 points.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 6.5 billion with a value of
2.23 billion pesos (85 million U.S. dollars). The decliners
continued to outnumber the advancers by 141 to 10, with 39 other
issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Phisix shed 54.49 points, or 1.98 percent, to
close 2,698.66.
</P>
<P>
The tumble in the local bourse in the past few days offset
almost all the grounds the market has regained since late May when
it began to recover from a long-time decline triggered by fears of
a Thai-style financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts here said the main reason for the recent tumble
in the local bourse was the rising fears that the peso could face
greater pressure to be depreciated and the Central Bank will be
forced to further hike its overnight borrowing rates.
</P>
<P>
The peso has been under great pressure to be devalued under
waves of speculative attacks during the past several months,
particularly after the Thai government decided to float baht early
this month.
</P>
<P>
After the floatation of baht in Thailand, speculators shift to
the peso. To fend the peso off a fresh wave of speculative attack
Monday, the Philippine Central Bank raised its overnight borrowing
rates, for the third time in one week, from 20 percent to a
two-year high of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the pressure on the peso and the uncertainty in
the foreign exchange market are now spilling over into the stock
market and investors are scared by the continued jump in overnight
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
They said many investors flocked over to fixed income
securities like treasury bills rather than stocks because fixed
income securities are offering higher yields than these stocks.
</P>
<P>
The analysts expected the market to continue a downtrend in the
near future since foreign and big institutional investors remain
shy away from the local bourse and continue to wait and see the
situation in the local foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
But analysts also said despite today's drastic drop in the
Phisix, the fundamentals of the local bourse are still sound. Once
the Thai crisis is resolved and furor over the peso dies down,
investors will return to the stock market, they said.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 16 illegal beer bars
have been closed down recently in Kanyama compound of the capital
city of Lusaka as the crackdown on unlicensed bars gains momentum
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted a local official as saying on
Tuesday that two truckloads of beer have been seized in the
operation and the raids will continue in several parts of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is promising and illegal bars will soon be a
thing of the past, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that anyone selling beer illegally are doing so at
their own risk because the council will not hesitate to
confiscate the liquor.
</P>
<P>
Most of Zambians are said to be addicted to beer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the official also called on the public to look out
for vendors selling beddings and other valuables from
door-to-door because the council suspects that the items could
be stolen from the dead at graveyards.

<P>
BUDAPEST, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Horn
Gyula announced today that his country will hold a referendum on
whether it will join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
If the majority of the citizens refuse to seek a membership of
NATO, Hungary may not join the international organization, Horn
said.
</P>
<P>
Horn's announcement came after the NATO leaders decided to
invite Hungary to join the Western military alliance in its first
wave of expansion. The invitation has been welcomed by all
political parties in the National Assembly, which hail it as a
diplomatic victory won by two terms of government over the past
seven years through " strenuous efforts."
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders meeting at a summit in Madrid on Tuesday moved
towards an historic agreement on admitting former Soviet bloc
enemies -- Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, as members of
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The United States is insisting NATO's first wave of enlargement
be limited to the three countries and rejecting a drive led by
France and Italy for Slovenia and Romania to be included.
</P>
<P>
France insists, however, Slovenia and Romania are crucial to
security on NATO's southeastern flank.

<HEADLINE> Major Grain Growing Provinces Report Smooth Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Grain purchase is operating
smoothly in major grain growing provinces, with Jiangsu, Anhui and
Shaanxi exceeding State-set quotas.
</P>
<P>
Anhui and Jiangsu in east China bought in 1.19 million and 1.61
million tons of wheat respectively, and purchases in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province amounted to 0.73 million tons, according
to sources with the state administration of grain reserves.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces also tried to buy grain at a protective
price to protect farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
China has had a bumper summer harvest this year. Prior to the
peak purchase season, the State Council urged localities to try
every means to guarantee the smooth purchase of grain and guard
against a price drop resulting from too many sales.
</P>
<P>
So far, no IOU notes have been issued to farmers and the
quality of purchased grain is reportedly good.

<HEADLINE> Forum for Economic Coop Set Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today
launched a National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) to provide
a framework for cooperation among private sector, the government
and the employees.
</P>
<P>
The forum, comprising 62 members from the private sector,
non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and civil
society, would be chaired by Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira with Mugabe as its patron.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said important issues to be resolved by the forum
should include formulation of strategies to mobilize resources
for investment and the indigenization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
''I would like to stress that the planned targets should be
aimed at those areas that are catalytical to overall economic
growth such as mobilization of financial resources for the medium
and long term investment, acceleration of commercialization and
privatization of state enterprises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He mandated the forum to recommend strategies that could be
used to promote participation of the indigenous people in the
mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, Mugabe said, could use the forum to spell
out the assistance it required from the government to facilitate
that promotion.
</P>
<P>
On the participation of the labor force, Mugabe said the
challenge was to ensure that workers had ownership in the
production process through equity participation and other
facilitative mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the forum is based on the smart partnership
philosophy which is an ambitious step to economically empower
developing nations and ward off domination of rich nations
through accelerated growth and fostering relationships among
government, private sector and labor.

<HEADLINE> China Pumps 71 Million Tons of Onshore Crude in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's onshore oil production is
maintaining strong growth momentum this year, and the country had
turned out 71.07 million tons of crude and 8.41 billion cu m of
gas by the end of this June.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country's onshore daily output in the
first half year increased by 4,389 tons compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Onshore crude production has two distinguishing characteristics:
</P>
<P>
The aging oilfields in east China maintain stable oil output
and have completed 50.37 percent of the State-set annual output
target, while the newly-developed oil fields in West China have
witnessed sharp rises in oil production, with average daily output
outpacing the figure of the same period of last year by 6,350 tons.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of this May, the oil fields of Daqing, Shengli,
Liaohe, Henan, Dagang and Xinjiang have applied the technologies
of polymer-propelling and injecting water into oil wells to
produce more oil.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source noted that the new technologies had helped to
increase crude output by 1.08 million tons in the first half of
the year, and an increase of 2.6 million tons is expected for the
whole year.
</P>
<P>
Great headway has also been made in onshore oil and gas
exploration; a total geological oil reserve of 545 million tons is
expected to be verified by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Local, Foreign Carmakers Compete Over S. Korean Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Both local and foreign carmakers are
shedding blood in fierce competition over the saturated market in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In the luxury sedan sector, South Korean auto makers challenge
imports with various sophisticated options while the latter
counters with reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, the largest auto maker in South Korea, offers an
exclusive back-seat television, high quality stereo system,
back-seat airbag and navigation system as options for its Dynasty
and New Grandeur, while Kia, the third largest carmaker, puts up
back-seat massage and automatic light control headlight.
</P>
<P>
Sangyong Motor Company joined the competition by equipping its
new sedan, Chairman, with various Benz technologies and navigation
system.
</P>
<P>
Importers, on the other hand, are counteracting by slashing
prices.
</P>
<P>
U.S. carmaker Chrysler cut the price of its 3.5-liter version
to 36,076 U.S. dollars from 43,123 dollars while BMW offers its
523 and 323 models with prices lowered by 2,000 to 3,000
dollars. For the 1996 735 models, BMW slashed the price tag as
much as 11,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. company, Ford, also reduced the price of 3-liter
Taurus to 32,135 dollars from 38,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the medium sized vehicle sector, South Korean companies
introduced various bargain installment plans to consolidate their
positions.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Motor's Company, the second largest carmaker in the
nation, introduced a sort of leasing installment system for the
first time among domestic carmakers on its main models Lanos,
Nubira and Leganza.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, consumers pay 60 percent of the price tag in
stallments on the condition that they return the used car in three
years.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo introduced the system despite major margin losses as a
strategy against the no-interest installment sales put forth by
its major domestic competitors Hyundai and Kia.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), the
oil producing arm of the state-owned umbrella Petroleum
Corporation, and French Total Oil Company signed here today a
consultancy agreement for technical services in the fields of gas
and oil.
</P>
<P>
The three-and-half-year agreement was signed after several
months of talks, KOC's board chairman and managing director Khalid
Yusif Al-Fleij said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the French company would supply
technical expertise and know-how to the KOC in developing oil
reservoirs in the Gulf oil rich state.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fleij said the deal would provide a good opportunity for
training Kuwaiti employees on modern techniques along with the
operational methods which have enabled Total to be one of
the successful oil companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal would also allow the KOC to use the modern
technologies available at Total, which became the first French
company to sign a deal with the KOC concerning operations inside
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the deal stipulates that Total would
make available to KOC its technology, expertise and know-how
to help KOC select the most effective approach to develop
its oil reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement mainly involves the provision of
technical consultancy and advice for the neutral zone oil
field which straddles the border with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The neutral zone produces about 240,000 barrels of oil per
day, which is shared by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia under a
boundary agreement which dates back to 1922.
</P>
<P>
The KOC currently has a sustainable production capacity of 2.4
million barrels of oil per day and plans to raise that to 3
million barrels per day by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait actually produces about 2 million barrels of oil
per day in line with the quota set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The KOC has similar technical service accords with British
Petroleum and U.S. firm Chevron.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive Praises PLA HK Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
described the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison
as a mighty and highly disciplined force and as an important
factor in keeping prosperity and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tung was greeted by the garrison's Commander, Major General Liu
Zhenwu, and its political commissar, Major General Xiong Ziren,
when he visited the Stonecutters Naval Base of the PLA Garrison in
the HKSAR earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the Chief Executive on the visit were a number of
senior officials of the HKSAR government including Chief Secretary
for Administration Anson Chan, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang,
Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung and Secretary for Home Affairs
Michael Suen.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu congratulated Tung on the establishment of
the HKSAR government and on his election to the post of the HKSAR
Chief Executive, expressing heartfelt thanks on behalf of his
garrison to the HKSAR government and HK's various circles for
their support to the PLA troops' entrance.
</P>
<P>
Tung took the opportunity to welcome the PLA Garrison on behalf
of the HKSAR government and HK citizens. He said that the
stationing of the PLA Garrison, composed of the army, navy and air
force, has not only realized China's resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, but has also provided a strong
guarantee in the defense of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Garrison has not only required its members to
familiarize themselves with the Basic Law, the Garrison Law and
relevant local legislation, but has also compiled guidelines on
these legislation to strictly govern the actions of the entire
garrison stationed in Hong Kong, Tung said, noting that their
serious attitude towards the Basic Law should be a good example
and an encouragement for Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in that the HK people and the PLA
HK troops may enforce their bilateral trust and deepen their
bilateral profound feelings in the future. He also called for
cooperation with the PLA garrison in dealing with defense affairs
in Hong Kong as the HKSAR government's unshirkable duty.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive then presented a souvenir flag to Major
General Liu. And Major General Xiong presented a souvenir to Tung.
</P>
<P>
Tung and his party also visited a missile escort craft and a
transportation vessel of the PLA garrison in the Stonecutters
Naval Base. They showed great interest as they were briefed by the
garrison's officers on the warships.

<HEADLINE> Adventurers Reach ROK After Successful Sea Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Korean expedition finished
a voyage by bamboo raft and arrived at Inchon Port in the Republic
of Korea (ROK) Tuesday afternoon, it was learned from Hangzhou
University today.
</P>
<P>
Four adventurers from the ROK and one Chinese spent 23 days on
the ten-m-long and five-m-wide raft made of 80 lengths of bamboo,
according to the Research Institute of ROK Studies of the
university, one of the sponsors of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
Their voyage across the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea
between the Chinese mainland and the Korean peninsula was said to
be the first one ever recorded in history.
</P>
<P>
The adventurers set off from Zhujiajian Island off the coast of
east China's Zhejiang Province on June 15. The straight distance
to Inchon is 1,500 kilometers. At one point they lost contact with
their headquarters for 12 days because of radio failure.
</P>
<P>
They were varifying the theorty that people used bamboo or
wooden rafts to navigate between China and the Korean peninsula
more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The success is hard evidence that Chinese and Koreans may have
contacted each other by sea as long as 3,000 years ago," said
Prof. Jin Jianren, a researcher at the institute.
</P>
<P>
Four ROK adventurers started a similar voyage from Zhujiajian
Island on July 22 last year. But typhoons forced them to call off
the attempt.

<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- France's ultra-right National Front
(FN) party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen today denounced NATO's Madrid
summit, saying that the military alliance has become an American
tool to rule Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued today, the FN described NATO as "the
privileged instrument of the United States to make the American
order reign in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The successive diktats of the Clinton administration prove
that America does not wait but for one thing from Europeans: a
pure and simple submission to their will, and the transformation
of their national armies into harkis of the new world order," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The harkis were Algerian soldiers who fought on French side
during the War of Independence from 1954 to 1962.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Greco-Turkish Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has welcomed an agreement
between Greece and Turkey to promote better relations and believed
it could facilitate in a positive manner the on-going peace effort
to find a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"The government welcomes the Greco-Turkish agreement to promote
friendly ties based upon the principles of international law and
the respect for each other's sovereignty," Cypriot government
spokesman Manolis Christofides told Cypriot journalists in New
York today, according to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on how this understanding will affect the
direct talks between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, beginning in the U.S. today, the
spokesman replied that "we hope the timing of this development
would influence the talks in a favorable way."
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government had obtained a copy of the text
agreed between the two countries at a meeting Tuesday between
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem, on the sidelines of the NATO meeting in
Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this development and believe it would have
beneficial results on the Cyprus issue, particularly at a time
when talks will begin," Christofides told the press.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that "let no one doubt Greece's support
for Cyprus in a dynamic manner in efforts to settle the Cyprus
problem."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Greece's position that a new Turkish
offensive against Cyprus would constitute casus belli still
stands.
</P>
<P>
"This position has not been annulled," he stressed, adding
that "it has not been abandoned."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have been at odds over
this east Mediterranean strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the southern part of the island would mean
war between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Sectors Maintain Stable Growth in January-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China registered a steady
industrial growth during the first half of this year, with the
industrial sectors above township-level generating an added value
of 984.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 11.6 percent
when adjusted for inflation, according to the statistics report
released by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, the state-owned sector turned out a
growth rate of 5.5 percent, and that of the collective and other
economic sectors stood at 12.5 percent and 15.1 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that the country basically achieved a
balance between the development of light and heavy industrial
sectors, during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
The light industry generated an added value of 411.9 billion
yuan, up 12.1 percent from the same period in last year; that of
heavy industry stood at 573 billion yuan, up 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the consumer industrial goods,
including color TVs, washing machines, refrigerators and household
air-conditioners, maintained a year-on-year increase margin
between 14.7 to 27 percent, while the production of bicycles,
sewing machines and electric fans saw a decline.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the country's efforts to readjust the structure of
the textile sector, the output of major textile products showed a
quicker increase than before.
</P>
<P>
In the heavy industry, the output of major raw materials
registered a steady increase, while the investment machinery
products showed a drop or slow increase in production.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate of industrial sectors hit 94.6 percent in the
first half of this year, up 0.7 percent from the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that China's industry had shown traces of a
comprehensive revival, with the enterprises generating 43.3
billion yuan in profits in the first five months this year, up
35.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector has made up for its losses since last
April, and turned out a combined profit of six billion yuan in
April and May.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out, these auspicious signs are
only the first step towards a long-term revival, and a number of
state-owned enterprises are still suffering from heavy losses.

<HEADLINE>   Howard Defends Australia's Racial Tolerance Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today defended the country's record for racial tolerance
following criticism of federal government's handling of aboriginal
affairs and anti-racist party protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the overall record, especially in the last
generation, we are a tolerant, open, harmonious society," the
prime minister said today during his visit to the Thursday Island
off Australia's Cape York Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that "we have blemishes. Of course we treated
the indigenous people of this country very badly in the past".
</P>
<P>
Howard went on to say that "we've welcomed people from the
four corners of the earth. We took more Indo-Chinese refugees per
capita than any other country in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a meticulously non-discriminatory immigration policy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, about 500 protesters here yesterday called independent
MP Pauline Hanson racist while One Nation Party Canberra branch
were holding its formation meeting, and 1,200 anti-racist
activists gathered near Melbourne Monday night in a protest
against the move by the One Nation Party to set up a branch there.
</P>
<P>
More protests are expected as the One Nation Party has planned
to set up 300 branches across the country within the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attack against growing criticism from within and
outside Australia of government's treatment of aboriginal people
and over the Pauline Hanson race debate, the prime minister said
"I am fed up with the self-flagellation to which some in this
country believe we should subject ourselves".
</P>
<P>
"So far as I am concerned, I think I speak on behalf of
millions of Australians, I am fed up with the sense of
defensiveness and the self-flagellation that some want us to
submit ourselves to".
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was quoted yesterday by
local media as warning Australia facing moral crisis over its
handling of aboriginal affairs.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 aboriginal children were forcibly removed from
their families during 1910-1970 and an official inquiry report
calls for government apology for the practices and financial
compensation for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Fraser also backed the report's description of the forced
removal as genocide, which was rejected by the prime minister on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also made a strong statement last night that
he will no longer accept what he describes as unreasonable,
ill-founded and uninformed criticism of Australia's record on
racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that annoys me most about political debate
in Australia at the present time is the way in which so many
people who comment about Australia, are spreading this view that
in some way we are a narrow-minded, bigoted people," Howard
complained.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Introduce Environmental Education in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Education
Ministry has decided to introduce environmental education in
schools and the Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania (WCST)
is preparing brochures to this end for schools and the public.
</P>
<P>
At a week-long workshop to discuss the brochures which opened
at Kibaha of Coast Region Tuesday, Commissioner Philemon Sarungi
stressed that environmental education is a matter of survival for
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said such problems as land, water and air pollution, loss
of biodiversity and deforestation should be addressed seriously.
</P>
<P>
Sarungi urged the WCST to take up the initiative, saying very
few tanzanian writers have produced environmental literature and
that most of those available were too technical and professional.
</P>
<P>
''I challenge you to be more practical; and come up with
something which Tanzanians can benefit from and something that
can be developed further to educate our society on environmental
awareness," Sarungi noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being held in Coast Region, where 10 percent
of the total area is covered by forest, most of which is
threatened by deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Party Leader Cleared off Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli State Comptroller Miriam
Ben-Porat said today that she had decided not to investigate Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak in connection with a military training
accident in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel radio reported that the announcement
cleared the newly-elected opposition party boss off accusations
that he did not help soldiers wounded in the accident and that he
left the scene before the soldiers were evacuated to safety.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Porat said that there is a contradiction between what the
wounded soldiers said after the accident and what they said two
and half years later. She added that she has no legal tools to
determine which version is correct.
</P>
<P>
She told Knesset (parliament) State Control Committee this
morning that shortly after the accident the wounded soldiers told
military police investigators that their shipment had been speedy
and efficient, but only two years later some of them changed their
story and complained about the behavior of then chief of general
staff Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a missile was launched by mistake
during a training course, killing five soldiers and wounded six
others.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi accused Ehud Barak of
running away from the scene, leaving the wounded behind.
</P>
<P>
However, Chief of the General Staff Lt. General Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who was Barak's deputy and also witnessed the
accident, refuted the charge, saying that any claims that Barak
abandoned the wounded were a lie.
</P>
<P>
Barak was elected chairman of the Labor Party June 3. The
general-turned-politician is widely regarded as the only one who
can beat Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the next general
elections scheduled for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> 1 More Month for Non-Jordanians to Get Work Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) - Egyptian workers in Jordan now have
one more month to obtain work permits from the Jordanian
government before being evicted from the country, local English
newspaper Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time that the Jordanian Ministry of Labor
extended deadline to give Egyptian workers more time to get valid
permits that allow them legal work here.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the mandate was in line with a decision made
by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali during a meeting
this week of the Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee co-chaired by
Majali and his Egyptian counterpart Kamal el-Ganzouri in Cairo,
according to Minister of Labor Saleh Khasawneh.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian workers in Jordan were first given three months to
obtain work permits starting from the beginning of last March, and
then the mandate was extended for three weeks and now for another
month.
</P>
<P>
According to Khasawneh, a total of 90,000 Egyptian workers
have complied with the regulations and obtained work permits
since March, raising the total number of Egyptian workers holding
valid permits to 125,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister stressed, large numbers of non-Jordanian
workers, including Egyptians, are still working without valid
permits and it is hoped that they would benefit from the one month
extension in order to avoid being evicted from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Upon the expiry of the new mandate, Khasawneh said there can be
no excuse for any non-Jordanian workers to remain in the country
without a work permit and employers will have to bear the
responsibility for their violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
When the second extension was announced, the Ministry of
Labor affirmed that the government would strictly apply the law
and requested that non-Jordanian workers without valid work
permits leave the country and pay both requisite exit fees and
other fines which they might have incurred.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said there are at least 300,000 non-Jordanian
workers in Jordan and 90 percent of them are Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the Egyptian workers are employed in
agriculture and the rest in construction work, domestic service
and a number of other services shunned by Jordanian job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government started to limit the number of
foreign laborers in 1996 for fear that they might give rise to
unemployment among the Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Jordanian government issued an order to close 16
occupations to non-Jordanians. The Ministry of Labor only issued
42,976 work permits to non-Jordanian workers, a 55 percent
decrease from the figure of 94,333 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the Jordanian government concluded an
agreement with the Egyptian government, which stipulated that
Egyptian workers in Jordan acquire work permits through the
Jordanian Embassy in Cairo before they were allowed entry to the
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> New Drilling Technology Expected To Boost China's Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Oil Field in north China
has made great headway in oil and gas exploration by using fast
drilling technology.
</P>
<P>
Some nine S-shaped oil wells in the Bohai Sea have been sunk
using this technology, at an average depth of 2,464 meters.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bohai Oil Field official, it took only seven
days for each of these oil wells to be drilled, four times faster
than with the previously used technology. And the production cost
for each of the wells was cut 46 percent, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the fast drilling technology has been successful in
three oil and gas fields since it was put into trial practised in
August, 1995, saving a total of 70 million yuan and bringing 450
million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a total of 200 oil wells have been
drilled in the Bohai Oil Field in the past 30 years, where there
are more than 800 million tons of proven oil reserves and an
annual crude production capacity of two million tons.
</P>
<P>
The new drilling technology is expected to increase the
country's oil production in the coming years, the official said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit of Eastward Expansion Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) concluded its two-day summit today in the
Spanish capital of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government of 16 NATO members,
representatives of the Western European Union (WEU) and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), were
present at Tuesday's meeting. They were then joined on Wednesday
by NATO's 27 Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the first day of the two-day summit, the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to begin accession talks
with NATO, marking the formal implementation of NATO's eastward
expansion plan, which came into being about three and a half years
ago.
</P>
<P>
As for other candidates, especially Romania and Slovenia, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said, "We reaffirm that NATO
remains open to new members under Article 10 of the North Atlantic
Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"No European democratic country whose admission would fulfil
the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from consideration,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO aims to sign the protocol of accession with the three
countries at the time of NATO's ministerial meetings in
December. It is hoped that the three former Warsaw Pact countries
will become NATO's new members in April 1999, when NATO marks its
50th anniversary of the Washington Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, NATO leaders reaffirmed that the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) will remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina
till next June. They called on the authorities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina to accelerate the implementation of the 1995 Bosnia
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"While SFOR's mandate comes to an end in June 1998, we have a
commitment to and a long-term interest in stability in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the surrounding region," NATO heads of state and
government said in a special declaration issued after a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders called on the parties to the Peace Agreement,
signed on December 14, 1995 in Paris after it had been negotiated
in Dayton, Ohio, "to comply fully with the commitments they
themselves have agreed and to implement the Peace Agreement
without delay".
</P>
<P>
The SFOR of 31,000 troops was activated on December 20, 1996,
when the one-year mandate of its predecessor, the Implementation
Force (IFOR), expired.
</P>
<P>
On the second and last day, NATO chief Solana, heads of state
and government of 16 NATO members, and Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma formally signed the "Charter for a Distinctive Partnership
Between NATO and Ukraine", initiated on May 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-Ukraine Committee will be established
accordingly. Regular consultative meetings between the alliance
and Ukraine and the exchange of military liaison officers will be
arranged.
</P>
<P>
As the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and
Security Between NATO and Russian signed last May, the
NATO-Ukraine Charter comprises several parts, covering the major
principles, consultation and cooperation mechanisms to ensure
safety in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the charter, NATO allies reaffirm their support for
Ukrainian sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity,
democratic development, economic prosperity and status as a
non-nuclear weapons state, as well as the principle of
inviolability of frontiers.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), including NATO
members and PfPs, had its first meeting at the level of heads of
state and government on Wednesday before the end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
EAPC, set up on May 30, 1997, replaces the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council (NACC) established at the end of 1991. It
provides the overarching framework for political and
security-related consultations and for enhanced cooperation under
PfP.

<HEADLINE> Macao Civil Servants Get Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao's civil servants get a higher
pay from this month, up 6.38 percent on their previous level,
according to a bill passed by the Macao Legislative Assembly on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News reported today that after the increase of
wages, Macao governor's monthly salary will rise from 123,165 to
129,734 patacas (about 16,422 US dollars), and his secretaries' to
97,300.50 patacas (about 12,316 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government has to increase expenditure of over
245 million patacas (about 31 million US dollars) a year. It has
to pay the civil service more than four billion patacas a year,
accounting for 35 percent of the government's budgeted
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly income of Macao residents is around 4,000
patacas (about 506 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in a commentary that it may become a
huge burden for the future Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR) following successive pay rises in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"The successive pay rises over the past decade has gone too
far," it said. "It paid no attention to Macao's social conditions
and a sluggish economy. It might mean a heavy burden for the
future SAR if it is not brought to a halt."
</P>
<P>
Macao's inflation rate for the first six months of the year
was only 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tiny territory now has more than 18,600 civil servants,
comparing with 8,400 in 1987 when China and Portugal signed the
joint declaration on the question of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigeria's Economy Rated Low for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite some macroeconomic
improvements, Nigeria's future economic outlook still appears
gloomy, according to different reports of the World bank and the
Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC ).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank in its "world economic outlook" for May 1997,
which was available here Tuesday, said although the oil revenue
improved the near-term outlook for the country, the medium-term
prospects however "remain uncertain", according to the Vanguard
newpaper today.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that "some limited progress was made during
1996 to restore economic stability in nigeria, but inflation,
while easing, remained high."
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics show the inflation rate in the
country stood at 21.4 percent at the end of April this year,
compared with 28 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank considered it to be about 300 percent higher
than the globally accepted inflation rate of five percent.
</P>
<P>
In its own 1996 annual report, also available Tuesday, the
NDIC admitted that despite some favorable developments recorded
last year, "the economy was still characterized by high
unemployment, low effective demand, inadequate infrastructure and
external debt burden."
</P>
<P>
The corporation, which, together with the Central Bank of
Nigeria, oversees the country's financial industry.
</P>
<P>
The situation, the NDIC stated, had serious implications for
the banking sector as the depth of distress measured by the
amount required for recapilization and non-performing loans
worsened.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that as at last December, the recapitalization
requirement of the distressed banks amounted to 42.4 billion
Naira (about 499 million U.S.Dollars) compared with 34 billion
Naira (about 400 million dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans of
the distressed banks stood at 80 percent as against 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
All this suggests further deterioration in the financial
condition of the banks, the corporation noted.
</P>
<P>
While the total assets of the distressed banks rose by 11.97
percent in the past year, their total loans, advances and leases
decreased by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was recorded against the background that the number of
distressed banks declined from 51 in 1995 to 47 in 1996, as a
result of the government efforts to sanitize the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The 47 distressed banks, along with three other classified as
potentially distressed, are however technically insolvent, the
NDIC said.
</P>
<P>
The NDIC attributed the bank failure in the country mainly to
unprofessional practices and attitudes of bank directors,
managers and other employees, insider related abuses, and other
financial malpractices.
</P>
<P>
While praising the performance of the African economy in
general, the World Bank said Nigeria was among some other poor
African countries that have fallen behind not only in relative
but also in absolute terms.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, these countries are facing a general need to open
their economies, reform governments, establish financial markets
and maintain international and external finanical stability.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the World Bank has recently announced
a 20-percent cut of its budget on Nigeria and reduced the number
of its projects in the country from oer 20 to 12 because of what
it saw as unsatisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
Despite Nigeria's remarkable improvement in the past few years
in maintaining stability of exchange rate, reducing inflation and
opening up the economy by promulgating new investment decrees,
the World Bank insists that much can still be done to provide a
more favorable investment climate.
</P>
<P>
The bank is reportedly said it would not approve its budget
package for Nigeria unless Nigeria shows seriousness with its
democratization process, deregulate the economy, harmonize the
exchange rates and privatize key parastatals among others.
</P>
<P>
Such circumstances, in addition to sanctions by some western
nations and internal problems, are posing threat on the 5.5
percent economic growth targeted by the government for this year,
observers noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Accusation of Funding for S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Tuesday denied the accuse by
the Sierra Leonean military government that it is funding a
pirate radio that is aimed at destabilizing Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Acting defense spokesman, Godwin Ugbo said in an interview
with This Day in Lagos that Nigeria is not aware of the station
in question, let alone funding it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Abdul Sesay, spokesman of the ruling Armed
Forced Revolutionary Council of Sierra Leone accused Nigeria of
masterminding the radio station during an interview with BBC.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean spokesman said his government was aware of
the radio station through intelligence reports several weeks
before it fully came on air.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the radio station is located at the Lungi
International Airport near Freetown, which is under the control
of the Nigeria-led west African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Sesay claimed that the accent of the presenter during the test
transmission of the station is purely that of a Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
He called it illegal and unfair that Nigeria set up a radio
station on the Sierra Leonean territory.

KUWAIT CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A fully loaded passenger plane
of Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC) left here today for Jordan to
resume direct flights between the two countries after a lapse of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
A KAC official told Xinhua over phone that the A-310 airbus
took off at 9:45 a.m. (0645 GMT) with 160 passengers and nine
infants on a two-hour flight to Amman, capital of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze links with Jordan, including direct flights by
their flag carriers, after accusing Amman of siding with Iraq
during its seven-month occupation of the country between August
1990 and February 1991.
</P>
<P>
KAC and Royal Jordanian struck an accord last month to resume
twice-weekly direct flights within the framework of a
normalization process started last year between the two Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
KAC will have two weekly flights to Amman every Wednesday and
Friday, while the Jordanian Royal National Airlines will operate
two flights to Kuwait every Monday and Thursday, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> African Heads Urge Peace Talks on Sudan, Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of six eastern and
northeastern African countries today urged all warring parties in
Sudan and Somalia to put down weapons and hold face-to-face peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia,
Uganda, Djibouti and Eritrea made the appeal in a joint
communique issued at the end of a two-day summit meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
The leaders hailed the acceptance by the Sudanese government
of the Declaration of Principles, drafted by IGAD in 1994, as the
basis for discussions and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the declaration, religious factor is recognized as an
important role in Sudan's development.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John
Garang arrived here Monday before the summit. But he reportedly
rejected face-to-face talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Sudanese delegation said the
peace talks will be held between the warring sides in Sudan "in
the near future."
</P>
<P>
SPLA has fought in southern Sudan since 1983 for greater
autonomy of the Christian south from the Moslem north and now is
allied with armed opposition groups in northern Sudan as battles
continued in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In order to break the impasse, talks must be resumed by all
parties in the conflict so that a lasting solution can be found,"
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi vowed in his opening speech on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD held two high-level meetings in 1994 on the crisis in
Sudan but the talks were deadlocked. Since then, all IGAD peace
initiatives have stalled.
</P>
<P>
On siutation in Somalia, the joint communique said that the
six leaders expressed satisfaction that "the siutation in
Somalia, the joint communique said athat the six leaders
expressed satisfaction that "the situation in northern Somalia
was relatively stable and urged cooperation among the factions in
order to create a united and peaceful Somalia."
</P>
<P>
IGAD, grouping Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia,Eritrea, Sudan, Uganda
and Djibouti, was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation among
member states on anti-drought and economic development. Regional
political affairs have been on the agenda of IGAD meetings in the
recent few years.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's chair is vacant at the seven-member IGAD summit as
usual because it has not had a central government since 1991 when
clan leaders combined to oust former leader Mohamed Siad Barre
and then brought the Horn of African nation into a war-torn
state.

<HEADLINE> HIV Epidemic Reaches Advanced Stage in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) epidemic has reached an advanced stage in India, with the
country's Maharashtra and Manipur states continuing to have the
highest rates of infection, Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
latest consolidated data from all the surveillance centers
under India's National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) indicates
that one in every ten persons from high-risk groups are infected
with the AIDS-causing HIV virus in Maharashtra and Manipur.
</P>
<P>
The overall AIDS situation is worsening, NACO warned in a
report.
</P>
<P>
As of May 1997, a total of 3.03 million samples from high risk
groups and clinically suspected cases of AIDS were screened in
various surveillance centers in India.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 56,409 were found to be HIV positive, which indicates
an HIV positively rate of 18.6 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,551 cases were reported till May this year, but
this only represents a small fraction of the actual AIDS cases in
India, NACO said.
</P>
<P>
The data indicates that the infection is spreading
geographically and has percolated from high-risk groups to the
general population.
</P>
<P>
The HIV prevalence in highly-prevalent states such as
Maharashtra and Manipur shows that the epidemic is in advance
stage, NACO concluded.

LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of British Airways
(BA) cabin crew launched their strike at 6.00 a.m. (0500
GMT) disrupting Heathrow and Gatwick flights.
</P>
<P>
BA has cancelled 135 of 196 Heathrow flights today and
nine out of 93 Gatwick departures.
</P>
<P>
Pickets are also at Glasgow airport this morning,
according to a report from the city.

<P>
The company said, passengers turning up at airports will
be put on other airlines or given a refund if no BA flight
is available.
</P>
<P>
BA cabin crew began the first of a series of three-day
strikes despite a warning from BA that strikers would lose
perks and face a lockout unless they promised to work
normally in the future.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose over the airline's plans to save a
billion pounds by the year 2000 through major restructuring.
Negotiations to seek settlement broke down on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and General Workers' Union, which
represents 9,000 cabin crew staff, said the airline had
suggested an independent arbiter could examine the union's
proposals for efficiency savings.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Ukraine formally signed a NATO-Ukraine
relationship document here today to further develop their
partnership.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, Heads of State and
Government of 16 NATO members, and Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma put their names on the "Charter for a Distinctive
Partnership Between NATO and Ukraine", initiated on May 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-Ukraine Committee will be established accordingly, and
regular consultative meetings between them and exchange of
military liaison officers will be arranged.
</P>
<P>
"This is further proof that the European continent is building
a new security structure based on cooperation," Kuchma said at the
signing ceremony today, the last day of the two-day NATO Summit.
</P>
<P>
Solana hailed the charter as "a visible symbol of a new Europe,
which is not the Europe of the past, not the Europe of divisions".
</P>
<P>
As the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and
Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation signed last May,
the charter comprises several parts, covering the major
principles, consultation and cooperation mechanisms to ensure
safety in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In it, NATO allies reaffirm their support for Ukrainian
sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity, democratic
development, economic prosperity and status as a non-nuclear
weapons state, as well as the principle of inviolability of
frontiers.
</P>
<P>
According to the charter, areas for consultation and
cooperation between NATO and Ukraine, in particular through joint
seminars, joint working groups, and other cooperative programs,
will cover a broad range of topics including civil
emergency planning and disaster preparedness; civil-military
relations, democratic control of the armed forces, and Ukrainian
defence reform.

CHENGDU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The city of Jiangyou in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, hometown of well-known poet Li Bai who

hot-spot in recent years.

<P>
Jiangyou is host to 1.8 million domestic and overseas tourists

The city has worked to develop tourism resources based on its

tourist groups have been attracted to the city's most noteworthy
sites, such as the poet's former residence, a Li Bai Exhibition
Hall, a martial arts training center, and a number of natural
scenic spots.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Welcome Manila-Declared Truce in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) said today that it welcomes the
government's declaration of a unilateral temporary truce in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF will not declare their own version of cessation of
hostilities since their troops are maintaining a defensive
position in the conflict, said Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman
for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this development but we will not declare a
cease-fire because our guerrillas are always in the defensive
posture and only fire back when attacked," Jaafar added.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to an order from President Fidel Ramos to the
Armed Forces to suspend their operations in Mindanao, particularly
in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces, to give the peace
negotiations a chance to resume.
</P>
<P>
Ramos earlier designated Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao to mediate an end to the impasse after
the rebels called off the June 28-29 low-level peace talks in
protest of the military offensive against MILF camps.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Sixth Infantry Division,
confirmed Tuesday that the division had declared a unilateral
suspension of military operations as an expression of support for
Misuari's peace mission with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said the 48-hour truce, which will last until 6
o'clock in the morning on Friday, can be extended if peace
prevails in the areas it covers.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato disclosed that the military will maintain a status quo
during the implementation of the temporary cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here believe the peace process will remain stalled
for some time since the government only met just one of the four
conditions put forward by the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier also demanded the pullout of government troops
from the "occupied areas," particularly Camp Raja Muda in Pikit
Town, Cotabato Province. The camp was formerly the MILF's second
largest headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions include the safe return of thousands of
evacuees to their respective places and no more "provocative
pronouncements and manufactured accusations" by the military
against the MILF, according to Jaafar.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and government troops have fought fierce battles
against each other in Mindanao during the past several weeks,
killing more than 150 people and forcing nearly 70,000 residents
to abandon their homes.

<HEADLINE> Thailand for Cambodia's Asean Admission in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai foreign minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn has said his country prefers that Cambodia's admission
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) be
postponed to December, when Asean leaders will hold an informal
summit.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyasarn told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that it was his
hope that after a few months there might be greater political
stability in Cambodia, where fighting has been on since last
Saturday between troops loyal to the two prime ministers, Norodom
Ranariddh and Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has gained the upper hand and is in control of the
capital, while Ranariddh is now in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Thai foreign ministry on Tuesday withdrew a proposal to the
cabinet requesting the cabinet to formally endorse the admission
of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar to Asean later this month when
Asean's annual foreign ministers' meeting takes place in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Asean foreign ministers are scheduled to hold an informal
emergency meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to review the
situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
At an informal meeting in late May, Asean foreign ministers
agreed to pursue an earlier decision by Asean leaders to admit all
three countries in late July, a move to fulfill the Asean
founders' aspirations to include all 10 nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping celebrates its 30th anniversary
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, fighting in Cambodia has made it necessary to
review Asean's stance as it has had an impact on peace and
stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Explores Fish Markets In Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is exploring fish markets
in the Middle East and the Far East following a ban from Europe
of the importation of Uganda's fish.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ugandan Export Promotion Council who
preferred anonymity said that Uganda has found new markets for
fish exports in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arab and
Lebanon, local daily "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on fish export have been made recently between
Uganda and those countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We have been exporting to the Middle East,
specifically to the United Arab Emirates, which re-exports our
fish to other Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
Fish export industry in Uganda has grown at a tremendous rate
since it began fish export some seven and a half years ago. Now
the country has 13 fish processing factories with a total of
installed production capacity of 73,000 tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from European countries, Uganda in
February this year suspended seven of the country's fish
processing factories from making further exports to th European
Union after Spain imposed the ban on importation of Ugandan
fish.
</P>
<P>
Other EU states also threatened to block importation of
Uganda's famous Nile Perch for they said the high level of
bacterial contamination.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Economic Growth Slower than Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's gross domestic product
(GDP) will grow by only 2.5 percent this year, compared with an
initial forecast of 4.1 percent, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
A report published this week by the Economics and State
Revenues Department of the Finance Ministry predicted that
Israel's GDP will reach 88.94 billion U.S. dollars this year
compared with 86.77 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP registered a 4.4 percent increase last year,
according to the report, which also forecast a 6.7 percent
unemployment rate, a zero-growth of per-capita private
consumption, and an 8 percent increase in industrial exports
(excluding diamonds) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decline in economic growth to the
drop in immigration which means reduction in consumption of
durable goods and housing investment; declining investments; tight
fiscal and monetary policies and the deadlock of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations which have a strong impact
on Israel's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
It suggested maintaining the government's budget deficit
targets without raising tax burden and implementing tax and
capital market reforms as means to reverse the economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy in Cambodia Will Protect HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's embassy in Cambodia is
duty bound to provide consular protection to Chinese citizens,
including Hong Kong residents, who stay in that country, a
spokesman for the Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's
Commissioner in Hong Kong said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has instructed China's embassies and consulates
abroad to provide consular protection and services for Hong Kong
Chinese citizens, said the spokesman in response to questions from
local journalists.
</P>
<P>
After military conflict broke out in Phnom Penh, capital of
Cambodia, China's embassy there already provided assistance in
shifting Hong Kong Chinese citizens from warring areas to safe
places, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on the afternoon of July 8, the Chinese
Embassy in Phnom Penh made representations with Cambodian
government officials, urging the Cambodian side to take necessary
measures to protect personal and property safety of all the
Chinese citizens staying in the country, including Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The embassy has issued a notice, asking Chinese citizens in
Cambodia to go to the embassy to make registration, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged Hong Kong residents in Cambodia to contact
the Chinese Embassy so that the latter could, when necessary,
provide consular protection and assist them in overcoming
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as Hong Kong has returned to the
motherland, all Hong Kong Chinese citizens, no matter whether they
hold British travel documents or not, can get consular protection
and services from the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
At present, the situation in Cambodia is stabilizing but still
arouses concern, the spokesman said, adding that the Foreign
Ministry Commissioner's Office will provide assistance to the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Government at any time if
necessary.

<HEADLINE> Highland Malaria Kills 41 in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one people have died from
highland malaria in the past two days in Uasin Gishu District,
western Kenya, according to a Kenya Times report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper quoted John Kibosia, Medical Superintendent of
the Eldoret Moi National Teaching and Referral Hospital, as
saying Tuesday that more than 500 others are admitted in serious
condition in the district.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that 26 of 120 patients who had been admitted
in serious condition died at the hospital. "The situation in the
district seems to be worsening though medical personnel are
working tirelessly to curb the spread of the disease," He added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Ministry of Health has taken swift action to
deliver enough drugs to the district, said Kibosia.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour, James Mwanzia, Director of Medical
Services, said that there was an upsurge in mosquito density in
the western parts of Kenya due to heavy rains and his ministry
was making a headway in combating the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A malaria outbreak was reported last month in Nandi, Trans
Nzoia and Uasin Gishu districts and the disease has now spread to
six more districts in Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Chebet, the provincial medical officer, was quoted as
saying Tuesday that the situation had been aggravated by
chloroquine-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures being taken to combat the disease
included the provision of 500 mosquito nets to each district in
the most affected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also supplying special malaria drug kits to
all the affected districts and additional buffer stocks to Nakuru
and Eldoret regional depots.

New Nigerian

<P>
-- The decision by the Commonwealth ministerial action group to
meet in London from July 10-11 at which submissions would be
entertained from some Nigerians in self-exile has elicited strong

ULAN BATOR, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's economy recovered in
the first half of 1997, with the gross domestic product reaching
532.6 billion tugriks (about 66.7 million US dollars), up 2.6
percent from the same period of last year, official statistics
showed today.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau said that the industrial output of

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Banks Look for Greater Opportunities in Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong banks have been going to
the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone in eastern Shanghai, to look
for opportunities that may come from Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation led the rush by
moving its Shanghai branch to the Pudong New Area. "With this
move, our bank is hoping to play an increasingly important role in
the development course of the inland areas, and also in Shanghai's
march toward an international financial center," the bank's
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Hard on their heels came the Hangseng Bank, and the East Asia
Bank, the largest Chinese-backed bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 40 overseas-funded financial
institutions in the Lujiazui Zone, and 2,800 offices. Experts
predict that Lujiazui will have more newcomers in the financial
sector, given its role in the metropolis, which plans to become an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has already expressed its desire to return to the
glory days of the past when it was a financial hub of the Fareast,
and experts say that the emerging Lujiazui district, together with
the 159-year-old financial street along the Bund, will play a key
role in the city's revitalization drive.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Banks Look for Greater Opportunities in Shanghai (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooperation between the two cities dates back to the early
1980s, when HK banks introduced new financial methods to Shanghai
and helped the city's financial sector get acquainted with
international practices.
</P>
<P>
They began the use of mortgages, introduced Automatic Teller
Machines, and underwrote the first B shares on the local stock
market. In doing so, they also got a fat chance to make a
profit. The Hong Kong &AMP; Shanghai Banking Corporation, for example,
tops the list of overseas banks in China today, both in terms of
business volume and profitability.
</P>
<P>
And the picture just gets rosier. HK banks with licenses for
yuan dealing can work with their local counterparts to make loans
to multinationals in Pudong, which is regarded as a more lucrative
business by overseas banks in China.
</P>
<P>
Fund-pooling instruments are still awaiting development, and a
large group of projects are underway in Pudong that call for a
large amount of funds to build an international air-traffic
center, deep-water port, and information hub.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the Shanghai Stock Exchange to Lujiazui is
expected to become another major factor behind wider cooperations
in the financial field, one that may make closer links in
supervision, organization of the securities markets and exchange
of experts between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
And there is the huge and largely-untapped domestic insurance
market, which experts say could be a powerful magnet for overseas
insurance companies.

PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The NATO Madrid summit ended Tuesday night with a concession
by the United States in the face of a mini-revolt by several
European countries led by France. The United States yielded to
European pressure by agreeing to discuss the candidature of Romania
and Slovenia for NATO membership at the 1999 Washington summit of
the trans-Atlantic military alliance.
</P>
<P>
-- Abdelkader Hachani, number three of Algeria's outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), was released from prison on Tuesday after
five years of detention without trial. Hachani is considered the
``most political'' leader of the Islamist FIS and contributed
greatly to the victory of the party in the 1991 legislative
election, cancelled by the Algerian army.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite a dispute between Europeans and Americans over the
number of countries to be admitted by NATO in the first wave, NATO
kicked off the process of integrating Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary, definitely turning the page of division in Europe
which resulted from the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
-- A commission in charge of drafting a report on the reform of
France's justice system will submit its proposals to President
Jacques Chirac on Thursday. The report, which is aimed at
strengthening the independence of the country's justice power,
proposes preventing the minister of justice from intervening in
individual cases, and better protecting the right of innocence of
suspects before a court judgement is given.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Many Shanghai executives are
finding work the old-fashioned way: they send resumes and other
pertinent information to local employment agencies, who in turn
advertise for their clients.
</P>
<P>
"People in Shanghai have to compete for a managerial position
now, instead of being appointed by the local government," said a
spokesman of one job agency, adding that about one third of the
city's industrial enterprises have been chosen because of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Dongfang International Group Company Ltd., which
has an annual gross sales of 30 billion yuan, is now asking an
employment firm to advertise for senior managers so that it can
recruit the most-qualified personnel, according to an official
working with the company.
</P>
<P>
The firm, named the Executive Talent Company, which was founded
in September, 1995, serves as a go-between for companies and
potential employees, and has a database of more than 9,800 names
of qualified managers in different trades.
</P>
<P>
More such employment firms will be set up in Shanghai soon to
improve the city's talent market.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's internal conflict will
have no impact on Asean's solidity although the country will soon
join the grouping, an Indonesian legislator said.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia's crisis is an internal affair. I think it will not
drag on provided it is not brought to Asean. Instead, Asean will
try to seek a solution to the conflict," Antara News Agency today
quoted Deputy Chairman of the Interparliamentary Cooperation Board
Zamhari Ar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following the factional fighting between supporters of
Cambodia's first and second prime ministers, Cambodia's second
prime minister Hun Sen reportedly took control of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement Tuesday, the chairman of the Asean
standing committee on behalf of Asean called for an immediate
ceasefire in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Cambodia's internal conflict will not hinder its
admission into Asean," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asean is scheduled to admit Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into its
membership late this month.
</P>
<P>
At present, Asean groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<P>
NANCHANG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one tenth of the fresh pork
on the Hong Kong market every day comes from central China's
Jiangxi Province, and its other poultry and fruit products are
welcomed by Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The province, abundant in fish and rice, has become one of the
major suppliers of non-staple food to Hong Kong. It has also
become the biggest rice supplier in the country's coastal regions
after years of stable growth in grain production.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi officials are optimistic in the future of cooperation
between Hong Kong and Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has the market advantage and Jiangxi has the
resource advantage, so the two can complement each other," said
Jiangxi Governor Shu Shengyou.
</P>
<P>
Shu has asked leading officials of the provincial economic
departments to seize the opportunity to strengthen the economic
and trade cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The province's current annual export trade volume to Hong Kong
is around 700 million US dollars, accounting for 40 percent of the
province's total, and experts believe there is still potential to
tap.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Hong Kong investors have more than 2,670
factories in the province with total investment exceeding two
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China City To Develop Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, which used to be in
Sichuan province and was made a municipality directly under the
central government recently, plans to improve its industrial
structure by focusing on seven pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
These include the three existing ones -- machinery, chemicals,
and metallurgy -- and four new ones: electronic information,
building materials, tourism, and food processing.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has adopted a strategy of turning itself into an
economic center for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and
Southwest China. Its GDP is expected to quadruple by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In the machine industry, it will make automobiles and
motorcycles the core; in the chemical industry, natural gas and
chemicals for medicine; and in the metallurgical industry, high
quality steel and aluminum, according to Mayor Pu Haiqing.
</P>
<P>
For some time, Chongqing has been a major automotive and
motorcycle producer. In 1996, it produced 120,000 automobiles and
over 1.8 million motorcycles. There are now 38 auto parts
manufacturers there, and over 100 suppliers of motorcycle parts.
</P>
<P>
Pu told Xinhua in a recent interview that the city will also
develop industries like electronic information, building
materials, and food-processing, and promote 50 famous local brands.
</P>
<P>
Lei Hengshun, an economist and professor at Chongqing
University, says that the new strategy is based on Chongqing's
particular situation and will help the economic development of
other parts of Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have shown great interest in Chongqing's
pillar industries. Over 600 foreign-funded enterprises have been
set up in Chongqing, more than 70 percent of which belong to the
chemical, metallurgical, and auto and motorcycle industries.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Death Toll Drops in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's national malaria death
toll has for the first time in a decade dropped by 60 percent as
a result of efforts made by the Ministry of Health and the Child
Welfare since it launched the Malaria Control Program last September.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the ministry, over 1,400 people
have died of malaria from about 500,000 cases reported
countrywide since the beginning of this year, compared to 3,000
people who died of the disease last year out of the 1.6 million
reported cases.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Stamps, Minister of Health and Child Welfare,
attributed the huge decline in malaria deaths to the ''massive''
malaria control programme launched last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the spraying program has been very
effective and the householders have been very receptive to it
because Icon, the chemical, not only controls malaria, but also
kills bugs and other pests.''

<HEADLINE> Military, Rebels Continue Clash in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Government troops and Muslim rebels
attacked each other with artillery fire this morning in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, despite a unilateral truce announced by
the military on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Sixth Infantry Division, said
the 90-minute exchange of gunfire took place just shortly before
the unilateral truce started to take effect at 6 o'clock this
morning.
</P>
<P>
To save the imperiled peace process in the southern
Philippines, President Fidel Ramos Tuesday ordered the military to
declare a unilateral suspension of military operations against the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said armed men identified as MILF members first
pounded the position of the 39th Infantry Battalion in Buldon
Town, Maguindanao Province, with several mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The government troops, though conscious of the temporary
cease-fire, were then forced to retaliate and fired their mortars
toward MILF positions, Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported on both sides in the latest clash.
</P>
<P>
But Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs,
insisted that the clash was provoked by the military who he said
fired the first shot.
</P>
<P>
"The military fired several rounds of 81 mm mortar shells to
MILF positions prompting our men to fire back," Murad stressed,
adding that government troops pounded "MILF-controlled areas" with
shells until 6:30 this morning.
</P>
<P>
Murad accused the government of sabotaging its own cease-fire
to justify a total war against the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which began peace talks with Manila in January,
pulled out of the talks late last month after the military overran
its second largest camp in Cotabato Province.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging between the MILF and government troops
during the past several weeks in central Mindanao, killing more
than 150 rebels, government soldiers and civilians and displacing
tens of thousands of villagers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of poverty in
Zimbabwe worsened over the last five years because of recurring
droughts, Social Development Fund Director Sydney Mhishi said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on a new budget concept, Mhishi said
that people's ability to meet basic needs had been undermined by
the effects leading to growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
''The growing burden of the AIDS pandemic and the squeeze on
public spending on social services threaten to erode much of the
post independence progress in human resource development,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said 45 percent of the Zimbabwean households are very poor,
while 16 percent are poor and 37 percent in the ''non-poor''
category.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimated in 1990/91 that urban poverty in
Zimbabwe would stand at 12 percent, while zimbabwe government
poverty assessment in December 1996 revealed that urban poverty
had actually reached 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mhishi said: ''The implications of a high incidence of the
educated, but poor people, roaming the urban streets is not
comfortable to contemplate.''

<P>
JINAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open up about 666,000
ha of land in the Yellow River Delta area by the end of the
century or in the early 21st century to raise the current
production level to two billion kg of grain and 75 million kg of
cotton, as well as 500,000 tons of meat and eggs.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus rose
15.4 percent to 906.8 billion yen (8.03 billion US dollars) in May
over the same period of last year, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus surged for a second consecutive
month, following a strong 92.7 percent leap in April.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the increase was the April 1 consumption
tax hike from three percent to five percent, which chilled
domestic consumption, Kyodo News quoted a ministry official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In May, Japan registered a surplus of 412.8 billion yen (3.65
billion dollars) in goods and services trading, compared with a
deficit of 104.1 billion yen (921 million dollars) a year earlier,
the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade increased 118.6 percent to
927.9 billion yen (8.21 billion dollars), following a 90.9 percent
surge in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Exports expanded 20.2 percent to 3,984.9 billion yen (35.26
billion dollars), while imports rose 5.8 percent to 3,057 billion
yen (27.05 billion dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan posted a deficit of 515.1 billion yen (4.56
billion dollars) in services including tourism, down from a
deficit of 528.7 billion yen (4.68 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predicted that the rising trend in Japan's
current account surplus is likely to continue for a period of
time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Becoming Less Concerned About Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people, who have been
quite sensitive to price fluctuations in the past, are becoming
less concerned about price and the number of lawsuits involving
pricing is decreasing, as people shift their attention to product
quality instead.
</P>
<P>
The price index is still published regularly in most major
newspapers however.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Committee in central China's Hunan Province
received 1,113 price complaints during the first half of this
year, accounting for only nine percent of the total number of
cases it handled, fewer than in the past.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, there were 9,113 complaints about
quality to the committee, accounting for 70 percent of the
total. More than a third of them involved electric machines or
appliances for the home.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the change to the country's macro-economic
controls in the past few years and to improved living
standards. People no longer seem afraid of the shortage of goods
that plagued China for a long time in the past.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that one explanation for the change
might simply be that ordinary people know little about the market
and prices, and some people just don't bother to file lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Dollar Pushes Baht Value Further Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Strong domestic demand for US
dollar prompted the baht to further fall in the local spot market
to its lowest level since July 2, when the baht was floated.
</P>
<P>
In the local market, the dollar/baht trading was quoted on
Tuesday at 29.15 and 29.20 baht, compared with 28.93 baht at the
close of trading on Monday, and around 27.50 baht at the close of
the first day of trading when the baht was floated.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the central bank set its reference rate at 28.922
baht, up from 28.578 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reference rate given by the central bank is used by
commercial banks as a guide for their money transactions.
</P>
<P>
Dealers say that the baht's weakness was attributed to
commercial demand for the dollar. Thai businesses want to buy
dollar amid the uncertain direction of the baht under the float
system.
</P>
<P>
The floating of the baht creates a heavy burden for Thai
businesses which have borrowed foreign capital, as their debts
will add correspondingly to a decline in the baht's value.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2, the baht has dropped sharply, by 12 percent of
its value on June 30, the last day the country's fixed exchange
rate regime was in effect.
</P>
<P>
A dealer from Bangkok Bank said that some Thai businesses were
selling baht for dollars in order to pay for their imported goods
and pay off their foreign debts as well.

COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police are hounding
Tamil rebel suspects in and around Colombo on the orders of
Inspector General of Police W.B. Rajaguru, according to police
sources today.
</P>
<P>
This follows intelligence reports that during the "Black July",
the rebels would be engaging in acts of terrorism to cause death
and destruction in Colombo and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Rajaguru has alerted all police stations in the city to be
extra vigilant to the rebel plans and ordered them to round up and
detain all rebel suspects pending court action, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The police and the armed forces have tightened security in
Colombo since July 1 in a bid to prevent possible Tamil suicide
squad attacks during the "Black July".
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels mark "Black July" annually, the anniversary of
the 1983 racial riots.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels who have been fighting for a separate state, are
facing a severe setback as a result of the Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory) operation by government troops in the north of the
country and are therefore believed to be planning destructive
actions in other places in the country.

conflicts, which is in the interest of the Republic of Srpska and
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is expected to meet the two Bosnian Serb leaders to
discuss measures to avert the crisis and to ensure the progress of
the Dayton Peace Accord signed in December 1995, said Tanjug news
agency today.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, Robe Rt. Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary, asked
Milosevic to help resolve the crisis with his influence and
prestige when he met the Serbian president.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, president of the Republic of Srpska, and Krajisnic,
member of the three-man presidency of the Republic of Bosnia, have
been locked in a power struggle for nearly 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic disbanded the parliament last week and called for new
elections in September. But Krajisnic and his supporters dismissed
her decision and held a session of assembly, rewriting laws to
enable her recall and to strip her of defense powers.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Vilksinson, deputy spokesman of the United Nations
peacekeeping troops stationed in the southwestern part of Bonsia,
said today that the troops are closely monitoring the situation
in the Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
However, Vilksinson said the peacekeeping troops are not on
high alert as the situation in the region remains under control.
</P>
<P>
He said that the troops still maintain cooperation with the
military representatives of the Bosnian Serb army, denying the
rumor that U.N. peacekeeping soldiers are guarding Plavsic's
residence.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Upbeat About Growth Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Thanong
Bidaya insists that the economy is on the upside following the
floating of the baht on July 2, with improvements expected in
growth, inflation and exports.
</P>
<P>
Inflation for 1997 should reach 6-7 percent, far below the
double digits predicted by some economists following the rapid
depreciation of the baht, the Bangkok Post today quotes Thanong
Bidaya as saying.
</P>
<P>
The baht on Tuesday weakened to 29.20 against the US dollar, a
record low for the baht onshore, traders say. Before the floating,
the Thai central bank's mid-rate to the dollar was 25.75 on June
30.
</P>
<P>
Thanong said the baht should have been floated at least six or
seven months earlier. Because foreign investors saw the baht as
overvalued, investment slowed, causing liquidity in the local
market to tighten and increasing pessimism about the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said although overseas borrowing costs have increased with
the float, liquidity should increase in the local market as
capital returned, resulting in a better economic situation than
before the changes.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand recently increased its inflation forecast
from 4.5 percent to 6 percent. With a possible 10-15 percent
depreciation in the value of the baht, import prices for oil and
energy, raw materials and intermediate goods will rise, pushing up
domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry has asked producers to refrain from
boosting prices of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
On Monday central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said the
authorities viewed the baht trading at 28.5 to the dollar as
appropriate, but did not say whether authorities would intervene
to support this level.
</P>
<P>
Some private analysts have said the baht could weaken further
in the next several months, possibly breaking the
psychological-important 30-baht barrier, although this would hinge
on how fast the authorities would move to lower domestic interest
rates to ease the debt burden on the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans to Borrow 10 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to borrow 10 billion
US dollars in the next six months to spur its economy and bail out
its finance industry, according to an aide to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented step would increase the government's debt by
a third.
</P>
<P>
The government is now negotiating to borrow 5 billion dollars
from foreign banks, according to Poosana Premanoch, deputy
secretary-general of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
The loans might be available early next month, he said,
declining to name the banks that would provide them.
</P>
<P>
Another 5 billion dollars would be raised by selling
international bonds.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not that the government has a liquidity problem,
but that the government wants to keep a credit line available that
can be used when needed.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the money set to be raised would not be
spent on government projects.
</P>
<P>
The decision to borrow the money was made after discussions
between Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya and the Bank of Thailand
last week, according to Poosana.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that money was needed to boost the country's
foreign exchange reserves. So far this year, the central bank has
spent about 6 billion dollars to rescue the baht when it was
heavily attacked overseas by speculators. The country's foreign
reserves now stand at about 33 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the increase in debt is almost certain to
lead to another downgrading of Thailand's credit rating.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Charter Change Drives Die Hard in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Are charter change drives really
dead in the Philippines after charter change advocates were given
their third heavy blow by the Commission on Election on Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
Political analysts doubted that conclusion. They said with
almost a year to go before the presidential election, it was
unsafe to say that charter change groups have been killed in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
After an unexpected caucus on Tuesday, the seven-member
Commission on Election voted unanimously against a petition filed
by a leading pro-charter change group called the People's
Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA).
</P>
<P>
This was the third defeat suffered by the PIRMA. Earlier, the
Supreme Court has twice ruled against the group's effort to call
for a plebiscite on constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The country's constitution, which was rewritten in 1987 in
order to avoid a dictator like Ferdinand Marcos, set a six-year
single term for the president. However, President Fidel Ramos'
supporters, including the PIRMA members, have been trying to lift
the term limits for Ramos and other incumbent officials and
lawmakers by changing the charter.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision was widely welcomed by the opposition
and other walks of life. However, their joy may be short-lived.
Analysts said what had happened in the country proved that the
PIRMA died hard.
</P>
<P>
PIRMA executive director Mike Policarpio said he was very sad
about the commission's decision, but he would not give up. He said
his group would go back to the Supreme Court and find an issue
that would not be rejected outright by the court.
</P>
<P>
Legal sources had earlier raised the possibility that in
another round at the Supreme Court, the PIRMA may change the
fragile equation of voting in the court and win.
</P>
<P>
The Court voted 6-6 with an absentee on June 10 to uphold its
early ban on moves to amend the constitution. Legal sources said
that three judges who participated in the voting are retiring
after August, raising a hope of victory for the PIRMA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez, who revealed to
the public that President Ramos was "too shy to say" he favored a
second term, said "other options" are still open to the
pro-charter change groups.
</P>
<P>
The constitution can be amended through three ways in the
country: a people's initiative, the convening of Congress into a
constituent assembly or the calling for a constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported earlier that House Representatives loyal
to President Ramos were considering the second way after the
Supreme Court banned the PIRMA.
</P>
<P>
However, House Speaker Jose de Venecia, a presidential aspirant
who enjoyed strong support in the House, opposed to changing the
charter before the 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts said that the "to be or not to be" of
the charter change groups was actually controlled by President
Ramos, who strongly opposed to charter changes but changed tune
this year.
</P>
<P>
In his recent report to the nation, the president called again
for review of the 1987 constitution to keep the country's fast
economic growth on track, saying that it was the people's right to
change the charter.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos has repeated on countless occasions that he
would step down as his term ends next June. But recently, he
admitted that it was hard to say "no" to supporters who favor his
staying in power.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil exploration in northwest China
indicates that the vast Jurassic stratum there is rich in oil,
with an expected reserve of 13 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Jurassic stratum, formed from 180
million to 135 million years ago, was regarded as a non-oil
bearing structure by Chinese geologists.
</P>
<P>
But the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has
succeeded in oil exploration in similar strata, and oil
departments in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China
have discovered 23 oil and gas fields, including two large ones,
in several basins.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Qinghai
Province also indicated that the Jurassic stratum is an oil-rich
layer.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the CNPC, the company has chosen
five major oil areas in the Northwest and the Jurassic stratum
will be the focus of exploration in those areas in the coming
years.

ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Tha Afghan Taliban militia have

</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Tuesday night by Pakistani Additional
Secretary in Foreign Office Iftikhar Murshad on his return from

<HEADLINE> Australia's Mining Giant Looks For Manganese Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's mining giant BHP Co.
Ltd is considering taking a major international partner into its
integrated manganese business to capitalize on forecast expansions
in the Asian steel market.
</P>
<P>
The partner is likely to be one of the major Japanese steel
makers or an existing ferro-alloy manufacturer supplying the steel
industry, the Australian Financial Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
Manganese, in the form of ferro-alloys smelted from the raw
manganese ore, is a vital ingredient in steel making.
</P>
<P>
The pressure to find a partner stems from dramatic changes
sweeping the manganese market in which ferro-alloy manufacturers
are becoming more directly aligned with the steel makers.
</P>
<P>
At present BHP's Groote Eylandt Mining Co produces about 2
million tons of manganese ore but only controls the smelting to
ferro-alloys of about half of that volume.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Hunt, general manager of BHP Manganese's Group, said
yesterday the company needed to increase that to about 80 percent
and lift production within the next few years to retain its market
share, particularly in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is getting extra ferro-alloy into Japan,"
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the world manganese production was consumed
as ferro-alloys in steel making, and with rising steel production
it was vital for BHP to conclude expansion plans or new alliance
deals within the next year, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
BHP, or the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, is the largest
mining company in Australia.

<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen declared Tuesday a successful conclusion to
the countdown to China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The large digital clock that stood on Tian'anmen Square
counting the days, minutes and seconds remaining to Hong Kong's
return will be moved to the Great Wall at Badaling, and a model of
the clock, one 256th the real timepiece's size, will be kept in
the Chinese Revolutionary Museum. Qian said that the digital clock
aroused enthusiasm in China's inland areas and Hong Kong, and had
a good social effect.
</P>
<P>
He said the model clock will play an important and special role
in conducting patriotic education and called on the Chinese people
to hold the banner of patriotism high and to rally closely around
the central committee of the Communist Party of China with Jiang
Zemin at its core, and to strive for the reunification of the
motherland, guided by Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
A new clock will be put in the same place on Tiananmen on
December 20, 1997, two years before China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, to count the time remaining to Macao's
return to the motherland.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyztan's new Foreign Minister,
Murafbek Imanaliyev, said today that the country's foreign policy
is to serve its economy.
</P>
<P>
A report from the capital, Bishkek, quoted Imanaliyev as saying
Kyrgyzstan will strengthen economic ties with the outside world
and absorb more foreign investment to boost the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Imanaliyev was holding his first news conference after being
appointed to the post on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign policy will not change with the personnel
changes in the foreign ministry and Kyrgyzstan will actively
develop relations with Russia, China, the United States and other
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the internal conflicts in Tajikistan and Afghanistan,
Imanaliyev said Kyrgyzstan would take an active part in the
mediating work, as the instability of the region would threaten
the security of Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Following a proposal by Kyrgystan President Askar Akayev,
representatives from Russia, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan and the
Afghan anti-Taliban union are expected to hold an international
conference on the Afghan issue in Bishkek before the end of this
year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Before the appointment, Imanaliyev headed the presidential
administration's department of international affairs and served as
the country's foreign minister between 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
President Akayev accepted the resignation of former minister,
Roza Otunbayeva, who was named the country's ambassador to Britain
and Northern Ireland, Interfax news agency reported on July 2. But
the report did not say why she stepped down from her post.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Pakistan Call for Cooperation in Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan
are calling for active interaction to solve regional issues,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers announced this on Tuesday after holding talks
on the situation in Afghanistan, the progress of an inter-Tajik
settlement and the development of India-Pakistan relations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that stabilization in Afghanistan can be achieved
only with the possibility of agreement by political forces and
then a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Gohar Ayub Khan, who arrived in Moscow on Monday for a two-day
visit, told Primakov that Pakistan recently initiated an increase
in inter-Afghan dialogue. This would be in preparation for
full-scale negotiations involving all warring sides of
Afghanistan, under United Nations supervision and in the presence
of Russia and the United States as country-guarantors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister is holding shuttle consultations with
Afghan sides to discuss preliminary conditions for a ceasefire
and the beginning of negotiations, but the sides are taking a
tough stances.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Pakistan noted that the unsettled territorial
problem for India and Pakistan in Kashmir is the only serious
threat of major military conflict in the world.
</P>
<P>
A conflict would have "dreadful consequences" because both
sides have powerful military potentials and advanced missile and
nuclear technologies, said Gohar Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of the eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Primakov said it would be
"the most serious mistake since the end of the World War Two --
although Russia and NATO have signed documents on bilateral
relations."
</P>
<P>
Primakov hoped NATO would respect and implement the agreement,
which "would actively keep the security of Russia and later change
the organization."
</P>
<P>
The NATO Secretary General, Javier Solona, announced on Tuesday
at the Madrid Summit that NATO had decided to formally invite the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to join the alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Dong Hong, a young archaeologist in
northwest China's Gansu Province, revealed recently that Zhang
Jiang, a Chinese artist of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220)
had created many copies of the famous "bronze flying horse".
</P>
<P>
The "flying horse" was chosen as the symbol of Chinese tourism
earlier this year. It was first discovered in Han tomb No.1 two
years ago. The owner of the tomb was Zhang Jiang himself. Dong has
done a year of research on Han tomb No.2 since it was unearthed
near No.1 in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that No.2 has a 38-m tomb passage and three coffin
chambers. On the passage walls are frescoes of moon and sun
worship in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Among the historical relics unearthed in the tomb are items of
pottery and ancient coins, and a bronze horse tail, which is
similar to the tail of the "flying horse", according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
Those buried in tomb No.2 were the ancestors of Zhang Jiang, a
senior official of the Han Dynasty, Dong said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Urged to Lure Foreign Investors With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government's review
of industry assistance is expected to recommend that Australia
appoint a high-level investment ambassador with authority to offer
foreign companies financial incentives to set up business in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The review will urge the federal government to adopt a more
aggressive and interventionist approach to attract offshore
investment, similar to that used in countries such as Japan and
Singapore, the Australian Financial Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
In another strong challenge to the Australian government's
economic orthodoxy, the government's information industries task
force, chaired by former Liberal Party President Professor Ashley
Goldsworthy, is set to recommend the use of tax incentives to
encourage multinational companies to set up manufacturing plants
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
A proposed overhaul of business assistance schemes include
reducing the plethora of programs to five core areas covering
exports, investment, innovation, competitiveness and
sustainability, setting growth targets in key areas such as
exports, providing direct financial assistance for foreign
companies, which could be used to purchase land or other
equipment, to encourage them to invest in Australia.
</P>
<P>
After a six-month inquiry, the review of industry assistance
has decided that the present system, which involves more than 130
programs and 1.5 billion US dollars in direct expenditure each
year, is cumbersome and lacks transparency.
</P>
<P>
The core findings of the report are now being tested with major
industry groups and within the government before it is presented
to Minister for Industry John Moore in about three weeks, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stock Market Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Weiguo, chief accountant of
the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), says that China
has been successful in expanding its securities market,
establishing a legal and supervisory framework, improving market
technology, and training securities personnel over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"The sustained, rapid and sound development of the Chinese
economy has provided strong back-up for a growing stock market,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, the Chinese stock market
grew 44 percent to 160 billion shares, on total capitalization of
1.667 trillion yuan, up 69 percent from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 state enterprises have listed shares overseas,
raising nearly eight billion US dollars in overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
Market legislation has improved with a series of regulations
since 1993, on information disclosure, management of the stock
exchange, and issuing and trading stocks.
</P>
<P>
Zhang emphasized that the inclusion of securities crimes in the
new Criminal Law will help halt securities crimes by severely
penalizing those involved in stock price manipulation, insider
trading, giving of false information, and other securities
violations.
</P>
<P>
The use of better technology has helped build better operations
in the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, with a high-speed system
of trading, information dissemination, and market surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Securities brokerages have also flourished because of the
booming stock market, with the number of people involved in the
sector well above a million.
</P>
<P>
"However, the most important and far-reaching significance of a
gradually maturing stock market lies in its role in fostering a
socialist market economy in China," Zhang noted.

<HEADLINE> Klein Announces Extension of Mandate in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Transitional
Administrator in Eastern Slavonia Jacques Klein said here today
that the U.N. mandate in the region would be extended to next year.
</P>
<P>
Klein, the outgoing U.N. administrator for the last rebel
Serb-held part of Croatia, made the announcement after meeting
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Klein said "The mandate should be voted this week in the
U.N. Security Council, and my feeling is that it will be extended
to January 15 next year."
</P>
<P>
The postponement proposal was made among concerns that the
ethnic reconciliation has proceeded slower than hoped.
</P>
<P>
Both Serbia and Croatia agreed to put Eastern Slavonia under a
U.N. protectorate for up to two years and demilitarize it in a
deal worked out during the Dayton Peace Accord negotiations which
ended the near four-year war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission has been overseeing the transition back to
Croation control, a move which, under the deal, must be completed
by January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the continuing demilitarization of
the region and the dual nationality of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Klein said that demilitarization was the main issue to be
solved by the peacekeepers and suggested that both Croatian and
Yugoslav troops remain at least 15 kilometers from the border.

<HEADLINE> State Inspects Appraisal Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a national drive
to standardize its burgioning appraisal business by eliminating
unqualified agencies, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of State Property
(Sasp) said a list of unqualified asset valuation agencies will be
announced soon after provincial branches of SASP wind up their
inspection of the 3,200 agencies under provincial supervision.
</P>
<P>
Sasp's headquarters in Beijing has finished the inspection of
the 107 agencies directly under its surveillance, revoking
licences for two agencies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, when the first appraisal agency was approved, firms
have mushroomed throughout the country. Public intermediaries such
as accounting firms and legal offices also shared a piece of the
market.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are about 3,300 agencies doing valuation business
in China, employing 55,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the business was brought about by
increasing property ownership and co-operation activities among
Chinese enterprises and overseas firms doing business here.
</P>
<P>
The current headache for Sasp, regulator of the appraisal
industry, is that many valuating agencies have been set up hastily
to meet market need. This has proved harmful for the industry's
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Appraisal reports signed by these agencies -- usually with
unreliable and unprofessional staff -- often caused business
disputes or a drain on State assets.
</P>
<P>
Sasp believes the 3,300 agencies are definitely enough for
handling the country's appraisal business and in fact, there have
been more appraisal firms than needed in some areas.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the administration decided to stamp out
irregular practices and shut down bad agencies.

<HEADLINE> East China City Protects Groundwater Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Suzhou City has
increased efforts to protect its groundwater resources and has
been successful in controlling ground subsidence.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent nearly 25 million yuan on groundwater
protection. Figures show that the volume of groundwater it has
used dropped to 60,000 cubic meters, which is within the range set
by the state.
</P>
<P>
The city's over-extraction of groundwater in the past has been
the cause of the surface subsidence, and it remains a hidden peril
in industrial and agricultural production and in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the city has tightened controls on
groundwater use. There are quotas on water use at the beginning of
the year, and extra fees at the end of the year if the quotas are
exceeded.
</P>
<P>
The city has made stricter controls on the extraction of
groundwater, and has at the same time taken steps to increase the
recycling rate of industrial waste water to 75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Funding of Highways Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China is probing various
fund-raising channels to fuel a steady boom of highway and
waterway infrastructure construction, as the 21st century
approaches, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides continuing to use loans from international financing
organizations and foreign governments, the Chinese government
expects more private capital from overseas individuals, officials
with the Ministry of Communications said yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The country is planning to use the BOT (build, operate and
transfer) method, under which foreign investors run the completed
facility for a specified period before transferring it to the
Chinese, officials said.
</P>
<P>
As another means to raise funds, the government plans to list a
few expressways, including Shanghai-Nanjing, Shenyang-Dalian and
Jinan-Qingdao, on overseas stock markets, following the successful
listing of some highways of Guangdong province in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China used about 5.8 billion US dollars in
loans from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the
Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan and other foreign
governments to build ports and highways, said Vice-Minister of
Communications Hong Shanxiang.
</P>
<P>
The loans have helped build some major coastal ports with an
increased handling capacity of 85 million tons and 10,000
kilometers of highways throughout the country, said Hong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to using foreign funds, highway and waterway
transport departments are collecting fees and setting up
foundations for infrastructure construction, he said said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingjia, deputy-director of the ministry's Highway
Management Department, said 110,000 kilometers of highways
including 6,500 kilometers of expressways, will be added in China
before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to key highways across the
country: Tongjiang-Sanya, Lianyungang-Huo'erguosi,
Shanghai-Chengdu, Beijing-Zhuhai, Beijing-Shanghai,
Beijing-Shenyang and a highway stretching southeast from Chongqing
to the sea.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the ministry plans to extend the
lengths of roads open to traffic to 1.25 million kilometers,
focusing on high-standard highways and expressways. China has 1.18
million kilometers of roads now.
</P>
<P>
Li Wuzhou, deputy-director of the ministry's Infrastructure
Construction Department, said the government plans to build some
major port hubs, focusing on those vital for energy transport,
foreign trade and raw materials transport.
</P>
<P>
Ports include Qinghuangdao, Dalian, Qingdao, Shanghai and
Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Work to improve inland waterways along the Yangtze River, the
Pearl River and the Grand Canal as well as the navigation network
in Yangtze and the Pearl River deltas will also be the priority, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Craze Cooling Down for International Auto Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Only hundreds of Beijing people
toured the Beijing International Automobiles, Motorcycles and
Manufacturing Equipment Show (AMS '97), opened here Tuesday,
indicating the city's enthusiasm for auto shows is cooling down.
</P>
<P>
There used to be thousands of visitors to such auto shows held
in Beijing, and many of them were potential car buyers, according
to industrial analysts.
</P>
<P>
AMS '97 touted itself at the most authoritative auto show in
China, But due largely to the short interval between Shanghai's
auto show and the four-day event in Beijing, the exhibition drew
relatively few audience during the morning session, today's China
Daily quoted industrial analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 foreign and domestic auto-makers and parts
suppliers attended the event, most of whom now seem to have little
confidence in the compact of auto shows.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the potential car buyers to visit the
exhibition hope to see some cars immediately affordable, they
say.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that endeavors by all of us will revitalize the
industry and promote its strategic development," said Lu Fuyuan,
vice-minister of Machine-Building Industry at the exhibition's
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set a production goal of 1.3 million cars and
8 million motorcycles by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of auto industry executives conducted by State
Statistics Bureau indicated that private demand for motor vehicles
would rise to 48.9 percent of all the vehicle sales, with 450,000
cars predicted to be sold.
</P>
<P>
Although beset by excessive competition, auto makers from
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, France, Italy and United
States lost no chance to grab a bigger share of the most enormous
potential market in the world.

BERLIN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- New South Wales Premier Bob Carr

would not be listed in the programmes of the 2000 Olympic Games in

Carr, who was in Berlin to promote the Games, said that it was
a pointless exercise in building a special site for the sport as
it would not be used after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"No one in Austrlaia competes in this sport internationally so
there is no point in having it at the Sydney Olympics," Carr said.
</P>
<P>
"There is little point in building a special site for this
sport which will not be used at all after the Games are over,
while other stadia will remain very popular," Carr added.

</P>
<P>
Of that number, nearly one-half are registered at the

<P>
According to official statistics, sales of arms in commercial
establishments have diminished in the country but the business is
flourishing in the black market.

In spite of the government's efforts to provide greater
control, the number of assaults, assassinations and robberies are
increasing day by day.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Laura Chinchilla stated that she
believes this situation is due to a proliferation of unregistered
arms among the population.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Clarify Ronaldo Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- FIFA will issue a statement on
Wednesday to clarify it position on Brazilian striker Ronaldo's
transfer from Barcelona to Internazionale.
</P>
<P>
Growing confusion over who owns the world footballer of the
year, combined with a recent statement by the European Commission,
warning FIFA that its transfer regulations may contravene European
Union law, have forced FIFA to make its position clear.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said on Tuesday that a press
release would also contain the long awaited date of a Players
Status Committee meeting and, "what will happen to the players in
the meantime".
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which has now widened to include the attempted
move from Athletic Bilbao to Bayern Munich of French international
defender Bixente Lizarazu, centers around "buyout" clauses found
in Spanish league contracts.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo is reported to have bought out his contract with
Barcelona for 27.5 million U.S. dollars but the Spanish Football
Federation has refused to issue a transfer certificate for the
20-year-old Brazilian on the grounds that such "buyouts" or
withdrawal clauses are valid for domestic transfers only.
</P>
<P>
FIFA rules also state that a player cannot buy out his contract
for the purposes of obtaining an international transfer.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, however, maintains that such rules
infringe workers' rights to free movement -- a right granted in
the landmark Bosman ruling.

ATHENS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch hinted on Tuesday that Athens may
have a historical advantage in its bid for the 2004 Olympic Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the five cities bidding for the summer games
were "very precious" for him as IOC president, and "are in the
same status. But I would like also to say that maybe the Olympic
movement has a historical debt to Athens."
</P>
<P>
Four other cities seeking the 2004 Games are Buenos Aires, Cape
Town, Stockholm and Rome. The IOC will pick the winner on Senial
Gaesi
</P>
<P>
Samaranch made the statement while planting an olive tree from
Ancient Olympia in an Athens park dedicated to the Olympic
movement. IOC members who visit Athens each plant a tree in the
park.

<HEADLINE> Transnationals Pin High Hopes on Yangpu Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Many transnational corporations from
the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea have shown
greater interest in involving themselves in heavy industrial
projects in the Yangpu Development Zone in Hainan Province, South
China.
</P>
<P>
The companies include the ACO Petroleum Co., Morgan Consortium,
South Korea's Hyundae Consortium, and Japan's Marubeni Corporation,
Nissho Iwai Co. and Fosuke Funai.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu, in the west of Hainan Island, is China's first
industrial zone solely developed by foreign investors and has
adopted one of the most favorable opening policies in the country.
</P>
<P>
After several years of infrastructure construction, Yangpu,
with an excellent harbor and rich local resources, has the
conditions to be built into a coastal heavy industrial base have
matured.
</P>
<P>
A chemical fertilizer project with an investment of 15.5
billion yuan from the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC), and a solely-foreign-funded pulp project have already
been approved.
</P>
<P>
Exploration by CNOOC and ACO shows that there are about 58
million cu m of natural gas in the Beibu Bay Basin, Yinggehai
Basin and Qiongdongnan Basin to the southwest of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The annual handling capacity of Yangpu Harbor amounts to one
million tons. The second phase of an expansion project will double
its handling capacity over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Chinese petrochemicals experts are drawing up a
development program giving priority to the petroleum and natural
gas industry.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the development target for Yangpu has been
changed from that of a Hong Kong-style free trade and export
processing zone to a coastal heavy industrial zone like those in
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economists and entrepreneurs from the Overseas Enterprise
Association of Japan, who made an inspection tour to Yangpu
recently, agreed with this strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Nissho Iwai Corporation, Samsung and some other
corporations are consulting about iron and steel projects. More
than 20 projects in this field have already been approved, with a
total investment of about seven billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
jumped 103.82 points to 7,962.31, within 40 points of 8,000 today
as stocks rallied in an optimistic prelude to the impending flood
of second-quarter profit reports.
</P>
<P>
It was the first close above 7,900 for the blue-chip barometer,
which has now risen 23.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 525.61
million shares as against 518.78 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.55 to 918.75, and
the NYSE composite index rose 2.94 to 478.49, enough for both to
beat Thursday's record highs.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.33 to 1,485.07, its fourth
straight record close. The American Stock Exchange composite index
rose 2.14 to 634.11, just 0.23 shy of Thursday's record finish.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also set new highs, rallying into the
close after posting more modest gains for much of the session.
</P>
<P>
With no major economic data today, the market focus shifted to
the early trickle of company profit reports for the just-ended
second quarter.

<HEADLINE> European Ministers Agree to Limit State Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- European countries agreed in principle
today not to impose new taxes or regulations on business conducted
over the Internet and instead they will largely allow the private
sector to play a key role in determining how to run cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
In a non-binding declaration agreed after a two-day ministerial
meeting in Bonn, 29 European countries agreed that the potential
of the Internet could only be fully tapped if national governments
reduced their intervention to the minimum level.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said private investment and standards should be
given priority in building the Internet; no new tax levies should
be imposed on the commercial use of Internet; the right to free
expression should be protected; and data encryption technologies
should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
But it also stressed that international agreements were needed
to ensure that digital signatures on documents were legally
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers from the European Union
(EU) and the European Free Trade Association nations as well as
some eastern European countries. Representatives from the United
States, Canada, Russia and Japan attended the meeting as
observers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said the Bonn declaration
was close to suggestions made by U.S. President Bill Clinton for
an Internet free trade zone, but there were also differences.
</P>
<P>
The United States requires providers of encryption, or
information scrambling, technologies to let the law enforcement
authorities have a "key" in order to gather evidence against
criminals. Washington also keeps a tight control on the export of
software with strong encryption.
</P>
<P>
Because a majority of software powerhouses are in the United
States, the Europeans fear that they will be put at a
disadvantageous position in this area and that it will enable U.S.
intelligence services to read their sensitive data.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the EU and the United States are scheduled to
meet in Brussels Wednesday to discuss the future of digital
commerce. The talks will focus on issues such as intellectual
property rights, the security of transactions, electronic payment
systems, data protection and taxation on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> US Watches Closely Developments in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is watching
the situation in Cambodia very closely and urging the two
political factions to reaffirm their support for the 1991 Paris
Peace Accords, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to review the situation as closely as we
can... (while) urging all the time the two major political
factions to reaffirm their support for the Paris Peace Accords of
1991, respect for the people elected in 1993 and respect for the
fact that we believe that any differences between the two factions
ought not to be resolved by gunfire," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Troops loyal to Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen moved against those supporting First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh in the capital of Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh is
reported under the control of Hun Sen who declared to have ousted
Prince Ranariddh while he was in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the Clinton administration is taking a
wait-and-see attitude with regard to the chaotic Cambodian
situation, which is said to be too murky at this point to draw any
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh
was to come to Washington and U.S. officials would meet him when
he arrives.
</P>
<P>
"Given our relationship with him (Prince Ranariddh), he's an
elected leader in Cambodia, we will obviously see him here at the
State Department," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S. Acting Secretary of State Tom Pickering
consulted with senior representatives of many countries Monday,
including ambassadors and senior representatives from the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries, the other four
permanent countries of the U.N. Security Council, Japan and
Australia about the situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials have also made telephone
conversations with Ken Quinn, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, for
further information, Burns added.
</P>
<P>
Based on these meetings and the conversations, Burns said, the
Clinton administration reiterated its position on Cambodia:
</P>
<P>
The use of force to overturn the 1993 election in Cambodia is
unacceptable and the principles of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords
must be upheld; Cambodian political parties, including the
political party of First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh, must be
allowed to operate freely; free and fair elections should be held
as scheduled in 1998; and the United States is opposed to having
senior Khmer Rouge leaders play any role in Cambodian politics.
</P>
<P>
The United States has yet to decide whether to evacuate its
citizens from Cambodia, but three ships carrying marines and
helicopters are put on alert in Japan in case an order comes
forward for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The commander-in-chief of the Pacific Command in Hawaii has
ordered the three ships, the Belleau, the Fort McHenry and the
Dubuque, on alert "for their potential use (for) evacuating
non-combatants and maybe third country nationals" from Cambodia,
Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Com. Karen Jeffries said at a briefing
today.
</P>
<P>
The three ships, carrying several hundred marines and
helicopters, are now based at Sasebo in Japan. It would take them
four days to reach the Cambodian coast if they receive the order
for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
But some other officials said the evacuation looked less likely
as the situation was actually easing after days of ferocious
fighting between rival factions in Phnom Penh, the capital of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The Pentagon is preparing for possible contingency if
something were to be necessary but so far the situation is
becoming more calm rather than less calm," they said.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is prudent preparation for a possible future need
but not something that's actually going on right now," they added.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Turkey Agree to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey today agreed
upon a set of principles to improve their relations, including a
commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means, the U.S. State
Department announced.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting between Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail
Cem, in Madrid. The meeting was hosted by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
are gathering in Madrid on the alliance's expansion and its
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The meeting among the three foreign ministers focused on the
Greek-Turkish dispute over the Aegean Sea that has burdened
relations since early 1996 when they almost came to blows over a
small Aegean island known to Greeks as Imia and to Turks as
Kardak.
</P>
<P>
The two sides committed to peace, security, and the continuing
development of good neighborly relations between the two, and
respect for each other's sovereignty, State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their "willingness to avoid conflicts
arising from misunderstanding; and, finally, a commitment to
settle disputes by peaceful means, based on mutual consent and
without use of force or the threat of force," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe... that this is a significant step forward for both
Greece and Turkey," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is a new foundation for Greek-Turkish
relations, and we look now to both of those countries to take
practical steps to move that relation forward," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Borrowing Up 2.9 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The increase of Americans' debt
burden slowed in May resulting mainly from the sharpest decline of
auto borrowing in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today that the consumer
debt outstanding rose at a 2.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual
rate to 1.21 trillion dollars in May, following increases at a 9.7
percent rate in April and a 2.7 percent rate in March,
</P>
<P>
The report said that credit-card debt inched higher at a 1.8
percent annual rate in May, down from 13.4 percent a month
earlier. Auto loans outstanding fell at a rate of 5.4 percent, the
largest decline since October 1992 and down from an advance at a
14.5 percent rate in April.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of consumer debt rose at a 13.3 percent rate, after
shrinking at a 0.3 percent rate in April. This category includes
loans for mobile homes, education, boats and vacations. The report
doesn't include home mortgages or home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
It was another sign that the U.S. economic growth was
moderating after a strong increase in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer-spending represents about two-thirds of overall U.S.
economic activity. Its sharp increase early in the year prompted
the U.S. Fed to dampen demand by raising short-term interest rates
a quarter percentage point on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The moderation in the April-June period, when analysts believe
economic growth slowed to about a 2 percent rate, has allowed the
U.S. central bank to postpone further rate increases.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the report provided more evidence that
consumers took a breather after a spending spree early in the year
that powered first-quarter economic growth to a decade-high 5.9
percent annual rate.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy to Grow 3.1 Percent in 1997: Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy is expected to grow
3.1 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1998, an economic think
tank said here today.
</P>
<P>
In its summer outlook released today, the Conference Board of
Canada revised upwards its overall growth projections for this
year and the next.
</P>
<P>
Its previous projections set Canada's 1997 economic growth at
2.9 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This upturn in overall growth comes at a good time for
debt-laden consumers, since it reflects the recent surge in job
creation," said Paul Darby, director of economic services of the
board.
</P>
<P>
"Since mid-1996, production has been outpacing job creation and
with good prospects for further demand growth, employers are
starting to hire," he added.
</P>
<P>
The job creation of the last three months, low interest rates
and wage gains will provide a foundation for improved consumer
demand, the board said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, consumer recovery will be contained because savings have
dwindled to almost nothing, household debt is at record levels and
bankruptcies have been soaring, it noted.
</P>
<P>
While Canada's exports are to remain robust, export growth will
likely lag imports this year.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that the country's inflation will remain stable,
averaging 1.9 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Its unemployment rate will average 9.5 percent this year, down
from 9.7 percent last year, it added.
