<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Urges Normalization of Iraqi-French Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi government newspaper
today urged France to consider "more seriously" the normalization
of relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra, organ of the Iraqi ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said Iraq can forgive France's hostile acts against it
since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But it expressed the hope that France can "rectify" its
strategic mistake so that France's role in the Gulf War would be
seen as "merely a mistake" made by former French President
Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Any hesitation by France to mend fences would show that France
might commit the same mistake and harm Arabs through Iraq, the
newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper made an attack on France for its
reported decision not to treat President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son, Odai, who was wounded in an attempt on his life last month
here.
</P>
<P>
Iraq severed diplomatic ties with France six years ago. Now the
Iraqi authorities eagerly want to restore their friendly
relationship to the level in the 1980s and lift the
U.N. six-year-old embargo imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait
with the help of France, a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rises Slightly Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation
rose slightly to about 16.4 percent in December, 1996 compared with
13.9 percent last November, according to figures obtained from
the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe today.
</P>
<P>
The major contributor to the rise in inflatgion in December
last year was the increase in fuel prices, salaries and wages, as
well as medical fees.
</P>
<P>
In the draft document detailing the second stage of market reforms
to be launched this year, the Zimbabwe government has pledged to
pursue fiscal and monetary policies that will reduce inflation
further to single digit figures by the year 2001. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Hydro-electric Power Generation Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's hydro-electric power
source, Lake Kariba, is at a critically low level for power
generation, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The water situation in Lake Kariba remains critical with
water flows over Victoria Falls having dropped to less than 100
cubic meters per second, the lowest flow levels ever recorded
since records began in 1907," the ZESA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"With the water level in Lake Kariba at this level, it
presents a serious challenge to the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA)
which manages the waters of the mighty river on behalf of Zambia
and Zimbabwe regarding the water allocation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Lake Kariba is the world's largest man-made lake. Its flow
rate just picked up with recent rains.
</P>
<P>
A meeting is due to be held on Friday between the ZRA, ZESA and
Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) to discuss power
allocation for the period from February 1 to July 31.

<HEADLINE> UN, Europe Show Concern on Water Stress in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched
today their first annual joint statement on the environment,
focusing on water resources under serious stress in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Water stress requires radical new approaches to the use and
management of water resources if Europeans are to avoid severe
water crises, the joint statement warned. Water stress refers to
shortages, floods, pollution and damaged ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
"We have a 19th century approach to 21st century problems,"
said Domingo Jimenez Beltran, EEA executive director. "We just
think of supplying new dams and pipelines rather than increasing
water use efficiency. Prices don't cover the full cost of
supplying and using water, which encourages its inefficient use.
An integrated approach to water quality and quantity is needed."
</P>
<P>
"Concerted action at the European level is becoming more and
more essential," said Frits Schlingemann, UNEP representative
and regional director for Europe. "International organizations
provide a forum for promoting and complementing national action
through international cooperation. Detailed and reliable
information as well as analyses of the world's fresh water systems
can help promote solutions for easing related environmental
pressures."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that new political agreements on
integrated river basin management and greater public support for
new types of policy instruments such as taxes, voluntary
agreements and tradable permits are needed if these initiatives
are to be implemented successfully.
</P>
<P>
Major points in the statement include:
</P>
<P>
-- Drinking-water losses from pipes are estimated at 30 percent
in most European countries and up to 70 percent to 80 percent in
some cities;
</P>
<P>
-- About 60 percent of large European cities are
over-exploiting their groundwater resources for their drinking and
other water needs. If depleted or polluted, these resources are
expensive and time-consuming to restore;
</P>
<P>
-- As water shortages increase, river basin authorities are
restricting water-use for industry. Similar pressures on
agriculture are likely to occur in the near future;
</P>
<P>
-- Other threats include the increase of the global mean sea
level due to changes in climate and run-off patterns of water
courses in some areas.

<HEADLINE> Locusts No Longer Problem in Zimbabwe This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Di Taylor, an entomologist of
the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe, said today the menacing
red locust has disappeared in the most areas of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the locusts are no longer moving in swarms as
before, but are scattered all over thus posing no threat to
crops.
</P>
<P>
"They are no very much spread out and the situation is far
much better than what it was this time last year," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
She said a South African expert on locust has been working to
fight the insects in Mozambique, where they are believed to have
originated from.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's farmers lost crops worth millions of Dollars from
the red locusts last year and there are fears that there would
more damage this year once they are allowed to breed in large
numbers.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Imbalance Climbs to 8.4 Bln Dlrs in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
climbed up slightly to 8.4 billion U.S. dollars in November,
according to a report from the Commerce Department today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the November trade deficit in goods
and services was up 4.9 percent from October's 8 billion dollars
imbalance despite the fact that the two months represented big
improvements from previous double-digit figures in red that
included a record high of 11.8 billion dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
However, the slight increase in November was a much better
result than some analyists' earlier prediction of a sharp shoot-up
to some 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For November, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan dropped 12.9
percent to 4.3 billion dollars. For the first 11 months, the
country's deficit with Japan amounted to 43.4 billion dollars,
down 22 percent from the same period a year ago. That level
represents the lowest imbalance with Japan since 1991.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, America's foreign oil bill declined by 13.4
percent to 5.43 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, U.S. exports of goods and services rose 0.3 percent
to a record 71.97 billion dollars while imports went up 0.8
percent to some 80.37 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But even with the recent improvement, the U.S. trade deficit
for 1996 is running at an annual rate of 112 billion dollars as
compared with the trade gap of 105.1 billion dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Solana, Kinkel Discuss NATO-Russia Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his Moscow visit,
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary-General Javier
Solana held talks in Bonn today with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel on the eastward expansion of the military alliance and its
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to German Foreign Ministry, both Solana and Kinkel
stressed at the meeting that NATO should make an agreement with
Russia on the issue of NATO's eastward expansion before the
alliance's Madrid summit this July.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming summit, NATO will nominate the first group
of countries in Central and Eastern Europe as candidates for the
Western alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO should seek consensus with Russia on the basis
of a strong, stable and sustained security partnership. He also
expressed confidence in an "enlarged NATO" in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel promised to give "full support" to Solana's
Moscow visit next week, saying Germany will continue its efforts
to allay Russia's fear over the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that Germany aimed to draw in Russia as
"a partner with equal rights" to the construction of "a new
European security architecture."
</P>
<P>
He recalled his proposal for a special "NATO-Russia charter,"
under which Russia will be allowed to discuss matters of common
concern as an equal partner in a permanent consultation committee
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he himself would be visiting Moscow in a few weeks
for talks on the issue with his Russian counterpart Yevgeni
Primakov. The latter will in turn send an envoy to Bonn within
this month.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Up 0.8 Percent in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
increased by 0.8 percent in December for the second straight month
and rose by 3.2 percent for all of 1996, the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that December's production of durable goods
-- items such as cars and computers expected to last more than
three years -- shot up by 1.3 percent, stronger than the 0.9
percent gain in November.
</P>
<P>
Nondurable goods output was up 0.8 percent after increasing 0.5
percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output jumped by 1.1 percent in December, up from
0.7 percent a month earlier. Production at mines surged 1.2
percent, double the 0.6 percent gain in November.
</P>
<P>
But utility output plunged by 3.3 percent, more than erasing a
2.3 percent advance a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report supports other data showing inflation under
control. It said that the U.S. industries were operating at 83.8
percent of capacity, up from 83.4 percent in November. It was the
highest rate since it reached 83.9 percent in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, that is still less than the 85 percent capacity
utilization which analysts say would result in the production
bottlenecks that could lead to shortages in the labor market and
higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Industry Fully Liberalized in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Major reform measures in
Kenya's coffee industry have been announced over the past months
to accelerate commercial competitiveness of the industry with
minimal state control.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kenyan government announced major changes in
the management of the coffee industry, which would lead to its
full liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the changes, then Agriculture Minister Simeon
Nyachae said that the coffee growers are given power to elect
directors who in turn will pick a chairman and choose a chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Kenyan law empowered the agriculture minister
to appoint a chairman and a chief executive from among the
directors.
</P>
<P>
The government will withdraw from the Coffee Board of Kenya
(CBK), which was set up by the government to manage the coffee
industry, so that it can become purely a farmers' organization.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued last November, the Kenyan government
announced that the Central Coffee Auction, which had been adopted
for the coffee industry in the past, is converted into a coffee
exchange to facilitate the fixing of reserve prices and balloting
for floor auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
CBK General Manager Aggrey Murunga described the move as a
further step in the liberalization of the coffee industry, which
is the main earner of foreign exchange in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The coffee production in the country in the past three
years increased by 28 percent from 75,516 tons in 1993-94 to
97,575 tons in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, coffee output is estimated to fall in the 1996-97
crop year and some officials of the industry projected the output
at 85,000 tons, because of bad weather and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Last year Kenya earned 16.36 billion Kenyan Shillings (about
300 million U.S. Dollars) by exporting 110,000 tons of coffee,
compared with 14.4 billion Shillings in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Foreign Cooperation in Tank-building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign arms manufacturers are
invited to join a 4.5-billion-U.S.-dollar project of upgrading the
world's fourth largest tank fleet in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Turkey will produce 800 main battle tanks of
the third generation for its armed forces to meet the next
century's defense needs, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish military sources as saying that these
tanks would have higher maneuver ability, higher firing power as
well as lower weight.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, the number of the tanks under this project
will reach 2,500," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Four Turkish companies would be invited to bid for the project,
but any bidding Turkish company is required to find a foreign
partner which has experience in tank production, according to the
planned tender
</P>
<P>
The project is likely to kick off at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The project will greatly enhance Turkish armed forces' combat
capacity, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 780,000-strong Turkish troops is among the 10 largest
armies in the world, and its tank unit ranks fourth in the world,
according to the World Strategic Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Turkey has given priority to army
modernization programs and new weapons introduction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chief of General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces
Ismail Hakki Karadayi announced that 150 billion dollars would be
needed for the arms and operation of the Turkish armed forces in
the next 25 years.

<HEADLINE> 240 Million Kg of Tobacco Expected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe now expects to produce
240 million kg of tobacco, up from the original forecast of 230
million kg made last year, the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Public Relations Director Lal Taylor said all indications
pointed to another record crop, with many farmers now either
completing curing or reaping the early irrigated crop.
</P>
<P>
She said the area planted with the irrigated crop had been
doubled, mainly due to the availability of surface water
following an unusually heavy rain season during 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The ZTA has agreed that tobacco output should increase
gradually every year by at least 10 percent so as to meet rising
demand on the world market, she added.
</P>
<P>
"Indications are that demand is still there throughout the
world and we are hoping to meet that demand from our particularly
quality crop," she said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said, "We have had a good season and we are now
preparing for the opening of the auction floors on April 22."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe last season produced about 201 million kg, which were
expected to earn the country about 600 million U.S. Dollars in
foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> Nine Liberians Killed in Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were killed
and three others wounded in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, when
unidentified gunmen ambushed a vehicle Thursday morning,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims are identified as militiamen of the ethnic
wing of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia (ULIMO-J) led
by Roosevelt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
So far, nobody has declared responsible for the ambush, which
might be connected with the on-going disarmament exercise in that
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's estimated 60,000
factional fighters started on November 22 last year and only
about 7,000 of them put down their weapons two weeks before the
January 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The slow pace of disarmament is partly attributed to the delay
in the release of additional troops to the west African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, by some countries in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The lack of enthusiasm and cooperation of factional leaders is
also a major factor.
</P>
<P>
The program has been further jeopardized by recent calls from
two warlords for another peace conference.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Leader: PUK to Cut Ties With PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani said here today his party
will cut ties with the Turkish outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK).
</P>
<P>
Talabani said at a press conference:" We have no confidence in
them (PKK)," adding that there were two PKK camps in northern
Iraq, which was under his party's control.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PUK will not let any Kurdish group to have a military base
in northern Iraq and stage attacks against neighboring countries,
said Talabani.
</P>
<P>
"I also want Turkey to allow the transportation of
humanitarian aid of non-governmental organizations to northern
Iraq," said the PUK leader.
</P>
<P>
Talabani arrived here Thursday for the exchange of views
with Turkish officials on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-backed PUK fought with the Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP), supported by President Saddam Hussein, in late August of
last year, which led to U.S. air strike against Iraqi military
targets.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and the KDP then signed a peace deal on October 31,
1996 under mediation of the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rebels since
the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones after
the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

"There is no question that the missiles will not be deployed,"
the president said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus has
imposed lower interests rates on commercial banks, which is
regarded as a step toward total liberalization of the credit
system on the island.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the bank, as from today its
lending rate to commercial banks is 7 percent instead of 7.5
percent and the overnight deposits rate 4 percent instead of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its move was dictated by market condition and the
liquidity situation and due to prospects of the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
It added that this should affect interest rates in general and
at a later stage, the rates in dealings between commercial banks
and the private sector. However, in the long run, repercussion
will be in favor of the public, the Bank believed.
</P>
<P>
The cut of the interest rates is considered to be a step toward
total liberalization of the credit system in Cyprus in view of its
prospective accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for European Union full membership in 1990. The
EU is expected to start accession talks with Cyprus toward end of
this year or early next year.

<HEADLINE> America Online Boosts Network Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The America Online Inc., beset
by complaints from customers frustrated by its overloaded service,
said it will trim its advertisement campaign and spend an extra
100 million U.S. dollars beefing up its network to handle its
higher traffic load.
</P>
<P>
Since the company adopted a plan of 19.95 dollars a month for
unlimited use last December, the number of customers has swelled
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
It's just like an "eat as you can" plan, which has hooked
people on-line as long as they wish, some analysts said. Because
of the difficulty to login, many people stay on line even while
away for dinner. Members now spend an average of about half an
hour a day on-line, compared with just 14 minutes a few months
ago. Similar situation has occurred with other Internet service
providers such as Prodigy and Microsoft Net (MSN).
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that by pulling its new
television ads and cutting back on direct-marketing efforts, AOL
hopes to slow an influx of new members and reduce the strain on
its network, which has greeted thousands of members with slow
response time and busy signals.
</P>
<P>
The largest on-line company now boasts more than 8 million
members, with 1.2 million new comers in the most recent quarter.
Its network can handle a maximum of about 260,000 users on-line at
any given time. Last fall its usage peaked at about 140,000
customers at the same time. But member complaints about the
crowded network have become widespread. Over the past couple of
days, the company had to cut its capacity for hours to fix its
facilities.

<HEADLINE> EU to Take Legal Action Against Ireland on Overgrazing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to
take legal action against Ireland over the country's failure to
monitor the environmental damage done by sheep overgrazing,
according to well-informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The action, which is taken under the EU Rome Treaty, is part of
a wider set of legal proceedings against Ireland for failing to
protect ecologically sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all EU-funded grants are paid on the basis
that no other EU law is contravened and no environmental damage is
done.
</P>
<P>
One EU source was quoted as saying recently that the Irish
Department of Agriculture "hasn't policed this at all."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said that "we've
received nothing formally" regarding EU legal action against
Ireland, but "we have heard something is happening and we're
sitting on the edge of our seats."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Irish Agriculture Minister Ivan Yates
announced a package of financial measures to lessen the problem of
sheep overgrazing in sensitive mountain areas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, the Irish government gave generous cash
payments to those farmers who agreed to reduce sheep numbers on
the hills.
</P>
<P>
However, some Irish environmental groups have been drawing
attention to the widespread damage being done to blanket bog and
to other sensitive upland habitats by sheep overgrazing.
</P>
<P>
Following their complaints and some independent investigations,
the EU Commission has initialed a wider legal action over
Ireland's alleged failure to assess the environmental impact of
intensive farming projects.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Praises China's Publicity, Ideological Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The overall international and
domestic situation is good at present, and so is the work in
China's publicity and ideological work, Communist Party of China
(CPC) General Secretary Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the Chinese president, made the remark this
morning while addressing publicity department heads attending a
national conference on publicity and ideological work.
</P>
<P>
Departments in publicity and the ideological sector worked
together to build the material progress on one hand and strive for
social ethical and cultural progress on the other; they scored new
progress in various work last year following the remarkable
achievements made over the past three years since the 14th
National Party Congress, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Party Central Committee is satisfied
with the extensive work that has been done, mainly centered on the
convocation of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central
Committee, and new situation that emerged in the drive to promote
socialist ethics and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
"1997 is an important year in the history of development of our
party and country," he noted, and the publicity and ideological
sector should uphold the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It should also
focus on two major issues that concern the overall situation,
namely, resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and
the convening of the Party's 15th National Congress. All work
should be carried in a practical and down-to-earth manner.
</P>
<P>
In a final analysis, Jiang said, if a country wants to be
stronger and develop further, its economy must be boosted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he expressed the hope that officials in the publicity
and ideological field across the country should, in keeping with
the Party's general guidelines and arrangements for the current
conference, continue to focus on economic development and open up
a new situation as they strive for ethical and cultural progress, so
as to provide a still more powerful ideological guarantee for
advancing reform, opening-up and the modernization drive, and create
a stable and unified environment for Hong Kong's return and the
Party's 15th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded by wishing people in publicity and ideological
field still greater successes in their work this year,
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, a member of both the Political Bureau and the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and head of the
Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, participated
in today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Britain Lags Behind Competitors in Basic Maths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain lags far behind in an
international basic maths test, with only half the success rate of
the Japanese and French and young adults considerably worse than
people over 45, according to a survey by the Basic Skills Agency.
</P>
<P>
The survey, of a total of almost 6,000 people in seven
industrialized countries, found that only 20 percent of British
adults could correctly work out 12 "common, everyday"
calculations.
</P>
<P>
Japan topped the numeracy table with 43 percent of respondents
answering every question correctly, followed by France (40
percent), Holland (38), Denmark (36), Sweden (34) and Australia
(33). Britain came bottom.
</P>
<P>
Among the British sample of 1,000 adults, women performed worse
than men and 16- to 24-year-olds did much worse than those over 45,
with 16 percent answering all questions correctly compared with 29
percent of the older age group.
</P>
<P>
Another survey also published by the agency, a charity that
encourages adult education, found that numeracy had a significant
and sustained impact on adults' lives, and especially their
chances in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
It showed that men with poor numeracy were more likely to be
unemployed or in manual jobs while women were more likely to be in
part-time work.
</P>
<P>
Alan Wells, the agency's director, said that Britain's poor
performance was not just a recent problem.
</P>
<P>
"But to start climbing the table we need to raise expectations
and aspirations, stop expecting and accepting low standards and
motivate people to want to learn and improve," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretary,
welcomed the campaign and promised to announce more initiatives
later this month to tackle poor adult basic skills.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Continue Arms Deal with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's major
state arms producer, DENEL, said here today that there is no
question of an arms deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the company Paul Holtzhausen said in a statement
that the DENEL gave a demonstration of its tank-firing control
system in Syria last year.
</P>
<P>
But he said Syria has given no firm commitment to buying the
system, costing about 638 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He denies having asked permission from the National Arms
Coordinating Committee of the South African parliament to export
the system to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said his company only asked for a permit to
market its Tiger tank-firing control system in Syria, which was
granted at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has sparked a diplomatic row between South
Africa and the United States, which accuses Syria of supporting
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The DENEL was formed in the early 1990s as a private company
to take over control of South African arms industry from the
ARMSCOR, which is a government controlled group.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said early this
week that the cabinet did "conditionally agree" to sell Syria the
tank-firing control system last month, but a final decision will
not be made until the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Opposes Farmers' New Protest Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today expressed strong opposition to a renewed protest
action announced by farmers, likening it to blackmail.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament during a scheduled debate on
agricultural policy, Simitis said the protest action constituted a
blow to the country's fragile economy and society and harmed the
interests of farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Thessaly farmers' coordinating committee announced
Wednesday that farmers would begin protest action on January 28,
gradually escalating until February 4 when they would resume the
road and rail blockades which caused widespread disruption
nationwide in December. The 25-day blockade cost the country 1.6
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The farmers suspended their action during the Christmas and New
Year holidays but vowed to repeat it if demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
These demands include lower fuel costs and lower value added
tax (VAT) on farm equipment, higher price supports, especially for
cotton, and a 1.3 billion U.S. dollar rescheduling of debts to the
state Agricultural Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, farmers in central Greece will launch on
January 28 a series of protests, mostly disrupting public
services, to warn the government they mean business ahead of a
full-scale blockade.

<HEADLINE> EU to Assist Tanzania, Kenya in Building 5 Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
plans to spend another 210 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 350
million U.S. Dollars) on five road construction projects in
Tanzania and Kenya in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
EU Head of delegation here Peter Beck Christiansen today told
Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Daniel Arap Moi of
Kenya that out of the total amount, 150 billion Tanzanian
Shillings would be spend on rehabilitating three roads in the
country and 60 billion Tanzanian Shillings would finance road
rehabilitations in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Christiansen as saying at the
opening ceremony of the Musoma-Isebania road at Sirari border
town between the two sister countries that the roads to be built
in Kenya include Mai-Mahiu-Naivasha-Lanet (110 kilometers) and
Sultan Hamud Mtito-Andei section of Mombasa (135 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
He said on the Tanzania side three roads would undergo heavy
rehabilitations in the next two years. They are the
Mwanza-Nyanguge-Musoma road and urban roads in Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Others included a road linking Mwanza region with Nzaga and
one from Mwanza to Isaka and Dodoma-Singida road, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU official appealed to the two governments to ensure that
maintenance of the roads would be given a top priority and
suggested that the two east African States set aside sufficient
budgets for maintenance purposes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU head of delegation also advised the two
governments to implement an effective and viable maintenance
system through increased use of the private sector and to enforce
axle load standard.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Ruling Council Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's ruling Council of
State has held its first full meeting since October last year
under the good offices of Nigeria, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
All the six council members, three warlords and three
civilians, met outside Monrovia, capital of Liberia, on Thursday,
following negotiations by Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Tom
Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
The council was set up in 1995 as an interim authority, and it
was the first time it met since Charles Taylor, one of the
vice-chairmen and leader of the National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL), accused George Boley, another vice-chairman and
leader of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), of masterminding an
assassination on him in the council building on October 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose NPFL ignited the Liberian conflict in December
1989, escaped unhurt, but the incident left five of his
bodyguards dead and spread panic in the capital.
</P>
<P>
And Boley has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the incident, much of the council's business has been
conducted at members' homes.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be correct to say that this meeting is indeed
historic," said Ikimi, who heads a delegation of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia to evaluate
the on-going disarmament operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Taylor described the meeting as "very
successful", because "it was the first time Boley and I met
face-to-face" since the October incident.
</P>
<P>
"I walked over to Boley and shook his hands and we exchanged
greetings," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we in this country must begin to put some of the bad
things behind us and continue to move forward to meet the January
31 deadline for the completion of disarmament in preparation for
elections," Taylor said, quoted by the report.
But it didn't give any other details of the meeting.

Rural areas -- would be benefited from the assistance.
</P>
<P>
It said the four districts have already worked out the program
in conjunction with the villages ready for implementation.
</P>
<P>
It further said the Prime Minister's Office would be
responsible for the coordination of this program, whose objective

the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
To cap it all, the project's objective is to increase the
sustainable production of agricultural and forest products and
achieve financially sustainable development in the districts.

<HEADLINE> Biological Cigarette Filter Invented in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Greek researchers
today unveiled a new biological cigarette filter which they claim
can largely neutralize the harmful substances of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
Details on the filter were announced at a press conference by
Athens University physiology Professor Ioannis Stavridis,
Assistant Professor G. Deliconstantinos and the director of the
Onassion heart surgery center's medical service, Professor S.
Geroulanos.
</P>
<P>
The new filter, according to its creators, provides effective
protection against tar and other cigarette emissions. In addition,
they say the cost of its production is not higher than that of
conventional filters, while preserving the fragrant ingredients of
cigarettes and not changing their taste.
</P>
<P>
The new filter reportedly has the same appearance as
conventional cigarette filters.
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Stavridis, the basic ingredient of the
biological filter is haemoglobin, which is found in active
charcoal. He said the filter can withhold or neutralize
carcinogens -- such as nitrogen monoxide derivatives -- to a large
degree.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Stresses Building Roads to Enhance Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today urged building more road networks which he
said is vital for revitalizing East Africa Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot escape the need to build a network of good roads
that will link our countries and facilitate the efficient
movement of people and goods," Mkapa told a ceremony to mark the
completion of the Musoma-Isebanis road which links Tanzania and
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi and government officials of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa hoped that the Musoma-Isebania road would contribute to
the building of firm cooperation between Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also urged the people of Nyanza province in
Kenya and those of Mare region in Tanzania to see this road as an
opportunity for rapid self-development, and as a chance to
increase legal trade across the common border.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that the road would help strengthen transport
around Lake Victoria zone, adding that it provides an alternative
route to the landlocked countries of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"This road is clearly not useful to the people of Kenya and
Tanzania only, but also to those of the entire Great Lakes
region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has provided an investment of 40 billion
Tanzania Shillings (about 67 million U.S. Dollars) for the
construction of the road.
</P>
<P>
It has pledged to give another 109.5 billion Tanzanian
Shillings (about 182.5 million US Dollars) during the next five
years to rehabilitate 414 km of roads between Dodoma and Mwanza,
and 300 km of rural roads in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also agreed to finance emergency repairs of the
350-km Isaka-Rusumo Highway.

<HEADLINE> Africa Sustains Huge Loss to Poor Animal Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Africa is sustaining an annual
loss of about 850 million U.S. Dollars as a result of poor
collection of animal hides and skins.
</P>
<P>
A report from the News Agency of Nigeria said today that
livestock owners in Africa hardly receive any added value for a
good quality skin from an animal sold alive.
</P>
<P>
Though sub-Saharan Africa has approximately 10 percent of the
global cattle and buffalo population, the same percentage of
sheep and more than 20 percent of world's goats, its contribution
to global production of skins is less than the equivalent share
of total livestock.
</P>
<P>
Cattle and buffalo hides produced in sub-Saharan Africa is
less than nine percent, whereas Europe, with only eight percent
of cattle population, produces 15 percent of commercial skins,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
This is because of a higher slaughter level and the off-take
of livestocks in developed countries, as well as the fact that
the skins are not collected in sub-Saharan Africa for the market.

<HEADLINE> Canada Loses Magazine Case to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada has lost a cultural
battle to the United States after an international trade panel
ruled that its efforts to boost the domestic magazine industry
violate world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel has ruled in favor of
the U.S. in its trade dispute with Canada over the "split-run"
edition of the Sports Illustrated magazine, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The WTO preliminary decision was provided in confidence to the
Canadian and U.S. governments Thursday. The final ruling will be
rendered next month and made public soon after that.
</P>
<P>
Although the Canadian government is widely expected to appeal,
the chance of any major change in the final ruling is quite
remote, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the results, we plan to pursue our cultural
objectives," Nicole Bourget, a spokeswoman for International Trade
Minister Art Eggleton, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is going to continue to promote its cultural objectives
so that Canadians can have access to Canadian publications," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The trade case was filed by the U.S. at the WTO in March 1996
after a long battle over the attempts of the U.S. Time Warner Inc.
to establish an edition of Sports Illustrated in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated was forced to shut down its three-year-old
Canadian edition after Canada began to impose the 80 percent tax
in December 1995 on the revenue of split-run magazines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. complained that the new tax violates "national
treatment" provisions in the 1995 WTO pact.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO, a government must treat foreign companies the
same way they treat domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
Canada insisted that the tax was acceptable because of a WTO
clause that it did not sign, and was a reasonable response to a
U.S. attempt to raid the limited Canadian advertising market.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruling has dealt a serious blow to the Canadian
government's efforts to protect the cultural sector from
Americanization, the reports noted.
</P>
<P>
At present, half the English-language magazines in Canada and
four-fifths of those sold in newsstands are from abroad, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Will Go on: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
today outlined his new government programs for the next five
years, saying privatization of parastatal companies will continue
to be a key component of the government economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first session of the new National Assembly,
Chiluba reaffirmed that his government formed early last month is
''irrevocably committed to the privatization program."
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to complete the privatization program
within our second term of office including the sale of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), Mamba collieries, nitrogen
chemicals and Zamtel,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
The second term of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (MMD) government should be a period of delivery and
discipline and most importantly, commitment to duty, and hard
work must become a driving force, said Chiluba, who won his
re-election last November.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said cooperation between the police and the public is
important in preventing crime and arresting criminals. creation
of the neighborhood watch associations has increased community
participation in the fight against crime, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On education, he said by 1995 education spending had accounted
for almost 14 percent of the total public expenditure and the
government's ultimate target is to commit a higher percentage of
the total budget to education.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Chiluba also referred to the government
policies on housing, agriculture, social safety network and
environment protection among others.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Union Explains Stand at WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Trade Union Unity (OATUU) is opposed to the inclusion of labor
issues in the World Trade Organization (WTO) charter as it would
place developing countries at disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
It would lead to the abuse of the "social clause" in WTO by
the powerful trading countries against the weaker ones, OATUU
Secretary-General Hassan Sunmonu was quoted by a report as saying
in Accra, Ghana on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It would also block the chances of "the developing country to
resort to cross-retaliation within the WTO dispute settlement
mechanism even when it wins in a complaint against a more
powerful trading country," said Sunmonu.
</P>
<P>
According to the union leader, the "social clause" is an
embodiment of international conventions stipulating core labor
standards like the convention against child labor and the
convention for equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the International Labor Organization (ILO)
is currently the best body to handle labor issues because by its
representation, there is equal opportunity for members to take
collective decisions based on consensus.
</P>
<P>
"International labor standards are set by the tripartite
members of the ILO, namely, governments, employers and workers,
whereas within the WTO only governments are members," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that before the WTO takes on labor issues, it must be
structurally re-organized to give equal opportunities to member
countries, irrespective of their economic status.
</P>
<P>
And even the implementation of the Uruguay Round trade
agreement, which gave birth to WTO, revealed "great inequalities
in the distribution of benefits and costs", said the OATUU
Secretary-General.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister to Visit Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy will visit Cuba on January 21 and 22 to
discuss a number of bilateral and multilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome this opportunity to review our relations and
exchange views on a broad range of issues," Axworthy said today in
a statement announcing the visit.
</P>
<P>
Canada has maintained a long-standing dialogue with Cuba that
includes questions of human rights, good governance, trade and
economic and legal reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Canada and Cuba may not agree on all issues, we have
chosen to discuss our differences of views in a context of
engagement and dialogue, and not one of confrontation and
isolation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believes it is important to raise and discuss these
views at an appropriate political level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1945, Canada has pursued its policy of dialogue with Cuba
through successive governments and has maintained interrupted
diplomatic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy's forthcoming visit is the first by a Canadian foreign
minister since 1959, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa)
Christine Stewart will go to Cuba along with the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
This visit follows one to Canada by Carlos Lage Davila, the
vice president of the Cuban Council State, in October 1996.

<HEADLINE> France Not Against South Africa-Syria Arms Deal, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- France today said it is not
against an arms deal between South Africa and Syria despite the
United States' opposition to it, the Syrian Arab News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the news agency in Paris, French Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Eve Dotrau said Syria and South Africa are
sovereign countries and "We are for the sovereignty of
countries. That is a very important principle in the international
law."
</P>
<P>
The French official was commenting on the fact that the
U.S. pressurizes South Africa to cancel its
641-million-U.S.-dollar arms deal to sell tank-firing control
system to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which blacklisted Syria as a sponsor of
international terrorism, has reportedly threatened to stop its
118-million-dollar-aids to South Africa if it goes ahead with the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Syria, in response, has said "the U.S. stand towards the arms
deal is a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of both
Syria and South Africa, and a dictation of the U.S. law on world
countries."

CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East Countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Foreign arms manufacturers are invited to join a
4.5-billion-U.S.-dollar project of upgrading the world's fourth
largest tank fleet in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Turkey will produce 800 main battle tanks of
the third generation for its armed forces to meet the next
century's defense needs, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish military sources as saying that these
tanks would have higher maneuver ability, higher firing power as
well as lower weight.
</P>
<P>
Four Turkish companies would be invited to bid for the project,
but any bidding Turkish company is required to find a foreign
partner which has experience in tank production, according to the
planned tender
</P>
<P>
The project is likely to kick off at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Central Bank of Cyprus has imposed lower
interests rates on commercial banks, which is regarded as a step
toward total liberalization of the credit system on the island.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the bank, as from today its
lending rate to commercial banks is 7 percent instead of 7.5
percent and the overnight deposits rate 4 percent instead of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its move was dictated by market condition and the
liquidity situation and due to prospects of the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
It added that this should affect interest rates in general and
at a later stage, the rates in dealings between commercial banks
and the private sector. However, in the long run, repercussion
will be in favor of the public, the Bank believed.
</P>
<P>
The cut of the interest rates is considered to be a step toward
total liberalization of the credit system in Cyprus in view of its
prospective accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for European Union full membership in 1990. The
EU is expected to start accession talks with Cyprus toward end of
this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT-- Lebanon has slashed interest rates by 6 percent to
encourage private sector borrowing, Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted bankers as saying that the move reflects
increased confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Association announced Thursday that it had cut the
prime lending rate, the lowest rate of bank's lending, from 24
percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Kuwait, Lebanon and Egypt will cross-list shares on
each other's exchanges next week, according to the latest issue of
the local economic weekly Middle East News.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Kuwait signed an accord last April to cross-list
shares and Lebanon joined in September.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Lebanon have no restrictions on foreigners trading
shares of national firms. However, Kuwait allows listing of shares
of foreign companies subject to rules set by a market committee.
</P>
<P>
The accord allows Arab residents in Kuwait to invest their
money in Egyptian and Lebanese shares.
</P>
<P>
Dealers were quoted as saying that the new investment channels
are expected to result in a slight decline in trade of Kuwaiti
shares.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Explosions Blamed on Gas Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A gas leakage could have been the
cause of the fire that sparked the explosions of about 100 gas
cylinders this morning at a gas cylinder storehouse west of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
There are reports of slight injuries and suffocations due to
the fire.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency quoted Director of the Civil Defense
and Fire Department Major General Mahmoud Khalil as saying that
some 150 gas cylinders were saved from fire and are now being
examined as a safety precaution.
</P>
<P>
Six fire engines and 50 firefighters rushed to the scene and
have managed to control the fire that broke out at the gas
cylinder depot in the highly-populated al-Moatamadia, Imbaba
district of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Giza Abdel Rehim Shehata who was present at the
scene blamed the fire on gas leakage from one of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
He told MENA that he has ordered immediate check-up of safety
conditions at all gas cylinder storehouses in the governorate.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspaper Raps Japanese Ex-Minister for Defending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The DPRK's Rodong Sinmun
today asked Takami Eto, a member of the Japanese House of
Representatives, to openly apologize for his recent statement
whitewashing Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary published today, Rodong Sinmun said that Eto's
statement showed clearly that some Japanese have not changed their
pro-militarism mentality at all. Eto was ousted from the cabinet
in 1995 after making statements distorting history,
</P>
<P>
Pro-militarism activities went rampant in Japan; Eto and his
like are occupying leading positions in the Japanese power
hierarchy and society, thus wielding strong influence in the
political, economic and military fields, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It warned that those who spared no time to deny Japan's
aggression history aimed to deceive the Japanese people and lead
Japan on the road of aggression.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Eto reportedly said the treaty that effectively put
the Korean Peninsula under Japanese rule was a "country-to-country
treaty" which can hardly be called invasion.
</P>
<P>
He also said he doubted the credibility of the claim of korean
"comfort women," who were forced into sexual slavery by the
Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Eto's comments triggered widespread condemnation on the Korean
Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cairo International Book Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The two-week 29th Cairo
International Book Fair opened today with a rich display of books
which will provide a rich feast to the mind and eye of Egyptians
who are observing their Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
After kicking off the event, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
lingered around the Fair ground in the Nasser City here, where about
2,400 publishers from 79 countries have put up 3.6 million books
in 27 pavilions.
</P>
<P>
As Mubarak browsed through the Chinese pavilion where nearly
2,000 newly-published books from 26 publishers are on display, the
Chinese-language "A biography on Mubarak" caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
Among the wealth of books neatly laid out on shelves, the
Arabic versions of some Chinese literary classics and reference
books, such as the Arabic-Chinese dictionaries, have attracted
large crowds.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the bountiful varieties of intellectual fodder, an
amitious program of seminars held on the sidelines adds more
flavors to the annual fair, which runs throughout the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Arab folk artists will also grace the annual Cairo
International Book Fair, which was originated in the demand for
provision of proper culture at affordable costs for the majority
of low-income Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the book fair will have a glimpse of the
cultural and folk art from seven Arab countries, namely, Oman,
Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Palestine, at a series
of special soirees given by these participants.
</P>
<P>
It could well become a rare meeting place for a stellar cluster
of great Arab poets who will have their solo soirees to recite
their new poems and discuss cultural issues with readers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 100 young talents from remote provinces are
waiting with baited breath for the chance to recite their works at
mass soirees.
</P>
<P>
Artistic elements apart, Cairo originated the book fair 29 year
ago out of a pragmatic need to present local people with the
latest Egyptian and foreign books, encyclopedias, dictionaries and
reference books at moderate prices.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the fair has grown into the second largest and
most important in the world, with many publishing houses competing
to get a pavilion at the two-week cultural event.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee this year's fair a success, the Egyptian General
Book Organization, the organizing authority, has formed a higher
organizing committee to shape the outlines of the cultural program.
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting, the committee said the majority of
seminars and discussions will be centered on future prospects of
Egypt, the Arab world and the international arena on the threshold
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To add a more cultural aroma to the event, 41 short,
documentary and cartoon films will be aired by the National Cinema
Center to give visitors a rare chance to appreciate the
development of the special genre of the Egyptian cinema.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the organization Samir Sarhan said the fair, which
for the first time coincides with Ramadan, will be open from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to midnight. Cultural and poetic
activities will be held during the four-hour evening
session.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Better Commodity Circulation Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
called for government regulations on commodity markets to be
stepped up and improved to enhance prosperity in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels should work hard to diversify the
pattern of modern circulation institutions, and make structural
readjustments, Li said at a national working conference on
commodity circulation which ended in this capital of Fujian
Province today.
</P>
<P>
Commodity circulation has a major role in the national economy
as China shifts its economic structure from a planned economy into
a market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to push forward reform of circulation systems
and improve state management of major commodities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should make efforts to help develop chain
stores, agency sales and second-hand goods markets, the vice
premier said, adding that such businesses should increase their
scales and improve management performance.
</P>
<P>
As current businesses of commodity distribution are generally
small in size and poor in efficiency, reform measures should be
implemented to help them merge into larger operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of making a success in state
purchase of grain by the grain circulation sector, and reiterated
the no-IOUs policy to farmers. The government wants to stamp out
the practice of issuing I-owe-you notes to farmers during
grain-purchasing.

residence in Lima, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government expects a framework for negotiations,
including the composition of the proposed guarantor commission, to
be forged at an early date, and progress to be made toward a
peaceful resolution to the crisis," Kyodo quoted a high-ranking
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official was referring to a much-sought resumption of
direct talks between the Peruvian government and Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holding 73 hostages at the
diplomatic compound.
</P>
<P>
Canada's ambassador to Peru, a former hostage, had agreed to
sit on a guarantor commission overseeing the proposed talks.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports, the Peruvian government said Friday
that it was ready to resume face-to-face talks with the rebels,
but the rebels rejected the government proposal.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after the Peruvian government announced the
statement, the MRTA guerrillas set free one captive, the first in
17 days.
</P>
<P>
The hostage drama began on December 17 when a group of MRTA
guerrillas stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence and took
hostage hundreds of diplomats and dignitaries inside, who were
attending a reception marking Japanese Emperor Akihito's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are demanding the Peruvian government to free
hundreds of their detained comrades in exchange of the release of
the remaining hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
The rebels set free most of the captives in several batches,
but still kept 73 in their hands.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Demonstrate Against Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Israeli
peace activists and Palestinian villagers today launched a
demonstration in the West Bank village of Hirbata, near
Ramallah, against land confiscation by Israeli settlers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched from the village to a plot of land,
one and half kilometers away, which is being threatened by the
encroachments of the Kiryat Sefer settlers. Olive seedlings were
planted there by Israelis and Palestinians together.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc, said
that the struggle for a Hebron deal is hardly concluded and
already the bigger struggle has started, the struggle for the
future of the West Bank, which will decided the real chances for
peace.
</P>
<P>
"The Netanyahu Government had put off signature of the Hebron
Agreement for as long as it could. In the agreement itself it
had put off completion of the further redeployment on the West
Bank for a further 19 months. Clearly, the government tries to
buy time," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "In the past weeks, a struggle for the
land, constituting a virtual mini-war, has broken out all over
the West Bank. Everywhere the settlers, backed by the army, try
to take over any available piece of land, using the most
impossible legal tricks, and the most flimsy excuses. Bulldozers
are deployed, fenses are erected for the 'extension' of existing
settlements, which sometimes amounts to the de-facto creation of
new ones." "Land grabbing affects not only the so-called 'state
lands' (some of which have been in the hands of Palestinian
villagers for generations) but also lands whose private
ownership by Palestinians is unquestioned," it added.
</P>
<P>
"The new agreement gives the government 19 months until
redeployment is completed in most of the West Bank. Clearly,
each and every one of these days will be used for land-grabbing,
with the aim of creating a situation in which a Palestinian
state will be impossible -- which would make peace impossible,
as well," the statement concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, a senior Chinese
leader has called for the nation's economic powerhouse, Shanghai,
to speed up its drive to become an international economic,

<P>
Qiao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the call
during a week-long inspection trip to Shanghai that ended on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Shanghai seizes the opportunities and brings its
own advantages into full play, the city will definitely be built
into such a center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, also chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, said Shanghai has a

the city will be able to achieve great progress in many fields,
including modern industry, science and technology, finance and
foreign trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in order to score a faster economic growth, it
is essential for Shanghai to accelerate the development and
opening-up of the Pudong New Area, which enjoys a number of
preferential policies granted by the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will also be conducive to Shanghai's development
to increase economic and technological cooperation with China's
central and western regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to continue to deepen reform, open the
city wider to the outside world, and solve practical problems, to
make greater contribution to the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>

facilities to improve local residents' cultural lives and develop
popular culture and arts.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Qiao visited the Pudong New Area, the Baoshan
Steel and Iron Company and a number of other places, and held a
meeting on state-owned enterprises with local officials and
managers.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Shanghai's reform of state-owned
enterprises, and expected the reforms to be carried out even
further with boldness.

ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan ruling Taliban
militia moved northward today to the opposition's stronghold of
the Panjshir Valley, said reports from the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
After capturing most of Kapisa Province last week, the Taliban
came close to the town of Gulbahar, 100 kilometers north of Kabul,
near the mouth of the Panjshir Valley.
</P>
<P>
Because of its strategic location, Gulbahar is said to be the
key to entering the Panjshir, stronghold of ex-Defense Minister
Ahmad Shah Masood who fled there when the Taliban took the capital
of Kabul last September.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the Taliban took the strategic Bagram Airbase,
50 kilometers north of Kabul, and the nearby town of Charikar,

<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China Ocean Shipping (Group)
Co. (COSCO) will contribute to maintaining Hong Kong's role as an
international shipping center, Chen Zhongbiao, president of COSCO,
 said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to mark the maiden voyage of a large container
vessel, "Lu He," here today, Chen said that after Hong Kong
returns to its motherland on July 1, 1997, the status of Hong Kong
 in the international shipping industry will be kept and if there
is any change, it will be for the better.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also chairman of the China Shipowners' Association, said
that COSCO will continue to develop its business in Hong Kong so
as to make its contribution to the sustained prosperity and
further development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said no ports in the Chinese mainland can replace Hong Kong
as a shipping cargo transit center in quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
He described "Lu He" as a symbol of COSCO's commitment. The
vessel is the first of six 5,250-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent
units) ships ordered by COSCO from Kawasaki Heavy Industries
Ltd. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The ship was delivered to COSCO on January 8 this year. After
her maiden call to Hong Kong "Lu He" will continue on her maiden
voyage, culminating in calls to ports on the West Coast of the
United States before returning to Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, following "Lu He," COSCO will put five other
 5,250-TEU vessels and seven 3,400-TEU vessels into service, which
 will bring COSCO's container carrying capacity up to 250,000 TEUs
 from its current 184,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that COSCO will accelerate its fleet expansion,
improve management and provide high-quality service to its
customers all over the world.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Maize Production Yields Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's maize crop
would yield about nine million tons this season, the National Maize
Producers Organisation said today.
</P>
<P>
The organisation's General Manager Kit Clus said plantings of white
maize in South Africa were about 12.5 percent down on last year while
plantings of yellow maize were about 1.5 percent up.
</P>
<P>
The overall crop would be about seven percent smaller than last
season's, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reasons behind the smaller area under maize included
uncertainty over prices and the abolition of the price subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Maize crops were generally in good condition in South Africa, but
parts of the country's central areas were dry in the past season.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the biggest maize producer and exporter in the
African continent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Retain Dual Exchange Rate in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will retain its dual exchange
rate in 1997, Head of State General Sani Abacha announced in his
budget speech this morning.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is contrary to widespread speculations that the
country's controversial dual exchange rate will be merged this year at
around 50 Naira to one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said that the official exchange rate will remain
22 Naira to one dollar, and the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market
rate will also remain 80 Naira to one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government's policy has generated a stability of
the Naira in the foreign exchange market and it is necessary to ensure
that the exchange regime is maintained at a sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
His speech implies that the government also wishes that the
policy will serve as a potent weapon to contain inflation, which
according to him, had declined from 72.8 percent in 1995 to 28
percent in 1996, but still eight points above the 20 percent
government target.
</P>
<P>
However, Abacha indicated that the country's two foreign exchange
rates will be ultimately merged.
</P>
<P>
"Government will therefore continue its policy of guided
deregulation, and in repect of the exchange rate regime, government
would maintain the current system with the ultimate aim of a
subsequent merger," he said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Expects Reform to Enhance Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Li Peng has
expressed hope that the establishment of a State Power Corporation
will help promote a better and faster development of the nation's
power industry.
</P>
<P>
Setting up the new corporation, which is part of the reform of
government structures, is aimed at enabling the power
administration system to keep in line with market rules, Li said
at a meeting on reform of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The State Power Corporation, which was officially inaugurated
two days ago, is a state-owned business entitled to manage the
nation-wide power network and inter-regional power
transmission. Its establishment is expected to lead to the
abolition of the current Ministry of Power Industry after a period
of operation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription to
congratulate the new corporation on its inauguration, calling on
the industry to make new contributions to the development of the
national economy and social progress.
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports from Shi Dazhen, general manager of the
corporation, and other industry officials at Friday's meeting, Li
said that by taking the reform measures, China wants to diversify
sources of investment in power generation facilities and
facilitate the industry's development.
</P>
<P>
He urged the corporation to play a leading role in the national
economy and serve the public well.
</P>
<P>
The premier asked all enterprises within the power industry to
enhance technological progress and strengthen management to help
cut costs and increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that in the coming years, more government
departments administrating industrial affairs will gradually
convert to corporations or industrial associations so that
governmental and business functions can be separated in accordance
with market rules.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Wu Bangguo presided over yesterday's meeting. He
delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the corporation two
days earlier, hailing the reform measures of the power industry as
an important structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
Wu asked the Ministry of Power Industry to separate its
functions as a power management business. He called for the State
Power Corporation to achieve normal operations as soon as
possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
laid 2,204 kilometers of optical cables in 1996, forming a
province-wide advanced telecom system based on three loop optical
transmission networks.
</P>
<P>
The three loop networks, which were finished last year, are
located in the north, south and central parts of the province, and
link the province to national-level optical trunks, such as
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin,
Beijing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou, and Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou
Cable lines, said the journal "Communication Weekly."
</P>
<P>
This year, the province will speed up work on a project for a
800-km optical cable section, which will supplement a telecom
artery connecting four provincial capital cities, including
Shijiazhuang, Jinan and Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the construction of 3,000 km of local optical cables
and telephone networks is also under way. When completed, Hebei's
optical telecom density rate will be significantly improved, and
an optical web will cover every corner of the province, the
journal said.

Sani Abacha this morning announced the government's 1997 budget#,

<P>
Contrary to widespread speculations, Abacha announced that
the dual exchange rate will be retained in 1997, with the offcial

32.6 billion Dollars at the end of 1995 to 28.1 billion Dollars
at present, thanks to "effective debt management".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish to speed up the negotiations with the

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Bulgaria's opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces,
has called on the socialist government to make "a declaration on
the salvation of the nation," including the drafting of a new
policy for the central bank, putting the bank under protection,
setting up a government of technicians, and negotiating with the
International Monetary Fund to prevent the country from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac has called on Hungary not to
forget French enterprises when Budapest signs big contracts with
international businesses. He expressed his regret that France has
so far failed to win any big deal in Hungary, although Paris has
become the third largest investor in the country after Germany and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- In Switzerland, the dispute over Jewish properties deposited
in Swiss banks during World War II, and the threat to boycott Swiss
banks by world Jewish organizations have re-awakened the old feeling
of anti-Semitism. The Swiss Federation of Israeli Communities has
been receiving letters expressing hatred of Jews.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- One day after he signed the deal on Hebron with Palestinians,
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu reaffirmed in an interview
with Le Figaro that Israel will never negotiate the status of
Jerusalem with Palestinians. He also said that his government will
not talk with Syria on Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
-- Seven years after the discovery of the virus of hepatitis C,
one percent of the French population, or half a million people
living in France, could have been infected by the epidemic, which
has become a major problem in the public health of France.

</P>
<P>
The agreement conformed to the aspiration for peace and

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President Leaves Cairo for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim
Khaddam left here this morning with his accompanying delegation
following the end of a one-day visit to Egypt during which he met
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no reports of the scheduled resumption
of talks this morning between Khaddam, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian delegation had held talks with Ganzouri on bilateral
relations and Arab affairs Friday evening before meeting President
Hosni Mubarak on the suspended Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks, the Syrian vice-president conveyed
a letter to Mubarak from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, which
dealt with the current situation in the Arab world and the Middle
East peace process, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A day before the Syrian-Egyptian talks, Syrian President Assad
received a telephone call from Mubarak on some Arab issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Details were unknown about their conversation, which came a day
after Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed a deal that
secured a partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank town
of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Syrian official daily Al-Thawra Thursday slammed the
agreement, saying it was the death knell of the Mideast peace
process. "There is nothing new to encourage Syria to resume peace
talks with Israel," it lamented.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the U.S. has ruled out the
possibility of an imminent resumption of talks on the
Israeli-Syrian track. U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas
Burns said no breakthrough was achieved on the Syrian track last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which began in 1991, are frozen
over the future of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East War. Talks broke off in March last year after
four suicide bombings in Israel killed over 60 people.
</P>
<P>
While Syria insisted on the return of the Golan Heights as a
precondition for peace, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
has said Israel will retain the strategic plateau as it is crucial
to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which is the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, plays a leading role in brokering peace in
Arab-Israeli talks.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Shows Marked Trade Surplus over Nine Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's exports reached
nearly 3.1 billion Kuwaiti dinars or 10.23 billion U.S. dollars
in the first nine months of 1996, showing a surplus of about 4.62
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
according to an economic report released Friday by the
Al-shaal weekly, oil exports of the gulf country totaled 2.9
billion dinars to make up 94.5 percent of Kuwait's total exports
of 10.23 billion dollars while imports stood at some 1.7 billion
dinars (5.61 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
If the surplus was computed for a full year it would have
jumped to 1.8 billion dinars (5.94 billion U.S. dollars), the
report added.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the huge surplus to the high oil prices, mainly
during the last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the general average of Kuwaiti crude oil
price was about three dollars per barrel in 1996 compared with
that of 1995. Kuwait exports about 1.5 million barrels of crude
oil a day.
</P>
<P>
The report anticipated a drop of the trade surplus in 1997
due to an expected lower oil price after the end of the cold
season.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices rose to around 16.8 U.S. dollars per barrel in
1995 from 15.5 U.S. dollars in 1994 and again jumped to around
20 U.S. dollars during the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Due to the oil price increase, the report said, Kuwaiti gross
domestic product (GDP) might register a five to six percent
increase in 1996 on the basis of 8.2 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report said "we expected a moderate growth in the GDP of
1996 compared with that of 1995 in current prices."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's budget for 1996-97 fiscal year presented on October
1, 1996 envisaged that the expenditure would be at 4.21 billion
dinars (13.89 billion U.S. dollars) and revenues at 3 billion
dinars (9.9 billion U.S. dollars) with an assumed deficit of
3.96 billion U.S. dollars.

HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Average labor earnings,
covering major sectors in Hong Kong and measured by payroll per
person engaged, gained 8.6 percent in nominal terms in the third
quarter of 1996 over a year earlier, figures from the Hong Kong

</P>

The increase was 3.1 percent in real terms, after discounting
changes in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sectors recorded increases, among which the
wholesale, retail and import/export trades, restaurants and hotels
sector recorded the fastest -- 10.8 percent in nominal terms or
5.2 percent in real terms.

<P>
The overall wage index covering selected major sectors showed a

The index rose by 6.4 percent in nominal terms and by only 1.2
percent in real terms in September 1996 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The relatively faster increase in earnings as compared with
wages was due to more overtime pay and the issue of irregular
payments in some sectors, which were covered in earnings but not
in wages, the department said, adding that this can be seen as an
indication of intensive manpower utilization in the sectors
concerned.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week either firmer
or quiet.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market which was spurred by strong leads on
the palm oil futures market closed the week firmer.
</P>
<P>
January-South surged 17.50 ringgit (about 7 U.S. dollars) this
week to 1,335 ringgit (about 534 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The market was choppy throughout the week, but the bullish end-
December production figures released by the Palm Oil Registration
and Licensing Authority (PORLA) on Wednesday aided the palm oil
cash market.
</P>
<P>
The PORLA reported that December 1996 CPO production dropped 16
percent to 637,865 tons from 762,539 tons.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the metal also settled
the week higher when a surge on other metals on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) spurred strong local buying interest.
</P>
<P>
On the LME, zinc and nickel made a record high on Thursday
overnight as zinc hit a 23-month high and nickel scored strongest
levels for the year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a buying spree for three month tin enabled the
KLTM to recoup last week's losses as bids amounted 415 tons
against offers of 78 tons.
</P>
<P>
While trading of the first three days were choppy, profit
taking on the LME on Friday dampened trading which clipped further
gains as the market settled at 14.59 ringgit (about 5.84 U.S.
dollars) per kg at the close this week against 14.37 ringgit
(about 5.75 U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The week's turnover amounted 582 tons against 456 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
But the Malaysian rubber market was very quiet this week on
lack of interest as buyers were sidelined.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said buyers were expected to return only after the long
double festival holidays in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Reports of excess stocks in China and Japan contributed to the
weaker trading this week as buyers would not seek local rubber.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of the ringgit also contributed to the
sluggish trading this week with local rubber becoming relatively
more expensive than those in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
However, players were still bullish about the market as they
expect the long holidays to lift the price up.
</P>
<P>
February RSS One stopped at 304.00 sen (about 121.6 U.S. cents)
per kg, down 2.50 sen (about 1 U.S. cent) from 306.50 sen (about
122.6 U.S. cents) last week and SMR 20 at 299.50 sen (about 119.8
U.S. cents), down 4.50 sen (about 1.8 U.S. cents) from 304.00 sen
(about 121.6 U.S. cents) previously.

years due to the appreciation of the yen, are staging a comeback
with 1997 sales expected to pick up.

<P>
The improvement is attributed to competitive pricing and
introduction of new models to cater for medium and small
markets. Prices of Japanese cars which were reported to have gone
down in 1996 will see a further cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese lost to the U.S. and Korean manufacturers whose

leave the country's economy under control of foreign powers,
according to local newspaper Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
"This situation can not continue forever. If one thirds of
the budget is going to finance interest payments alone, Turkey
can not achieve economical or political stability," Tekir said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Turkey's domestic debts stood 78 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of last year, and the country had to use
15 billion U.S. dollars to cover interest payments.

exports in a bid to restore people's confidence in the
country's economy.

Holding, the second largest business company of Turkey, and
Belgian Cimenteries CBRSA.

the group's total 10.82-million-ton cement capacity and sell all
of the output."
</P>
<P>
The Sabanci division operates six cement plants in Turkey,
with an annual production of 6 million tons. The Sabanci
Holding has several other cement divisions.
</P>
<P>
Celenk said that Akcansa was considering to build new
plants or to expand its productive capacity on the current
basis.

<HEADLINE> Investigations to Be Conducted into Alleged Improper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Telecom
Corporation and the Contracts Division of the Finance Ministry
have been instructed to expedite the investigation into alleged
improprieties in the former's deal with a foreign firm.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into an allegation of improprieties in a
tender awarded by Malaysia Telecom Corporation to Swedish
multinational Ericsson Telecommunications has been classified as
an "urgent matter," Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Telecom and the Contracts Division have been
instructed to expedite the investigation and to submit a report as
soon as possible, Anwar, who is also finance minister, told
reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked for it to be speeded up. It is not necessary to
take too much time because all the records are still there. I have
classified it as an urgent matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government on Wednesday instructed that an investigation be
conducted into the alleged improprieties in the award of a
contract by Malaysia Telecom to Ericsson for the supply of
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is now in California on a
visit to the United States, also said yesterday the matter should
be investigated.
</P>
<P>
On whether the preliminary report he received contains
allegations against any cabinet minister or senior officials of
Malaysia Telecom, Anwar said "there were references but there
were no specific allegations. I've not seen the detailed report."
</P>
<P>
However, he said "we should be transparent. If there is any
report, we should take it up. I don't think we should be unduly
concerned but we should be positive and we should take it up
seriously."
</P>
<P>
According to procedures, all tender awards have to be approved
by the Tender Board before final approval was given by the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore the investigation will cover the question of whether
the procedures were observed, whether there were discrepancies at
any level, be it the Telecom level or Treasury level, whether
there was actually a reference to the Treasury at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all speculations should cease as an investigation
was being conducted.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sign Information Technology Deal Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will soon sign
the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a multilateral pact to
liberalize a wide range of information technology products,
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama reported today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would be ready to "sign on the dotted line" in July,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is now in
California, was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is ending his week-long working visit to the United
States today, a trip aimed at promoting his country's proposed
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) which has received positive
responses from the world's renowned high technology companies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia didn't sign the agreement in Singapore
last month when it was negotiated during the inaugural ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization because it wanted to
review the provisions of the agreement to see if it would have a
harmful effect on Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Malaysian reporters at Santa Clara, California, he
said Malaysia will not impose any duty on the import of multimedia
equipment under the Multimedia Bill of Guarantees to companies
receiving MSC status from the Multimedia Development Corporation
(MDC).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government also planned to review, and if
necessary "amend or formulate new laws" to provide venture capital
for small and medium-sized companies, especially start-up
companies involving multimedia.
</P>
<P>
He called on Silicon Valley companies to invest in the MSC and
"to be our partners in exploring these exciting new frontiers."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was scheduled to head for Tokyo today to continue his
mission of promoting the MSC to Japanese IT companies.

their own affairs and must not be dictated upon by foreigners who
do not understand them.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty of Africans to strive and become
self-sustaining instead of waiting for assistance from other
countries which has strings attached nearly always, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that sustainable economic growth and
development for east Africa can best be achieved through
co-operation and integration.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for east African countries to harmonize
their transport and communications network and co-ordination,
President Moi stated, adding that a mechanism is required for
proper co-ordination of an efficient inter-country road network.
</P>
<P>
On the 112-kilometer road funded by the European Union at a
cost of 70 million U.S. Dollars, the president said that the road
network will be a big boost to the east African regional
co-operation in particular and the Great Lakes region in general.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said
that a political federation can stimulate trade in the region and
thereby increase economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Both President Moi and President Mkapa stressed on the need
for easing of customs and immigration rules to enable local
people transact their businesses with minimal hindrance.

<HEADLINE> Indian Securities Board to Tighten Surveillance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) has taken measures to tighten surveillance
mechanism over stock exchanges all over the country in a bid to
stabilize trading prices at stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The streamlined surveillance will relate to the imposition of
price ranges, making it mandatory for the stock exchanges to
implement price ranges uniformly based on the previous day's
closing price of the stock. At the moment, price ranges on some
exchanges were based on the opening price of stocks on the same
trading day.
</P>
<P>
The new surveillance measures followed a decision taken by the
securities market watchdog at the end of a meeting Thursday with
representatives of all the major stock exchanges. The meeting was
convened to review the volatility on the bourses following the
stock market indices' roller-coaster ride over the last three
days.
</P>
<P>
SEBI has decided to probe the wild price volatility on the stock
exchanges. Data and information regarding price movements and
broker-related positions will be collected by the stock exchanges
and provided to the market regulator shortly.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs to Improve Project Implementation: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs to address some
generic problems to improve its poor performance in project
implementation and an effective monitoring system should be
ensured, the World Bank said in a report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the World Bank had discussed with the
Bangladeshi government some crucial generic issues during the
preparation of its 1996 country portfolio performance review.
</P>
<P>
But the Bangladeshi government, which receives an average
foreign aid of two billion U.S. dollars per year, has not taken
any resolute action to address these issues which continue to
affect project outcome, it said.
</P>
<P>
The issues include inadequate administrative authorities or
project directors and frequent staff rotation, delays in
procurement processing, lack of compliance with financial
reporting and audit requirements and delays in technical
assistance projects.
</P>
<P>
At the political level, the bank said, there has been often too
little involvement at the conceptual stage and consequently
ministers have rarely been the true champions of project conceived
and implemented.
</P>
<P>
The government should ensure a high degree of commitment by
taking a more active part at the project conceptualization and
design stage, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President for Reduction of Dependence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
has urged his country to reduce dependence on donor charity in
its development, a source reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
"If our development is to have a solid and lasting foundation
it is essential and expedient that we reduce dependence on
donor charity," stated Chiluba when he officially opened the
First Session of the Eighth National Assembly here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the finance minister will present this
year's budget and the major thrust of the budget will be "living
within our means by reducing very drastically the budget's
dependence on external subventions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is important for the country to cede the
dependence syndrome for outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba did not reject foreign aid. He said
that Zambia will for a long time to come continue to suffer
serious resource gaps and it will always welcome external
assistance when it is available to supplement the inadequate
internal accumulations.
</P>
<P>
But donor aid must be seen in the correct context of
engendering international cooperation towards global development.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia fully supports the United Nations system-wide special
initiative for Africa intended to mobilize international support
for development for the continent," the Zambian president said.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Leader: PUK Desires Federal Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Iraq's Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK) Jalal Talabani has said that his party desired
a federal settlement with a "democratic" Iraq, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Turkish Daily News published
here today, Talabani said that he did not make contacts with the
Iraqi government, although there had been indirect calls for a
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government kept wooing the PUK and sent a message
through Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov for the start
of a dialogue with the PUK last year.
</P>
<P>
On the future of ties with Baghdad, Talabani said: "If
there is a democratic government, we will have a close federal
relation; if not, ours will be a looser bond within a
unified Iraq... Our laws will be in conformity with Iraqi
constitution."
</P>
<P>
The PUK leader said that he did not expect full democracy
from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but Iraq's form of
democracy "should be at least as that of Jordan or Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
The Iran-backed PUK fought with the Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP), supported by the Iraqi government, in late August last
year, which led to U.S. air strikes against Iraqi military
targets.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and KDP then signed a peace deal on October 31,
1996, under mediation of the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rebels since
the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones after
the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Agricultural Union Warns of Anarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- With a high incidence of
crime and more and more people getting the law into their own
hands, South Africa is on the brink of crime anarchy, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
President of the South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) Chris
Du Toit said on Friday that "the country cannot afford another
six months on the road to crime anarchy and all sectors must now
work together to reverse the situation", according to
the Johannesburg-based daily The Citizen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Du Toit said the high crime
rate was causing despair in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The point has now been reached where people are revolting and
taking the law into their own hands, something one cannot blame
them for," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Du Toit said the crime problem has many facets,
adding policing is poor in many areas despite a greater will on
the part of the government to fight lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the time has come for the entire South
African community to unite visibly in persuading the government
to act mercilessly to create effective deterrents to restore
law and order in the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls on Arab Countries to Help Sudan Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has called on Arab
countries to help Sudan in its fighting against secessionist
rebels, saying the Khartoum government was facing a plot against
its territorial unity, local newspaper Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"What brotherly Sudan is being exposed to is a conspiracy
aimed at the unity of its people and territory and this is a
matter that necessitates from Arab countries a united stance,"
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti was quoted as saying
in a statement, which was also carried by Jordan's national news
agency Petra.
</P>
<P>
Such support, Kabariti said, is "imperative to prevent the
exploitation of Sudan's circumstances and to confront the enemies
of the Arab Nation to foil the possibility of harming Sudan's
unity."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a joint rebel force captured the town of Maban on
the southern front of the Blue Nile region as the Sudanese
government sent reinforcements to contain the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
At present, the rebels are advancing towards Damazin, a
strategic town, which supplies the country's capital with 80
percent of its power, a rebels spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Rules Out Regional Military Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has ruled out a full-blown military confrontation in
the Middle East, saying such an adventure was "two costly
for all sides including Israel," local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's Daily Star, the only English daily published in the
Lebanese capital, said that Hariri's remarks came at an Iftar, the
breakfast in the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, at his
residence in West Beirut, which was attended by more than 700
guests.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the chances of war in the region, Hariri
said: "There is no war in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Two days ago (Egyptian) President Hosni Mubarak said the same
thing for war is very costly to all sides," he said, adding that
military means had been tried before but failed to work.
</P>
<P>
"In 1978 and again in 1982, the military solutions were
tried and did not work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only results were destruction and damage, killing and
bad reputation for the aggressors," Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the Israeli army is capable of hitting
civilians and killing innocent people, damaging houses and
undermining this country's infrastructure, but the aggression did
not lead to a change in the political decision-making process
in Lebanon," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has been plagued in recent weeks with
wide-spread rumors about an imminent war by Israel against
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Hariri warned Israel against waging a war with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"When we refer to a regional military conflict, we are
talking about a war between Syria and Israel," Hariri said,
"a war with Syria means destruction to both Syria and Israel
and everyone will pay the price."
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is for peace and all the previous circumstances
and facts that favored war rather than peace are now behind us,"
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Israeli threats would not force a change
in Lebanon's policy toward the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Indian Industrial Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A sharp fall in the growth of
infrastructure industries has led to a slowdown in industrial
growth during the first eight months of the current financial year
starting April 1, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four industries recorded a mere five percent growth as
against 11 percent in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative growth in the infrastructure sector, accounting for
about 29 percent in the index of industrial production (IIP), fell
to 3.3 percent during April-November from 9.3 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Seven industries including crude petroleum, fertilizer, cloth
and jute recorded a negative growth as against just two industries
-- pig iron and copper cathodes.
</P>
<P>
The 18 major industries (excluding the infrastructure sector)
accounting for 21.6 percent in IIP, registered a 7.9 percent
growth against 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The crude petroleum industry was the worst hit with a 10
percent decline in production as compared with 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The crucial electricity sector grew by 3.2 percent compared
with 9.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The best performance was recorded in sugar, cars, motor cycles
and three-wheelers growing 37.6 percent, 21 percent, 23.3 percent
and 33.9 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Two-Line Hybrid Rice to Raise Farm Output in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A new strain of two-line
hybrid rice, with a high potential for increased output, will give
grain production in China a major boost, said an expert from
central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
Created by China's "Father of Hybrid Rice", the new strain,
compared with usual three-line varieties, can generate a higher
yield and can make use of manpower and material resources more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Hunan province planted 50,000 hectares of the new strain last
year and fulfilled a per hectare yield of more than 7,500
kilograms, up to 15 percent higher than three-line strains.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has taken the lead in the country in rice production for
several years. Annual rice output in the province is 26 billion
kilograms, and is expected to reach 30 billion kg in the year of
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, the spread of the two-line hybrid rice
strain will play a positive role in helping the province fulfill
the target.
</P>
<P>
"Research on new strains of Chinese sorghum and oil-bearing
crops has also made breakthroughs through hybridization," said
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
A new strain of sorghum will raise its output to 7,500 kg for
each hectare.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Rebels Free A Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian rebels occupying the
Japanese ambassador's residence released an ailing security chief
today at around 2 p.m. local time (1900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Luis Valencia Hirano, head of the Delta special forces unit of
Peru's anti-terrorist police DINCOTE, was the first hostage freed
since the New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
The exhausted-looking Valencia was sent to a police hospital
accompanied by two Red Cross officials. The organization played a
go-between role linking together the Peruvian government and the
rebel Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
</P>
<P>
The release was followed by a statement from the Peruvian
government, saying it is ready to resume talks with the rebels but
refusing to free the rebels' imprisoned comrades.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen from MRTA broke into the diplomatic compound in the
evening of December 17 and held hostage more than 500 people, who
were attending a reception to mark Japanese Emperor Akihito's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
MRTA demanded the Peruvian government release its about 400
guerrilla comrades in jails, but was refused.
</P>
<P>
Domingo Palermo, the official negotiator, reiterated the
refusal today when he made the statement.
</P>
<P>
"As is publicly known, the Peruvian state is not going to
release the MRTA prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
MRTA international spokesman Isaac Velasco said the rebels
would never surrender without reaching their goals.
</P>
<P>
"We have said it a million times, we will say it again. We will
never give in," Velasco said at a press conference in the Danish
capital of Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Palermo told a news conference he would meet leader of MRTA
Nestor Cerpa Cartolini in a building near the sieged compound. He
added that Cerpa would be transported to the site in a Red Cross
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
But so far rebels have not confirmed whether they would attend
the meeting. Previously they broke off a planned encounter with
Palermo because the government refused to discuss the release of
their comrades.
</P>
<P>
Rebels have freed most of the hostages and are still holding 73
persons in custody, including Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's younger brother and Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela.
</P>
<P>
Other hostages include Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki,
Japanese businessmen and Peruvian top officials.
</P>
<P>
A recent major poll shows that 93.2 percent of the subjects
believe the siege should be resolved through a peaceful way, and
88.2 percent say no rebels should be released from prison.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- American adventurer Steve
Fossett obtained a last-minute permission to overfly Libya's air
space late Friday, continuing his bid to become the first man for
the non-stop round-the-world balloon flight.
</P>
<P>
Early, Fossett had to make a detour as Libya denied his request
to fly over its territory, and the delay may add one day to his
trip, said spokesman Alan Blount.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time when Fossett in his "Solo Spirit" has
encountered the issue of the kind.
</P>
<P>
Fossett was forced to change his itinery on Tuesday when he was
traveling toward Scandinavia to avoid flying over Russia that
denied his flight in its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Two other teams of balloonists had failed in recent attempts to
fly around the world starting from Morocco and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Former President Asks for Trial of Corrupt BNP Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The just-released former
Bangladeshi President Hussain Mohammad Ershad has asked Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to put on trial the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) regime for corruption.
</P>
<P>
"You (Hasina) will be identified as a promise-breaker if you
don't hold the trial," Ershad told a huge public meeting held
Friday in his hometown of Rangpur.
</P>
<P>
Hasina will be unable to continue her politics if she does not
keep her election pledge, said Ershad, who is also chairman of the
 Jatiya Party (JP).
</P>
<P>
Only with JP support, Hasina's Awami League (AL) won enough
seats to form the new government after the June 12 general
elections last year, turning the former ruling BNP into the
biggest opposition party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe in the ideology of the AL," Ershad said. "We
supported it unconditionally to topple the BNP from power as the
AL emerged as the largest party against the BNP after polls."
</P>
<P>
The former president, who was deposed on December 6, 1990, and
sent to jail on charges of corruption, was released on bail on
January 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the BNP allegation of obtaining the bail through an
entente with the AL, Ershad claimed that while he was in jail
after last year's general elections, the BNP wanted to make a deal
by withdrawing all cases against him and offering him the position
of prime minister. But he rejected the offer, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Even if I have to die, I'll never support the BNP, because
they oppressed me so much in jail," Ershad said amid thunderous
applause from his supporters who chanted "go ahead Ershad, we are
with you."

<HEADLINE> Stone Carving Booming in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A county in east China's Fujian
Province has become the biggest base for carved stone exports,
whose value surpassed two billion yuan (240 million US dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
The history of stone-carving in Hui'an County, the hometown of
many overseas Chinese, goes back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907),
and a well-known carving at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing,
a famous tourist attraction, is the work of the county's
stonemasons.
</P>
<P>
Hui'an has over 2,000 factories whose business is stone
carving, with an annual output value of more than 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 types of stone products have been exported to 30
countries and regions, including Japan and the US, said an
official with the local government.
</P>
<P>
The county places great importance on improving production
equipment, and has put more than 100 million yuan into this sector
in the past few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has also built a 35-km road with more than 1,000 stone
carvings and processing factories along it.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
seized on Friday another province and shot down a rival jet,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces overran the province of Kapisa, northeast of
the Afghan capital of Kabul, driving out the troops loyal to the
ousted Afghan government, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the militia also claimed to have shot down a rival
jet fighter plane in Charikar, north of Kabul and capital of
Parwan Province controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The jet belonging to the forces of northern Uzbek warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostum was raiding Taliban positions in Charikar, a Taliban
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kapisa was seized a day after the Islamic militia recaptured
the strategic Bagram Airbase, about 50 kilometers north of Kabul,
and the key provincial capital of Charikar.
</P>
<P>
The militia, which seized Kabul on September 27 last year,
controls two-thirds of Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
It faces combined military resistance from the ex-government
forces led by the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani's chief
military commander Ahmad Shah Masood and the troops of Dostum.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Votes to Reprimand Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- After two years of probe,
the U.S. House ethics committee voted tonight to reprimand Speaker
Newt Gingrich for admitted violations of House rules and called
for a financial penalty of 300,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, ratified on a bipartisan vote of 7-1, would
permit Gingrich to retain his powerful post. A formal House vote
is scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Gingrich said in advance he would submit to the
reprimand and the penalty.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough penalty. I believe it is an appropriate
penalty," Nancy Johnson, the committee chairwoman, said as the
vote was announced. "It demonstrates that nobody is above the
rules."
</P>
<P>
On December 21, Gingrich admitted that he had violated House
rules, saying that he had failed to seek proper legal advice on
using tax-exempt projects to meet political goals, and he
acknowledged that "in my name and over my signature" inaccurate
statements had been submitted to the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the full House, the punishment would be the
sternest on a speaker since the ethics process was established
three decades ago.

<HEADLINE> Former Official Reveals India's Ties With CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Foreign
Secretary J. N. Dixit has revealed that the Ministry of External
Affairs has had formal links with the American Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) at least over the last 10 years, the
local newspaper The Pioneer reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The revelation adds a new dimension to the sensational Rattan
Sehgal "spy" case in which the senior Intelligence Bureau (IB)
officer was forced to retire for "unauthorized" meetings with two
"undercover" CIA agents recently.
</P>
<P>
Dixit said here on Friday that he himself formalized the
arrangement between the ministry and the U.S. government during
his tenure as foreign secretary. "This is not something that has
been announced publicly but we have been liaising with the CIA
ever since the Kashmir issue blew up."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Sehgal case and his "unauthorized" meetings
with two CIA agents, Dixit said the meetings were not a
clandestine operation as both U.S. officials were declared to the
government of India as liaison officers between the U.S.
intelligence agency and their Indian counterparts, the IB and its
research and analysis wing.
</P>
<P>
Sehgal, as chief of the IB counter-intelligence unit and
principal liaison officer, was in touch with the two CIA officials
in keeping with his routine work, he said. He called the meetings
an open liaison which he said has been converted into an espionage
drama.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists on Ratification of START-2 Before New Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
maintain its stance that the START-2 strategic arms treaty should
be ratified by the Russians before negotiations on further nuclear
cuts,
</P>
<P>
The point was made today by outgoing U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that START-2 should be ratified and
implemented," said Christopher in a farewell interview with
international news agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly our long-term goal is for additional arms control
agreements, but I don't think you can leapfrog over START-2, and
we've let the Russians know that we want to encourage them to find
a basis to go forward with START-2."
</P>
<P>
Under the START-2, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, signed
in 1993 between the United States and Russia, the two countries
were to reduce their long-range nuclear arsenals by some two
thirds, to about 3,500 warheads apiece by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Russia now has about 7,600 nuclear warheads and the United
States has a little more than 9,100, according to the New
York-based Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma (parliament) has so far resisted strong
pressure to ratify the treaty for reasons ranging from the cost of
implementing the treaty to concerns over U.S. missile defense
plans.
</P>
<P>
A recent U.S. Defense News report from Moscow said that until
Russian President Boris Yeltsin submits a detailed plan to the
Duma of all expenditures relating to the treaty, Russian
legislators will not begin consideration of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Russian opponents of START-2 argued that it was unfair because
Russia's nuclear deterrent was more reliant on land-based,
multiple-warhead missiles than that of the United States, which
was largely based on submarines and bomber aircraft, the Defense
News said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the legislators directly link Russia's
reduction of nuclear arsenal with the NATO's plan to expand into
Eastern Europe, which Russians regard as posing threat to its
national security.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Committee Chairman Lev Rokhlin suggested that
Russia should scrap START-2 altogether and begin negotiations on a
START-3 treaty to cut the bilateral arsenals further and more
equitably.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said;
"We don't want to begin negotiations on START-3 until the Russian
 Duma has ratified START-2," when asked if there was any plan to
advance START-3 negotiations at all.
</P>
<P>
However, arms control experts were quoted by media reports
saying they understood that in order to spur the Duma to ratify
START-2, the administration was seriously considering making a
commitment that START-3 negotiations would begin immediately
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Russian
counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, are set to meet in March, when they
would discuss the issue and hopefully get a deal.

YANGON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Myanmar Megasteel

According to the report, a land-lease contract for the factory
between the Human Settlement and Housing Development Department of
the Myanmar government and the Singapore company was signed here

</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the Singapore company will lease a
2.4-hectare plot in the zone for an initial 30-year period, with
two extra five-year extension periods.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Train Crash Inquiry to Take Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The official inquiry into last
weekend's fatal rail crash which killed eight people may not be
completed until June, Public prosecutor Alberto Grassi said today.
</P>
<P>
Grassi, who is heading the judicial inquiry into the
crash of the highspeed, tilting Pendolino train at Piacenza, said
he would appoint a commission of inquiry next week.
</P>
<P>
Its members would be "high level and absolutely impartial", he
said. But he intended to keep their names secret to protect them
from outside pressures.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not give the State Railways access to
material seized by police on his orders after the accident. It
included the train's trip recorder, the equivalent of a plane's
flight recorder.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the cause of the crash has centered on the
possibility that the train entered a tight curve, just north of
Piacenza station, too fast.
</P>
<P>
Railway engineering professor Franco di Maio said today that
the radius of the curve was only 337 meters, compared to a minimum
of 2,500 meters of the high speed track between Rome and Florence.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the stretch of track just before the fatal bend
the train would have been traveling at about 190 kph.
</P>
<P>
The maximum allowed on the bend was 105 kph, and di Maio said
he calculated the train would leave the tracks above 155
kph. Media reports have suggested that the train's drivers, who
died in the crash, failed to slow down because they were eating
lunch at the time, but this hypothesis was dismissed as absurd by
the driver's union (COMU).
</P>
<P>
The COMU said it was calling a go-slow from next Monday to back
demands for talks with the railway management on a range of safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
These included maintenance of lines and rolling stock, the
conditions of signaling and safety installations, the abuse of
overtime, level crossings and the suitability of trains such as
the tilting Pendolino.

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Export-Import Bank today announced it had approved a financing

sales for two gas field development projects.
</P>
<P>
The export of U.S. equipment and services for the Ras Laffan

will sustain thousands of American jobs. The projects will tap the
world's largest gas field, the North Field located offshore Qatar.
</P>

The Bank will offer 464 million dollars to finance U.S. exports
to Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd, to build, own and
operate offshore and onshore facilities at the North Field.
</P>
<P>
The deal also includes up to 62 million dollars in financing
the sale of U.S. equipment and services for the upstream part of
the Qatargas Liquefied Natural Gas Project.
</P>
<P>
The financers of the two projects will be repaid from projects'
revenues, rather than relying on a guarantee of the debt by the
host country government.
</P>
<P>
The Bank is a government agency that provides guarantees for,

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has signed a contract
with Canada to buy a remote sensing small satellite worth 116
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed Friday in front of Thai Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and his Canadian counterpart Jean Chretien,
who is on a five-day visit to Thailand with a 450-member mission,
including over 350 business people.
</P>
<P>
The deal was inked after the Canadian side had agreed to delay
the payment and buy more Thai products in counter trade, as
Thailand is facing a current account deficit and is cutting back
public spending.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the payment will start from October of
1998, which is the first month of Thailand's fiscal 1999, instead
of January of 1998, and the counter-trade ratio in the deal will
be increased from the original 20 percent to a new 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Thai and Canadian businesses signed 55 contracts worth
just over 800 million dollars on Friday, the second day of
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's five-day visit to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In terms of value, about 60 percent of the deals were
commercial contracts and the rest memorandums of understanding.
</P>
<P>
The deals covered a wide range of fields, including power,
petroleum, construction, electronic products distribution,
environment, steel, microwave technology, plastic coating and
fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
Ten other agreements were also signed on Friday between the two
governments and public sectors of the two countries involving
investment protection, cooperation in education, academics and the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Official Accused of Violating Adoption Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Nepal's
Home Ministry is facing corruption charges after he permitted a
foreign couple to adopt two children in Nepal, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority
(CIAA), the country's corruption control body, has decided to file
a lawsuit soon against Home Secretary Padmaraj Pokhrel on charges
of violating the adoption law, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The CIAA is collecting necessary documents and will file the
case at the Appellate Court, probably within a week.
</P>
<P>
According to CIAA sources, Pokhrel earlier permitted a Spanish
couple to adopt two children from an orphanage in eastern Nepal
although the adoption law prohibits one foreigner from adopting
more than one child in the country.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Pokhrel had permitted the double adoption in
spite of the suggestion by the Ministry of Law that it would be
illegal.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Zinc Industry Faces Production Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's zinc industry is
facing a decline in production capacity because of a mineral
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Padaeng Industry Plc, the only zinc producer in Thailand as
well as in the entire ASEAN region, faced pressure in terms of raw
material supply and higher power costs than those of rivals in
other countries, according to President of the company Teerachai
Riensubdee.
</P>
<P>
Padaeng, which used to be able to produce sufficient raw
materials to support its production, has now been forced to import
more raw materials, which has led to a considerably higher cost.
</P>
<P>
Teerachai said his company needed to step up efforts to lower
production costs and improve efficiency in order to gain a
competitive edge over rivals from Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total zinc consumption last year was 123,000 metric
tons, of which Padaeng had a market share of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that this year the demand will increase by 5.7
percent to 130,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Teerachai predicted that zinc prices in the world market this
year would likely pick up from current levels of 1,100-1,200 US
dollars a ton, because the global zinc stockpile has been
declining steadily.
</P>
<P>
The world zinc stockpile now totals about 480,000 tons, down
from a peak of 1.2 million tons in 1994, according to Teerachai.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Cases Soar in Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Minister of Public
Health Vasili Nikolaevich Devyatko warns that tuberculosis cases
have increased greatly in recent years, and now number 60,000.
</P>
<P>
He called today for immediate measures to battle the disease,
the Kazakh Telegraph Agency (KazTAG) reported.
</P>
<P>
Devyatko told a news briefing that the present death toll from
tuberculosis had doubled compared with several years ago. He
called on medical agencies to make efforts to eliminate the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said urgent measures must be taken to get rid of diseases of
the respiratory tract, especially influenza, in order to prevent
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh Tuberculosis Research Institute attributed the
increase in tuberculosis to economic stringencies. Funds allotted
to prevent the disease had decreased and patients had not received
timely treatment.
</P>
<P>
Devyatko said a special law to battle tuberculosis was being
drafted and a loan of 400,000 U.S. dollars would be used to buy
medical equipment to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
Japan, South Korea and other countries have also offered help
to Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> First Unit of Nuclear Station Returns to Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The first unit of Bulgaria's
six-unit Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station resumed operation today
after being appraised and checked out by western companies.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the unit, with a capacity of 440,000 KW, was
endorsed today by the country's Committee of Peaceful Utilization
of Atomic Energy and is expected to feed into the national grid in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Kozloduy is Bulgaria's only nuclear power station, and is
located on the Danube riverside. It was forced to stop operation
because of doubts about its safety by western countries.
</P>
<P>
In December, it was concluded it would be able to work until
the year 2004, its designated expiry, by a watchdog group from the
Council of Europe, Germany's Siemens company, a U.S. company and
its Russian designer. The group examined samples of the unit's
outer metal cover.
</P>
<P>
Using generating units produced by the Leningrad electrical
machinery plant, the Kozloduy Power Station, the biggest in the
Balkan Peninsula, was set up in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The first two reactors went into operation in 1975. The next
three were established in the 1980s and the last one started to
work in September 1991.
</P>
<P>
Its generated energy accounted for 45 percent of the total
amount generated in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The first reactor had more than 160 improvements incorporated,
and the study of its outer metal cover indicated it could work
until the year 2006, Bulgarian experts said.

<P>
KIEV, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has
repeated Russia's claim of authority over the controversial city
of Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Mayor, regarded as persona non grata in Ukraine,
made the remarks today when he arrived in Sevastopol to distribute
172 apartments to officers of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
"No document has ever confirmed that Sevastopol belongs to
Ukraine," Luzhkov said as he gave room keys to the officers.
</P>
<P>
Sevastopol was claimed by both Ukraine and Russia after the
collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. The dispute over the
division of the Black Sea Fleet and the status of Sevastopol have
hurt relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov claimed Sevastopol was Russian territory in December
1996 when Russian and Ukrainian legislators fought a battle of
words over the city. He announced he would visit the city in
January 1997, and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Genady Udovenko,
wrote to persuade him not to come.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov predicted Russia would win when the dispute was handed
over to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.

MONTEVIDEO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Uruguay,
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile expressed grave concern today over
risks associated with the transit of ships taking radioactive
wastes through the southern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The four countries in a joint statement made known their
concern about the pending arrival of a 40-ton plutonium cargo from
France bound for Japan.
</P>
<P>
The four said because of the danger implied by this
transportation means, they would adopt measures recognized by
international law to protect the health of their inhabitants, and
their marine ecological systems.
</P>
<P>
They said it was necessary to reinforce international
organizations with jurisdiction on the subject, the regulation of
transporting radioactive wastes and waste radioactive fuels.
</P>
<P>
They considered these regulations should also contemplate
guarantees not to pollute the marine environment, and on the
exchange of information about chosen routes.
</P>
<P>
Countries which transported radioactive wastes had the
obligation of communicating to the sea coast states emergency
plans for cases of disaster, a commitment to recover the
radioactive wastes and the payment of indemnities in cases of
injury or material damage.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Calls for European Neutrality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky today stressed the importance of neutrality, and the key
role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) in
building European security.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the parliament assembly of the OSCE,
Vranitzky said the security policy of Europe should not focus on
the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
It should take into consideration all other organizations
concerned such as the United Nations (U.N.), the OSCE, the
European Council (EC), the European Union (EU) and the Western
European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said the basic principles of neutrality should be
used in building Europe's security system. They included
non-participation in other countries' wars and not resorting to
violence for national interests.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the security of Europe must be connected
with Russia. There would be no real security if Russia was
excluded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky called for a strengthening of the OSCE's role,
pointing out that the organization was wide-ranging both in
geography and politics.

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
has repeated its wariness about the United States proposal to
accelerate the creation of the Americas Free Trade Area (ALCA).
</P>

Brazil did not accept that a reduction of custom tariffs in the

undersecretary for Economic Affairs, Integration, and Foreign
Trade, was quoted by the local press as saying today.

Brazil couldn't bear another round of tariff reductions that
would worsen the trade deficit, which stood at 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars last year, Gonzalves said.
</P>

The creation of the ALCA, a hemispheric free trade zone without
customs tariffs to be in force at the beginning of the year 2005,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Erupts, 8,000 Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 people were
evacuated Friday as Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano,
erupted, gushing molten lava and spewing heat clouds of ash over
vast areas.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on casualties but unconfirmed reports said
six people were missing as the alert was raised to the highest
level.
</P>
<P>
Officials monitoring the 2,968 meter-high volcano said two
minor eruptions occurred in the morning and two larger ones
followed in the afternoon, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The molten lava streaming down the mount's slope was clearly
visible from the ancient city of Yogyakarta last night as the
weather was fine, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Officials observing the natural phenomena said burning volcanic
ash shot 4,000 meters into the sky, falling across areas as far as
six kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which observers say was larger than the one in
1994, affected the nearby regions of Sleman, Klaten, Boyolali and
Magelang as well as Yogyakarta.
</P>
<P>
Residents said the first big bang was heard at about 10:35 a.m.
when thick smoke was belching from the mountain dome. The eruption
could be heard from Yogyakarta, about 35 kilometers south of
Merapi.
</P>
<P>
The second eruption was not quite as forceful. Louder
explosions were heard at 1:45 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The latest report last night said that of the six people
reported missing, five were workers from a drinking water project
on the Kaliboyong river and the other was a farmer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flights to and from Yogyakarta were not affected by
the eruption, said Garuda Indonesian Airways spokesman Arif
Hardanto.
</P>
<P>
The last eruption of Merapi was on November 22, 1994, killing
more than 60 people, injuring dozens and destroying properties.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one of 127 volcanoes in the country and has also been
classified as the most active one in the world.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Deposits Soar in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The foreign currency deposit
units (FCDU) accounts with the Philippines' commercial banks
reached a record 14.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1996, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This record represents a 53 percent jump from the year-ago
level of 9.4 billion dollars, the Philippine Journal quoted
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as saying on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Though not officially counted as part of the Philippine
international reserves, the FCDU deposits represent a second layer
of foreign reserves for the country. Most of the FCDU accounts are
held by exporters, local companies with dollar earnings, and
families of overseas Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The growing foreign currency deposits can be attributed to
increased exports, foreign investments and remittances from
Filipino workers overseas.
</P>
<P>
The FCDU accounts, mostly in U.S. dollar deposits, are held by
the 48 commercial banks operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the record FCDU deposits, the Philippines also
registered a record gross international reserves of 11.8 billion
dollars in 1996, 4 billion dollars higher than the figure for
1995, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms today asked the Clinton
administration to suspend aid to South Africa if it goes ahead
with plans to sell weapons components to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, Helms said: "I respectfully urge that
you refrain from waiving the provisions of the Anti-terrorism
Act."
</P>
<P>
"The government of South Africa should understand that ... a
significant amount of U.S. foreign aid to South Africa will be cut
off," if its 650-million-U.S.-dollar military deal with Syria goes
through, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the State Department threatened to cut off
its 120-million-dollar aid to Pretoria if South Africa ignores
U.S. warning.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, South African President Nelson Mandela rejected
pressures from the United States to halt the contract of supplying
modern firing control systems to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"There is no country anywhere in the world that is going to
dictate to South Africa," the South African president said. "What
we decide will be in the interest of South Africa and South Africa
alone."
</P>
<P>
Helms, a staunch supporter of Israel, said: "Syrian acquisition
of the state-of-art military hardware runs counter to longstanding
U.S. national security interest in the region (of the Middle East)
and represents a significant new threat to Israel."

MANAGUA -- Nicaragua registered in 1996 a 12 percent inflation,
two points over the government's target and 0.8 percent higher

PANAMA CITY -- The budget for the Panama Canal this year is 550
million dollars, a figure to be maintained after the year 2000,
when the country will have full control of the interoceanic
waterway.
</P>
<P>
It would be necessary to hire more Panamanians to work in the
Canal, because the use and benefits of the Canal were considered
to be part of a global framework adapted to the needs of the
country, said Ricaurter Vasquez, comptroller of the waterway
commission.
</P>
<P>
About 850 million dollars will be invested during the next
eight years for the modernization of the Canal.

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Adventurer Steve Fossett may
be forced to abandon his round-the-world balloon non-stop flight
after Libya denied his passage, his spokesman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Fossett acrossed the Sahara Desert but was forced
into a detour away from the jet stream after Libya turned down his
request, Bo Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
And it was hard for Fossett to pick up the jet stream again
although the detour makes no danger to the flight, Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
Fossett is seeking to become the first balloonist to circle the
globe non-stop.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he was heading southeast on a detour that would take
him over Niger, Chad and Sudan, but the winds could push his
balloon in the wrong direction that may forced him to give up the
adventure.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- It is known as the capital of
cotton, a small village where virtually every household relies on
the raw material for clothing to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
Xinfeng Village in east China's Jiangsu province, is now
renowned nationally for its large-scale cotton industry.
</P>
<P>
Known as the number one cotton village in China, Xinfeng has
been taking a lead for almost a decade among China's villages in
respect of cotton growing.
</P>
<P>
Last year 454 hectares of cotton were planted in the village,
with output reaching 700,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed the achievements to help from a
village-run cotton research institute.
</P>
<P>
Four research fellows from the institute have helped local
farmers solve two major problems -- density of crops and serious
crop pests.
</P>
<P>
Advanced techniques were spread to cotton farmers through
various channels, such as on-the-spot meetings and local
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
With their efforts, 80 percent of the thousand cotton farmer
households in the village now earn more than 10,000 yuan a year
from cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying high profits, local farmers have great enthusiasm for
cotton production. The village, for ten years running, has
maintained its cotton-planting areas of more than 400 hectares.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Cornelio Sommaruga on Friday
urged Bosnian authorities to provide information on the missing
persons.
</P>
<P>
During the 43-month-long war in Bosnia, a total of 18,000
missing persons have been listed, and a majority of them are
probably dead, but the authorities must at least provide
information on them, Sommaruga told reporters in Serb city Banja
Luka after meeting with Serb President Biljana Plavis.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of persons missing in the civil war is a real
humanitarian tragedy," and the authorities of both entities in
Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and Muslim-Croat federation -- have the
greatest responsibility for resolving this problem, Tanjug news
agency quoted the ICRC president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Describing Friday's meeting with Serb leaders as very useful,
Sommaruga, who is in Bosnia on a several-day visit, said the
humanitarian situation was very difficult in both entities, and he
had discussed the issue with Plavsic the means of resolving
humanitarian problems.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said after the meeting that she had been impressed by
Sommaruga's report to the London conference and that the same
problems were on the agenda of Friday's meeting, including all
aspects of the humanitarian tragedy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both entities have claimed that thousands of their people went
missing during the war and charged the other side for
responsibility. ICRC's regional offices in the former Yugoslavia
are responsible for collecting and passing information on missing
persons between the two entities. So far, more than 500 missing
persons have been identified.

investigation. Cole said Gingrich used tax-deductible funds for
two activities with "substantial partisan political aspects to
them" including a college course Gingrich taught.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich admitted on December 21 that he had violated House
rules. He said he had failed to seek proper legal advice on using
tax-exempt projects to meet political goals, and he acknowledged
that "in my name and over my signature" inaccurate statements had
been submitted to the ethics committee.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Says Croatia Wants Balkan Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman said on friday his country would constructively help
implement the Dayton peace plan and the Muslim-Croat federation
accord but would not join the Balkan or southeast European unions.
</P>
<P>
Croatia "does not wish to enter into any Balkan or southeast
European unions or associations," although it hopes to develop
good relations with its neighbors, Tudjman said in Zagreb at a
traditional New Year meeting with the diplomatic corps in the
Croatian capital, according to Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Croatia was willing, however, to heed the recommendations of
the European Union and the United States and review concrete
measures for cooperation in the region, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman added that the year 1996 had been the first year of
peace in Croatia, and conditions existed for the current trend to
continue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's principal state policy target would be to bring to
completion the peaceful reintegration of the Serb region of
Eastern Slavonia into Croatia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, located in the northeastern Croatia bordering
Yugoslavia, is now under U.N administration. The majority of the
local population are Serbs who fear possible retaliation or
discrimination after the Croatian government resumes power in that
region in July of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Starts River Purification Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kunming City in southwest
China's Yunnan Province has started a large-scale operation to
clean up the water of five "smelly rivers" that run through urban
areas in the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The city government has decided to complete the work by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 local people cleared over 20 tons of garbage and
floating waste from the Panlong River in just one day this week.
</P>
<P>
The city has vowed to have all the floating garbage along the
river banks moved before the coming Spring Festival which starts
on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The five rivers, including the Panlong River, Mingtong River
and Daguan River, became smelly some years ago as more than 50
tons of waste water were discharged daily, and piles of garbage
were dumped along the banks of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Pollution of Dianchi Lake, a famous scenic spot in the city, is
also worsened as the five rivers flow into the lake.
</P>
<P>
The Dianchi Protection Committee and the city's waste water
discharge company urged units or enterprises along the river banks
to offer money or send employees to work on the river clean-up
operation.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort, the city is to build a project to transfer
waste water from the Panlong River into a waste water disposal
plant, cutting waste water discharged into Dianchi Lake by 10 tons
a day.

<HEADLINE> UK Corrects Mistake in Report on Nazi Gold Bought by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign and Commonwealth
Office of the United Kingdom published today a new version of its
report on Nazi gold that Switzerland bought in 1946, correcting an
error in its 1996 report, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign
Affairs announced in the Swiss capital of Bern.
</P>
<P>
In the old report published in September, 1996, the British
Foreign Office claimed that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) paid 500
million U.S. dollars for gold seized by German Nazis from their
occupied countries. The new report said that the amount which the
SNB had paid was 500 million Swiss francs.
</P>
<P>
In 1946 when the transactions finished, one U.S. dollar was
worth 4.3 Swiss francs. At present, one dollar is about 1.3
francs.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government is satisfied with Britain's correction of
the mistake but regrets that it has been condemned by the
international press based only on inaccurate information, said the
Swiss task force for the investigation of whereabouts of Nazi
gold.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the task force today handed over a list containing
the names of 53 Polish account holders to the Polish Ambassador in
Switzerland. The Polish authorities have committed themselves to
make the list public as soon as possible in order to locate those
entitled to restitution, according to a press release by the task
force.
</P>
<P>
The list concerns account holders whose assets were transferred
in 1975 to the Polish government in line with the Swiss-Polish
Compensation Agreement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States decided on
Friday to maintain a ban on American travel in Lebanon, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to have concerns about the safety of Americans in
Lebanon. secretary Christopher reviewed the passport restrictions
within this context and decided to continue the restrictions," a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States hosted a gathering of some 30 nations and
international lending institutions late last year to raise money
for the reconstruction of Lebanon after 15 years of civil war,
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Several million dollars were raised, but Lebanese President
Rafiq Hariri said lifting the travel ban was the best way to
attract business. President Clinton reportedly said such a move
was premature, but promised to review it early this year.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Israel to Talk with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Secretary of State
Warren Christopher on Friday urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to try to resume peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell interview with international news agencies,
Christopher said Netanyahu's agreement with Yasser Arafat on
Israeli troops' pullback from the West Bank city of Hebron could
prompt an accord with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He praised Netanyahu as crossing "an important threshold",
stopping short of saying that Netanyahu had been converted to the
"land-for-peace" formula by handing most of Hebron to the
Palestinians under the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt this will improve the relationships between
Israel and the rest of the Arab world," he said. And "by reaching
this agreement, by beginning redeployment... by committing to a
road map for the future, he will give... some encouragement to
those Arab countries that have wanted to see progress in peace."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli prime minister to try to resume peace
talks with Syria as Syrian President Hafez Assad will soon be
"back in action" and ready to pursue more stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I would think that the Israeli government, if it gets an
opportunity, should test the willingness of the Syrians to get
into serious discussions," Christopher said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A small plane crashed in New
Hampshire today after an untrained girl failed to control the
aircraft after the pilot had apparently passed out from carbon
monoxide fumes, killing both of them, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration controllers tried to talk the
girl into a safe landing after the pilot fell unconscious this
afternoon, possibly due to carbon monoxide fumes in the cabin, but
they lost contact with the plane just before it reached a airport
in Connecticut.

<P>
The drama began shortly after the private plane took off from
Republic Airport on New York's Long Island at 11:50 a.m. (1650
GMT). The FAA learned the plane was in trouble just after noon. It
crashed 40 kilometers northeast of Concord, New Hampshire at 1:30
p.m. (1830 GMT).

<P>
BELGRADE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Bosnian Serb
Vice-President Nikola Koljevic was under operation at Belgrade's
military medical academy hospital late on Friday, but his
condition is still extremely critical, a hospital source said.
</P>
<P>
Hospital Press Chief Col. Radoslav Svicevic said "Koljevic was
brought into the hospital in a very serious condition, but with
his vital organs functioning."
</P>
<P>
Koljevic, who shot himself in the head in a suicide attempt

<P>
ATHENS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said this evening that Greece backed Cyprus' defense
effort and announced that Athens will undertake an international
information campaign on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"Greece fully supports the Cypriot people's struggle, and we
clearly back Cyprus' defense effort," Simitis told reporters after
a meeting with visiting Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Nicosia announced earlier this month the purchase of Russian-
made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, which elicited strong reactions
and threats of military strikes against the island on the part of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides, on his part, underlined the "unwavering
position" of his government for the reinforcement of Cyprus'
defense capability, adding that the meeting confirmed that the
defense cooperation between Greece and Cyprus within the framework
of the joint defense doctrine is a steady choice of the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus signed a joint defense agreement in November
1993.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the meeting included the Defense Ministers of
Greece and Cyprus, Akis Tsohatzopoulos and Costas Eliades,

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Trade Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's international
merchandise trade moved ahead in November, with exports up 5.7
percent and imports up 4.7 percent, Statistics Canada reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose to a level of 16.5 billion U.S. dollars.
Automotive exports accounted for the bulk of the increase,
regaining two-thirds of the losses related to October's General
Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the automotive sector, exports grew 0.7 percent in
November, the federal fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
In November, imports rose to a record of 15.2 billion dollars.
A surge in aircraft purchases and a rebound in auto parts imports
were the main sources of growth.
</P>
<P>
Since exports grew faster than imports, the November trade
surplus increased to 1.3 billion dollars from 1.1 billion in
October.
</P>
<P>
A stronger trade balance with the United States was responsible
for most of the increase, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Roaring Over 6,800 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied
further into record territory Friday as the latest indications of
surprising strength in the economy failed to ignite the recent
inflation jitters in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 67.73 to 6,833.10, its
fourth new high this week and eighth in 10 sessions. The Dow's
first move above 6,800 came only about three months after it broke
past 6,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,549 up, 967 down and 848
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 532.44 million shares, almost unchanged
with 532.33 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also posted a sharp advance, with several
setting new highs.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.42 to 776.17, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 3.19 to 409.31. It was the second
straight record finish for both measures.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index 8.48 to 1,349.06, breaking Tuesday's
record close, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose
2.59 to 589.95.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies rose 0.96 to 367.88,
topping Tuesday's record finish by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging corporate earnings reports obviously helped offset
some unsettling news on the economy and inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve reported this morning that industrial
production rose 0.8 percent in December, higher than many analysts
had expected and raised again inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
Bonds initially slid after the report, boosting the yield on
the 30-year Treasury higher. But the Treasury market recovered
most of the drop, taking pressure off stocks, with the yield
finishing almost unchanged at 6.83 percent.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Warns over Anti-European Mood in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan warned here today that the surging
anti-European mood in Britain could eventually make the country
isolated in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a brief visit to London earlier today, Brittan
said that the concept of flexibility to allow some EU members
forge ahead in some areas could result in Britain becoming
increasingly isolated in the 15-nation block.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, a former British Conservative minister in the 1980s,
warned British politicians not to "damage Britain by engaging in a
Dutch auction of Euro-scepticism."
</P>
<P>
The anti-European sentiment is gathering momentum across
Britain with 38 percent of Britons wanting to quit the EU,
signaling a marked increase of anti-European feelings, according
to a recent opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who has been a EU commissioner since 1989, noted that
he had conveyed his warning to British Prime Minister John Major
and opposition Labor leader Tony Blair, calling on them not to
launch an anti-European election campaign.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that he did not expect Major to rule out
the possibility of joining the single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there will be any change in the present
(wait-and-see) formula, and I think it would be unwise to make
such a change," he added.

CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks here this evening with visiting Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara on
suspended Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks, the Syrian vice-president conveyed
a letter to Mubarak from Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, which
dealt with the current situation in the Arab world and the Middle
East peace process, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the latest developments in the
Middle East region and means of strengthening joint Arab actions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri and Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria were suspended last March
after four suicide bombings in Israel killed over 60 people.
Syria has demanded the return of the Golan Heights, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as a precondition for peace.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said the
Golan Heights are crucial to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed an agreement Tuesday to
redeploy Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron and much
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which is the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, now plays a leading role in brokering peace in
Arab-Israeli talks.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Constitutional Balanced-budget Amendment Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said today that approval of a balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution would expose the U.S. economy to
"unacceptable risks."
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, he
said a constitutional amendment to achieve the aim of balanced
budget was the wrong approach to take and would have serious
consequences.
</P>
<P>
"A balanced-budget amendment could turn slowdowns into
recessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even
depressions," Rubin said. "It could prevent us from dealing
expeditiously with emergencies such as natural disasters or
military threats."
</P>
<P>
The amendment "is a threat to our economic health, will expose
our economy to unacceptable risk and should not be adopted," Rubin
told the committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. Congress and the White House are very close
to an agreement that would achieve a balanced budget by 2002 and
that this was the proper approach to take.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's testimony marked the U.S. Government's opening salvo in
a campaign to defeat the constitutional amendment in the U.S.
Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
In comments to reporters on November 12 last year, President
Clinton had appeared to soften his longtime opposition to the
amendment, saying that he would consider the idea if it contained
an "escape hatch" for the economic recessions.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin and other government officials made corrections
quickly the next day. They said that Clinton's remarks had not
represented a change of position and the president still intended
to fight the amendment.
</P>
<P>
A constitutional amendment requires passage by two-thirds of
both houses of the U.S. Congress and then approval by
three-quarters of the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
In the last Congress, a constitutional balanced-budget amendment
received the necessary votes in the U.S. House of Representatives
but failed to clear the Senate.

UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businessman
Maurice Strong has been named as senior advisor to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was made on Thursday and confirmed today by U.N.

LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock markets in London, Paris
and Frankfurt all surged ahead and ended the week at new record
levels Friday, boosted by Wall Street's advance and the dollar's
surge to its highest level since June 1994.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in London ended the week on a high note at a new
all-time closing high of 4,207.7, 10.2 points up on the day and a
rise of 151.10 points on the week, and the first time it has burst
through the 4,200 barrier. The FTSE had earlier today peaked at
4,218.4.
</P>
<P>
Falling domestic bond yields, firm futures and gilts, and the
Dow Jones move above the 6,800-level all helped to boost the
market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares broke through the magical
3,000-points barrier, ending up 8.06 points at 3,001.37, boosted
by a 30-month record high for the dollar, which was particularly
favorable for German exporters. The DAX-30 index was 67.98 points
higher on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
French stocks had earlier today surged to a peak of 2,426.13
before closing at a fresh record high as the market continued its
bullish run, with the CAC-40 index up 17.33 points at 2,425.10, a
gain of 97.6 points on the week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the surge was fuelled by fresh liquidities and a
firmer dollar.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 10.2
points higher at 4,207.7. Frankfurt's DAX-30 index ended up 8.06
