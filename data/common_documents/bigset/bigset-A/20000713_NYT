<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three bodies were recovered Wednesday from the rubble
of a Brooklyn townhouse that exploded on Tuesday night, and fire
investigators said that they strongly suspected the blast was
caused by a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main possibility,'' said Chief Fire Marshal Louis
F. Garcia, citing the nature of the damage, the absence of other
obvious causes and the accounts of neighbors who said they smelled
gas before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really looking at anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon Wednesday, firefighters discovered the body
of Leonard Walit, 72, buried under tons of rubble in the basement
of his townhouse at 420 State St. in Boerum Hill. Eight hours
later, firefighters discovered the body of his friend and neighbor,
Khay Cochran, 73, and, about three hours after that, found the body
of Walit's wife, Harriet, 66, a retired social worker.
</P>
<P>
   For friends and relatives and neighbors, it was a devastating
day _ a day in which hope faded to nothing and a stunned
neighborhood was left to confront the mystery of fate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Mrs. Walit had called Cochran complaining of
the smell of gas, neighbors said. Cochran, a close friend of the
Walits, went next door to help investigate. Minutes later, an
explosion obliterated the Walits' place and all but obliterated the
adjoining townhouse that Cochran shared at 418 State St. with his
longtime companion, Julian Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet miraculously, Jackson and another roommate, Francis Aguire,
escaped with barely a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, his white dress shirt coated
in black dust from a night of supervising several hundred
firefighters, said the explosion could have been touched off by
something as simple as someone turning on a light, or lighting a
match. The explosion _ so intense that it snuffed out all flames in
an instant _ appeared to have originated from the Walits' basement,
knocking out supported walls and allowing the upper floors to
collapse in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building just pancaked,'' said Philip J. Burns, a deputy
fire chief.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators said it was far from clear whether the leak came
from a gas service line or from an appliance. The townhouse, they
said, had a gas stove, a gas boiler and a gas water heater, and a
spokesman for Keyspan Energy, the utility company, said that the
company's investigators had not identified any leaks coming from
its supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found zero evidence of natural gas leaking in the area,''
said Robert J. Mahoney, manager of media relations for Keyspan. He
cautioned, however, that because of the damage the company had not
been able to test the service lines leading directly into 420 and
418 State St.
</P>
<P>
   And although neighbors reported smelling gas before the
explosion, Mahoney said that the company's records of gas
complaints did not show any telephone calls from the neighborhood
on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than a month ago, on June 5, a resident at 422 State
St. complained to Keyspan about a gas smell. The odor, the resident
reported, was strongest near a wall that adjoined 420 State St.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said that Keyspan workers promptly investigated the
complaint, performed extensive testing inside and outside 422 State
St., but failed to detect any leakage of gas. Given those results,
he said, there was no need to test 420 State St. or other
residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went by the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunni Levinson, the person who made the complaint, said that
the Keyspan worker who responded told her that he, too, smelled
gas. ``It makes you wonder,'' she said. ``We smelled it, they
smelled it. When the gas man says he smells it, it has to come from
somewhere, and you have to find it.'' She added, however, that in
the weeks since she has not smelled gas.

PAST, PRESENT OF EVOLUTION DEBATE COME TOGETHER IN KANSAS
PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ H.L. Mencken must have been a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years ago this month, the caustic Baltimore Sun
columnist predicted that the dispute between creationists and
evolutionists, between traditionalists and modernists, wouldn't end
with the two-week trial of a Tennessee science teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken was proved right Wednesday night, as about 1,300 people
filled the University of Kansas' Lied Center for a dramatic
presentation based on transcripts from the 1925 Scopes ``Monkey
Trial'' and a debate after the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People continue to be so divided on this issue,'' panelist
Edward Larson, author of a book on the Scopes trial, told the
audience. ``It's an important issue because of how we view
ourselves and our morality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scopes re-enactment, presented by the People for the
American Way Foundation came 11 months after the Kansas Board of
Education voted to de-emphasize evolution in new science standards.
The standards are guidelines for what students will learn and be
tested on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee was the battleground 75 years ago,'' said Ralph
Neas, foundation president. ``Kansas is today's ground zero in the
battle over evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Ed Asner, a native of Kansas City, Kan., portrayed William
Jennings Bryan, the well-known orator who prosecuted science
teacher John Scopes. James Cromwell, who starred in the movie
``Babe,'' played defense attorney Clarence Darrow. Also part of the
cast were actress Shirley Knight, a native of Mitchell, Kan., and
Harold Gould.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation coincided with a weeklong observance in Kansas
of the trial sponsored by the Mainstream Coalition, a political
watchdog group; Kansas Citizens for Science, formed after the state
board's vote; and several other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The August 1999 vote by the state board raised many of the same
issues as the Scopes trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, Bryan argued that parents, not teachers, should decide
whether their children should learn scientific theories or anything
else that goes against the values they teach at home. The six board
members who voted for the standards made similar points, saying the
new standards allow local districts to decide what to teach.
</P>
<P>
   And Darrow, like the scientists and pro-evolution group that
arose after the state board's vote, charged that dismissing
evolution is just the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the next session you may ban books and newspapers...until
with flying banners and beating drums, we are marching backward to
the 16th century when bigots lighted torches to burn men who dared
to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and culture to the
human mind,'' intoned Cromwell during his performance as Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd Wednesday night also served as the courtroom audience,
responding with appropriate laughter, applause and hisses to
placards displayed near the stage.
</P>
<P>
   After the hour drama, a panel took the stage to discuss the
difference between theories of creationism and intelligent design,
which hold that a designer created the universe and everything in
it, and evolution, the theory that living things share common
ancestors but have evolved over time.
</P>
<P>
   Moderated by KU law professor Michael Davis, the panel included
Larson; Tom Willis of Cleveland, Mo., president of the Creation
Science Association for Mid-America; Eugenie Scott, director of the
National Center for Science Education in Berkeley, Calif.; John
Calvert of Lake Quivira, managing director of the Intelligent
Design Network; and Leonard Krishtalka, a KU evolutionary biologist
and curator of the school's Natural History Museum.
</P>
<P>
   During the 40-minute debate, Davis asked Willis, Scott, Calvert
and Krishtalka to describe why the debate over evolution still
rages. Scott and Krishtalka said it's because some people don't
understand exactly what evolution is and are uncomfortable with
what they do know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Willis and Calvert said their scientific evidence that a
designer created life isn't allowed into reputable scientific
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Krishtalka answered by saying that he believed creationism is
religion, and ``intelligent design is creationism in a cheap
suit.''

NL shakedown begins before games resume
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The National League playoff picture took on a bit of a different
look Wednesday when the Cincinnati Reds all but conceded their
hopes of contention while the Atlanta Braves strengthened
themselves for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, just eight games behind first-place St. Louis in the
NL Central Division, traded away its top starting pitcher. Atlanta,
meanwhile, acquired a veteran starter with hopes of winning its
eighth straight NL East crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds traded lefthander Denny Neagle to the Yankees the day
after the All-Star Game, basically signaling the end of
Cincinnati's run for the division title this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play for the Reds, that's pretty tough to swallow,''
Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said of Wednesday's deal. ``Don't
get me wrong. The Reds could still win it, because there's a long
way to go, and a lot can happen. But that's not exactly what you
like to see when you're coming back from the All-Star break. I'm
sure that deal doesn't make the Cardinals unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Braves, starting pitching has been the main reason
they have been so consistent over the past 10 years. And while
their 4.33 earned run average is good for second in the NL, it's
still significantly higher than what they're accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andy Ashby, whom they acquired from the Phillies on
Wednesday, has struggled most of the season, he's certainly an
upgrade over Terry Mulholland and John Burkett _ the bottom two
starters in the Braves' rotation behind Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine
and Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves need Ashby to pitch like he did for the Padres in
1998 and '99 (when he was a combined 31-19) if they are going to
hold off the Mets in the NL East. The Ashby the Phillies saw this
season didn't look much like the one who was a picture of
consistency for San Diego. Ashby has a 5.68 ERA this season,
although he has allowed just three runs in his last 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashby's ability and experience are very appealing to us, and
we believe he's shown signs of returning to his old form,'' Braves
general manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Cardinals appear to have the best chance to
unseat the Braves as NL champs. While most contending teams are
looking for starting pitching, the Cardinals' rotation is so deep
that righthanders Matt Morris and Alan Benes, once highly touted,
have been relegated to relief work. Of course, that just makes the
Cardinals' bullpen that much better.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis arguably has the most dangerous lineup in the league
and is very sound defensively. The Cardinals should cruise to the
NL Central title, barring a rash of injuries to key players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get too far behind this (Cardinals) club,'' Reds
first-base coach Dave Collins said. ``It isn't like you're chasing
chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   The best race figures to be in the NL West, where things are
still very much up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some team is going to win 20 of 25. You can count on it,'' San
Francisco manager Dusty Baker said. ``It might as well be us.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Arizona Diamondbacks are a great team
every fifth day _ in other words, when Randy Johnson pitches _ but
just so-so the rest of the time. Take away Johnson's 14-2 record,
and the Diamondbacks are just two games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are on the Colorado Rockies' bandwagon, and
rightfully so. They've made quite a turnaround under new manager
Buddy Bell, who has the club making a serious run at the playoffs
for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the Rockies have improved, it's unlikely they'll
continue to stay in the race if they don't play better on the road.
Good teams typically play well away from home, and the Rockies
clearly didn't fall into that category during the first half. They
are 28-9 at Coors Field but just 17-31 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finished the second half strong, and Baker always
seems to find a way to have them in the mix at the end of the
season. And don't discount the Los Angeles Dodgers, who on paper
look like the best team in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of adversity hanging over us in the first half,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We've just got to put
together well-pitched games. That's going to be the key for us in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers and every other team that fashions itself as a
contender in the NL, it all begins today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thirteen mini columns, each one soon to be a
major motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   -- The tourist rents a car, takes his family out for a drive
around San Francisco. Another car cuts him off, imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   Our tourist slams on his brakes, and out from under his seat
slides a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a new rental-car feature, it's a great idea on many
levels. One, as sloppy as airport security is these days, it's
still risky for the traveler to pack his or her own heat.
</P>
<P>
   -- Memo to Peter Harris, former toy-industry honcho hired as the
new boss of the 49ers: Some assembly may be required.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is ``simply fun to be around,'' says a 49er spokesman. So
is Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheesy tourist trap or Bay eco-education center at Pier 45?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, I'd like to support ``A.'' San Francisco could use a
one-stop historical/cultural museum where tourists  &UR; and  &LR; locals
could absorb the big picture in one morning or afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But my faith in the ability of those Cleveland people to pull it
off without mind-boggling schlock: Zero.
</P>
<P>
   So it looks like I'm back to supporting Gavin Newsom's Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Jack Gallagher points out that Plan A would drive out
what there is now at Fisherman's Wharf's Pier 45: ``Fishermen!
Fish! Wharf!''
</P>
<P>
   -- Another way the city bites the hand that buys the Alcatraz
T-shirts and keeps the economy booming:
</P>
<P>
   Overbooking by the big hotels. Sometimes, it works. This week,
with a huge semiconductor convention in town, one hotel overbooked
by 100 rooms, another by 60, and, oops, all the usual no-shows
showed.
</P>
<P>
   One hotel blamed a computer snafu. So the victims were hoisted
by their own petard.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared, hotels scrambled to book guests in other full-up
hotels, and folks with legit reservations were exiled to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should open up the cell blocks at Alcatraz for victims
of overbook. A homeless shelter for screwed tourists.
</P>
<P>
   -- Chico has never recovered from the time Herb Caen reported
that Velveeta could be found in the gourmet section of the local
Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of the Chico News &AMP; Review (spotted by Maxine
LeClerc), in a story on the great chefs of Chico, chef Robert
Allison of Christian Michaels' Ristorante says, ``There's a reason
why lamb and goat cheese go together, and it's not because they're
from the same animal.''
</P>
<P>
   -- What's San Francisco coming to when a local poet can't have a
smoke on the sidewalk without getting thrown in the can?
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sauer, a leading S.F. poet and translator, was busted for
smoking pot outside Specs bar on Saroyan Alley in North Beach last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer spent the night in jail (at least the jail wasn't
overbooked), went to court, charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Specs, where Jack Kerouac drank and Janis Joplin got 86'd, is
still a hotbed of culture, home of poets and other endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   What other bar has a Sunday figure-drawing session, with live
nude models? It's legit. No doodlers or finger-painters, please.
</P>
<P>
   -- The man who dropped rebar on cars driven by hookers'
customers _ the Bootybomber? _ got off easy, sure.
</P>
<P>
   But would it be fair for this clown to do hard time while so
many others involved in life-threatening criminal activity get the
old wink from the city?
</P>
<P>
   -- The Old Homeboy wonders if the Associated Press is pulling
the wool over our eyes. The story: A former Duke basketball player
says that while in high school he was given cash from a coach to
play summer-league ball.
</P>
<P>
   The coach who made the payoffs: Myron Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   And the story quoted a Duke executive vice president named
Tallman Trash III.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman trash? Homeboy says that's what you must listen to after
the 7-footer swats away your driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   -- Memo to 49ers' new boss: Forget the $700 million stadium. For
a couple thou you can build a new stadium from Leggo blocks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Today at the Gold Coast they dedicate the city's first
``Mo,'' a rest room named in honor of Florida attorney Morris
Engelberg, defender of the sacred honor of Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   I hope it's a very large rest room, so Mo don't sue.
</P>
<P>
   -- We got your onomatopoeia right here, pal:
</P>
<P>
   On Stockton in Chinatown, Cuffs Corbett saw the Ching Ching Coin
Shop.
</P>
<P>
   -- Anonymous caller suggests, ``When you go on vacation, could
you please have the paper run the best-of-your-best columns, like
Ann Landers does when she's on vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   Bless your heart, sir, that's a great idea. But what will I do
for Tuesday?

THIS ONE'S FOR MARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marty Tregnan finally got his day.
</P>
<P>
   And with it perhaps his fondest wish.
</P>
<P>
   Tregnan, the longtime public-golf advocate who campaigned until
his death in 1997 to keep the game accessible and affordable to all
segments of society, on Monday had his name and spirit linked to
unprecedented aid for golf's future.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the opening of the Tregnan Golf Academy at
Coolidge, the country's first municipal golf-training center
devoted to youth.
</P>
<P>
   Established for junior golfers, particularly from low-income
families, it is located in his beloved Griffith Park on the site of
the long-abandoned Coolidge par-3 course. The refurbished hilltop
facility sits a few long tee shots down Crystal Springs Drive from
the Wilson and Harding courses, where Tregnan served officially as
men's club president and unofficially but unmistakably as champion
of golf for the working class.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he rubbed people the wrong way in his passion,
manifested often during his 40 years as an active and vocal member
of the Municipal Golf Association. But whether Tregnan was pushing
for greater opportunities for juniors, campaigning in City Council
to keep rates reasonable, or helping promote the creation of a golf
advisory board, no one who dealt with him could doubt his
dedication to keep public golf available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan alluded to that at Monday's
dedication of the Tregnan academy, a state-of-the-art training
facility that includes three practice holes, a driving range,
chipping and putting greens, practice bunkers and a
1500-square-foot learning center with classroom space.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people here have helped make this happen,'' Riordan
told a turnout of nearly 300 at the 10-acre facility. ``But one in
particular is looking down on us in his curmudgeonly way, looking
down laughing. Marty? Have we done a good job? I think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   They have done that _ in three short years _ thanks to the
combined efforts of many, led by American Golf, the U.S. Golf
Association, the Griffith J. Griffith trust, the L.A. Junior
Chamber of Commerce Urban Youth Golf Program and the L.A.
Department of Recreation and Parks.
</P>
<P>
   American Golf made the biggest contribution, conducting a
$900,000 renovation of a Coolidge course that had been shut down
since 1982. The USGA has awarded $475,000 in two grants to the city
_ the most that organization has contributed to any project _ and
the Griffith trust has given $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other contributions _ acknowledged on bricks lining
the Tregnan entrance _ helped pave the way for the facility, which
will be staffed and maintained by Recreation and Parks. The Urban
Youth Golf Program will provide equipment and instruction, which
begins Saturday when the first Tregnan students start classes
designed to teach as much about sportsmanship and integrity as club
selection and course management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to serve 500 a year,'' said academy manager Randy
Kelly, who has nearly 350 registered for the first of two six-month
sessions. It can cost students as little as $25 a year for a
15-week instruction program that includes round-trip transportation
from neighborhood recreation centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never really been tried to the extent that we're
doing it,'' Kelly said. ``We go out in vans and get the kids. We
make it accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-step program, designed to prepare young golfers for the
next stage of junior opportunities on city and county courses,
emphasizes etiquette, dress code and safety along with care of the
course, the proper swing and handling of the club.
</P>
<P>
   All at a site Tregnan often said would be ideal for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty would be thrilled,'' said Clare Darden, Tregnan's
sweetheart for 15 years before his sudden death at age 78 of heart
failure. ``He was always thinking the old Coolidge would be
perfect. Here it was, just lying there, not doing anyone any good.
This way, these kids are going to be ready to play when they're 14
on the big courses. So many kids aren't _ they really don't have
the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tregnan might be thrilled by more than just the new learning
center bearing his name. Boosted by the phenomenal popularity of
Tiger Woods, junior golf is booming throughout the inner city and
seemingly benefiting more each year from individuals and agencies
dedicated to that growth.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Hathaway par-3, a county course in South Central Los
Angeles, is the introduction site in the Western States Golf
Association's 18-year-old program that advances juniors to
more-difficult county courses as skills improve. This year, the
Hathaway course is scheduled to become part of the national First
Tee program, which combines considerable pooled resources _
including those of the USGA, PGA, LPGA and World Golf Organization
_ to develop youth-training centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've sort of adopted the philosophy of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt that parks are very important to our community,'' said
Susan Henderson, director of the WSGA's Junior Golf Academy at
Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 children, aged 7-17, are now enrolled in the WSGA
program, which provides students with instruction and equipment for
$20 a year and which, like others, is feeling the impact of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program has had a good, healthy interest for a long
time,'' Henderson said, ``but certainly, after Tiger, interest has
doubled.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same at the LPGA-founded Urban Youth Golf Program,
which provides equipment and instruction in nine-week sessions that
cost $20 a year for those who can get into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a waiting list of about 300 now,'' said director John
Morrison, who has 600 in the program and ``we anticipate an
additional 500 in the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city and county courses _ the next learning step for
children taught the game in the WSGA, Urban Youth and Tregnan
programs _ have reduced rates for juniors by half in recent years.
This year, July has been designated Junior Golfer Appreciation
Month at the 17 county courses, enabling juniors to play for $1 in
twilight time when accompanied by an adult or senior. County golf
operations administrator Steve Durand estimates 50 to 100 children
participate in junior programs at each county course _ 250 at
Maggie Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   At city courses, director of golf operations Pete Frey says
junior golf programs, offering instruction and team play,
consistently average 2,500 youngsters a year with growth limited
only by lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have too many kids,'' she said, ``because it would be
too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Tregnan might have had a real dilemma with that _ the concept of
too many juniors for public courses. But he would have loved
thinking up a solution _ much as he did in planting the seed for
the metamorphosis of Coolidge. &QL;

AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AD BLASTS DAVIS OVER TOBACCO  SETTLEMENT
MONEY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The American Heart Association blasted Gov. Gray
Davis in a full-page advertisement Wednesday, saying the governor
has hijacked the state's tobacco settlement money and put
Californians at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The association's full-page ad in the New York Times came as
Davis' office trumpeted new numbers showing that teen smoking in
California dropped from 10.7 percent in 1998 to 6.9 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis' office attributed the drop to the state's tobacco
education campaign, the governor's critics say Davis is allowing
the program to become woefully underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state gets $500 million a year from the tobacco
settlement, and no new dollars whatsoever are being put into the
state's tobacco prevention campaign,'' said Marc Burgat, spokesman
for the American Heart Association. ``The tobacco companies are in
the midst of a record year of spending on media and advertising,
while the state's funds remain static or are decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' spokesman said the proof of the project is in the
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advocacy groups are doing their job in wanting more, but
California has done more than other states,'' spokesman Steve
Maviglio said. ``They are targeting California so other states will
follow. The bottom line is the results are there.''
</P>
<P>
   But one anti-tobacco advocate said the numbers will not stay
down if the Davis administration continues to ignore the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davis administration has done absolutely nothing
meaningful on tobacco,'' said Stan Glantz, professor of medicine at
the University of California at San Francisco. ``There may be fewer
people smoking, but there are more than there should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said the drop in smoking rates can be attributed to
Proposition 10, a 50-cent-per-pack tax on cigarettes approved by
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the height of arrogance for him to take credit,'' Glantz
said. ``It is down no thanks to anything the Davis administration
has done. There is no leadership from the administration on this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements that Davis released with much fanfare soon after
he took office were produced under former Gov. Pete Wilson or by
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did increase the state's advertising budget by $25 million
this year, but Burgat said that is simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Burgat cited a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention that said California should be spending $105 million
on anti-tobacco campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a no-brainer,'' he said, adding that studies
show for every $1 spent on campaigns, the state saves $8 in future
health costs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also vetoed a bill last year that would have directed the
state's share of the settlement to tobacco-related health programs,
saying there already is enough money in these programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the better policy to maintain flexibility in the use of
the tobacco settlement funds for other purposes as well. In the
event of unforeseen fiscal emergencies, it is critical for the
administration to have discretionary control of the uses of these
monies,'' Davis said in his veto message.
</P>
<P>
   The state has a $12 billion surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement that states made with the tobacco industry,
California receives about $1 billion a year, with half going to
counties.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has pledged to spend $1 million a year from its
share of the settlement money on tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has put all of the state's tobacco money into health care,
increasing the number of children enrolled in the state's Healthy
Families program and supporting other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' office also argues that there are two tobacco-related
funds that have been created by initiatives _ Propositions 99 and
10 _ that provide more than $400 million and almost $700 million,
respectively, for health and education.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988's Proposition 99 added a tax to cigarettes to pay for
an anti-smoking campaign, the state has spent $1 billion, Davis
said in a statement announcing the smoking numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Health study also showed that adult
smoking dropped to 18 percent from 18.4 percent, significantly
lower than the national average of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows smoking dropping across gender and ethnic lines
among youths age 12 to 17. Smoking among 16- and 17-year-olds fell
from 20 percent to 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Burgat said the numbers nationwide are going up the most
among 18- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The state's survey also shows the numbers increasing in this age
group, although the governor's office declined to release those
numbers.

YOUNG SHOPPERS GET OWN ZONE AT TRENDY GALLERIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Some new retailers at the trendy Glendale
Galleria are hoping to lure cash-flush Generation Y shoppers into
The Zone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case of the kids speaking and the mall opening its
checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone concept was created with input from a focus group of
146 Southern California teens.
</P>
<P>
   They helped persuade the mall owners to spend $2.5 million
creating what officials say is the nation's first entertainment,
dining and shopping venue designed specifically for people 6 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   It will open Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The area will include a lounge with a message board,
out-of-the-ordinary vending machines and overhead television
screens that will show music videos, extreme sports footage and
messages from mall businesses, said Annette Bethers, senior
marketing director for the Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Later, teens will be invited to bring videos of themselves and
their friends playing music, demonstrating other talents or
participating in extreme sports, she said.
</P>
<P>
   KIIS-FM will do frequent live broadcasts from the site, starting
with the grand opening set for 8 to 10 p.m. Friday, Bethers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria's Gen Y shoppers, born between 1979 and 1994, spend
between $2,700 and $3,000 each per year, Bethers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide this age group numbers 60 million with purchasing
power of $90 billion to $150 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with the concept more than a year ago,'' Bethers
said. ``We realized, upon doing some research on Generation Y's
numbers and buying power, that we had an opportunity to better
serve that customer in our mall and to begin building a loyalty
toward the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Galleria retailers that targeted Generation Y - such as Limited
Too, Hot Topic, Planet X and Quake - have been joined by more, mall
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers new to the mall are:
</P>
<P>
   No Fear - clothing for extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   Van's - clothing, shoes, skateboards and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtapose - junior apparel plus a juice bar and music
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Boarders - skateboards, snowboards, surfboards, apparel and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Premium - young junior apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Catwalk - junior apparel and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale Galleria has a history of launching new retail
concepts, and that reputation attracts retailers and makes the mall
prominent in the diverse Los Angeles marketplace, Bethers said,.
</P>
<P>
   The first Disney, Synchrony watch and ESPN sports memorabilia
stores were launched at the Galleria, Bethers said.

DODGERS FAIL AT LITTLE THINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have power and pop, but
they don't manufacture runs and win the close games that
championship teams do. Their bullpen is solid, their ERA is fourth
in the league, but the starting pitching was a disappointment and
they've resorted to closing games by committee because Jeff Shaw
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers withstood injuries to Kevin Brown, Todd Hundley,
Kevin Elster and Adrian Beltre, a demanding schedule in the first
two months of the season and a fight at Wrigley Field in mid-May
that remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to be a playoff team, the Dodgers must do more than
hit the long ball at pivotal times. They must begin executing in
the finer points of the game if they're to make up the six-game
deficit they face in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly, nobody is happy with the Dodgers standing in fourth
place at 44-42. If the Dodgers don't make a run at the playoffs,
discussions of who's on the hot seat will surely come.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least as far as contending, I don't think anybody would
disagree with the fact that we have the talent, but we have to get
it done,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We worked
with (manager) Davey (Johnson) and brought in players we thought
would help us be a postseason team. There has been some
(adversity), but all that should be behind us in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are talking about it. You have seven All-Stars and
a balanced lineup and we have tremendous make-up and the chemistry
on the team is outstanding. We have to do the little things.
Everybody has to turn it up a notch and it starts with me and Davey
and the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are roundly criticized by scouts for not being
fundamentally sound, either offensively or defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who follow the Dodgers on a semi-regular basis
continually say the players don't sacrifice for the betterment of
the team by hitting behind runners, laying down sacrifice bunts or
hitting cutoff men.
</P>
<P>
   What's more is the Dodgers are 6-17 in games in which they don't
hit a homer, and they lead the league by grounding into 80 double
plays. That's manifested in their 12-13 mark in one-run games and
7-9 record in two-run games.
</P>
<P>
   It's why Bob Daly, Dodgers managing general partner and CEO,
went to San Diego last week to talk to Johnson and tell him the
club needs to play with more enthusiasm and fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a philosophy and approach of, `How are we
going to score tonight if we don't hit the long ball?' '' Malone
said. ``We need to hit behind runners, get bunts down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers survived some possible pitfalls in the
first half and are five games better off than they were a year ago,
a $90 million payroll is expected to yield more than a .512 winning
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Blame can go to many areas, but the starting pitching, as
always, deserves a fair share. Right-hander Kevin Brown has been
even better this season, going 8-2 with a 2.38 ERA, but he's been
left alone for the last month by the rest of the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Chan Ho Park is 9-6, but he hasn't won since June
18 and the organizational concerns of him getting unnerved in
crucial situations have returned. He was well on his way to an
All-Star bid with a five-game winning streak, but he's faltered
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort, called by Malone ``the key to the
second half,'' has regressed. He was 3-1 after a shutout of St.
Louis on May 12, but his only win since then came June 7. Dreifort
is 1-6 with a 7.03 ERA in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an easy argument to make is that lefty Carlos Perez was
the Dodgers' third-best starter in the first half and went 4-4. And
for all the promise and potential of rookie right-hander Eric
Gagne, he's 1-5 with six no-decisions and opponents have scored
first in nine of his 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dreifort, Gagne and Perez are a combined 9-16, the
Dodgers are trying to add a veteran starting pitcher before the
July 31 trading deadline. They were involved in talks about
Cincinnati's Denny Neagle and Philadelphia's Andy Ashby before both
were traded, and in both cases they were told they didn't have
enough in the prospect market to trade for either player.
Therefore, Neagle went to the Yankees and the Phillies traded Ashby
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solutions aren't always external,'' Malone said.
``Everybody can say you want to win, but can you dig deep down and
make the sacrifices to win? It's how bad do we want to win, because
we have the talent. That's what people in the industry are telling
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dodgers position-by-position grades for the first half of the
season &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros is cleaning up in the fifth spot in the batting
order en route to career highs in home runs and RBI. His 25 homers
and 70 RBI are second on the club as teams pitch around Gary
Sheffield and Shawn Green to get to him. Defensively, his range is
limited, and that's a big part of the position as well. Grade: B &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek's transition from shortstop to second has gone
smoothly, although a few ill-timed errors have allowed winning runs
to score. He hasn't been given many days off, mostly because of
Devon White's injury and F.P. Santangelo's mediocre offensive play.
Grade: B &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster started out with a bang with three homers at Pac
Bell Park, but the position hasn't produced offensively. Elster has
10 homers (one as a third baseman) and 21 RBI, and Cora is hitting
.254 with a homer and six RBI in 130 at-bats. Cora has brought
improved defense the last month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the offseason distractions are showing now. Sure, Adrian
Beltre is 21 and in his second full season, but he's batting .251
with eight homers and 38 RBI. Worse, he's made 13 errors, many of
which were errant throws. When he missed three weeks with a
hamstring injury, Kevin Elster and Dave Hansen weren't upgrades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trio of Todd Hundley, Chad Kreuter and Paul LoDuca have 24
homers and 63 RBI, led by Hundley's resurgence. He's hitting .316
with 17 homers and 43 RBI heading into free agency. But some of the
disappointment of the starting pitchers can be attributed to the
catchers' play behind the plate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, All-Star. He's thrived with Green batting behind him,
has played through painful ankle injuries and is one of the leaders
in the clubhouse. Oh, and he's missed just two games and leads the
Dodgers in batting (.334), homers (27), RBI (71), walks (58) and
on-base percentage (.440) and is tied for the team lead with 64
runs score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White's partially torn rotator cuff has thrown the Dodgers a
curve. The team's leadoff hitter and starting center fielder on
opening day went down with an injury May 2. Since then, Todd
Hollandsworth and Santangelo have platooned. Hollandsworth is
hitting .246 with a .323 on-base percentage and Santangelo is
batting .183 with a .310 on-base percentage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green has started all but one game but has slumped terribly in
the last month. His average has dropped to .294, he is fourth on
the team with 13 homers and has 59 RBI. Green, a Gold Glove winner
last season, has four errors, three more than a year ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARTING PITCHING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown missed three weeks but went 8-2 with a 2.38 ERA.
Chan Ho Park had nine wins by the middle of June, but he last won
June 18. That also happens to be the last time a starter other than
Brown won a game for the Dodgers. Carlos Perez last won May 20,
Darren Dreifort won June 7 and Eric Gagne has one win. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RELIEF PITCHING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw twice lost his closer's role, went on the
disabled list for the first time in his career and is 2-4 with an
8.00 ERA. He has 12 saves but has blown seven saves. But Mike
Fetters and Matt Herges have been Godsends, and after a rough
start, Onan Masaoka has pitched well as the only lefty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BENCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen is the best pinch-hitter in baseball _ he has four
homers and nine RBI _ but he needs help. The big disappointment has
been Santangelo, a good clubhouse guy who's struggled to get any
rhythm. The bench was weakened when Geronimo Berroa, the
right-handed power source, broke his left foot. It forced the
Dodgers to deal utility infielder Jose Vizcaino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MANAGER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson has had to deal with suspensions, injuries
and the collapse of closer Jeff Shaw, and the Dodgers did fine for
the first 2 months. But the Dodgers lost 11 of 17 to end the first
half of the season at 44-42. Johnson has to figure out a way to get
Dreifort and Gagne and Green back on track. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRONT OFFICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New head man Bob Daly is discovering how tough talent evaluation
can be. He was instrumental in bringing Orel Hershiser back to the
Dodgers and now Hershiser is one of the top-paid consultants in the
game. The Gregg Olson signing is a nonfactor. F.P. Santangelo
hasn't performed well. However, clubhouse camaraderie is high and
the majority of the pieces are in place to compete for the division
title. &QL;

 NATURAL LAW PARTY CANDIDATE WANTS TO TAKE REFORM PARTY NOMINATION  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A quantum physicist who taught at the Maharishi
University of Management in Iowa is trying to wrest the Reform
Party presidential nomination _ and $12.6 million in federal
matching funds that go with it _ from Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Although John Hagelin, who was the Natural Law Party candidate
for president in 1996 and again this year, has no illusions about
winning the presidency, it is clear even with his mild, button-down
manner that he wants to thrash his conservative opponent, a former
TV commentator and GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Buchanan stands for is not what the Reform Party stands
for,'' Hagelin said during a mashed potatoes and lobster tail lunch
near the Capitol on Tuesday. ``He has a very narrow message, a
message of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin contends that Buchanan is ``alienating most of the women
and minorities in the Reform Party _ certainly African American and
gay members of the party. It's not an inclusive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign declined to comment on Hagelin's charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party has not been a major force in politics since
1992, when its founder, Ross Perot, mounted a strong third-party
challenge that attracted nearly 20 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   But while polls suggest the Reform Party's percentage of the
November vote will be in single digits, the choice of a nominee
could, in a close election, have an impact on the fortunes of the
major party candidates, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A Buchanan candidacy could drain crucial votes of social
conservatives away from Bush's camp, and Green Party nominee Ralph
Nadar could peel off some of Gore's more liberal followers.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin wants to see his candidacy backed by a coalition of
other third parties.
</P>
<P>
   He says the positions of the Natural Law Party, founded in 1992
by 12 people in Hagelin's hometown of Fairfield, Iowa, are broader
than those of the Reform Party, but that the two platforms are a
good fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party vision was to be a mainstream centrist
alternative _ of, by and for the people, not financed by the
special interests,'' Hagelin said. ``The Natural Law platform has
extended those core reforms to what's working in preventative
health care, sustainable agriculture, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Law Party is also heavily linked to the
transcendental meditation movement. Its Web site states, ``The
first priority of the Natural Law Party will be to create a more
orderly, harmonious and positive society by establishing a group of
7,000 experts practicing Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation and
TM-Sidhi Programme, including the technique of Yogic Flying,''
which the party says will ``enliven the collective consciousness''
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The party also supports teaching meditation to prison inmates to
reduce recidivism, placing a moratorium on genetically engineered
food and promoting the use of solar, wind and other renewable
energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco Wednesday, Hagelin charged Buchanan with
illegally enlisting thousands of unqualified GOP supporters to cast
Reform ballots on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin said Buchanan has attempted to subvert the party's
nomination process and has refused requests by party officials to
turn over lists of supporters to be verified as qualified voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have witnessed over the past months efforts to compromise
the open, democratic nature of the Reform Party, through Pat
Buchanan and his brigaders steamrolling over longstanding Reform
Party leadership and supporters in state after state,'' said
Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform nomination will be decided by mail ballots in a
national primary that began July 5. According to the party's
complex primary rules, registered party members _ and anyone who
officially has requested a ballot _ are qualified to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin said he has raised $2 million and will spend some of
that to send mailers to registered party members in New York and
California, which represent about 90 percent of the party's 250,000
national members.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin charges that Buchanan is trying to stack the deck by
submitting a 400,000-person list of voters which Hagelin does not
have access to.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party executive committee was expected to vote
Wednesday night on whether Buchanan would be required to turn over
the documents, according to secretary Jim Mangia, a Hagelin backer.
</P>
<P>
   Some party members, though, are irked that Hagelin has pledged
to run as the Natural Law nominee should he lose his fight against
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Reform Party becomes the Buchanan party, America is
going to need a voice of reform,'' Hagelin responded.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly contentious race could lead to a chaotic
national convention, scheduled for Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin says the race with Buchanan is ``neck and neck.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Hagelin has going for him is Doonesbury's skewering of
Buchanan and his campaign manager sister, Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The character Uncle Duke is seeking the Reform Party nomination
but is constantly thwarted by close-cropped, Neo-Nazi-like youth
who call Bay Buchanan ``Frau Buchanan'' and report to her that Duke
is ``using Democratic processes to secure delegates loyal to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Hagelin: ``Garry Trudeau, insightful as always.''

HUNDLEY'S THUMB FEARED BROKEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers went nearly four weeks
without Todd Hundley in the lineup last month and the offense
suffered _ and they could be looking at more time with the
switch-hitting catcher out of their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is scheduled to undergo X-rays on his right thumb upon
his return to Los Angeles today. The Dodgers fear he has a hairline
fracture at the tip of his right thumb, and it's likely he won't be
ready to catch until after the three-game series with the Angels.
He's hitting .316 with 17 homers and 43 RBI, and has provided
protection and depth to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to (physical therapist) Pat (Screnar), he's moving
it pretty good and the swelling has gone down,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said of Hundley's thumb. ``As far as throwing, we'll
have to see. The doctors said maybe by the weekend (Hundley could
play).''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was injured Friday when he took a foul ball off the
thumb in Seattle. He was the designated hitter Saturday but was
scratched Sunday. He spent the All-Star break away from Los Angeles
because of a sick family member.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Hundley's ailing thumb and the absence of Chad
Kreuter, the Dodgers recalled Paul LoDuca from Triple-A
Albuquerque. LoDuca hit .346 with two homers and five RBI in nine
games last month and takes the place of Mike Metcalfe, sent back to
the minors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Devo's progression: For the first time since suffering a
partially torn left rotator cuff diving for a ball May 2, center
fielder Devon White faced live pitching. White batted from both
sides of the plate at the beginning of Wednesday's workout, did
some running in the outfield and shagged balls.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials believe White will be ready to go on a rehab
assignment in a week, and after he spends 10 days to two weeks
playing in the minor leagues, the club hopes White will be ready to
return.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shaw's back: The Dodgers plan to activate reliever Jeff Shaw
for tonight's game against the Angels. He's missed the past two
weeks with tendinitis in his right elbow, landing on the disabled
list for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson doesn't plan on handing the closer's role back
to Shaw, who is 2-4 with an 8.00 ERA and has converted just 12 of
19 save chances. Instead, Johnson will look at matchups when it
comes to using Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably do like I did before,'' Johnson said. ``He came
back and threw pretty good, so we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Short hops: Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, felled
by illness Friday in Seattle, was examined by Dr. Michael Mellman
because his condition has not improved. Johnson said it's unlikely
Grudzielanek will play tonight. . . . Gary Sheffield and Kevin
Brown were excused from the workout because they played in
Tuesday's All-Star Game. . . . The fines of coaches Rick Dempsey,
Glenn Hoffman and John Shelby were each reduced from $5,000 to
$3,000 for their part in the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field.

 SPERMICIDE INCREASED HIV INFECTIONS  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ It was the worst of outcomes for a
clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of protecting women against the AIDS virus, a
contraceptive gel being tested as a chemical shield against HIV
caused a higher rate of infection in the women who used it.
</P>
<P>
   The disastrous results, released Wednesday at the 13th
International AIDS Conference, have put an end to hopes that a
commonly used spermicide, nonoxynol-9, could be quickly put into
action as a ``microbicide,'' which could be applied before sex to
kill HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Underwritten by the United Nations, the carefully designed study
was set up in four countries in 1996 to settle the question of
whether nonoxynol-9 could become the first HIV microbicide _ a
dream AIDS prevention product sometimes called the ``chemical
condom.''
</P>
<P>
   But when researchers completed the study and examined their
data, they were shocked to discover that the women who used the gel
had a 52 percent higher infection rate. Fears that nonoxynol-9
would cause irritation and tiny tears in the vaginal wall, creating
a gateway for HIV, appeared to be well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are a serious setback. I think this may be the
end of nonoxynol-9 as a microbicide,'' said Dr. Lut Van Damme, who
led the research effort from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in
Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that other clinical trials of the
microbicide may have to be halted for the participants' safety and
raise questions about promoting the product in family planning
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are also worried about use of the chemical in sexual
lubricants. Gay men in the United States had been buying such
products in the belief that nonoxynol-9 might protect them from
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Paxton, a microbicide expert at the federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, said that gay men should no longer use
lubricants with nonoxynol-9. ``I think we really need to get the
word out about this UNAIDS study,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects for an AIDS vaccine a distant dream, and
prevention education programs failing to stem Africa's soaring
infection rates, researchers have been searching for a microbicide
that would give women the means to protect themselves from the
virus. Hopes were riding high on nonoxynol-9 because it was already
on the market as a contraceptive and had a long-established track
record as a safe product.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helen Rees, director of the South African equivalent of the
Food and Drug Administration, was bitterly disappointed. ``My
bottom line is that, if you are using nonoxynol-9 for HIV
prevention, you are wasting your money, and you may be wasting your
life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Perriens, who has headed up UNAIDS efforts to develop
a microbicide program since 1993, and other microbicide experts
said they hoped the results of the test will not discourage
research in the field. In fact, they believe that the trial
findings add urgency to efforts under way to test other products
specifically designed to be HIV microbicides. None has received
marketing approval, but there are 34 candidate products in the
testing pipeline. The only products in advanced, large-scale trials
of the kind needed for regulatory approval, however, involve
nonoxynol-9.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAIDS trial used a product marketed under the trade name
Advantage-S by Columbia Laboratories, of Miami. The four-year trial
involved 990 prostitutes living in six cities, including Durban and
Johannesburg, South Africa; Hat Yai and Bangkok, Thailand; Cotonou,
Benin; and Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
   Women were divided into two groups, one receiving packets
containing Advantage S, the other a vaginal moisturizer containing
no nonoxynol-9, to serve as a placebo. The women were given free
condoms and extensive counseling to use them every time. But they
were not told whether the gel they were using contained the
microbicide or was merely the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   When the results were unsealed in May, researchers were stunned
to find the infection rate for women using the microbicide was 15.5
percent; while the rate of infection among women using the placebo
was 10.2 percent. Further analysis showed that women using
Advantage S had 46 percent more vaginal lesions, small cuts or
sores that could have been caused by the gels.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Levine, research director for Columbia Laboratories, said
he felt the UNAIDS researchers were jumping the gun, basing their
conclusions of the first look at early data. He noted that some of
the prostitutes in the study used the product as much as 20 times a
day, far more than the four applications a day that was envisioned
as the typical usage rate for sex workers.
</P>
<P>
   Testing on prostitutes created a ``worst case scenario'' to
evaluate the product, said Levine. Further analysis of the data is
needed to find out whether the HIV infections were confined to the
heaviest users of the microbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Padian, director of an international AIDS research program
at the University of California at San Francisco, had special
reasons to be disappointed. She was just about to launch a
nonoxynol-9 microbicide trial in Zimbabwe, involving about 1,200
women. Now, it is doubtful that trial will continue, until a new
microbicide candidate is found. ``I think the results of the
(UNAIDS) trial were pretty convincing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of nonoxynol-9 is already shifting attention to
alternative products now being tested. The three most promising are
a product called Pro 2000, under development by the New York-based
Population Council; another called ``buffer gel,'' which controls
the acidity of the vagina; and a chemical called dextrin sulfate,
which blocks the virus from penetrating cells.

FATAL CRASHES OFTEN INVOLVE UNLICENSED MOTORISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty-two percent of California drivers involved
in fatal crashes had suspended or revoked licenses - or none at
all, according an unprecedented study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And one-fifth of all crashes nationwide involved at least one
driver without a proper license, according to the study by the
American Automobile Association's Foundation for Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is a very real safety problem - 8,000 people a year
are killed in unlicensed-driver crashes,'' said Stephanie Faul, AAA
Foundation spokeswoman. ``These are happening quietly, like a
hidden epidemic. It's a significant threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``Unlicensed to Kill,'' examined the
correlation between unlicensed drivers and fatal crashes in the
United States from 1993 to 1997. It found that drivers who never
had licenses, or lost them in court, continue driving anyway and
get into a disproportionate number of deadly crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not people who are normally law-abiding and let
their licenses lapse,'' Faul said. ``Some of them are just
awe-inspiring in their venal idiocy.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County is home to more than 300,000 drivers with
suspended or revoked licenses, according to the Automobile Club of
Southern California. That's 6 percent of all the drivers in the
county - a figure that mirrors the state's percentage of drivers
with suspended or revoked privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't that people become bad drivers after their
licenses are taken away. They were dangerous drivers to begin with,
and lost their licenses because of that behavior, yet still hit the
road - ignoring their punishment and endangering others with their
recklessness, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Faul cited one example of a man who tried to steal a car from an
auto showroom. When police arrived, he stole a patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out he didn't have a license,'' Faul said. ``Well,
what a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   And another concern for law-abiding drivers: people who don't
have licenses usually don't have insurance, either, said Sgt.
Richard Rinker of the Los Angeles Police Department's Central
Traffic Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have the foresight to have uninsured motorist
coverage, if one of these people hits you, you're basically out of
luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that in many cases, investigators can't tell the
license status of drivers involved in crashes, because they take
off before officers arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roughly 50 (percent) to 60 percent of all our traffic
accidents are hit-and-run. We believe that a large portion of these
are a number of things,'' he said, such as drivers who are
intoxicated, who have a suspended or revoked license, or who never
had one at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to the AAA report, California trailed only New Mexico,
Arizona, the District of Columbia and Hawaii in the percentage of
improperly licensed drivers involved in fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as simple as saying California has worse drivers,''
said Steve Bloch, senior traffic safety researcher for the
Automobile Club of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since California has a very high DUI arrest rate per capita,
compared to other states, the state also suspends or revokes a
large number of licenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch noted California has 20 percent of the drunk-driving
arrests in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these drivers continue to drive with invalid
licenses,'' he said. ``We take them in, revoke or suspend their
licenses and suddenly we have a new problem: revoked or suspended
drivers on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a woman driving with a suspended license in North
Hollywood crashed into a parked truck and killed her 7-year-old
son, police said. Lynn Julian, 30, is scheduled for arraignment
today on charges of murder, gross vehicular manslaughter while
intoxicated and two other counts in connection with the July 5
crash.
</P>
<P>
   And a man whose license had been suspended for failing to appear
in court killed a Van Nuys pedestrian in April when he lost control
of his Ford Explorer during an epileptic seizure, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA Foundation recommended three ways of dealing with
drivers whose licenses have been suspended or revoked: impounding
their cars, installing ignition interlocks for DUI drivers and
installing electronic driver licenses. But each approach has its
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic licenses would force drivers to insert them in a
reader before starting the car. A computer would check records for
that license to determine whether the driver is restricted because
of age, criminal record or other factors. An on-board computer
could also chart speed and location, but such information would
surely raise privacy concerns, the Foundation report said. In
addition, the system would need further safeguards to ensure a teen
without a license didn't borrow dad's to go on a joy ride, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   California impounds 100,000 cars every year, Bloch said, but
some jurisdictions don't take that tactic at all. And, Faul noted,
what happens if the state impounds the car because of what dad did,
but that leaves mom and the kids with no way to get to work or
school?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a tremendous negative social impact on the
family by taking away their transportation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ignition interlock is a device that DUI offenders must
breathe into before starting their cars, to check their
blood-alcohol levels. Starting in 1994, California required that
the measure be used for multiple DUI offenders - but Bloch said
judges imposed the measure in only about 15 percent of cases. He
said that should increase, as a new law allows DUI offenders to
shave time off their suspensions if they use the device.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA Foundation report concluded that unlicensed drivers are
about five times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than
licensed drivers. With their figures in hand, Faul said,
researchers now must examine success stories in some states and
figure out how best to enforce license suspensions and revocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes, What can you do to keep them off the
road?'' Faul said. ``We need to find a way to deal with that.''

PROTEST ORGANIZERS READY FOR MASS ARRESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protest organizers said Wednesday that they are urging peaceful
demonstrations during next month's Democratic National Convention
but said they were prepared for mass arrests and that they can't
rule out vandalism and property damage.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 activists gathered outside Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles also said they were afraid of coming under attack from
police officers during the Aug. 14-17 event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that no one will be attacking anyone,'' said
community activist Margaret Prescod, a member of the D2KLA protest
coalition, which organized the news conference. ``We are not hoping
for violence just to prove a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Horace Frank of the Los Angeles Police Department said
officers would do everything to enforce the law - including
arresting activists who block traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they engage in violations of the law, they're going to be
arrested,'' said Frank, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone ``chooses to break the law, to engage in decadent and
criminal activity, we as a law enforcement agency have a duty to
respond appropriately and accordingly,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Prescod decried the ``show that the
police put on'' Monday in San Pedro where baton-wielding officers
engaged in exercises on breaking up hostile crowds. The event was
part of training for 2,000 LAPD officers who will be deployed
during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sends the message to us that they intend to (incite) a
situation like that,'' Prescod said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said police would do everything to maintain the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to further peace and harmony, not to incite
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Jia Ching Chen said he plans to engage in nonviolent
protest but that doesn't preclude destructive acts such as throwing
a brick through a restaurant window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that property destruction is violent,'' said
Chen, a member of D2KLA and Just Act: Youth Action for Global
Justice, who added that he did not advocate such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizer Shawn McDougal cited D2KLA's ``Action
Guidelines,'' a training manual for demonstrators that prohibits
vandalism except in certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not destroy property, excepting at barricades erected
to prevent us from exercising our freedoms of speech and
assembly,'' said McDougal of the American Friends Service
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said D2KLA is helping plan and coordinate activists
who will demonstrate on behalf of myriad causes during the coming
convention. They oppose global trade and its impact on the poor and
the environment in Third World nations and will advocate legal
relief for immigrants in danger of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank, the (International Monetary Fund), the (World
Trade Organization), the roles that they play in shaping global
trade impact all of us, whether you live in Los Angeles or
Mozambique,'' Chen said.

   FIFTY YEARS AFTER HEROIC BATTLE, AFRICAN AMERICAN GIs GET THEIR 
 MONUMENT 
 &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SOMMOCOLONIA, Italy _ When a massive German assault was
launched on this windswept mountain village in December 1944, a
scant two platoons of American infantrymen were dug in here. Their
own commanding officers expected them to throw down their guns and
run.
<P>
   But for 20 critical hours, the tiny complement of 70 &QL; 
GIs _ all of them black, from the U.S. Army's segregated 92nd
Infantry Division _ held out against an offensive that might have
changed the course of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Then they vanished, almost completely, from the war's official
records.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken five decades of stubborn efforts by the battle's
few survivors, and 20 years of research by a Bay Area woman who
accidentally stumbled onto their tale, to fill in the empty page in
that history.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they will reassemble in Sommocolonia, northwest of
Florence, to dedicate a ``peace park'' to the memory of their lost
comrades in the presence of U.S. diplomats and Italian dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Put bluntly, the park is also a monument to American racial
bigotry at a moment when the U.S. Army was waging war against Adolf
Hitler's racist ideology and dreams of world domination.
</P>
<P>
   A mile to the north of Sommocolonia was the forward encampment
of the German 14th Army, which had been instructed not to take
prisoners from the 92nd Division because its soldiers were black _
and, by official Nazi standards, not fully human.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles to the south was the command post of the American
Fifth Army, which refused to provide either reinforcements for the
besieged troops in Sommocolonia or blood transfusions for their
wounded. They were black, and by official U.S. Army standards in
World War II, not fully soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, if you were not white, you had to fight on two
fronts at once,'' says former Maj. Otis Zachary of Carson (Los
Angeles County) a veteran of the battle. ``One against the Nazis,
and another against the mentality of your own superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   One black veteran of World War II combat operations in Italy
welcomed the U.S. government's belated recognition of the ``Buffalo
Soldiers'' _ the name given to the all-black 92nd Infantry
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that honors black American soldiers in Italy is
important,'' said former Capt. Harry Cox of Mill Valley, who served
with the 92nd.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a real estate broker, said his battalion was stationed in
Italy in December 1944 but did not fight at Sommocolonia. His
battalion was pulled back from the front a few days before the
battle took place.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Christmas 1944, the black GIs in Sommocolonia
were determined to prove that official assumptions, German and
American alike, were wrong. Most of them were dead 24 hours later,
and all but forgotten by their own country within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the U.S. Army is among America's most successfully
integrated institutions, with black officers at the highest level.
But in 1944, racism in the Army was astonishingly crude,
government-sanctioned policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military had become an extension of the Southern political
system because of its close ties to Southern congressmen who
controlled military appropriations, and because a large number of
the senior white officers in the Army were Southerners,'' former
92nd Infantry Capt. Dennette A. Harrod Sr. recalled in a 1992
speech at the U.S. Army War College.
</P>
<P>
   If black soldiers were wounded in action and required emergency
blood transfusions, only the plasma of other black soldiers could
be used to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The segregated units in which the majority of black enlistees
served were commanded by whites, many of whom regarded their men
with contempt and limited them to duty as gravediggers or mess hall
workers.  &LR;   &LR;  ``I did not send for you,'' Gen. Edmund Almond, the
white commandant of the 92nd Division told his African American
junior officers after their disembarkation in Italy. ``Your Negro
newspapers, Negro politicians and white friends have insisted on
your seeing combat, and I shall see that you get combat and your
share of casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   If a black unit became undermanned, white GIs could not be sent
to reinforce it. When the 92nd Division was so depleted by losses
that it could no longer be sent into combat, it was combined with
the all-Japanese American 442nd Infantry Regiment in what was
dismissively referred to as ``the Rainbow Division.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1944, the Allies had developed formidable new
weapons and motorized vehicles to confront the Wehrmacht. But the
92nd Infantry might have been fighting a war in the Middle Ages or
earlier, transporting their ammunition and supplies on the backs of
372 mules purchased from Italian peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of your educational training and background, you
were considered less intelligent, less trustworthy and incapable of
functioning on a level equal to that of whites,'' said Harrod.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 1 million black soldiers served in World War II.
Among those who saw combat, nearly a quarter were killed or
wounded. They captured twice as many enemy troops as their own
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the official books were closed on the war effort, not a
single African American had been presented with the Congressional
Medal of Honor, the nation's highest commendation for valor. Black
soldiers, the conventional wisdom ran, had ``melted away'' during
major offensives.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase came from an offhand remark in 1945 by Truman Gibson,
the War Department's special assistant on Negro Affairs. For half a
century, his words were the standard assessment of African American
military performance in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Solace Wales and her husband, Bill Sheets, two artists from
Kentfield in Marin County, bought a house in Sommocolonia in 1973.
Set on the edge of a cliff at 2,200 feet above sea level, it is a
landscape painter's dream and a soldier's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   From her kitchen window, Wales looks out over an enormous vista
of craggy granite peaks that frame the 35-mile-long Serchio Valley,
where the 92nd Infantry fought its way north 56 years ago. Cutting
sharply through two precipitous mountain ranges, the valley was a
key stretch of the ``Gothic Line,'' the principal German defensive
bulwark in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering around on a hilltop above her home one day, Wales
happened onto a low stone marker. ``John Fox, U.S. Army Lieutenant,
Dec. 26, 1944,'' it read in Italian. The marker had been erected by
the village authorities and stood next to the graves of
anti-Fascist Italian Partisans who died in Sommocolonia.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, Wales asked a neighbor about Fox. ``He was one of the
black Americans who died here back in the war,'' came the reply.
``They almost all died, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, wondered Wales, was there no American monument to Fox and
his comrades? What had happened to them?
</P>
<P>
   The short conversation set her on a two-decade search for
answers. She started with the other villagers, gradually
interviewing anyone who was old enough to remember the war and
tape-recording their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fox and the 92nd Infantry took hold of Solace
Wales. Slowly, she began to piece it together.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 26, 1944, John Fox was awakened at 4 a.m. by the sound
of mortar fire and rushed to his position on the Sommocolonia
hilltop, where he served as an artillery spotter. As dawn broke
over the mountains, the 29-year-old lieutenant saw that the streets
below him were swarming with troops.
</P>
<P>
   They were Austrian infantrymen from the elite Fourth Mountain
Battalion, the forward edge of a offensive that was to throw
elements of six Axis divisions at U.S. Army detachments in the
Serchio Valley. The poorly equipped and thinly supported 92nd was
expected to pose no obstacle to the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, the Wehrmacht hoped to retake the strategic port of
Livorno, 40 miles miles south of Sommocolonia. If successful, they
would have choked off supplies to the Allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., Sommocolonia was the scene of bloody, hand-to-hand
fighting. The 70 black GIs and 25 Italian Partisans who joined them
knew they could not turn back the offensive. But they could slow it
down.
</P>
<P>
   An order came to retreat at noon. ``Get the hell out of there,''
a U.S. Army captain in the nearby city of Barga radioed Lt. Graham
Jenkins, Fox's fellow officer in Sommocolonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get me some ammunition,'' Jenkins radioed back.
</P>
<P>
   The men in Sommocolonia fought on until more than two-thirds of
them were dead or wounded. The Austrians began torching houses
where wounded GIs lay, shooting them as they tried to escape from
the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins radioed his final message to the captain in Barga:
``They're coming after us. Please, when you get back to the States,
tell my wife and my kid and my mother that I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Austrians closed in to kill Jenkins, who had no
ammunition left, he was trying to comfort a badly wounded GI, a
survivor reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was how it was with `the master race' of Nazism,'' said
villager Bonafede Moscardini, who was 13 when he watched the battle
explode around him. ``They weren't about to show mercy to these
black soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   From his observation post, which was now surrounded by enemy
troops, Fox telephoned in artillery coordinates that moved closer
and closer to his own position. No one who saw what happened at the
end survived, but several men at 92nd headquarters overheard Fox's
last call.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for a smoke screen to cover a withdrawal by the handful
of GIs and Partisans who could still walk. Then he ordered a heavy
concentration of mortar and 105mm shells on the surrounded
observation post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox, that will be right on you. I can't do that,'' the
artillery officer at headquarters yelled into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire it!'' Fox yelled back.`
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, the Austrians rounded up villagers who had
hidden in cellars during the battle and forced them to leave
Sommocolonia. The village priest recalled seeing the body of Fox
next to his observation post, with the corpses of more than 100
Austrians around him.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 95 American and Italian Partisan defenders of
Sommocolonia, 18 made it alive to U.S. Fifth Army lines.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the German offensive sputtered to a halt, and
by January 1, Sommocolonia was firmly back in Allied hands.
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years, Solace Wales had no idea that anyone had
survived the battle. Back in the States, she had tried to broaden
her research in U.S. Army archives but found nothing in the
official records, not even a list of the men who had died at
Sommocolonia. The Italians remembered them, but as far as
Washington was concerned, Fox and Jenkins and their men had simply
melted away.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Zachary knew otherwise. The events of Dec. 26, 1944, were
burned into his memory. He had been one of John Fox's closest
friends. They had trained together in Massachusetts in 1942 and
shipped out on the same transport for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the man on the other end of Fox's last phone call, a
gunner so adroit, according to 92nd Infantry lore, that he could
``lay artillery on a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Zachary the officer understood that the targeting at
Sommocolonia was Fox's decision. He had called and said, ``I want
everything you've got put on my coordinates,'' and Zachary had
refused until he was ordered by a colonel to do what Fox asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Zachary the man, Fox's oldest friend in the Army, was
tormented by the belief that that his shells had killed Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like that happens, you go half nuts,'' he told
Solace Wales half a century later. ``A lot of things still come
back to me at night, so that I can't sleep for thinking about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other 92nd vets, widows and children _ notably Fox's
wife, Arlene, and their daughter Sandra _ who were haunted by the
story and couldn't let it rest. For five decades they pounded at
the Pentagon's door, demanding that the record be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The response was always the same: The official book on World War
II honors had been closed in 1952. Only an Act of Congress could
reopen it.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary and the others were working people, raising families and
struggling to make ends meet. But they found the time, somehow, to
keep the effort going. They petitioned their legislators. They
harassed the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   They grew old, and some of them died, while the story remained
in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Solace Wales finally discovered the existence of a 92nd
Infantry veteran's group, and contacted its president. He put her
in touch with Otis Zachary.
</P>
<P>
   The white woman who wanted to bring John Fox's story back to
life met the black artillery officer who was haunted by his death.
</P>
<P>
   Wales told Zachary what she had learned from the people of
Sommocolonia. How they had virtually nothing except chestnuts to
eat in the bitter winter of '44, until the black GIs arrived and
shared their rations. She translated the villagers' account of the
last hours of Fox and his men.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the effort to reopen the records, driven relentlessly
forward by Fox's widow and surviving comrades, was finally
attracting attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was attentive to black concerns. The
rise to prominence of an African American general, former Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, increased the pressure
on Capitol Hill, and Congress agreed to reopen the books.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, 1997, John Fox and six other black Americans were
presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, almost 56 years after they died, the black soldiers
who defended Sommocolonia will at long last be honored where they
fell by their own nation, in a joint ceremony presided over by the
village mayor and U.S. diplomats. Otis Zachary and Solace Wales
will both be there.

STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ROLLS OUT MONETARY INCENTIVES
FOR  IMPROVED PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By NANETTE ASIMOV 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banking on the idea that people will do almost anything for
money _ even raise student test scores _ the California Board of
Education announced Wednesday that it will pay $150 per student to
schools that meet academic performance goals.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in low-scoring schools that make great leaps forward
could earn as much as $25,000 each as a reward for their classroom
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Even janitors can win big in California's new ``if you pay them,
they will learn'' system. They, along with school secretaries and
every other school employee, could receive at least some financial
bonus if schools make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards come from three pools of money totaling $677
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win, win, win, win program for schools, teachers,
students and the community,'' said Doug Stone, spokesman for state
Superintendent Delaine Eastin, who Wednesday evening was still
ensconced in the board meeting where the awards were announced.
``Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But we're moving in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing on the rewards and the criteria for winning them,
California joins 14 states that have recently decided to use money
to encourage academic progress.
</P>
<P>
   California's rewards will be based on results from the Stanford
9 achievement test, due out Monday. More than 4 million students in
grades 2 to 11 took the multiple-choice exam in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be November before an announcement is made as to
which schools and teachers actually get the money, the 11-member
state board decided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reward system falls under the state's Public Schools
Accountability Act of 1999, a broad effort by state educators,
lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis to jump-start student achievement.
California, which was once seen as an example of educational
progress in the nation, sank in the 1990s like the temperature on a
cold day.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians blamed a popular educational approach at the time
that generally ignored basic phonics, grammar lessons and strong
math standards. The late 1990s saw a return to such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   California's exam, now in its third year, emphasizes such
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters in the state's new accountability system
for schools is whether students improve from one year to the
next,'' said Ann Bancroft, a spokeswoman for Davis' education
secretary, Sue Burr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action by the state board means that schools meeting
their annual goals for improvement will be rewarded for their focus
and achievement with significant new discretionary funds.''
</P>
<P>
   But the test being used to divvy up California's public
education dollars has been criticized by some, including a San
Francisco-based parent's group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Bonsteel, president of California Parents for
Educational Choice, contends that the Stanford 9 achievement test
should not dictate state spending because the test results reveal
very little about how students are actually doing in school.
</P>
<P>
   He has attacked the test for two main reasons: the widespread
availability of test questions, and disparities over the percentage
of eligible students who are tested.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that most of this year's test questions were repeated
from the previous two years and that old copies of the test are
easily obtained by teachers. He also insists that the state has
failed to audit what he calls the ``phony'' claims of individual
school districts about the number of eligible students taking the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Awards for schools will come from a $227 million pool and will
be known as the Governor's Performance Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Schools hoping to win $150 per pupil have to meet three
criteria:
</P>
<P>
   -- Test scores must rise by a specific amount from one year to
the next. Each year, the state's testing experts will assign a
numeric value to each school based on its scores. A value of 800 is
considered excellent. Schools must improve by 5 percent of the
difference between its own value and 800. (Schools that have
already achieved an 800 must improve by at least 1 point.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Each ethnic group within a school must also raise its scores,
but only by 80 percent of what the school as a whole must achieve.
</P>
<P>
   -- In elementary and middle schools, 95 percent of students
eligible to take the test must do so. In high schools, there has to
be a 90 percent participation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Padia, a testing director at the state Department of
Education, said rates for high school students are more lenient for
a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high school participation rate now is abysmally low,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to entice more teenagers to take the test, he said,
the board will slowly ratchet up the high school rate requirement,
possibly making it 92 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   A second pool of money, $350 million, will be used to give a
bonus to every staff member at schools that win performance awards.
The actual amount going to each janitor, classroom aide, secretary,
teacher and principal is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million will be divided by the total number of
employees in each winning school. Half of the money will be divvied
up among employees and the other half will go into the budget of
each school's governing council.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that have no governing council ``might want to form
one,'' Padia said.
</P>
<P>
   The final pool of money, $100 million, will provide teachers
with bonuses of $5,000, $10,000, even $25,000 if their schools meet
a stringent set of requirements. The bonuses are only for teachers
who work in schools that score in the bottom half on the state
test.
</P>
<P>
   To win the bonus, a teacher's school, in addition to meeting all
criteria listed above, must improve by 10 percent, rather than the
5 percent required for schools overall. The school's test scores
must also have risen two years in a row, rather than just one.
</P>
<P>
   Among this group, 1,000 teachers at schools showing the most
gains will win $25,000. After that, 3,750 teachers will each win
$10,000, and 7,500 teachers will get the $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Padia estimates that about 60 percent of schools could win the
basic $150-per-pupil windfall. It is harder to estimate the other
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many schools will get the $25,000,'' he said.

LOS ANGELES ON GROUND FLOOR OF XFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are you ready for some, some . . . football?
</P>
<P>
   Or at least a version dreamed up in the wild imagination of the
World Wrestling Federation's Vince McMahon? A testosterone-juiced,
cameras-and-microphones-go-anywhere, damn-the-rules, smash-mouth,
renegade kind of football promised by McMahon's XFL?
</P>
<P>
   Snicker if you like, but McMahon's newest creation gained
significant credibility when NBC signed on as a 50 percent partner
and agreed to broadcast its games during prime time on Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McMahon &AMP; Co. officially made Los Angeles one of
the XFL's eight inaugural teams, named the Coliseum as its site and
J.K. ``Don't Call Me John'' McKay as the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, on hand for the press event at the
House of Blues, said when he took over as president of the Coliseum
Commission he promised to bring professional football back to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not necessarily what I had in mind at the time, but it
will do,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, who is nothing if not a good quote, promised a high-
entertainment style of football, stopping just short of calling it
the anti-NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrogance and lack of common sense of the suits that run
the NFL not to have a franchise here in Los Angeles, the
second-largest market in the country, is not to be believed,''
McMahon said. ``It is downright insulting to the local populace.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon decried the ``corporate culture'' of the NFL, said it
was overregulated and promised to give fans a new viewing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL has turned its nose up at McMahon's latest venture,
NBC was quick to pay close attention. Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC
Sports, has noted McMahon's WWF has had ``incredible success'' in
reaching the most elusive audience in television _ young males. In
head-to-head competition last season, McMahon's WWF on the USA
Network outdrew ABC's Monday Night Football among young adult
males, ages 12-24, by 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, meet your new partner.
</P>
<P>
   NBC brings legitimacy to a venture many have been naturally
skeptical about. For all its stunning success, the WWF is a staged
and scripted event with a loose connection to sports. The natural
fear is a similar fate awaits football in the XFL, but its
supporters claim it will be old-fashioned football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about athleticism, first and foremost,'' McMahon
said. ``We have to have integrity in the game that we play.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon promised tickets will run from $22 to $25. The league's
three-month season starts in February and ends with its title game
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start in the worst weather there is, the way the game
should be played _ in the snow, in the mud and the ice,'' McMahon
said. ``We're in Chicago in February at Chicago Field playing
football. That's cool. Wait a minute, that's cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The XFL teams will have local management, not ownership. As with
Major League Soccer, all teams will be owned by the XFL. Five games
will be played at the Coliseum. There will be no exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you get the (NFL) season tickets is to buy the
damn exhibition games,'' McMahon said. ``Wow, that is a racket and
a half the NFL has. That's real (bull). The way they treat their
fans is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay, the former USC star who later played in the NFL and with
the Southern California Sun in the World Football League, had been
part of the failed Ed Roski Jr. group that lobbied for two years to
bring an NFL team to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   His brother is the general manager at Tampa Bay and he had hoped
to be the GM of the new expansion team at the Coliseum. McKay said
any doubts over the league and its staying power was eliminated
when he met its principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to have the best players, the best coaches and to
present the best product we possibly can,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   McKay said he hopes to name a coach within the month. A team
nickname and logo might also be announced by the league by then.
McKay said the XFL will draft players the league signs in October.
</P>
<P>
   Basil DeVito, XFL president, said the league will not compete
with the NFL in salaries but will be the second-highest-paying
league in the world. He said all players will receive a base salary
and will split a $100,000 bonus for each game their teams win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players in the XFL will be paid to play, but they will be
played more to win,'' DeVito said.
</P>
<P>
   Said McMahon: ``It's the American way.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels finished the first half of
the season at 47-41, exceeding the expectations of many people.
They are in the AL West race, five games behind the first-place
Mariners and two games behind the A's, who lead the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no celebrating, no consumption of champagne during
the All-Star break. There was only pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be pleased if we were in first place, but I wouldn't be
satisfied,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``It's like getting a
quarter of the way through a pizza. It tastes good, but you know
it's not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is in his rookie season as manager and is a candidate
for AL Manager of the Year. Second baseman Adam Kennedy and catcher
Bengie Molina are candidates for Rookie of the Year. Troy Glaus
made the All-Star team at age 23 and is halfway to 50 homers. Darin
Erstad, at age 26, leads the majors in hits.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the corps of young starting pitchers, without
whom the Angels would be looking down the barrel of another
disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Scott Schoeneweis is the oldest of a young and talented
group of pitchers that includes Jarrod Washburn (25), Brian Cooper
(25), Seth Etherton (23) and Ramon Ortiz (24).
</P>
<P>
   All five have spent time this season in the minors or on the
disabled list or both. But combined, they are 19-13. By comparison,
veterans Tim Belcher, Ken Hill and Kent Bottenfield are a combined
12-14.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is on the disabled list and might not make it back. Hill
is always a pitch away from another trip to the DL. That leaves
Bottenfield as the Angels' only real candidate to be that veteran
pitcher needed to lead the staff in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is really looking for a starting pitcher who can
step up and be a consistent guy and go out every fifth day and
pitch into the seventh, eighth and ninth inning,'' Scioscia said.
``Certainly Bottenfield has the makeup of a guy who can do that. I
think you'll see other guys follow suit and that will allow this
club to reach its potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have hit 141 homers and are on their way to breaking
the club record of 192 set in 1996. But Scioscia says the offense
doesn't revolve around the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, there's still an upside from where we are now,''
he said. ``We're certainly not expecting more home runs, but we're
expecting to maximize run production better.''
</P>
<P>
   !dlim!Following is a first-half analysis with a look toward the
second half:
</P>
<P>
   --Manager _ In half a season, Scioscia has made the Angels
clubhouse the happiest place on earth. He commands respect, demands
hard work from his players and yet is approachable. With the help
of coaching staff, Scioscia is as prepared as any manager in the
game. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   --First base _ Mo Vaughn finally has the opportunity to show the
organization what he can do when healthy. His .302 average, 23
homers and team-leading 68 RBI only tell half the story. Vaughn is
the clubhouse leader everybody expected him to be, having the
ability to pat a teammate on the back or kick him in the pants when
the situation calls for it. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   --Second base _ Kennedy has shown flashes of offensive
excellence, highlighted by an eight-RBI game in Toronto in April.
However, like any rookie, Kennedy is still searching to find a
level of consistency. He has been shaky defensively but is
improving. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   --Shortstop _ Gary DiSarcina is out for the season with a
shoulder injury, and the Angels have used Benji Gil and Kevin
Stocker as fill-ins. Stocker, if healthy, will get most of the
starts in the second half. Gil got most of the first-half starts
and began slowly but has improved both offensively and defensively
in the past few weeks. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   --Third base _ Glaus is hitting .293 with 25 homers and 60 RBI.
Except for a 1-for-29 slump late in the first half, he has been
consistent. A tired shoulder has contributed to a number of
throwing errors, but he is as good with the glove as any third
baseman in the league. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   --Left field _ Erstad is batting .384 with 17 homers and 66 RBI,
and with 144 hits is on a pace for 265, which would break George
Sisler's major-league mark of 257. He is the club's MVP of the
first half. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   --Center field _ Garret Anderson leads the club with 26 home
runs and is third on the club with 65 RBI. That's the upside. The
downside is Anderson, a career .300 hitter going into the season,
is hitting .246. He also needs to improve defensively by getting
better jumps on the ball off the bat. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   --Right field _ Tim Salmon is still the club's cleanup hitter,
but with 48 RBI, ranks fifth on the team. His 18 homers are fourth
on the team and his .265 average is considerably below his .291
lifetime average going into the season. Many observers believe
Salmon has lost a step defensively. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   --DH _ Scioscia has used the DH spot as a semi-day off for his
regulars, inserting primarily Scott Spiezio or Orlando Palmeiro
into the lineup. Palmeiro has been a solid on-base guy, hitting
.299. Spiezio provides occasional pop with eight homers and 25 RBI.
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   --Starting pitching _ No starter has more than five victories,
but as a group they have kept the team in games enough to keep the
Angels in the race. Hill and Belcher have been hurt too much to
make significant contributions. Bottenfield has been inconsistent.
But the young pitchers have given the team reason to be optimistic
about the future. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   --Middle relief _ Al Levine, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Mark
Petkovsek have been huge in bridging the game from the starters to
closer Troy Percival. Hasegawa's six wins lead the team. Levine has
an ERA of 3.19 serving as a starter, long man, set-up man and
closer (two saves). Petkovsek has bounced back from an illness to
pitch in 30 games, fourth most on the team. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   --Closer _ Percival has saved 20 and blown five. He constantly
seems to be adjusting mechanics, but when he's right he's almost
unhittable. Still, the club could not have hoped for more
considering he is coming off shoulder surgery. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   --Bench _ Palmeiro and Spiezio have been valuable, as has backup
catcher Matt Walbeck. However, Edgard Clemente is struggling in his
role as a bench player, and overall Angels pinch-hitters are
batting only .158 with no homers and one RBI. Grade: C

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels finished the first half of
the season at 47-41, exceeding the expectations of many people.
They are in the AL West race, five games behind the first-place
Mariners and two games behind the A's, who lead the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no celebrating, no consumption of champagne during
the All-Star break. There was only pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be pleased if we were in first place, but I wouldn't be
satisfied,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``It's like getting a
quarter of the way through a pizza. It tastes good, but you know
it's not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is in his rookie season as manager and is a candidate
for AL Manager of the Year. Second baseman Adam Kennedy and catcher
Bengie Molina are candidates for Rookie of the Year. Troy Glaus
made the All-Star team at age 23 and is halfway to 50 homers. Darin
Erstad, at age 26, leads the majors in hits.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the corps of young starting pitchers, without
whom the Angels would be looking down the barrel of another
disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Scott Schoeneweis is the oldest of a young and talented
group of pitchers that includes Jarrod Washburn (25), Brian Cooper
(25), Seth Etherton (23) and Ramon Ortiz (24).

is always a pitch away from another trip to the DL. That leaves

MOSS HASN'T FORGOTTEN HIS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Randy Moss caught a ball of a different
kind Wednesday. The 6-foot-4 Minnesota Vikings wide receiver
debuted in basketball's Summer Pro League with a solid showing at
the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Moss scored 13 points in 18 minutes. His team, Pro Advantage,
beat KMPC 110-92.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict on his play: Don't punch that NBA ticket too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got quick feet and is a good athlete,'' said Walter
Szczerbiak Sr., a former professional player and father of Wally
Szczerbiak of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Szczerbiak also scouts for the professional leagues
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he didn't play college ball,'' Szczerbiak said
of Moss' game. ``He looked like a lot of good players playing in
the free-agent division.''
</P>
<P>
   That division includes players who were not invited to play in
the summer league by NBA teams. Most of the players have played
overseas, in the CBA or have been out of the game and are hoping to
catch someone's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Moss will be playing again today at 12:45 as part of the team
Passing Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he has basketball skills,'' said Don Sellers,
an assistant coach with the Trenton Shooting Stars in the
International Basketball League. Sellers will be coaching Moss
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a guy that could make the transition successfully
into the minor leagues (of basketball),'' Sellers said. ``I don't
know if he could be an NBA player, but he could definitely be a
good minor-leaguer. I was impressed with his defense and his feel
for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss twice was West Virginia High School Basketball Player of
the Year at DuPont High in Rand, West Va., where he was a teammate
of Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, another
summer-league participant, also is a long shot because he is an
undersized power forward at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's undersized for what he does,'' said Rob Babcock of the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a two-sport athlete at Cal, scored 15 points on 4-of-6
shooting and a perfect 7 of 7 from the free-throw line. His team,
Nutriola, defeated Olimpia Milano 122-80.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has about a week until he leaves for training camp with
the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kobe's team in town: Kobe Bryant's team, Olimpia Milano,
began play on Wednesday with its loss to Nutriola. The team is
owned 50- percent by Bryant and his father, Joe Bryant, a former
NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Olimpia Milano faces the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Of note: Seattle SuperSonics guard Shammond Williams
continues to play well. He had 23 points in a 109-82 win over the
Portland Trail Blazers. He's averaging 26 points over four games so
far. Point guard Kedrick Johnson had 22 points, eight rebounds and
seven assists against Olimpia Milano. Johnson played last season in
Australia . . . Dallas Maverick Dirk Nowitzki has also shown well,
scoring 29 in a loss to Golden State. He had 24 in his only other
game. Dallas draft pick Courtney Alexander is averaging 19.5 and
Etan Thomas is averaging 19 points.

Some of his colleagues believe his daily intake of the stuff,

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTH LEBANON _ Was this what victory was for? Was
this why the Hezbollah fighters lost their hundreds of ``martyrs''
in their 18-year conflict with Israel and its Lebanese militia
allies? To blow up a war memorial? It stood atop a hill within
sight of Israel, the foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to
defend. Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for
their country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men. But
most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into joining the
militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would have been
imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in Lebanon....By

Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. On the very

   SREBRENICA, BOSNIA _ ``I will never forget this place,'' said
Tima Mehmedovic, trembling on the verge of hysteria. ``It was where
I saw my husband for the last time.'' Mrs. Mehmedovic, 47, came
Tuesday _ along with nearly 3,000 other Bosnian Muslims, mostly
women _ to a wrecked battery factory on the outskirts of Srebrenica
to mark the fifth anniversary of the worst war crime in Europe
since the Nazi era, and the worst humiliation that United Nations
peacekeepers have suffered....By Raymond Whitaker, The Independent &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Camp David, once named Shangri-La, was a retreat
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the stifling heat
which blankets Washington in the summer. Presidents ever since have
used it as a vacation home, a place to entertain guests and
occasionally _ as is the case this week with the
Barak-Arafat-Clinton summit _ to bring antagonists together to
talk. For the inhabitants of Thurmont, the nearest town to Camp
David, the flurry of activity on their doorstep is nothing new.
They seem more concerned with the local fire department's annual
carnival....By Andrew Marshall, The Independent &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Like Winnie the Pooh, Yasser Arafat loves honey.
Some of his colleagues believe his daily intake of the stuff,
bought at some expense in Yemen and poured into his tea, is the
reason why he is still in action, travelling from country to
country, tirelessly pressing his cause. Indeed, despite being
troubled by Parkinson's disease, the Palestinian leader is still in
fairly good fettle. Alas, the same cannot be said of his
Palestinian state that may, or may not, now be approaching birth _
depending on the outcome of the tripartite summit in Camp David,

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTH LEBANON _ Was this what victory was for? Was
this why the Hezbollah fighters lost their hundreds of ``martyrs''
in their 18-year conflict with Israel and its Lebanese militia
allies? To blow up a war memorial? It stood atop a hill within
sight of Israel, the foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to
defend. Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for
their country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men. But
most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into joining the
militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would have been
imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in Lebanon....By

   AIT AL-SHAAB, SOUTH LEBANON _ The rocks were littered with old
Pepsi cans and empty water bottles and dead bushes but Haji Mariam
Badran scrambled towards the Israeli frontier wire with the help of
her stick. ``I talked to my sister Sheikha on the phone and she
promised to be here at 11:30,'' the old woman wheezed. ``We have
been here since 10:30. And now the Israelis told us to go away.''
Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. On the very
day that Sheikha _ separated from her sister 52 years ago when the
Jewish Army attacked their village _ called from Israel to confirm
their meeting at the wire, the Israelis decided to call an end to
the family reunions over the frontier fence....By Robert Fisk, The

sign shows where the village once stood. ``Danger Mines!'' it says
in English, Hebrew and Arab. The Israelis have withdrawn _ up to a
point _ but the village is dead and the soil is now too dangerous
to tread on. So, what was liberation worth?....By Robert Fisk, The

   (PHOENIX) - It's not every day a man with a bloody shirt and a
question to ask walks into the combination gas station, grocery
store and post office Roberta Kornack manages in the town called
Why.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shaking,'' Roberta says, ``this smallish, dark-haired
man. He was like a teddy bear. `It was terrible. I couldn't go on,'
he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   The man spoke with a foreign accent, French maybe. They offered
him a soft drink and got him to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 7, a Friday, just before noon. Employees of the Why
Not Travel store had already begun counting the cars whizzing by on
Arizona 85, heading for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us his name was Jon,'' Roberta says. ``He said he'd
left Phoenix that morning and was headed to Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument. Up above Ajo, around Milepost 25, he was
following a green van. He said a rear tire blew out and the van
lost control, flipped and rolled, with one of the people inside
winding up on the road and others hurt inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon had a cellular telephone with him but didn't know he could
dial 911 for emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped and tried to get others to stop so they could use
the phone to call for help, but they wouldn't stop,'' he told
Roberta. ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Public Safety officer arrived not long after the
accident. According to a report filed later, he remembered a
foreign man in the roadway helping to direct traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jon told Roberta he had pulled one of the victims off the road.
That's how he got the blood on his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him to give the shirt to us so we could wash out the
blood for him,'' Roberta says. They used a hand cleaner and bleach.
</P>
<P>
   The man asked Roberta if everyone in this country is afraid to
help others when they are hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to tell him,'' Roberta says. ``You'd end up
going into how everybody's in a hurry and how they might be afraid
to get involved because they might get sued. What do you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy generates questions. In this case, the ``who'' was
known. And the ``what.'' And ``where.'' Now, this confused man from
overseas was in a place called Why, and no one knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
   A DPS spokesman said there were four women in the van. They were
nurses, perhaps on their way to Rocky Point for the weekend. One of
them died at the scene. The others also were injured, but not
critically.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators don't believe a tire blew out on the van. They
suspect the driver may have drifted off the pavement, skidded on
the loose berm, then lost control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine seeing that happen right in front of you when you're
in a strange country,'' Roberta says.
</P>
<P>
   Jon seemed to calm down the longer he stayed in the Why Not
Travel store and cheered up considerably when they returned his
shirt to him, clean and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thanked us,'' Roberta says, ``but we didn't think to thank
him for being a good Samaritan. Or even find out his last name.''
Before he left, they did ask the man where he was headed, however.
</P>
<P>
   South, he told them. The desert for some is religious, a
cathedral done in reds and browns, its blue dome arching from
horizon to horizon. The man who'd witnessed the accident wanted to
be there more than ever, to wander among the organ pipes.

 &HT;    THE FIGHT TO PULL LAKE POWELL'S PLUG(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<P>
   (UNDATED) - There are people, many people, who love it. Who
think the greatest thing that ever happened to way-north Coconino
County was the creation of Lake Powell, average depth 568 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those who hate what the lake stands for, hate that
it was formed when the federal government in 1963 stopped up the
Colorado River with a giant concrete plug called Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Those people want to see the lake drained, the dam breached and
the Colorado restored to its former magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bitter fight over an improbable objective: How do
you drain a body of water more than 180 miles long that supplies
power, water and jobs to a region without much of any of those
without creating a battle?
</P>
<P>
   You don't.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the abstract, rather odd dispute over Glen Canyon Dam
and Lake Powell behind it has gotten more serious because it
involves two of the most important dams in the Colorado River
Storage Project.
</P>
<P>
   Which means lots of water, lots of jobs, lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the battle over the West's dams is beginning.
And it looks to last a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 50 groups that want to drain the lake,
accompanied by a virtual Who's Who of the Western environmental
movement, including the Sierra Club and the Glen Canyon Action
Network, argued earlier this week at a Bureau of Reclamation
hearing in Salt Lake City to also drain Flaming Gorge Reservoir,
which was created by damming the Green River in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Their side has opened an ice cream store in Utah to raise funds.
The pro-lake people, buoyed by donations from corporate backers
such as SRP are waging an ad campaign with striking Valley
billboards and other road signs and the solicitation of donations.
There have been vandalism, harsh words and allegations of illegal
behavior, of signs being illegally put up and illegally pulled
down, of local law enforcement being complicit.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups' concerns center on the river's
changing ecosystem. There are four endangered fish in the Upper
Colorado River Basin that the dams have affected.
</P>
<P>
   The water below Glen Canyon is often too cold to support even
trout, and flows from the dam have scoured away much of the Grand
Canyon's natural streamside habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But to the burghers of Page and other communities on the lake,
this is a fight against out-of-town environmentalists,
carpetbaggers who don't make their livings off everything the lake
has brought to the otherwise-arid high desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of Page is it's here because of the lake,''
said Alice Robinson of the Page Chamber of Commerce, which shares a
phone number with the group trying to keep the lake, Friends of
Lake Powell. ``If the lake should be drained, that would be the end
for Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to try and turn it back to what it was before,
well, all the habitat that was there is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in reverse, is exactly the lake-drainers' point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small battle in the bigger picture of trying to
restore the Colorado River watershed,'' said Owen Lammers, director
of the Glen Canyon Action Network, the loudest of the groups trying
to drain the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about what is more beautiful but about the health of
the river,'' he said. ``It's not just about the survival of
endangered species. It's about the survival of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley billboards feature pictorials of the lake's dark blue
waters and the clear blue skies above them, the walls of what used
to be Glen Canyon rising dramatically over it. ``Don't let the
Sierra Club drain Lake Powell.'' Then comes a toll-free number for
people to voice their support.
</P>
<P>
   Some people obviously don't. At least two billboards have been
vandalized. The billboard on North 16th Street lasted about four
days before ``Free H20'' was spray-painted in cobalt across it, the
same paint blotting out the ``Don't let the Sierra Club'' portion
of the message, leaving just ``drain Lake Powell.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign, on 19th Avenue, lasted about as long and got the
same treatment. Both are clean now.
</P>
<P>
   Another theater of guerrilla warfare: An e-mail has been
circulating about the signs, a missive that originated from the
Moab, Utah-based Glen Canyon Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several billboards along major freeways have been rented in
Phoenix,'' the e-mail reads. ``Feel free to call the toll-free
number 888.845.POWE(LL) posted on the billboards to let them know
how quickly you want the reservoir drained. Call as often as you
like - it's free!''
</P>
<P>
   In March, both sides held rallies on the same day on opposite
sides of the lake, which brought out more police officers than had
been at the lake at one time since the threat of terrorism in
conjunction with the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until they came up to the dam to sing and dance
about it that the companies (in Page) started taking them
seriously,'' said Phoenix-area political consultant Jim Roush, a
longtime lake lover who helped mount the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we started getting corporate donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations are a bit tougher to come by for the lake-drainers.
They've opened up an ice cream store in Moab, the Restoration
Creamery, which contributes 66 cents for every $1 sold toward
restoration efforts. It earns money selling ice cream flavors with
names that allude to Glen Canyon: Music Temple Almond Fudge, Fern
Canyon Mint Chocolate Chip and Abbey's Rockey Road.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular flavor? Brower's Bear Claw, named for a former
Sierra Club director who didn't fight to save Glen Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   David Brower later called it the biggest mistake of his life.

 &HT;    20 TIMES? STABBING `ACCIDENT'(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BETH DEFALCO(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Mesa, ARIZ.)
</P>
<P>
   A Mesa teenager charged with stabbing a 7-year-old 20 times
first denied attacking the girl, then told detectives that he may
have accidentally stabbed her a few times while playing with a
steak knife, according to a police report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After he initially denied attacking Emily Galbraith behind her
apartment complex on West 10th Place near Country Club Drive on
Monday afternoon, Michael Arvizo, 14, later admitted he
``accidentally stabbed Emily while he was throwing a knife in the
air,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   He contradicted that account later, telling officers that he
fell on top of Emily as they were climbing a wall and
``accidentally stabbed her then,'' the report says. Arvizo said he
stabbed Emily again as he was getting up from his fall and then
``got scared and deliberately stabbed her twice more.''
</P>
<P>
   Arvizo had been baby-sitting Emily and his sister, Heidi, the
victim's best friend, and had been walking the victim home at the
time of the attack, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen offered no motive for the attack, but Heidi told police
that her brother had smeared some nail polish remover on Emily's
head and that ``she got mad,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Arvizo, who has been charged as an adult with a crime that
carries up to 24 years in prison, was interviewed almost
immediately after Emily was found unconscious in the parking lot at
her apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Emily was listed in fair condition Wednesday evening at Maricopa
Medical Center in Phoenix. Doctors are hopeful the little girl
won't need further reconstructive surgery. She lost 20 percent of
her blood and suffered deep cuts that just missed her heart and
other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa paramedic Cori Garnell, one of the first rescuers to
arrive, told (beginitalic)The Republic (enditalic)on Wednesday that
Emily identified Arvizo as her attacker in a brief interview with
paramedics and police.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Arvizo stabbed her, Emily simply replied, ``I
don't know,'' according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how tough this little girl was,'' Garnell said.
``She was afraid to tell us her last name because she didn't want
to get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived Monday afternoon at the boy's home just
after the stabbing, Arvizo's mother, Diana McKinney, gave them
permission to enter, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a pair of water-soaked shoes in the bathroom,
noting the shower was ``wet like someone had recently took a
shower.'' They also saw what appeared to be ``blood in and around
the bathroom sink,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, police found a 6-inch steak knife between a storage
unit and the wall bordering the apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deliberately denied the act and showed no remorse,'' Sgt.
Earle Lloyd, a Mesa police spokesman, told (beginitalic)The
Republic (enditalic)on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arvizo was being held in lieu of a $97,350 bond Wednesday.
Although charged as an adult, he is housed at Maricopa County's
Madison Street Jail with other juveniles.

 &HT;    SHARPE DEPORTATION HEARING TODAY(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JUDY VILLA(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Florence, ARIZ.) - Luis Sharpe remembers Cuba through the eyes
of a 6-year-old child: Spending time with his grandfather in
Havana; playing with new toys his grandfather showered on his
favorite grandson; climbing aboard the airplane that would take him
to U.S. soil and reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces of memories that have faded in the 34 years that
Sharpe has lived in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharpe, who once lived a storied life as the marquee player
for the Arizona Cardinals, now is brushing up on everything Cuban
and facing the possibility that he could be deported to a country
he hasn't seen since he was 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't want to go back,'' the former offensive
lineman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe spoke Wednesday from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service detention center in Florence, where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find a way to survive, but I'd be going into a place
that I don't know anything about,'' said Sharpe, wearing orange
detention pants and shirt and appearing to be relaxed and in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   A drug conviction earlier this year, Sharpe's second, landed him
in this predicament. Sharpe admits that parts of his past {ndash}
drug arrests, domestic violence, fights with police officers,
several failed rehabilitation attempts and two gunshots wounds
{ndash} are less than savory since he retired in 1994 because of a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   But he also maintains that he doesn't deserve to be banished
from the United States - and separated from his children - for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think I'm worthy of being in this country
anymore,'' Sharpe said. ``But I have a lot to offer and I still do.
Because of all I've been through and gone through, I can be a help
to hurting, lost souls. I'm excited to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe seemed well on his way to getting his life back in order
18 months ago after he had successfully completed drug
rehabilitation and began volunteering at a Phoenix ministry. He had
rebuilt relationships with his five children and talked of becoming
a minister himself.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, after two months at Rhema Bible College in
Oklahoma, Sharpe returned for a visit and relapsed into drugs. He
was arrested in November and then again in January for possession
of cocaine and drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed once again,'' Sharpe said. ``I serve a forgiving God,
and I thank him for his grace and his mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   But INS law isn't so forgiving. Any person who is not a U.S.
citizen is subject to deportation if he is convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   And while actual deportations to Cuba are virtually
non-existent, about 600 Cuban citizens sit in detention centers
across the country because their home country will not take them
back, according to February statistics provided by the Florence
Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project. Some are released into the
community while they await word, maybe years down the road, that
Cuba will finally accept them, but others become what's called
``indefinite detainees,'' waiting out their time in detention
because they could pose a risk to society.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, six men returned to Cuban soil after they took
hostages in a Louisiana jail and demanded they be repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ahr, an INS spokesman in Phoenix, said immigration
officials periodically submit a list of names they want to deport
and the Cuban government then decides which, if any, it'll take
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done on a piecemeal basis, one at a time,'' Ahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr could not discuss Sharpe's case. Sharpe, who said he had
planned to enter a rehabilitation program and resume his ministry
studies, was taken into INS custody last month after serving three
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 40, is a legal resident of the United States, but he
never became a naturalized citizen even though his parents and
brother did. A sister was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never took the time to do it,'' Sharpe said.
``Laziness, I guess. I just never went and did the paperwork. I
just never thought that I needed to, so I never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my shot. I can't blame anyone else, only myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's first hearing on the deportation matter is today. It
could take months before it's resolved. Meanwhile, he serves
mandatory detention under INS law, working for a dollar a day in
the recreation yard.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's attorney plans to challenge the mandatory detention law
in federal court, saying it's unfair and unconstitutional to detain
a man who is not violent, is not a threat to society and does not
pose a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Sharpe has faced deportation to Cuba. In
1998, he was granted a one-time waiver because he had been a
longtime legal resident and was not considered an aggravated felon.
</P>
<P>
   If he is ordered deported, his only recourse will be to seek
political asylum, a withholding of the removal order or relief
under the Convention Against Torture.
</P>
<P>
   All involve proving that Sharpe would be persecuted or tortured
if he returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (beginitalic) (enditalic)Sharpe's attorney, Jose Peqalosa Jr.,
believes that would be the case. He believes Sharpe could be
persecuted for his socioeconomic status, his religious beliefs and
his political beliefs. Sharpe's grandfather, Ernesto
Caballero-Suarez, served as mayor of the small town of Jamaica
Yatero during the Batista regime, then was imprisoned and died
after current leader Fidel Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's father once worked at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station
and chose to go to the United States in 1962 instead of remaining
loyal to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been instilled with democratic values and being the
person that I am today, that transgresses Cuban law and Cuban
beliefs,'' Sharpe said, ``and that would, I think, subject me to
torture and persecution. Someone like me could be a threat to their
ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Public sentiment, though, may not be with Sharpe the way it was
for Elian Gonzales, whose Miami relativesfought, then lost, a
seven-month battle to gain asylum for the boy. But for Sharpe,
``the stakes are higher,'' Peqalosa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all as Americans have a heart,'' Sharpe said. ``We're all
interested in the well-being of all people, and any time you see a
person that would be persecuted or tortured, we all should care.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Cuba would mean that Sharpe would be virtually cut
out of the lives of his five children, because getting travel
documents to Cuba is very difficult. &UR; (beginitalic) (enditalic)He
would have no money. The only people he would know would be a
spattering of aunts, uncles and cousins to whom he's rarely spoken.
</P>
<P>
   He could never return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And though Sharpe is fluent in Spanish, he said that likely
wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I could communicate,'' he said. ``But could I function?
That's a different thing.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush breaks from GOP's racist past in NAACP speech
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was more chutzpah than healing in George W. Bush's speech
to the national convention of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Republican presidential candidate with trying. No GOP
nominee-presumptive has bothered visiting the convention since 1988
when Bush's father addressed it. Four years ago, Bob Dole pointedly
snubbed an invitation, sourly dismissing it as an attempt by the
NAACP to set him up.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's gesture, carried out with more than ordinary political
histrionics, was surely meant to be read by the neo-Confederate,
``Fergit, Hell!'' wing of the GOP as extending the party's hoary
``Southern strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was Richard Nixon's device for breaking the once
solidly Democratic South by co-opting Alabama Gov. George Wallace's
white-backlash politics _ ending busing for school desegregation
and so on _ without Wallace's overt racist posturing and
fulmination.
</P>
<P>
   That has complicated the challenge to Democratic presidential
candidates, but the GOP's silent pact with racism has now begun to
complicate the challenge to Republican candidates, too. The GOP
typically polls a distant second with the growing blocs of ethnic
voters, often the make-or-break difference in key states like
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush conceded as much with his admission to the NAACP that the
party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln. (You
could say. President Reagan opposed every piece of civil rights
legislation in its time. Republican members of Congress, with
honorable exceptions, have generally resisted relevant legislation.
The GOP is the main political engine for dismantling affirmative
action. The list goes on.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself bore a substantial burden to his NAACP appearance.
Though sporting a generally decent record on race, just three
months earlier he had stooped to racist fellow-traveling in South
Carolina, speaking at Bob Jones University, toxic for its ban of
interracial dating, and cravenly indulging the state's overhanging
ensign of racism, the Confederate battle flag, which even South
Carolina's own balky state legislators furled just weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if others in his party will follow, Bush has taken what
could be the first step in a long-term rehabilitation of the
relationship the between the GOP and African-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's acknowledgement that racism remains active
should be a commonplace but was bold in a party that often pretends
the nation has achieved a magical post-racial colorblindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of Jim Crow,'' Bush said, ``there's racial profiling
and redlining. Instead of 'separate but equal,' there's separate
but forgotten.'' Few in Republican leadership have admitted as much
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had little solid to offer the NAACP delegates and the
larger black community except a promise to enforce civil right laws
_ which ought to go without saying. But if just showing up doesn't
count for much these days, Bush's appearance, given the long
estrangement, at least counts as a start.

   BROOKLYN _ BROOKLYN, N.Y. _ It wasn't until I plopped down in a
booth at Junior's _ the sprawling, orange-vinyl delicatessen run by
the Rosen family for more than 50 years at the corner of Flatbush
and DeKalb avenues _ that I began to realize what a melting pot New
York's most populous borough is. In Brooklyn, habitat of Hassids
and homeboys, matzah ball soup is served side by side with collard
greens and salmon croquettes. Over a recent long weekend, I didn't
have nearly enough time to eat my way around this ethnic-food
lover's paradise. But I did hopscotch around sufficiently to see
why it's New York's new ground zero of cool, why trendies from
``The City'' are subwaying over to check out the clubs and
restaurants, the museums and green spaces, the Gothic architecture
and Gotham views. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HOW TO FUND A RICH UNCLE SAM
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, July 16.

   WASHINGTON _ News from the nation's entertainment capital that
Eastman Kodak will pay $75 million to put its name on the theater
where the Academy Awards are due to move raises the prospect that
we're missing a bet back here at what J. Edgar Hoover, once a
Hollywood icon, called the seat of government.
</P>
<P>
   After all, why shouldn't the taxpayers also profit from the
trend that brings in big bucks from corporate sponsors for naming
rights to just about anything that's nailed down?
</P>
<P>
   Politicians already help point the way. The Republican National
Convention will open July 31 in Philadelphia's First Union Center,
a hall named in honor of the nation's sixth largest banking firm,
with assets that rival the annual U.S. defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the GOP could find a way to earn some extra campaign
funds by having Gov. George W. Bush of Texas give First Union a
subtle plug when he claims his party's presidential nomination.
Bush could begin his acceptance speech by saying: ``First and
foremost, sound banking policies anchor the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Vice President Al Gore could tell a
nationally televised Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles
that, as top dog, he would ``staple together centrist policies.''
That, course, would be a bow to the Staples Center, the host site,
and to the role office supplies play in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There's already talk in Atlanta of putting a corporate tag on
that city's busy public airport. Wes Hasden, associate editor of
the Chattanooga Times, has suggested that Atlanta-based Home Depot
claim the prize. That way, the mass transit station at Hartsfield
International Airport could be called the Home Depot depot.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics might object to the idea of giving federal
facilities corporate names on the grounds that, thanks to a hot
economy, the government already expects to earn a $2 trillion
surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Internet bubble that recently ruptured, such
projections are no sure thing. On the other hand, if things do work
out as planned, then the extra cash itself could earn some extra
cash as ``The Fortune 500 Surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, to help offset the rising costs of judicial
research, Chief Justice William Rehnquist could explore with Bill
Gates the notion of dispatching some of his corporate billions this
way. In return, a colorful Windows logo would be discreetly
embroidered onto the black robes of the nine jurists. For a few
billions more, the marble palace where they convene could be known
as the Microsoft Supreme National Business Court (MSNBC).
</P>
<P>
   As one of this city's prime tourist attractions, the White House
could no doubt also command top naming dollars from the business
community. Frequent mention in the press of the president's home
would only serve to enhance its naming value.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate consortium _ one that would surely include Kodak _
could be formed to help defray the expected large cost. Should any
antitrust concerns arise from such a collective approach, they
could be easily overcome at the MSNBC.

<P>
   Philanthropy has begun to embrace the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer, a modem and a credit card, you can now give
money to any of the 640,000 charities in America, using
www.allCharities.com or any of more than a dozen similar Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Type your ZIP code into an online box at www.helping.org and you
can learn when and where you can volunteer in your community this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks at www.guidestar.org, you can peek at the
American Red Cross' Form 990 tax return and learn that Elizabeth
Dole earned a $202,417 salary in her last full year as the
charity's president.
</P>
<P>
   You can even buy eight gourmet shrimp burgers at www.iGive.com
for $17.95, with 15 percent of your purchase -- in dollars, not
burgers -- donated to Save the Whales (www.savethewhales.org) or
any other charity you choose. A fast-growing number of other
virtual charity malls also provide opportunities for do-gooder
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has so much information been so readily available
to donors. Never before has it been so easy to give money and keep
records for tax purposes. And never before have charities -- which
took in a record $190 billion in this country last year -- been so
enthralled with the fund-raising potential of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since online donors are expected to demand more information and
accountability from charities, e-philanthropy -- though still in
its infancy -- has the potential to alter the character of the
nonprofit sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out a lot more about organizations with just a
few clicks of your mouse,'' said Mary Kay Phelps, senior director
of direct response fund raising for the American Red Cross
(www.redcross.org), the undisputed champion of e-philanthropy,
raising $2.8 million online in 1999. ``You can check their annual
reports. You can check how wisely they spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Chronicle of Philanthropy survey of 252 of the
largest nonprofit organizations, the Red Cross' 1999 total was more
than four times the next highest amount raised online, $590,300, by
Catholic Relief Services of Baltimore (www.catholicrelief.org).
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the $7 million online total for the 252 charities was
eight times what they raised online in 1998. But it was still less
than 1 percent of all the money they raised.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the country's largest charities didn't do any fund
raising on the Internet in 1999. Alnisa Allgood, executive director
of San Francisco-based Nonprofit Tech (www.nonprofit-tech.org),
said that even in Silicon Valley, her unscientific estimate is that
only 5 percent of charities, most of them small, even have Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the corporate world, the nonprofit world is way
behind,'' said Allgood. ``There's just a huge chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   That's changing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations of all sizes have scrambled to buy
computers and establish Web sites this year. And a suddenly
competitive number of Web-based charity portals -- doorways to
content in cyberspace -- have tried to strategically position
themselves as middlemen to cut their own slices of the fast-growing
philanthropic pie.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For donors, as well as people not inclined to giving, the
Internet may reduce, but not eliminate, some of the most annoying
community fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the traditional raffles, candy sales and car washes in
which every parent, neighbor and relative is expected to
contribute, an increasing number of schools have turned to Web
sites such as www.Schoolpop.com, www.SchoolCash.com and
www.ShopforSchool.com that link to online retailers while giving a
percentage of purchases back to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   WAMU, a Washington, D.C., public radio station (www.wamu.org),
has foregone some of the usual on-air pitches that interrupt
favorite programs, replacing them with a highly promoted
``CyberMonday'' or ``CyberWednesday.'' Bheesham Sethi, the
station's director of institutional support, said about 35 percent
of revenues from one-week membership drives has come on cyber days,
and listeners love it, because it puts them in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Web fund raising be part of the charitable landscape?''
Sethi asked. ``Absolutely. Does that mean we'll do away with direct
mail and things like that? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To expand, e-philanthropy must overcome several hurdles,
including donor concerns about privacy and security when giving
online. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has raised
questions about whether charity gifts funneled through for-profit
portals are tax-deductible, especially if there's no written
agreement from the charity to accept such donations through a
middleman.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing investment in e-philanthropy banks on the yet
unproven assumption that Net-savvy donors' growing comfort with
buying and researching online will transfer to Internet giving.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Capiel is an example of how this progression would work.
As chief technology officer of Digital Impact of San Mateo, Calif.,
he finds the Internet his natural domain.
</P>
<P>
   Capiel read a newspaper article this year about flooding in
Mozambique and was stirred to help. The article listed a toll-free
number for Oxfam America, but when Capiel called, the number was
busy. Determined, Capiel turned to his computer and found the
charity online (www.oxfamamerica.org), where he gave his first
Internet donation.
</P>
<P>
   It was so easy that Capiel experimented at www.4charity.com, one
of at least 17 portals that help donors research charities and
process online gifts. Now Capiel does all his giving online,
enjoying the ability to ``drill deep'' for information and the
convenience of having a record of his charitable deductions.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the San Francisco-based 4charity.com because it doesn't
take a big cut of his gifts, as some portals do. Instead, it passes
100 percent to the charity (hoping to make the bulk of its revenues
by charging for work done on charities' own Web sites). For Capiel,
it didn't hurt that 4charity.com was founded by graduates of
Stanford University, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   When Capiel donates through the portal, his charities get his
name and e-mail address, something that might give some people
privacy worries, but not Capiel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can run marketing campaigns to let me know what other
events they have going,'' he said. ``With that, I'll be able to
click from my e-mail to give them a donation. That will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Capiel has seen for-profit businesses invest in the Internet for
a few years now. But it's as if the nonprofit sector collectively
awoke in 2000 to the potential of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is year one,'' said Tracey Pettengill, 29, chief
executive officer of 4charity.com. ``We're in the protozoa stage of
development in the evolution of the Internet. But we're starting
something that will truly be revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dynamic possibilities of e-philanthropy --
interactivity between donor and charity -- could be its most
formidable hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the traditional philanthropic model centers on
what is known as ``the ask.'' Simply put, charities initiate and
donors respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, creates a two-way street. For the medium
to work optimally, donors will become proactive, just as buyers of
e-commerce are.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with philanthropy, people aren't buying a stock or a
product,'' said John Walters, president of the Washington-based
Philanthropy Roundtable and a skeptic of e-philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey after survey shows Americans practice what I call
`Trick or Treat' giving. You give to people and charities who ask
you. When it comes to reactive giving, the Internet is limited.
That's because donors simply don't start the search. They don't
say, `Who do I want to give to today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schmidt, founder and president of Virginia-based
Philanthropic Research, questions the viability of stand-alone
charity portals. What, after all, is going to drive donors to them?
</P>
<P>
   He sees more merit in making links to charity sites from online
media articles that pique interest in a problem, or from popular
financial service sites, where users are already thinking about
their money. The American Red Cross has found much of its success
by running banners requesting help on American Online and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Floyd hit the East Coast in September 1999, more
than $574,000 was given online to the Red Cross, where the average
Internet contribution is $130, compared to $115 through other
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that you don't wake up in the morning saying, `I
have $1,000, where can I give it away?''' said Schmidt, whose
GuideStar display of charity tax returns and other information has
been hailed as a breakthrough in providing online accountability.
``But you do wake up in the morning and get engaged in life through
the Internet and say, `Aha.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The ahas are where the action is.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Gudrun Schindler had an ``aha'' one day in June while sitting at
her new Gateway Pentium III computer in her Elgin, Neb., farmhouse.
She clicked to the Web site of the World Pantheist Movement
(www.pantheism.net), as she often does. There she discovered a new
way to promote pantheism, which maintains the universe as a whole,
not a god, should be held in reverence.
</P>
<P>
   All she had to do was find and review Web sites, on any subject,
for a new online directory, Zeal, which gave 50 cents to a person's
favorite charity for every Web site accepted
(www.zeal.com/charity).
</P>
<P>
   The novel concept gives Zeal, a May start-up, inexpensive labor
for a task for which more established competitors have had to hire
staff. It also illustrates how the Internet can foster creative
ways for people to engage philanthropically.
</P>
<P>
   For Schindler, a teacher, the scheme provided a way to help a
cause she believes in, but has not been able to donate to because
of budget constraints. It became something of a fun addiction, she
said, to mine Web sites two to three hours at a time, watching the
pantheism tally steadily increase.
</P>
<P>
   In about 20 hours online, Schindler raised $326, joining 69
other pantheists pointing and clicking their way to a grand total
exceeding $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's been hard being out here in the middle of
nowhere,'' Schindler said. ``The Internet helps me connect, and
this made me feel like I was actually producing something.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as is the case with many e-philanthropy ideas, the future
is anything but clear. Zeal changed its policy on June 30, dropping
its charity contribution from 50 to 10 cents for each published
submission, while adding a $500 weekly bonus to a selected charity.
``Zealots'' whom Zeal has so carefully cultivated have been howling
in online discussion groups ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Zeal senior marketing manager Daniel
Chamberlain said Zeal gave more than $10,000 to charities in May,
with nearly $40,000 expected to go out to more than 400 charities
later this summer. Chamberlain said he wanted to see the charity
drive ``continue indefinitely,'' perhaps with the help of sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Harrison, president of the World Pantheism Movement, is
tickled that the Internet may push donations to small charities
such as his. He calls it ``part of the magic money scene of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't seen any magic money yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in hope, with our fingers crossed, and will believe
itfully only when we see it,'' Harrison said. ``There is an element
of uncertainty here.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dealing with political protest
 &HT;    For release July 16, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the networks have erred in shaving their coverage time
of the national political conventions this summer. There appears to
be a growing foreboding of protests and demonstrations that might
rival the ratings-high World Wrestling Federation TV performances.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia police have announced that the worst protesters
arrested at the Republican National Convention beginning July 31
will be sent for detention and processing to what is described as
the ``dungeon-like'' Holmesburg prison in Northeast Philadelphia.
It is a 99-year-old maximum security prison closed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe any announcement has been made regarding the
Democratic National Convention when it plays Los Angeles in August,
but sending unruly protesters to a Los Angeles Clippers basketball
game might be an equivalent
</P>
<P>
   All the gloom about this year's political conventions appears to
be evaporating. The party hacks still will be hacking away, but the
folks in the streets are promising to make things interesting. And
the cops are indicating they've got corresponding plans.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways of dealing with protesters and there are ways of
dealing with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   I like the way the late Miami Beach Police Chief Rocky Pomerance
handled matters at Republican conventions held there in 1968 and
1972. A burly, gregarious 300-pounder, Rocky let it be known that
he had a plan if any groups began marching on Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since all but two of the bridges leading to Miami Beach were
drawbridges, he said he would raise them to seal off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his plans was to put unruly protesters on a bus,
drive them out to Andytown on the bug-infested edges of the Florida
Everglades and let them out, thus effectively removing them from
anywhere near the site of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually that was kind of a psychological ploy, it was not a
plan at all,'' Pomerance admitted years later. (And quite possibly,
announcement of detention at Holmesburg also is a psychological
ploy.)
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Rocky's ploys weren't needed in 1968. The
convention that nominated Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew was
relatively calm. It was the Democratic convention in Chicago
several weeks later that ran out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky had another challenge in 1972, and it wasn't as well met.
Groups such as Yippies and Zippies, even Nazis and KKKers as well
as Vietnam veterans and Cuban exiles marching against communism
descended on Miami Beach for the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Things got out of control when protesters began puncturing
delegate bus tires and physically confronting the delegates
themselves. Tear gas was chokingly plentiful and 800 were arrested
in a single night. There also was clubbing, but Pomerance _ to his
dying day _ insisted his police department clubbed no one. (There
were other agencies on the scene, including the Florida Highway
Patrol, a member of which created an opening for a cluster of
stitches in the head of one of the press photographers.)
</P>
<P>
   Through that unpleasant period, Pomerance nevertheless created a
moment of humor. In a pre-convention meeting with anti-war,
absurd-theater potentates Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, they
threatened to lead 10,000 naked protesters down Miami Beach's main
street, then over to the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pomerance, he turned to Rubin and responded, ``If
you can get 10,000 people to walk naked down the asphalt on a hot
(August) day, I'll lead the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The march never took place.
</P>
<P>
   A little creativity: Maybe that's what the Philly police need to
beguile potential protesters instead of packing them off to the old
dungeon-like joint. Put the baddest of the bad on a bus to, say,
Scranton (sorry, Scranton) or have them spend the winter at Valley
Forge as George Washington's troops (sorry, George).
</P>
<P>
   Even suggest a parade in the emperor's new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   That would give those TV cameras something to zoom in on _ and
restore the long-lost Nielson numbers for political conventions.
Anything might be better than listening to those drones at the
political podium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After making a brief _ and rare _ public speech at a
lavish luncheon the other day, the Queen Mother asked the guests to
drink a toast to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the event organized at Guild Hall to celebrate the
Queen Mum's upcoming 100th birthday complied by raising a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except the guest of honor, who couldn't find
her wine. After glancing around her place setting at the head
table, the Queen Mum fixed a stare at the archbishop of Canterbury
and pointed at the glass of red wine he clutched in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' she said, sweetly but sternly, to the head of
the Anglican Church, who instantly relinquished it to the senior
royal.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were charmed by this moment, which reminded them all
that the plucky matriarch of this country's often troubled,
occasionally unwieldy first family continues on _ a rock in a time
of sometimes wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother _ she
demanded the two royal designations in her official title _ will
celebrate her birthday at a quiet family gathering at Clarence
House, her longtime London home. An official celebration will be
held July 19.
</P>
<P>
   At a thanksgiving service for her Tuesday at St. Paul's
Cathedral, George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury who pinched
her wine glass, said her place in the hearts of Britons is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when such a premium is placed on the young and the
new, it is glorious indeed to be celebrating the birthday of
someone who can help us travel that country called 'life' _ and
someone, indeed, who so fully continues to inhabit it,'' he said.
``For we cherish in you, ma'am, a continuing openness and
responsiveness to people, not just of all backgrounds, but of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service the Queen Mum, aided by a walking stick and
handrail erected for her, walked the length of the massive
cathedral and down its 22 front steps. Prince Charles hovered near,
but she walked on her own, smiling demurely at people in the crowd
as she passed.
</P>
<P>
   With her warm smile and spry personality the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II remains by far the most popular royal _ for many the
personification of an ideal of ``British-ness'' that is fading
rapidly in the new century. She has seen two world wars, the
dissolution of an empire and counted among her friends Sir Winston
Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she is most revered for her easy, relaxed style that allows
for a fondness for gin, jokes and race horses.
</P>
<P>
   The country is full of people with memories of her, like a young
Manchester policeman who once guarded her parade route. Peering
into the Queen Mother's car, he noticed that she seemed to be
chewing on something. She saw him staring and the next thing he
knew, she had tossed him a
</P>
<P>
   caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other royals, the Queen Mum relishes a good joke with
the press and seems to not take it all so seriously. Lunching with
Queen Elizabeth some years ago, she was reportedly surprised when
her daughter, who normally doesn't drink, ordered some wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you should, dear?'' teased the Queen Mum, who is
known to enjoy a G&AMP;T now and then. ``After all, you have to reign
all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   She also holds a grudge. Biographies suggest she will never
forgive Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who King Edward VIII
surrendered his throne to marry. The abdication of her husband's
older brother in 1936 forced him to become King George VI and her
to become queen _ a role she never wanted. She blames Simpson for
her husband's early death in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   She also is said to be annoyed with Jimmy Carter for kissing her
on the lips at a 1977 meeting _ the first man, she complained, to
do so since the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The sun had not yet begun to set on the British Empire when she
was born to an aristocratic Scottish family. Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore. The family's Glamis Castle in northeast Scotland is
the legendary home of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   When the First World War started _ coincidentally on her 14th
birthday _ Glamis Castle became a hospital. One of her brothers,
Fergus, was killed at the battle of Loos in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Her family periodically entertained King George V and Queen Mary
and their children _ among them Albert. After twice refusing
Albert, Elizabeth married him in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, the bashful and stuttering Albert became
King George VI.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She became queen in the turbulent pre-war years with the
monarchy severely shaken by the abdication. She is credited with
restoring stability to the royal family and transforming her shy
husband into a people's king.
</P>
<P>
   During Word War II, she became a symbol of Britain, refusing to
leave Buckingham Palace, which was hit nine times by the German
bombers. She ignored then-Prime Minister Churchill's suggestion to
send her daughters Elizabeth _ the future queen _ and Margaret, to
the safety of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children won't go without me,'' she responded. ``I won't
leave the King. And the King will never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She sent the princesses to Windsor Palace outside London. And
with King George she roamed the country in the royal train,
cheering factory workers on, visiting army camps and hospitals, and
inspecting bomb damage.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the prospect of a German invasion, the Queen
learned to use a revolver, practicing on a shooting range
constructed at Buckingham Palace. She and the king went often to
London's frequently bombed East End. She picked her way through the
rubble in high heels to offer
</P>
<P>
   encouragement to East Enders.
</P>
<P>
   After one bombing attack left the palace substantially damaged,
she responded: ``I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel we
can look the East End in the face.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, George died of lung cancer, leaving her a widow at age
51. She moved out of Buckingham Palace to make way for her daughter
and went into seclusion until Churchill cajoled her into returning
to public life.
</P>
<P>
   She still refers to her husband as ``the king'' and declines
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Even now she continues a rigorous public schedule, which she is
said to regard as a sacred duty of her position. Unlike other
royals, she seems to enjoy the regimen of tree plantings, plaque
dedications and visits to old folks homes _ mostly occupied by
people much younger than she is. She has made more than 40 trips
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She always wears pearls, even when salmon fishing in Scotland _
a passion she still enjoys when she's up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother awakens each morning to the sound of bagpipe
music from her own recorded collection, and reads an assortment of
newspapers before meeting with her private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasion when she is lunching without family or
friends, she snacks with the staff at Clarence House, her London
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest pleasure comes from horse racing. She is so devoted
to the sport that she had a ``blower,'' a device used by bookmakers
to provide live race commentary, installed in her home.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She is said to have no intention of retiring after her 100th
birthday. Local newspapers say she has opened discussions on her
role in the bash being planned for the Golden Jubilee of her
daughter's ascending the throne. That would take place in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As she was leaving the recent luncheon in her honor, the Queen
Mum stopped her party to listen as a small group guests began
singing one of her long-time favorite songs, ``If You Were The Only
Girl In The World.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and urged them to sing louder. The rest of the crowd
joined in as the royal guest of honor beamed in pleasure.

<P>
   SANGPO VILLAGE, China _ Ding Yufeng is a fifth-grade dropout.
That does not make him unusual in this booming village in central
China.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a regular user of e-mail and the World Wide Web.
That, too, is not unusual here in Sangpo Village.
</P>
<P>
   Once a ``poor, backwards, uneducated'' speck in Henan province,
in the words of one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost.
Its 4,800 residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100
personal computers and a bustling Internet cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But Sangpo Village didn't get rich growing wheat and corn, which
is how most of surrounding Mengzhou County makes a living. Having
very little land, village leaders realized long ago the road to
wealth lay in private enterprise, not agriculture. So it decided to
capitalize on a traditional handicraft of its Muslim population _
sheepskin processing.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years, the village has grown these backyard businesses
into a multi-million dollar niche market. It now processes 5
million sheepskins a year, almost half of China's total sheepskin
imports. Most come from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Sangpo, the green fields along the side of the road
suddenly give way to row after row of short wooden tents, each with
a sheepskin on top laid out to dry. The streets inside the village
are also lined with drying sheepskins. Sangpo proudly calls itself
China's ``Fur City.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished products are exported to Turkey and Italy as
leather for shoes and handbags, to Russia as blankets and to the
United States as sheepskin carseat covers. The arrival of the
Internet two years ago has not only been a boon to business, it has
allowed bored youngsters a window to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shortened our distance with the rest of the
world,'' said Bai Huzhan, Sangpo's Communist vice-party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sangpo is an anomaly in China or a sign of things to
come remains to be seen. Some rural areas have started using the
Internet to post pricing and market information for farmers, but
the digital divide between rich and poor is still enormous, and
growing wider.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people have gone on-line in this country of
1.25 billion, according to the latest official estimates. But less
than 1 percent of the population even has Internet access, as users
are heavily concentrated in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials in Mengzhou County _ where Sangpo Village
resides _ are happy for the tax revenue and jobs the village has
provided, but have yet to make any great efforts to wire the rest
of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Only 60 percent of households in Mengzhou County have
telephones. The largest town in the county has a couple of Internet
cafes, but few people can afford the fee of 3 yuan (US36 cents) an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Sangpo Internet cafe, which charges 4 yuan
(US48 cents) an hour, is packed in the evenings, and home telephone
penetration is closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology came quickly to Sangpo. In 1993, the only phone in
the village was at the government building. By 1994, it had 2,000
lines and today, it has more than 6,000. By 1998, Internet access
seemed like the natural next step. So village leaders convinced the
county to set up a computer training center.
</P>
<P>
   In Ding's home alone, there are five phone lines. Two of them
are dedicated to personal computers, which he says are in use at
least 12 hours a day _ if not 24 _ by the extended family of more
than 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two computers is not enough for the family,'' said his father,
Ding Cunzheng, who runs the family sheepskin processing business,
White Dragon Fur Factory.
</P>
<P>
   For years, White Dragon was a small enterprise making leather
jackets. But then the younger Ding, 23, discovered computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any hobbies. I just fooled around and wasted my
time,'' says Ding, sitting in the factory office where he seems
oblivious to the clinging smell of animal hides. ``But when I
started learning computers, I found I could work at it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was using search engines to find sheepskin suppliers and
eventually sent e-mails to hundreds of them introducing his
father's factory. He got few replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our factory is too small,'' Ding said.
</P>
<P>
   But one business in Australia, where sheep outnumber humans, was
also small and looking for someone to buy its sheepskins. Before
long, another Internet match was made.
</P>
<P>
   White Dragon was able to cut out its middlemen and buy raw
materials directly from the Australian supplier. Its business
increased more than three-fold, and it now employs more than 40
workers, mostly from Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this is perhaps the dirty secret of Sangpo's
success. Cleaning, combing, cutting sheepskins is filthy work. It's
no work for rich villagers, especially those with two private cars
and 13 cell phones, as the Ding family has.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official population of the village is under 5,000,
the actual number of residents is closer to 11,000. The difference
being the laborers who've come from other towns and provinces for
jobs. They live in factory dorms and get paid by the piece, showing
that even Chinese villages take advantage of cheap Chinese labor.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity of the village has made its residents rather
lazy, laments Bai, the vice-party secretary. Money came easily, and
loftier goals were viewed as unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When villagers had nothing to do they would play mah-jong,''
he said. ``Kids wouldn't study; they'd just go out and spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the information superhighway made people
realize they needed to learn to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they don't study, they won't be able to grasp new
technology,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many young people in Sangpo, Zhang Juan(CQ), 19, says her
favorite Web activity is chatting with her Net buddies from all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, I can see the outside world,'' Zhang said. ``We
chat about everything. If someone has something on their mind, they
can talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first time in a chatroom was nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was embarrassed to say I was from a village,'' she
says, taking a moment from a chat session in the Sangpo Internet
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly gained confidence and made friends. Only
recently, she encountered a person from Hangzhou, a big city near
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person said, 'Well I have nothing to say to you, you live
in an isolated little village,''' she said. ``So I said, 'We're
much more developed here than where you are.'''

<P>
   LONDON _ After making a brief _ and rare _ public speech at a
lavish luncheon the other day, the Queen Mother asked the guests to
drink a toast to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the event organized at Guild Hall to celebrate the
Queen Mum's upcoming 100th birthday complied by raising a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except the guest of honor, who couldn't find
her wine. After glancing around her place setting at the head
table, the Queen Mum fixed a stare at the archbishop of Canterbury
and pointed at the glass of red wine he clutched in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' she said, sweetly but sternly, to the head of
the Anglican Church, who instantly relinquished it to the senior
royal.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were charmed by this moment, which reminded them all
that the plucky matriarch of this country's often troubled,
occasionally unwieldy first family continues on _ a rock in a time
of sometimes wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother _ she
demanded the two royal designations in her official title _ will
celebrate her birthday at a quiet family gathering at Clarence
House, her longtime London home. An official celebration will be
held July 19.
</P>
<P>
   At a thanksgiving service for her Tuesday at St. Paul's
Cathedral, George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury who pinched
her wine glass, said her place in the hearts of Britons is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when such a premium is placed on the young and the
new, it is glorious indeed to be celebrating the birthday of
someone who can help us travel that country called 'life' _ and
someone, indeed, who so fully continues to inhabit it,'' he said.
``For we cherish in you, ma'am, a continuing openness and
responsiveness to people, not just of all backgrounds, but of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service the Queen Mum, aided by a walking stick and
handrail erected for her, walked the length of the massive
cathedral and down its 22 front steps. Prince Charles hovered near,
but she walked on her own, smiling demurely at people in the crowd
as she passed.
</P>
<P>
   With her warm smile and spry personality the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II remains by far the most popular royal _ for many the
personification of an ideal of ``British-ness'' that is fading
rapidly in the new century. She has seen two world wars, the
dissolution of an empire and counted among her friends Sir Winston
Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she is most revered for her easy, relaxed style that allows
for a fondness for gin, jokes and race horses.
</P>
<P>
   The country is full of people with memories of her, like a young
Manchester policeman who once guarded her parade route. Peering
into the Queen Mother's car, he noticed that she seemed to be
chewing on something. She saw him staring and the next thing he
knew, she had tossed him a
</P>
<P>
   caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other royals, the Queen Mum relishes a good joke with
the press and seems to not take it all so seriously. Lunching with
Queen Elizabeth some years ago, she was reportedly surprised when
her daughter, who normally doesn't drink, ordered some wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you should, dear?'' teased the Queen Mum, who is
known to enjoy a G&AMP;T now and then. ``After all, you have to reign
all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   She also holds a grudge. Biographies suggest she will never
forgive Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who King Edward VIII
surrendered his throne to marry. The abdication of her husband's
older brother in 1936 forced him to become King George VI and her
to become queen _ a role she never wanted. She blames Simpson for
her husband's early death in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   She also is said to be annoyed with Jimmy Carter for kissing her
on the lips at a 1977 meeting _ the first man, she complained, to
do so since the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The sun had not yet begun to set on the British Empire when she
was born to an aristocratic Scottish family. Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore. The family's Glamis Castle in northeast Scotland is
the legendary home of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   When the First World War started _ coincidentally on her 14th
birthday _ Glamis Castle became a hospital. One of her brothers,
Fergus, was killed at the battle of Loos in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Her family periodically entertained King George V and Queen Mary
and their children _ among them Albert. After twice refusing
Albert, Elizabeth married him in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, the bashful and stuttering Albert became
King George VI.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She became queen in the turbulent pre-war years with the
monarchy severely shaken by the abdication. She is credited with
restoring stability to the royal family and transforming her shy
husband into a people's king.
</P>
<P>
   During Word War II, she became a symbol of Britain, refusing to
leave Buckingham Palace, which was hit nine times by the German
bombers. She ignored then-Prime Minister Churchill's suggestion to
send her daughters Elizabeth _ the future queen _ and Margaret, to
the safety of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children won't go without me,'' she responded. ``I won't
leave the King. And the King will never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She sent the princesses to Windsor Palace outside London. And
with King George she roamed the country in the royal train,
cheering factory workers on, visiting army camps and hospitals, and
inspecting bomb damage.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the prospect of a German invasion, the Queen
learned to use a revolver, practicing on a shooting range
constructed at Buckingham Palace. She and the king went often to
London's frequently bombed East End. She picked her way through the
rubble in high heels to offer
</P>
<P>
   encouragement to East Enders.
</P>
<P>
   After one bombing attack left the palace substantially damaged,
she responded: ``I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel we
can look the East End in the face.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, George died of lung cancer, leaving her a widow at age
51. She moved out of Buckingham Palace to make way for her daughter
and went into seclusion until Churchill cajoled her into returning
to public life.
</P>
<P>
   She still refers to her husband as ``the king'' and declines
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Even now she continues a rigorous public schedule, which she is
said to regard as a sacred duty of her position. Unlike other
royals, she seems to enjoy the regimen of tree plantings, plaque
dedications and visits to old folks homes _ mostly occupied by
people much younger than she is. She has made more than 40 trips
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She always wears pearls, even when salmon fishing in Scotland _
a passion she still enjoys when she's up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother awakens each morning to the sound of bagpipe
music from her own recorded collection, and reads an assortment of
newspapers before meeting with her private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasion when she is lunching without family or
friends, she snacks with the staff at Clarence House, her London
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest pleasure comes from horse racing. She is so devoted
to the sport that she had a ``blower,'' a device used by bookmakers
to provide live race commentary, installed in her home.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She is said to have no intention of retiring after her 100th
birthday. Local newspapers say she has opened discussions on her
role in the bash being planned for the Golden Jubilee of her
daughter's ascending the throne. That would take place in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As she was leaving the recent luncheon in her honor, the Queen
Mum stopped her party to listen as a small group guests began
singing one of her long-time favorite songs, ``If You Were The Only
Girl In The World.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and urged them to sing louder. The rest of the crowd
joined in as the royal guest of honor beamed in pleasure.

   SANGPO VILLAGE, China _ Ding Yufeng is a fifth-grade dropout.
That does not make him unusual in this booming village in central
China.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a regular user of e-mail and the World Wide Web.
That, too, is not unusual here in Sangpo Village.
</P>
<P>
   Once a ``poor, backwards, uneducated'' speck in Henan province,
in the words of one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost.
Its 4,800 residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100
personal computers and a bustling Internet cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But Sangpo Village didn't get rich growing wheat and corn, which
is how most of surrounding Mengzhou County makes a living. Having
very little land, village leaders realized long ago the road to
wealth lay in private enterprise, not agriculture. So it decided to
capitalize on a traditional handicraft of its Muslim population _
sheepskin processing.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years, the village has grown these backyard businesses
into a multi-million dollar niche market. It now processes 5
million sheepskins a year, almost half of China's total sheepskin
imports. Most come from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Sangpo, the green fields along the side of the road
suddenly give way to row after row of short wooden tents, each with
a sheepskin on top laid out to dry. The streets inside the village
are also lined with drying sheepskins. Sangpo proudly calls itself
China's ``Fur City.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished products are exported to Turkey and Italy as
leather for shoes and handbags, to Russia as blankets and to the
United States as sheepskin carseat covers. The arrival of the
Internet two years ago has not only been a boon to business, it has
allowed bored youngsters a window to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shortened our distance with the rest of the
world,'' said Bai Huzhan, Sangpo's Communist vice-party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sangpo is an anomaly in China or a sign of things to
come remains to be seen. Some rural areas have started using the
Internet to post pricing and market information for farmers, but
the digital divide between rich and poor is still enormous, and
growing wider.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people have gone on-line in this country of
1.25 billion, according to the latest official estimates. But less
than 1 percent of the population even has Internet access, as users
are heavily concentrated in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials in Mengzhou County _ where Sangpo Village

 &HT;    Turner, Nunn team up to tackle nuclear threats
 &HT;    By Don Melvin and Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two of Georgia's most prominent citizens _ Atlanta
billionaire Ted Turner and former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn _ are teaming
up in a major effort to create a foundation dedicated to reducing
the threat of nuclear weapons and materials around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will announce today they are launching a study ``to
determine the impact that a private organization with significant
resources could have on reducing the nuclear threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which will last through December, will be supervised
by Nunn and will cost Turner between $400,000 and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal is much larger than a study. If Nunn's inquiries
show that a private organization could play a useful role, the most
likely outcome would be the creation of a well-funded foundation
paid for by Turner and run by Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly a possibility that Ted and I have
discussed,'' Nunn said Wednesday in a telephone interview from
Monterey, Calif., where he was attending an international
conference on nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has long been known for the bold philanthropic stroke. In
1991, he created the Turner Foundation, which grants tens of
millions of dollars a year to organizations concerned with
protecting the environment and reducing population growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Turner announced he would give $1 billion over 10 years
to United Nations-related projects. So far, that effort has awarded
more than $275 million to projects around the world dealing with
children's health, population and women's issues, peace and
security, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn would not say how much money Turner is willing to devote to
the new effort to curb nuclear weapons, saying the amount will
depend on the results of the study. But it will be a significant
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted has made clear to me that he is talking about a very
substantial commitment and very substantial resources,'' Nunn said.
``He has talked in terms of an effort of what I would call
unprecedented magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn termed Turner's dedication to the project as equal to his
commitment to the U.N. Foundation, though the financial
contribution may not be as great.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was not available Wednesday for an interview, his office
said. But a statement issued by Turner said recent discussions with
experts have taught him two important things:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, in the post-Cold War era, the nuclear threat has
become, in many ways, more complex and dangerous. Second, if we are
to reduce the nuclear threat, we need to raise public awareness and
inspire leadership and cooperation around the world. It is my hope
that this scoping study will determine whether _ and if so, how _
we can play a role in meeting that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort brings together two men of huge accomplishments and
vastly different styles.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 61, the founder of CNN and a vice chairman of Time
Warner, has a reputation as a brash, sometimes impulsive achiever
who tends to want things done yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn, also 61 and former chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, is known as a methodical and deliberate statesman more
inclined to caution than impulse.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-senator from Perry acknowledged those differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different styles not just on the surface, but probably
when you scratch down a ways,'' Nunn said with a soft laugh. ``But
that's one of the questions _ can we basically complement each
other and use the strengths each of us has to tackle what I think
is the most important security question facing mankind? And I
believe we can, and Ted believes we can. But we want to make sure
we have a meeting of the minds, and where we differ we want to make
sure that those differences are things that are not going to block
a successful effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said he and Turner have traits in common, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted is known as someone who is bold and gets things done,'' he
said. ``I hope I'm seen as someone who gets things done. This
combination is what's exciting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement expected today will say the study will examine
the effect a private organization could have on four areas:
</P>
<P>
   _Stemming the proliferation of nuclear weapons, materials and
know-how.
</P>
<P>
   _Enhancing the security and safety of nuclear weapons and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing the chances of intentional or accidental use of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _Building the trust, accountability and confidence essential to
progress in arms reductions and in furthering the goals of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said he has been involved in nuclear issues since 1974,
when he visited a NATO tactical nuclear weapons base and concluded
that one of our greatest challenges was preventing the accidental
or unauthorized use of the weapons. His involvement as a senator
increased further after the breakup of the Soviet Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Turner have been discussing this initiative for several
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said that the threat of an all-out nuclear war has
diminished significantly in the past 10 or 12 years. But the danger
is not over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the threat of the use of a nuclear weapon by some
group at some point in time in the next few years has gone up,'' he
said. ``Now that's a big distinction but it's an important one,
because proliferation is occurring, nuclear knowledge is spreading,
the ability to make nuclear weapons that was formerly mainly
governments' is now spread through the Internet. ... One of the key
things is preventing the nuclear materials from joining up with the
know-how in terrorist groups or in irresponsible nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said whether a private foundation can play a significant
role will be determined, in important respects, by the answers to
two questions. One is whether a distinction between what
governments ought to do and what private organizations ought to do
can be successfully made. The other is whether Turner's money can
induce other organizations and governments to increase their own
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn, who is a partner in the Atlanta law firm King &AMP; Spalding,
will carry out the study with Charles Curtis, a former deputy
secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said the study will determine which, among what he said
were hundreds of needs, might be best filled by a foundation. He
cited these possibilities as examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Helping, through high-risk investments, commercial businesses
dispose of nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   _Helping scientists in Russia's ``nuclear cities'' _ about 10
isolated cities that have both the experts and the materials
necessary to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but to
which funding has been cut _ obtain ``gainful, meaningful,
constructive employment'' so they are not tempted or forced to sell
their expertise elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _Helping dismantle missile-carrying submarines. ``There are all
these nuclear reactors on 100 Russian submarines, and nobody is
addressing the problem and they are just deteriorating in the
oceans of the world,'' Nunn said. The foundation might use its
money to convince governments as those in the Scandinavian
countries and Japan to spend some of their money to dismantle the
submarines and protect their own environments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _Being available to engage in private diplomacy in areas such as
India and Pakistan, if the U.S. government cannot. Such efforts,
Nunn said, would be undertaken only in close coordination with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is spending $600 million to $700 million a
year on nuclear arms control. The foundation wants to work with the
government, supplementing _ but certainly not replacing _ its
efforts, Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting others to ante up, he said, the initiative will
be doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't leverage this money,'' Nunn said, ``even Ted's
fortunes are not enough to penetrate the problem.''

 &HT;    Turner, Nunn team up to tackle nuclear threats
 &HT;    By Don Melvin and Maria Saporta

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two of Georgia's most prominent citizens _ Atlanta
billionaire Ted Turner and former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn _ are teaming
up in a major effort to create a foundation dedicated to reducing
the threat of nuclear weapons and materials around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will announce today they are launching a study ``to
determine the impact that a private organization with significant
resources could have on reducing the nuclear threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which will last through December, will be supervised
by Nunn and will cost Turner between $400,000 and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal is much larger than a study. If Nunn's inquiries
show that a private organization could play a useful role, the most
likely outcome would be the creation of a well-funded foundation
paid for by Turner and run by Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly a possibility that Ted and I have
discussed,'' Nunn said Wednesday in a telephone interview from
Monterey, Calif., where he was attending an international
conference on nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has long been known for the bold philanthropic stroke. In
1991, he created the Turner Foundation, which grants tens of
millions of dollars a year to organizations concerned with
protecting the environment and reducing population growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Turner announced he would give $1 billion over 10 years
to United Nations-related projects. So far, that effort has awarded
more than $275 million to projects around the world dealing with
children's health, population and women's issues, peace and
security, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn would not say how much money Turner is willing to devote to
the new effort to curb nuclear weapons, saying the amount will
depend on the results of the study. But it will be a significant
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted has made clear to me that he is talking about a very

EVOLUTION IN THE INTERNET CHAT ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   If you're having trouble finding
stimulating, intellectual conversation in Internet ``chat rooms,''
it could be because you're talking to a chimp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least that's the theory postulated by Weekly World News, the
New York Times of supermarket tabloids. (Motto: All the Bigfoot
news that's fit to print.)
</P>
<P>
   I personally try to stay away from Internet chat rooms because
my brain cells are winking out fast enough without them. Spend five
minutes in one of these rooms and you may lose the ability to spell
or form complete sentences, which may account for their appeal with
young people.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a brief but verbatim transcript _ with the names
changed _ of the typed conversation that took place in an America
Online chat room early last week. The subject was Britney Spears,
who is a pop singer or perhaps a new doll from Mattel; it was
impossible to tell from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   AngieJo1222: yo yo what up?
</P>
<P>
   RYC33: nothin
</P>
<P>
   Americagrrl09: what are yall up 2
</P>
<P>
   BassNoFool88: Wazup
</P>
<P>
   TicsNTacs667: Britney Spears is FKAE, cheap and plastic
</P>
<P>
   AngieJo1222: ?
</P>
<P>
   Americagrrl09: nothin
</P>
<P>
   AngieJo1222: me i dumo?
</P>
<P>
   Casey91121: boys are dumb
</P>
<P>
   AngieJo1222: im a cheerleader
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean to single these people out. You will find
conversations operating on the same protozoan level in just about
any chat room you care to visit. The only difference is that the
one I chose to quote is less obscene than most.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the chimps. According to Weekly World News, animal
experts in the United States, Canada and Europe have been working
with chimpanzees and have taught them how to distinguish words on a
computer screen and type in short responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet expert'' George Leriger said the chimps can't type
long, complex sentences but they can respond with yes, no and other
simple phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Leriger does not say so specifically, but I would have to think
the list of ``other simple phrases'' would include ``wazup?'' ``me
i dumo'' and ``im a cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds a whole new dynamic to the Internet chat
scene, particularly for people seeking romantic encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems impossible that `yes' and `no' responses and an
occasional show of affection could be enough to make a person on
the other end of he computer think they've found a love interest,''
Leriger said. ``But we have looked at transcripts from the chimps'
computers and it's clear that has happened quite a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't see anything wrong with this. If young
people want to chat with a chimp on the Internet, that's fine with
me. It's probably more intellectually stimulating than other things
they could be doing, such as watching TV or listening to their CDs.
</P>
<P>
   What effect this is having on the chimps, on the other hand, is
hard to say. Some people might consider it cruel to put a chimp in
a chat room with a bunch of hormonally gorged 14-year-olds, but I
would presume the chimp would have enough sense to log off if
things got too weird.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, you never know. Some cheerleaders can be pretty cute.
</P>

NEVER, NEVER TAKE APART YOUR OWN PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wait'll the garage is built. Then we'll have room enough to
store a century of packrat stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, but isn't there a law out there that says, if there
is space available, it will be overfilled, instantly?
</P>
<P>
   At least the garage is coming soon, with room even for the car,
and to store all the stuff that was taken out of the toolhouse that
had to be torn down to make way for the garage.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, all that stuff is now flooding the basement, the
house, and the yard. We are not hoping for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the toolhouse had to go. It was a nice building that I
built in August 1972, during the Fischer-Spaasky chess match.
</P>
<P>
   My wife called it the toolhouse of the August moon. That was
nice, and it could have been called Walden because it was the exact
size and shape as Thoreau's famous hut at Walden Pond.
</P>
<P>
   It would have cost $500 to tear down and haul away. (Thoreau's
hut was, what, $6.98? As I contemplated that with tears rolling
down my cheeks, John, my son-in-law, came up with a brilliant idea:
Why not take it down and put it up somewhere else in the yard?
It'll be a piece of cake for the handyman, and save a buck, too.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the toolhouse was taken apart and is in pieces in the
yard, ready for reassembly.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no piece of cake. And here is the lesson for today:
Never, never take apart something that you put together. Being an
amateur, you will have overbuilt it, using half again as many
nails, using galvanized nails where they were not necessary (they
hold like crazy, and are equally difficult to pull), and glopping
up the roof with way too much roof cement.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with all this overbuilding, except when
you take it down. Misery, misery. Roofing cement is great stuff;
once applied, it never comes off. Well, hardly ever.
</P>
<P>
   First, the roof had to go. One does not save asphalt roofing
shingles, but we did save the sheathing plywood and rafters. All
with the help of David, my husky son. It could not have been done
without him.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever watched a crew scraping off roof shingles, you can
understand the problem. It is hard work, but with a certain amount
of luck and a lot of elbow grease, they come off in great sections,
not individually.
</P>
<P>
   Usually you can use a square-bladed shovel to rip off the
shingles. I found the perfect tool for this. It is called the MUTT,
which stands for Mighty Useful Tough Tool. It looks like a
long-handled ice cutter, but with a much heavier blade, and a sharp
one, too. It is no longer sharp, but it served well to rip off
those shingles, hitting a few dozen nails in the effort. It will
also handle ice, tiles, and roots with aplomb, with a strong back
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   It may be available in lumber stores.It was made by Dick Davis
of Pasadena, Calif., but a number I had listed for him has been
disconnected. Alas.
</P>
<P>
   Other useful tools in our project (and they are readily
available) were a flatbar (a short, wide, flat prying tool), a
ripping hammer, one or more pinch bars, (a 2-foot prying tool with
a wedge at one end and a hook at the other).
</P>
<P>
   And, a really heavy crowbar. Get one that weighs maybe 20 pounds
or more (about the weight of a Civil War musket). About 6 feet
long, it makes a great prying tool as well as a sledgehammer of
sorts. You can really batter off plywood sheets with this, without
wrecking the plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everything down to the four walls was easy. Separating
the walls was not. The plan was to leave the walls with the
sheathing and shingles intact, and move them elsewhere for
reassembly someday. Finally, they were separated.
</P>
<P>
   We sort of thought that the walls, just 10 to 12 feet long and 6
feet high, would be heavy, but wow, not that heavy. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, with one end on a wheelbarrow and the other in the
strong, capable hands of David, we pushed and grunted all four
walls, one at a time, to the new site, awaiting reassembly.
</P>
<P>
   All right, bring on the garage makers!

IT'S OFFICIAL: THE THUNDERBIRD RETURNS IN '02 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the buzzing afterglow that automobile designers and
manufacturers dream about. They unveil a new model at an auto show
and the reaction is electric.
</P>
<P>
   Build it, the public demands. The buzz lingers; the demand is
unending. What's a manufacturer to do? Curiously, however, the
latest buzz vehicles have been, rather than something totally new,
a step back in time. Hence, Volkswagen's New Beetle and Chrysler's
PT Cruiser. See them in a parking space near you.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, readers have asked me.
</P>
<P>
   I give you the Ford Thunderbird, another retro intro, unveiled
as a concept car at the 1999 Detroit International Auto Show. There
has been a constant buzz about the T-Bird ever since. And now it is
official: Ford will build a two-seat Thunderbird beginning next
year and sell it for the 2002 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the New Beetle, like the PT Cruiser, it is not really a
retro car. It is purely evocative and that is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to those mid-1950s Thunderbirds, before Ford lost its
way and made them bigger and uglier down the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ford itself acknowledges the history of the T-Bird to be one of
``glory years, dark days'' but now proclaims a triumphant return.
Thankfully, with its mesh grille, rounded and subtle lines, and
seating for just two, Ford is giving us the best of what the T-Bird
once was. It is reaching back through the decades, through designs
called ``square,'' ``projectile,'' ``jet aircraft,'' and
``luxury,'' through variations that included four doors and
horrific, bulging noses, to give us the car they dreamed up in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   This was in 1954 _ for the '55 model year. The goal, in upbeat,
postwar America was a two-passenger, canvas-topped sports car. They
wanted it under 3,000 pounds, V-8 powered, and capable of topping
100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ford delivered a car just over 3,000 pounds with a 102-inch
wheelbase and overall length of 175 inches. It sat just 52 inches
high and was powered by a 292-cubic-inch V8. Price? $3,000-$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to name the car, there was some debate.
Imagine if any of these suggestions had been adopted: Beaver, Hep
Cat, Arcturus, or El Tigre. Would we be panting today over the
reintroduction of the Hep Cat?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the new Thunderbird draws its lines not from any of
the abominations of the 1970s and '80s, but instead from the '50s
with a dash of the 1961 model tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   The two-seater was a huge success. But Ford, for some reason,
had to tinker with it. The changes for 1956 were fine _ better
cabin ventilation, more trunk space created by moving the spare
tire outside above the rear bumper. Even the portholes in the rear
of the hardtop roof had a certain class to them. But by 1957, the
two-seater was dead. Killed by a bad case of big and ugly. For the
next four decades, we got four-seaters, long roofs, fender skirts,
sharp sculpted lines that looked more Lincoln Continental than
sports car, and those deeply-browed twin headlights. The brows
looked like George Chuvalo after Muhammad Ali pounded on him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1958, the wheelbase had grown to 113 inches and the car was
nearly three feet longer than the original. It also weighed nearly
two tons. The T-Bird retained this ``square'' look until 1961 when
the ``projectile'' look _ with cleaner body lines and sharply
creased where hood met grille _ was introduced. This was a better
looking car, but by the mid-'60s square was back and the ugly
plunge continued.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, the T-Bird had hit the wall. It got a long hood that
ended in an extruded aluminum grille, called a ``poke-thru-nose.''
The designer of this 4,551-pound behemoth should have been poked in
the nose. By 1997, the T-Bird was, mercifully, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's coming back. New platform, new power, new technology.
More on that in a later column. For now, let's just enjoy the
new/old lines. We're gonna party like it's 1955.

AUTO INDUSTRY RETHINKING THE FUTURE OF SUVS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ America's marriage with sport utility vehicles has
always been a love-hate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   We love them for their utility, the sense of security they give
to occupants, and what they say about our active lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   We hate them for their gas-guzzling and environmentally harmful
ways, their tendency to tip over, the threat to occupants of
smaller vehicles, and what they say about our selfish lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors' Desert Proving Grounds in Mesa, college teams
from 15 engineering schools around the country worked recently, in
a program called FutureTruck, to help save the marriage. Each team
was given a new Chevrolet Suburban, modest financial backing, and
free expert advice. Their mission: Build the SUV of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge came as SUVs and pickups (classified, along with
vans, by the government as trucks) approach a regulatory and
consumer crossroads _ over safety questions, the reality of
escalating gasoline prices, and stricter government rules on
emissions and gasoline mileage _ even as their sales numbers
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive News projects that this year 9,138,184 trucks will be
built in North America, and 8,172,244 cars. By 2004, that gap will
widen from 9,692,789 to 7,492,446.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation, says Shelley Launey, director of the Clean
Cities Program for the US Department of Energy, that could put both
the FutureTruck participants and their experimental vehicles at the
heart of efforts to build a cleaner, more efficient fleet of
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Already manufacturers recognize the conflict between consumers'
hearts and consciences. Ford Motor Co. recently acknowledged in
presenting its corporate annual report that its SUVs need to be
cleaner and safer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Toyota had announced, even as it unveiled the latest in
what will be a fleet of five SUV models, that it needs to become
``greener'' in its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   And before that, Dodge announced that its popular Durango will
be offered with a 6-cylinder, hybrid gasoline-electric engine that
is cleaner, gets better mileage, and is stronger than its current
V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of testing the Suburbans at the Desert Proving Grounds
showed that GM and the students _ along with Dodge and its Durango
SUV _ are riding what could become a wave of hybrids that use
electric motors to boost the efforts of smaller gasoline engines.
It exploits technology that is already being introduced in cars
from Toyota, Honda, Ford, and GM.
</P>
<P>
   Students, engineers, and industry officials all agreed that the
lineup of rebuilt Suburbans at the Desert Proving Grounds was
symbolic of where America stands today in its efforts to build
cleaner, more efficient vehicles. Of the 15, there were no solely
electric SUVs; 14 of them were some variation of the hybrid, and
the one fuel cell vehicle (a technology believed to be 10-20 years
away) was lacking a major component: the fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell _ with liquid hydrogen as its key element _
generates electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a
reaction with only two byproducts: water vapor and heat. But it
remains prohibitively expensive _ as much as $1 million for a
single cell today.
</P>
<P>
   In hybrids, electric motors work in conjunction with regular
gasoline engines, sometimes powering the vehicle themselves on
short trips or at times working to boost the power of the gas
engine that would be smaller than typically used. When the vehicle
is running on the gas engine, braking causes the electric motor to
work as a generator, charging the car's batteries for future use.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Insight and Toyota's Prius, two small cars powered by
hybrid engines, are selling well in the United States, and both
will probably become the basis for hybrid models of more standard
autos. Honda will offer its popular Civic model in the United
States as a hybrid beginning in 2002. GM and Ford have displayed
high-mileage prototypes of hybrid sedans.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that trucks now outsell cars in the United
States, and that they tend to consume far more fuel than their
smaller counterparts, specialists say that modest gains in fuel
efficiency in the truck fleet would be more beneficial than strides
in smaller vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as gasoline prices soared this spring and summer,
there was no noticeable effect on the sales of trucks and SUVs.
Those in the industry, from Ron Zarella, president of General
Motors-North America, to Don Madden, a local Ford dealer, say that
SUVs continue to sell because people who can afford to drop $40,000
to $50,000 for a vehicle aren't fazed by spending a few hundred
dollars more per year for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But reform is surely on the way. Half of the participants in
this year's and subsequent FutureTruck competitions will end up
with jobs in the auto industry, said Launey of the Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll bring with them the interest in and understanding of
advanced vehicle technology that includes an appreciation of fuel
economy and reduced emissions,'' Launey said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the fuel cell concept appearing ``like it's a long time
before it's going to be competitive,'' she added, ``any program
where maintaining the power and utility of the vehicle is the goal,
you almost have to be hybrid.''
</P>
<P>
   So the students from colleges and universities in the United
States and Canada came to FutureTruck _ sponsored by GM, the
Department of Energy and Yahoo.com _ with hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Institute of Technology kept the stock 5.3-liter V-8
Vortec engine that came in the Suburban, burned reformulated
gasoline and aided it with a high-torque electric motor to help cut
gasoline consumption during heavy tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Davis powered its Suburban with
a 1.9-liter Saturn engine and aided it with an electric motor that
kicked in to help with acceleration and towing.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland went with a 3.8-liter 6-cylinder
engine that ran on ethanol and was boosted by an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Wisconsin replaced the Suburban's steel frame
with an aluminum frame to save weight.
</P>
<P>
   And West Virginia University coupled a 4.2-liter turbocharged
diesel engine with an electric motor and managed a powerful 260
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The schools competed in safety, performance, towing ability,
greenhouse emissions, fuel economy, and consumer acceptability. No
one offered radical safety solutions _ though advances in this area
are already coming from manufacturers in the form of SUVs and
trucks with lower impact rails to prevent them from climbing over
smaller vehicles in crashes. In addition, manufacturers are
planning a host of SUVs that more closely resemble the
old-fashioned station wagon with big but safer lower stances.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for gasoline mileage and environmental
improvements presented by the students was impressive, judges said.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia, whose Suburban reduced greenhouse emissions 23
percent, was the overall winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech truck won the towing competition, a grueling
test through 112-degree heat across the arid landscape, even as it
saved gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   And the UC-Davis SUV, which can run on strictly electric power
while in the city, managed 18.7 miles per gallon, nearly a 20
percent increase over stock Suburban performance.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers must still be convinced that hybrid powerplants can
perform much like standard engines _ and Honda's Insight is
apparently doing just that as sales have persuaded the manufacturer
to boost its 2000 production for the United States from 4,000 to
6,500 and expand the hybrid concept to the Civic.
</P>
<P>
   So the marketplace and the SUV experimenters appear to be moving
in the same direction: more efficient and more environmentally
friendly hybrid power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have electric until we have the fuel cell, and right
now nobody's got it,'' said Luciano Martin, the technical adviser
for the team from Montreal's Concordia University. ``Right now,
hybrid is what we've got.''

 &HT;    Here's some advice: Never bet on relatives in a horse race
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSSIER CITY, La. _ My cousins are having a rough day on the
ponies. I keep laying money on their nags to no avail, so that by
the seventh race I'm down $185.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the Bourque brothers, Coby and Cody, are really
my cousins, though they share my mother's maiden name. (Actually, I
don't know for sure if they're even brothers, though the odds are
good given the similarity of their first names and the fact they're
both riding horses here in Louisiana.) If kin, they're the Cajun
branch of the family, descendants of the group that had the good
sense to migrate south from Canada. My mother's side of the family
left Canada also but only made it as far as New Hampshire and
Massachusetts. My mother has lived in East Texas for more than 30
years but still considers herself a Yankee here only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I like to think of these two jockeys riding the nags in
the July Louisiana sun as shirt-tail kin and given that Bourque
(pronounced Burke up north and Bork in Louisiana) isn't a terribly
common name, there's the possibility. My mother firmly believes
that anyone even mildly famous with this surname is related,
including an NHL player and other minor luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is a physical resemblance in that all Bourques are
potential jockey material, myself included _ if I shrunk about 3
inches and lost 50 pounds. I had a great-uncle named Alexander who
was a midget and ran a bicycle shop in Canada, or so the story
goes. My 93-year-old grandmother was four-feet-11 before old age
stooped her, and now she's about the length of a Big Bertha driver.
</P>
<P>
   My wife has gone off with her daughter deep into Arcadia for a
beauty pageant, so I talk a couple of friends into heading to
Louisiana Downs to donate some money to the Edwin Edwards defense
fund. We are lucky enough to be seated next to an acquaintance of
my friends, who hails from Timpson, owns racehorses and has three
racing today. Jerry Bob Nix and his wife, Kay, are congenial table
neighbors and graciously take us down to tour the winner's circle
before his first race. They introduce us to their trainer and to
the jockey _ not one of the Bourques _ who is riding their horses
today.
</P>
<P>
   We stand in the winner's circle as that race's entries come
strolling by, magnificent beasts prancing nervously. I stand well
back so as not to cause a stampede with a false move.
</P>
<P>
   The jockey is, well, a small fellow, friendly and mud-spattered.
I also get to shake hands with the guy who plays the bugle to call
horses to the gate, which I've always thought is a way-cool job.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bob's first horse is named Alkahaulit. Sound it out. One
of this horse's relatives was named Beer Belly Bob. I'm not making
this up.
</P>
<P>
   This is Alkahaulit's first race, and he's a 35-1 longshot. Jerry
Bob gives the jockey some advice, which mainly consists of making
sure the horse heads out the gate in the right direction and
doesn't get hurt. I go in to make a bet, and the owner gives me
some advice: ``I wouldn't be betting real heavily on that one. It's
his first race, and there's no telling what he'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   I heed the advice and put a modest $6 on Alkahaulit across the
board, meaning if he finishes in the top three I'm in the money. He
finishes next-to-last, but Jerry Bob is satisfied, says the horse
will win a race before the season is over. I have no reason to
dispute this.
</P>
<P>
   His second horse is a near-favorite, and I put a 10-spot on him.
He takes the lead heading into the stretch but fades and ends up
third, which pays a modest profit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bourques are killing me in the other races. I bet
a trifecta and forget to box it. (Horse lingo: A trifecta is when
you predict the top three finishers. You can pay extra and box it,
which means it doesn't matter what order they finish in, as long as
you've picked the right three horses.) I picked the right three
horses, but not in the right order. Near as I could figure, this
mental error meant I lost out on winning about $400 on one race.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I give up on the cousins. Blood may be thicker than
water, but this was getting expensive. l start betting randomly,
making my picks on the color of the horses, their names and other
random trivia. On the eighth race I hit a longshot exacta (picking
the top two finishers) and win $217 on a $10 bet. I lose a bit more
in the last two races but walk out just a sawbuck or so lighter
than when I walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad price to pay for meeting a real-live horse owner, a
jockey and the bugle player all in one day.

 &HT;    50 ways to kill your catalytic converter
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do you ever get a song in your head that plays over
and over until you think it's going to drive you nuts? This week's
miscellaneous unscheduled manufacturers maintenance item, or MUMMI,
has been rattling around in my brain with a slightly different
twist to the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got your dead skunk in the middle of the road ... stinkin'
to high heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Only instead if ``skunk'' I've been thinking ``cat.'' I'm not
talking about our feline friends, I'm thinking about a catalytic
converter, known in the industry as a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive cats don't stink when they die, but they can emit an
odor that will rival the rottenest egg before their demise. Not all
cats will produce this sulfurous warning symptom.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost as many ways to kill a cat as Paul Simon's ``50
Ways to Leave Your Lover.'' Oh good, now I can start thinking of a
new song.
</P>
<P>
   Catalytic converters began establishing their dubious reputation
from the moment they made their debut on most passenger vehicles in
the mid-1970s. The American motoring public, seduced by the '60s
muscle-car mentality of bigger and faster, was not prepared to pay
the price for Detroit's years of decadence.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle manufacturers scrambled for ways to make their engines
pollute less. Engine performance was sacrificed to many of these
infant pollution control devices, which were countered with
widespread disabling or destruction of those components.
</P>
<P>
   The catalytic converter _ an unobtrusive mufflerlike gizmo _
usually remained intact until its overwhelming noxious odor and
floor-mat-melting, grass-fire starting qualities elevated it to the
most hated smog parts list.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's cats seldom melt carpets or start fires, their
reputation stays with them. Consequently, they have been misused,
abused or, at best, ignored, only getting attention when either the
vehicle won't get out of its own way or it fails an emissions test.
Unfortunately, many cats are simply replaced without regard to the
reason they failed in the first place. They rarely die of their own
accord. Something kills them.
</P>
<P>
   The inside of a catalytic converter is a delicate network of
honeycomb passages coated with a thin plating of platinum and
palladium to reduce hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions and
rhodium to reduce nitrous oxides. The total surface ``exhaust gas
contact'' area supposedly is about the size of three football
fields, give or take a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   When a properly running engine's exhaust passes through the cat,
a chemical reaction occurs, and almost all of the exhaust emissions
are converted to harmless carbon dioxide and water. If the engine
is malfunctioning or the ``service engine soon'' light is on, cat
murder is being committed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top ways to kill your cat is with poison. In the old
days, leaded fuel was the leading cat poison, but that is not an
issue anymore unless you drive your vehicle in a foreign country
that still uses lead in gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Other cat (and oxygen sensor) poisons are silicone and engine
oil. Silicone is a lubricant used in antifreeze and some aerosol
sprays and can also be found in some ``form-a-gasket'' products.
</P>
<P>
   It can be introduced into the exhaust system several ways. The
most common is an internal coolant leak, usually resulting from
damage done to an overheated engine, including a ``blown'' head
gasket, cracked head or block. Silicone lubricant spray and gasket
goo fumes are sucked into the engine via the air intake.

 &HT;    A challenge in Dallas
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Rosa Meraz de Montoya, stuffing envelopes in an East
Dallas campaign office, cares about the 5th District congressional
election more than the average volunteer. She wants her only
daughter to go to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my princess,'' said Montoya, who also has three boys.
</P>
<P>
   Dallasite Regina Montoya Coggins, 46, a graduate of Wellesley
and Harvard Law School, is running a surprisingly well-financed
campaign to unseat two-term Republican Pete Sessions.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of two Texas seats Democrats hope to recapture this
year. The other is the 14th District, stretching from Austin to the
Gulf Coast, where Loy Sneary of Bay City is trying again to unseat
Republican Ron Paul of Surfside.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th includes normally Republican-leaning Lake Highlands in
Dallas County and stretches south and east through
Democratic-leaning territory 180 miles to Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   While Sessions enjoyed a large lead in name identification in
May, it is too soon to predict what will happen on Election Day,
after each candidate has spent close to $1 million on TV and direct
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the 5th is an extraordinary opportunity for us,''
said Democrat Martin Frost, who has represented the adjoining 24th
District for 11 terms. If the Democrats shift just six seats,
they'll regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya Coggins ``is running a very good campaign,'' Frost said.
The wife of U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins has already raised more than
$1 million and is still bringing it in.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, 45, a Waco native with a degree from Southwestern
University, is the son of former FBI director and current federal
Judge William Sessions. His brief record is one of the most
conservative in the House.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years with Southwestern Bell, Sessions quit to run
against 12-year incumbent John Bryant in 1994. Sessions lost, with
47 percent. But when Bryant ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996,
Sessions got 53 percent against Democrat John Pouland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sessions received almost 56 percent while outspending
Victor Morales, who was also the 1996 Democratic nominee for the
U.S. Senate, by a 7-1 ratio. Democrats John Sharp for lieutenant
governor and Paul Hobby for comptroller narrowly carried the
district in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya Coggins is well-connected. She has been on corporate
boards, the board of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, a partner in
the politically connected Akin, Gump law firm, and has a long
string of civic activities, including a recent stint as national
president of Girls Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a list of people supporting me, it is a who's
who of the business community,'' said Montoya Coggins, who also
served as Bill Clinton's director of the Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's a moderate against a right-wing Republican who
voted ``yes'' on overriding President Clinton's veto of so-called
partial-birth abortions and ``no'' on things such as spending
federal money for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Sessions is out of touch with his district,'' says
Montoya Coggins, who supports abortion rights and lists education
and a prescription-drug payment program under Medicare as principal
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions' campaign manager, businessman Gary Griffith, concedes
Montoya Coggins has shown powerful fund-raising ability. But
Sessions, a member of the money-attracting Banking and Financial
Services Committee, will be at least as well-financed, Griffith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actively engaged in organizing for a campaign this
fall,'' Griffith said, ``and I think Pete Sessions is taking this
race as seriously as any he's ever run.''
</P>
<P>
   Pouland says Montoya Coggins will enjoy a 20-year base in Lake
Highlands that he didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets 35 percent there, she'll win,'' Pouland said. ``I
think she'll win the race by about 2 percent.''

THE MACARTHUR GENIUSES: HOW TO BECOME ONE OF THEM

<P>
   When Peter Hayes learned that he had won a $500,000 MacArthur
genius grant in June, he was stunned: It's ``like being hit by a
Mack truck. ... It's a little disorienting,'' he told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes shouldn't have been too disoriented. It would have been
surprising if he hadn't collected a MacArthur. He helps North Korea
develop windmills as an alternative to nuclear power. He takes
underprivileged kids sailing in San Francisco Bay during his free
time. And he lives in Berkeley, Calif., where you can't buy a latte
without meeting a MacArthur-stamped brainiac.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
has awarded 588 ``fellowships'' worth nearly $200 million to
Americans ``who show exceptional merit and promise for continued
and enhanced creative work.'' The foundation detests the word
``genius'' because it ``because it connotes a singular
characteristic of intellectual prowess.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship is a no-strings-attached grant: Each 2000 winner
will get $100,000 a year for five years. MacArthur calls the cash a
gift of time, because it frees winners from financial constraints
on their art, science, or activism.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion foundation is the estate of John D. MacArthur, a
skinflint who became the second-richest American by selling
cut-rate insurance through the mail. His son Rod grabbed control of
the trust after John's 1978 death and pushed the genius project.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur has become the United States' most famous
philanthropy project not because it rewards stellar people _ though
it does _ but because it's mysterious. Several hundred talent
scouts, whose identities are secret, suggest nominees to the
selection committee. The committee, whose members are also secret,
covertly gathers dossiers on the nominees and selects two-dozen odd
winners.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where self-promotion is a constitutional right, the
MacArthur is endlessly frustrating: You can't nominate yourself,
you can't nominate a friend, you can't lobby for it if you are
nominated. What's an unappreciated genius to do?
</P>
<P>
   Don't fear, the MacArthur is less cryptic than it seems. It can
be gamed. You may not be able to guarantee yourself half-a-million
bucks and a reputation for brilliance, but you can certainly
improve your odds. Here's a how-to guide for becoming a certifiable
genius.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 1: Live in New York or San Francisco. New Yorkers and
San Franciscans act like they're the most interesting people in the
world. MacArthur agrees with them. Fully one-sixth of all
MacArthurs live in Manhattan, and nearly as many live in the Bay
Area. Six of this year's 25 MacArthurs are Manhattanites, and three
are from Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, don't live in the South. Southerners rarely
qualify as geniuses unless they're sensitive writers or colorful
advocates for the poor. This year's only Southern winner is
typical: Auburn Professor Samuel Mockbee builds houses for poor
Alabamans out of old tires and hay bales. The Great Plains and
Rockies are equally inhospitable to genius: You're unlikely to win
unless you've started a bank or college on an Indian reservation.
Stick to the Northeast and the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 2: Be a professor. Specifically, be a professor at
Harvard or Stanford, where they hand out MacArthurs like candy. If
you're a humanities professor, choose Harvard (which has 35
MacArthurs) or University of California, Berkeley (which has 23).
</P>
<P>
   Hard scientists should land a job at Stanford (24) or Princeton
(20). Physicists at one of those two universities seem to win
MacArthurs more easily than tenure. In a pinch, University of
Chicago, University of Michigan, Columbia, and New York University
are acceptable backups, but avoid Yale! It's got only six geniuses.
You'd be better off with Bard College, whose tiny faculty has won
four MacArthurs.
</P>
<P>
   As Harvard grads have always suspected, Yale is approximately
one-sixth as good as Harvard.a
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough to be a professor. You also must choose the
right specialty. Ancient civilizations win MacArthurs. Revisionist
scholars of classical Greece do well, and MacArthur has identified
not one, but two geniuses who decipher ancient Mayan glyphs and a
third who deciphers ancient Andean knotted mnemonic devices
(whatever they may be).
</P>
<P>
   Literature, philosophy, and history all win plenty of
MacArthurs. Economics is unpromising, unless you study something
odd. 2000 winner Matthew Rabin, for example, analyzes the economic
implications of procrastination.
</P>
<P>
   Physics, math, and computer science are beloved of MacArthur.
Chemistry is a lost cause. Environmentalism is a sure winner.
Biologists should study evolution, dinosaurs, or primates, and
little else.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 3: If you don't want to teach college, make art.
Preferably in New York: One in 10 MacArthurs is a writer,
choreographer, artist, musician, or director in New York City.
Again, pick the right specialty. Be a poet or a choreographer.
Novelists, painters, and film directors seem underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   Among musicians, jazz is good, and free jazz is even better.
Needless to say, no matter what kind of artist you are, be
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 4: Do not, under any circumstances, work for the
government or the private sector. This cannot be stressed enough.
Many MacArthur geniuses advocate government activism, but all
fellows assiduously avoid public service. I found only two
MacArthur winners from the public sector, small-town Mayor Unita
Blackwell and then-Congressional Budget Office Director Alice
Rivlin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, geniuses should not soil themselves with earning a
profit. It's fine to run a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged
people start their own businesses, but almost no MacArthurs run or
work for profit-seeking corporations.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 5: Upset conventional wisdom. You don't have to be
right, but you must be provocative. It's not enough to study
quantum physics. You must, like 1999 winner Eva Silverstein,
``question the fundamentals of quantum physics.''
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur honored the classicist who reinterpreted the Parthenon
friezes as a human sacrifice and the paleontologist who says that
Tyrannosaurus Rex ate carrion rather than hunted.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a mathematician, set yourself one of math's great
insoluble problems: MacArthur knighted Andrew Wiles for cracking
Fermat's Theorem and Michael Freedman for proving the
four-dimensional case of Poincare's Conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   The best kind of provocation is a doomsday theory. MacArthur
adores folks who foresee the end of the world, especially if that
end is caused by Western avarice or stupidity. MacArthur has
blessed Paul ``Population Explosion'' Ehrlich; Richard Turco, who
popularized the idea of nuclear winter; and several scientists who
have sounded warnings about global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: MacArthur will soon reward someone who studies how
water shortage is plunging Africa and the Middle East into war.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 6: Be left wing. MacArthur generally finds genius on
the left. Only a handful of the 588 genies could be considered
conservative. Black community developer Robert Woodson is the most
notable. On the other hand, four Dissent editorial board members
have won the MacArthur, according to the American Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation likes artists who campaign for racial minorities
and the needy. Alfredo Jaar, a 2000 winner, creates art that
``focuses on injustices around the world _ poverty, exploitation,
genocide.'' 1997 winner Kara Walker constructs silhouettes about
racial and sexual exploitation. 2000 fellow David Isay produces
brilliant radio documentaries about the lives of poor Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation favors activists who fight for low-income
housing, disability rights, and racial justice. Libertarians,
religious conservatives, and free marketeers are never geniuses.
MacArthur routinely consecrates the causes celebres of the left,
from sex discrimination to right-wing human rights abuses in
Central America (see: Mark Danner, Tina Rosenberg, and Alma
Guillermoprieto).
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur's reliable support of left-wing causes makes it
fun to guess future winners. My bets: 1) Jerry Berman from the
Center for Democracy and Technology for lobbying to protect
Internet privacy; 2) an agriculture activist for showing the dire
health risks of genetically modified food; and 3) Edward Hopper,
author of The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS, for
theorizing that vaccination experiments in Southern Africa caused
the HIV virus to cross from monkeys to humans.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NO. 7: Be slightly, but not dangerously, quirky. MacArthur
favors the eccentric choice over the ordinary. Economist Rabin
wears tie-dyes, listens to Abba, and has Johnny Depp posters all
over his office wall. David Stuart won when he was an 18-year-old
prodigy. Recluse Thomas Pynchon took a MacArthur: Social butterfly
John Updike has not. And it surely helped Seattle ``sound
sculptor'' Trimpin that he goes by only one name.
</P>
<P>
   All the rules suggest that the perfect MacArthur genius is still
out there: a one-named Berkeley professor who choreographs
interpretative jazz dances about how genetically modified food will
destroy humanity.

 &HT;    Better manners might come in blink of a light
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of my greatest pleasures is driving an automobile.
For some people, it's golf, for others it's tennis, but for me, a
great vehicle and the open road say it all. Ah, the open road.
Around here, that is only a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   I hate Atlanta traffic and the ever-increasing congestion, but I
can live with it. The thing that drives me to distraction is the
decline in driving skills on our roadways. There seem to be no
rules, no regulations and a total lack of courtesy on the part of
most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I am overly optimistic to expect any better, based on
the absence of realistic driving training. When is it going to dawn
on our society that next to violence, the No. 1 weapon of death is
a moving vehicle? If we can't enlist our civic leaders to address
the growing problem, it falls upon the rest of us to address it if
by no other means than our personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I was traveling south on I-85. I was in the left lane,
but I was moving more quickly than the cars to my right. I also am
a driver who constantly watches her mirrors. Knowing what is behind
you as well as beside you is as important as knowing what is in
front of you.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine my shock when in my rearview mirror, I saw
what appeared to be the roof of a car behind me. Fifteen seconds
earlier, my backside was totally clear.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving my husband's compact truck, which has a low ride
level. The black roof of the vehicle in my mirror was as close as a
NASCAR racer in full draft mode.
</P>
<P>
   It was what I considered to be a completely unacceptable
situation. No, I didn't ``brake check'' the guy behind me. People
who do that are putting themselves in danger. But I didn't move
over. Why? Because the car behind me had already shown poor
judgment by his position, which made it a dangerous move for me to
change lanes.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea what his next move might be. The safest thing to
do was to maintain my position until I was sure that I had ample
room to move to the right.
</P>
<P>
   I activated my turn signal and waited. A mile or so later, when
the driver finally dropped back enough for me to see the front of
his new black Corvette, I safely made my lane change.
</P>
<P>
   He sped past me only to draft the next vehicle he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing an opening in the traffic, the guy darted right across
five lanes of traffic in one swift maneuver at what appeared to be
a speed close to 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a better way. Europeans have a much saner approach
to the passing dilemma. They simply blink their headlights.
Europeans don't take the blinking of headlights as a personal
assault; it is simply their automotive way of saying, ``Excuse me,
could I please get by?''
</P>
<P>
   As I see it, it would be a welcome addition to Atlanta drivers'
concept of Southern road hospitality.

   How to keep the SUPER in superheroes
</P>
<P>
   By Dave Larsen and Randy Palmer
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Movies based on comic books have produced some
super-duper box-office hits, but few have successfully translated
the often complex characters and intricate story lines of these
cartoon sagas to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Given the troubling cinematic fates of such costumed
crime-fighters as ``Batman'' and ``Superman,'' comics fans are
holding their collective breath for today's opening of ``''X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the top-selling Marvel series about genetic mutants
with superhuman powers, the highly anticipated film is directed by
Bryan Singer, whose credits include Oscar-winning indie ``The Usual
Suspects.'' The cast includes Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh
Jackman, Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry.
</P>
<P>
   With a host of additional superhero adventures on the horizon,
including ``Spider-Man'' and ``The Fantastic Four,'' we offer a
dozen do's and don'ts of comic-book movies.
</P>
<P>
   DO start with a compelling story, such as ``''X-Men'''s
allegorical tale of mutant heroes. The genetically sup-
</P>
<P>
   erior outcasts have human flaws, and fight to protect a world
that fears and hates them.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T expect flashy visuals to compensate for a weak script. As
``Spawn'' creator Todd McFarlane told Entertainment Weekly
magazine: ``Though some of the special effects were nice, we could
have made some of the characters a little meatier instead of
relying on big explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   DO outfit your superheroes in sculpted leather and rubber
costumes, as in ``X-Men'' and ``''Batman.'' Grown men in brightly
colored Spandex doesn't play well on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T put nipples on said leather and rubber costumes, as
director Joel Schumacher did with ``Batman &AMP; Robin.'' Save the
fetish wear for the privacy of the Batcave.
</P>
<P>
   DO justice to the material. ``Comic-book people tend to be
obsessed with respectability,'' Frank Miller said in Premiere
magazine. Miller's graphic novel, ``The Dark Knight Returns,''
influenced the bleak tone of Tim Burton's ``Batman,'' the best film
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' takes itself seriously, drawing parallels between
mutant persecution and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T go camp, as Schumacher did with the pun-drenched ``Batman
&AMP; Robin.'' Superhero spoofs also have been box-office kryptonite.
``Mystery Men'' was funny, but it failed to find an audience.
``Blankman'' was a dud and ``The Meteor Man'' fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   DO establish a set of rules and adhere to them. ``X-Men''
defines each characters' powers and uses the limits of those
abilities to advance the story.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T alter the characters' powers to service the plot. When
Superman moves at the speed of light near the end of ``Superman
II,'' audiences shouldn't be asking why he didn't do that sooner.
</P>
<P>
   DO consider offbeat and lesser-known comics. ``Men in Black,''
based on an obscure Marvel title, grossed $250 million _ just $1
million shy of ``Batman'''s box-office take. Other such adaptations
include ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' ``Mystery Men,'' ``The
Mask,'' ``Blade'' and ``The Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T assume that any character in a cape _ or other such
superhero apparel _ will leap to the top of the box-office chart.
``Tank Girl'' tanked. ``Howard the Duck'' laid a huge egg. ``The
Phantom'' didn't stand a ghost of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   DO hire an actor who can portray a superhero's inner conflict,
regardless of his or her physical relation to the comic book
character. Michael Keaton's ``Batman'' is a prime example, along
with ``X-Men'''s Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Anna Paquin (Rogue).
Intense but slightly built Tobey Maguire is director Sam Raimi's
top pick to play Peter Parker in his upcoming ``Spider-Man'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T hire muscle-bound thespians with limited range just
because they fill out the costume, as was the case with Dolph
Lundgren's ``The Punisher,'' Shaquille O'Neal's ``Steel'' and
Sylvester Stallone's ``Judge Dredd.''
</P>
<P>
   DO stay true to the characters, rather than allowing them to
become star vehicles. ``X-Men'''s little-known cast members blend
into their roles, enhancing the film's believability.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T tailor established roles to suit big stars hired for their
box-office appeal. Arnold Schwarzenegger spouted far too many of
his trademark one-liners as Mr. Freeze in ``Batman &AMP; Robin,''
earning a deserved cold-shoulder from audiences.
</P>
<P>
   DO have colorful, charismatic villains, such as Jack Nicholson's
Joker and Jim Carrey's Riddler.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T let them upstage the hero, like Nicholson's Joker and
Carrey's Riddler. Also, don't overcrowd your hero with countless
foes, as in ``Batman Returns,'' ``Batman Forever'' and ``Batman &AMP;
Robin.'' There's only so much screen time to go around.
</P>
<P>
   DO give the hero a well-developed love interest. The Man of
Steel reversed time to save his beloved Lois Lane in ``Superman.''
``X-Men'' establishes a love triangle among Wolverine, Jean Grey
and Cyclops, as well as unrequited romance between Rogue and
Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T insert a love interest simply because she's
well-developed, so to speak, as was the case with ``Batman
Forever'''s Nicole Kidman and ``Swamp Thing'''s Adrienne Barbeau.
</P>
<P>
   DO spend your budget on essentials such as costumes, sets and
special effects. ``X-Men'' eschewed big-star salaries by using a
cast of relative unknowns, putting its $75 million budget on the
screen. ``The Crow'' derived strong, stylish production values from
a meager $6 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T blow your entire budget on big stars and splashy set
pieces, as in the later ``Batman'' movies. Schwarzenegger's
$20-million salary could have paid for a few realistic-looking
icicles, at the very least. Conversely, don't stretch your small
budget too thin. ``Spawn's'' anthropomorphic cape was terrific, but
the computer-generated scenes in hell looked like a Nintendo game.
Roger Corman's cheapie version of ``The Fantastic Four `` was never
released.
</P>
<P>
   DO hire Danny Elfman to compose your musical score. The former
Oingo Boingo frontman has written the dark, witty and romantic
orchestrations for numerous comic book movies, including
``Batman,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Darkman,'' ``Batman Returns'' and
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T disrupt the mood with jarring musical interludes by
Prince, as in ``Batman,'' simply because a hot pop star sells
soundtrack albums.
</P>
<P>
   DO remember that there's a character under the costume.
``Spawn'' emphasized the vengeful hero's outfit at the expense of
the tortured soul inside the mask and cape.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T skimp on the costumes _ unless it's ``X-Men'' villain
Mystique, played by supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. In her case,
blue body paint does just fine.

HE STILL ISN'T UP TO SPEED ON THIS NASCAR STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had this dream, see. I dreamt I had entered a world in which
more than 100,000 people were speaking a language I did not
understand. These people had come to this specific gathering place
to take part in a spiritual ritual, and every one of them had
experiences and a complete frame of reference totally foreign to
me.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, that was no dream. That was me at New
Hampshire International Speedway at Loudon, N.H., last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``parallel universe'' has never had more personal
meaning. Something was going on that had great meaning to these
people, who didn't seem to mind the necessity of rising before the
sun was up in order to negotiate their way to a track that can
accommodate 100,000-plus people and which is ultimately accessible
only by New Hampshire Route 106, a two-lane highway (plus breakdown
lanes).
</P>
<P>
   They had come to see 43 skilled drivers steer their assorted
Chevys, Pontiacs, and Fords for 300 laps around the 1.058-mile
oval. In that sense, they did not get what they paid for, the race
being shortened by rain to 273 laps.
</P>
<P>
   But that is quite clearly not the whole point. They had also
come to celebrate a culture. A NASCAR race is more than just the
race. The competition is a lure, but it is not just the
competition. In the minds and hearts of the True Believers, NASCAR
is a unique fan experience in which the connection between
participant and viewer is quite real. These people seemed to be
bonded, both fan to fan and fan to driver.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that in order to participate, you need to love
your car. I mean really love your car. I don't. Never have, never
will. To me, a car is a large portable radio that costs me far too
much money to maintain. It is a nuisance that invariably lets me
down when I most need it. At best, I have an adversarial
relationship with my car. So perhaps I could never, ever become a
NASCAR person. It just isn't in me.
</P>
<P>
   I could never enjoy myself the way, for example, Rick Demelis
did.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Demelis had no problems leaving his house at 5 a.m. and
returning home at 11 p.m. He didn't mind the $170-per-person outlay
for tickets and entrance to the Du Pont tent, where he could
partake of food and drink all day while enjoying the race on his
own terms. He was, in fact, thrilled to have the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tickets are hard to get your hands on,'' he confides.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that Rick Demelis would be a NASCAR fan. He is
the owner and operator of A.J.'s Exxon in Hingham. He used to race
Modifieds himself. I know he knows cars because he has been largely
responsible for keeping my own large portable radios on the road
for the past 20 years. For him, last Sunday was a very satisfactory
day, rain-shortened race or no rain-shortened race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't upset by it,'' he says. ``I've been going up there
for six years, and that's the first time it's rained. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he would have loved to see what would have happened if the
race had been resumed after it rained for the second time. Like
everyone else in attendance, he knew that, for the second year in a
row, Tony Stewart had a fuel crisis, and that, absent the
raindrops, things might have turned out differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good race is one that's competitive right to the end,'' he
says. ``That could have been a great race. Those last 27 laps could
have been the most exciting part of the entire race.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's a big boy, and he knows it's caveat emptor with the
weather. Anyway, that's why he opted for the tent. He is a
hard-working man, and he wanted the full experience of a great day
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the whole experience,'' he explains. ``Getting
there. The tailgating. It's like a football game. The tents. The
thousands of people walking around with the different T-shirts. The
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all over and above the race itself, which Demelis, as
a car guy, finds endlessly fascinating. ``It's not like going to
New England Dragway and it's a matter of putting the pedal to the
metal and whoever's the fastest wins. There is so much strategy. In
the car itself you've got the motor, the tires, the fuel, and the
driver to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it not go without saying that Rick Demelis was one of the
thousands who rented a scanner in order to check out the
interaction between the crew and the driver? ``It's a very big
thing,'' he says. ``When does the pit crew tell him to come in?
What are they talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   A Winston Cup race is extremely fan-friendly. Information access
is immediate. Drivers are interviewed during the rain delay.
Everything is done to make everyone feel welcome. And that includes
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, basketball, football, and hockey could take lessons.
NHIS public relations director Fred Neergaard introduced me to
Brian VanDercook, the PR representative of the Hass-Carter K Mart
team, whose driver is Jimmy Spencer, and he, in turn, took me to
their ``Holler,'' or transport vehicle, where driver Ricky Simmons
gave me a complete tour, showing me every possible aspect of the
enterprise. At one point I guiltily took notes, as if I had any
remote idea what Mr. Simmons was talking about. At any rate, it was
all above and beyond the call of any PR duties I've ever
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons why this sport has grown from an offshoot of
backwoods Southern evade-the-revenuers mountain racing to its
current status as the best-attended and fastest-growing sport in
America. And Rick Demelis says it's not all about being a car
lover, either, citing Diana Demelis as Exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my wife for the first time last year,'' he says. ``She
doesn't like anything. Now she's got to be at my side at any race.
Believe me, if my wife gets into it, anybody can get into it. My
wife gets into nothing. But she wants to go back to these races.
And my brother-in-law took his girlfriend this time. She turns
around and says, `Can you get me tickets for September?' ''
</P>
<P>
   I saw it with my own eyes, and I know the phenomenon is real. I
still think it helps substantially if you love your car. All I know
is that after five laps, I was thinking, ``Please, God, make them
go faster. Please don't tell me there are 295 laps to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So to Fred, Brian, Ricky, Rick, and the brothers Bahre, who own
the track, I regretfully say, sorry. I just don't get it. But it's
pretty evident you don't need me.

 &HT;    Imposing Town Car offers classic luxury
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A truly massive vehicle and one that's
ultra-sophisticated in some ways, the 2000 Lincoln Town Car also is
as retro as the 2001 Chrysler PT cruiser or any other vehicle
harkening to the good ol' days of cheap fuel and big-engined luxury
cars.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it has a 4.6-liter V-8 engine driving the rear
wheels, making it among the last of its kind. The Town Car,
available commercially in base ($38,630), signature ($40,630) and
Cartier ($43,330) versions, has a cushy and exceptionally quiet
ride with enough space for six adults.
</P>
<P>
   As an everyday car, the Town Car has few equals when it comes to
comfort. Cadillac and Lexus are the only other manufacturers
regarded as challengers, and while the DeVille and GS 400 are more
sophisticated, they lose out in the space race.
</P>
<P>
   From its massive chrome grille to huge taillamp assemblies, the
Town Car stretches 18 feet and has a curb weight of more than 4,000
pounds. The only available drivetrain is Ford's workhorse 4.6-liter
V-8, which is tuned to a robust 220 horsepower, and a four-speed
automatic transmission. Despite the power and weight, the Town Car
pulls to 60 mph in less than 10 seconds and delivers 18 mpg in town
and 25 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Rear visibility isn't great, and the side vision suffers because
of the Town Car's massive pillars, but the straight-ahead and
in-town ride is very gentle. The power steering's about as soft as
the ride, but the power anti-lock disc brakes produce fast stops,
accompanied by gentle nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few cars that comes with a real clock, the Town Car
pampers driver and passenger with monstrous, overstuffed reclining
seats. Even the seat backs can be heated, and the front seats are
eight-way power-adjustable, so getting comfortable is hardly a
problem. The seats automatically slide back to facilitate
entry/exit, and the travel is so great that many drivers will have
to lean forward to put the key in.
</P>
<P>
   Even the center consoles are king-size, quite suitable for
playing board games, using a laptop or for paperwork. There's
plenty of storage: Deep door boxes are lidded, and the deep trunk
has more than 20 cubic feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   But unobtrusively transporting people, not things, is what the
Town Car is designed to do, and for those who believe that the
proper way to go is with rear-wheel drive, the superbly assembled
and finished Town Car is a tradition that just won't totally give
in to 21st century trends.

SEN. GREGG DRAWS IRE OVER COLUMBIA DRUG PATENT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A last-minute effort by New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg to
extend a lucrative biotechnology patent held by Columbia
University, his alma mater, is running into a storm of criticism
from drug manufacturers, consumer groups, and members of Congress,
including Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing-process patent, which expires in August, is
licensed by 33 companies who collectively have provided the Ivy
League school with $280 million over the past 12 years. Last year
Columbia received nearly $100 million _ by far its largest amount
ever _ from this single patent. All the money goes to basic
research at the school's New York City campus.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the funding from drying up next month, Columbia has
turned to Gregg, who graduated in 1969. He has 2 1/2 weeks left to
persuade Congress to approve an extension before the summer recess
and the national political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Republican legislator has tried _ unsuccessfully _
to insert a 350-word amendment into an unrelated federal spending
bill that would enable Columbia to seek a patent extension that
would bring in about $150 million over the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say Gregg's precedent-setting approach _ which has
Columbia's blessing _ is a misuse of power. Requiring drugmakers to
continue to pay royalties after a patent has expired, they say,
will raise the price of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the Columbia patent is ``simply a giveaway by Congress
to patent holders who don't deserve it,'' said Kennedy, and will
``impose unacceptable increases in the price of prescription
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, who tried unsuccessfully to include the amendment in an
agricultural spending bill in May, told colleagues his measure
would enable Columbia to ask the US Patent and Trademark Office to
extend its major university biotech patent beyond its August
expiration.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he withdrew a similar amendment from a
military-construction bill but congressional sources say they
expect he will try again before the end of the month.

   Columbia officials say they are seeking a 15-month extension on
the patent, which was granted in 1983 and covers a key
manufacturing process for using animal cells to produce proteins
used as drugs. But companies that have been paying Columbia to use
the patent say the extension is unfair because it circumvents
patent law and would set a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Senator Gregg is doing is simply outrageous,'' said Lisa
Raines, vice president of government affairs at Genzyme Corp.,
which relies on the Columbia patent to make its drug Cerezyme, a
major treatment for Gaucher's disease, which is a rare disorder of
the spleen and bone joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been any discussion in Congress about
Columbia's proposal and we, like other biotech companies, have a
contract that says we stop paying when the patent expires,'' she
said. ``Now Columbia wants to change the terms by slipping it
through a government budget appropriations bill with no discussion.
It's simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Columbia turned to Gregg, who as a subcommittee
chairman on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and is in
a good position to insert such a provision. Gregg argued that the
Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allows extensions of patents when drug
development is delayed by government action, such as Food and Drug
Administration approval. The provision has been applied to drugs in
the past, but never to manufacturing processes, such as the
Columbia patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia is finally reaping the reward of its research and
drug manufacturers are using this patent more and more,'' wrote
Gregg in a recent letter co-signed by Democratic Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York. ``The fact is that the drug and
biologic campaign against this language is based on money. These
companies want to continue to take advantage of this (process
patent) gap that exists in the law to avoid paying royalties.''
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat
who coauthored the 1984 law, insists that Columbia and Gregg are
misinterpreting the law. He says it was designed to compensate drug
makers who experienced FDA delays _ not universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregg proposal ``has nothing to do with the original intent
of the act,'' he said. ``On the contrary, it runs counter to what
we accomplished with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite mounting opposition, Gregg is reportedly looking to
insert the patent-extension amendment into what are called ``must
pass'' conference committee bills required for the federal 2001
budget. This `must pass'' legislation involves measures that have
been approved by both the House and Senate but had to be sent to a
conference committee to iron out key differences before lawmakers
vote on them again.
</P>
<P>
   Congresssional leaders, such as subcommittee chairmen like
Gregg, have the power to insert measures that were not in either
chamber's version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   When Gregg attempted to insert the extension into the
agricultural funding bill, several consumer watchdog groups raised
an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of backroom dealing, and it should
be pulled form the bill immediately,'' said Frank Clemente,
director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch. ``This secretly added
provision would be a windfall to Columbia University at the expense
of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gregg's apparent determination to get the
patent-extension measure approved, the senator has not spoken to
the media recently about the provision. He was unavailable for
comment this week despite several attempts to reach him through his
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Columbia was granted its biotechnology processing
patent in 1983, it did not collect royalties until 1988. Since then
it has received $280 million in license fees and royalties from 33
companies including Biogen Corp and Genzyme Corp., both based in
Cambridge, Mass.; Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., which is the
nation's largest biotech company; and Genentech Inc. of San
Francisco. These four companies along with about six other
companies, have created 14 government-approved biotech drugs that
use the patent, according to Columbia officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year license fees from the patent reached an all-time high
as Columbia collected nearly $100 million. All the funds from the
patent are used for unrestricted basic research by Columbia. Losing
the funds _ about 25 percent of the $400 million the university
spends annually on research _ would eliminate the opportunity to
expand into new research arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia officials insist the school is seeking only a 15-month
extension to compensate it for the five years between 1983 and
1988. That's when the FDA had regulatory issues and procedural
delays with some biotech companies that prevented the university
from obtaining royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only university that has come forth and raised our
hand about remedying the patent policy situation and we are getting
whacked pretty hard,'' said Michael Crow, Columbia's executive vice
provost.
</P>
<P>
   Crow acknowledged that there were no discussions within Congress
about Columbia's patent extension and that inserting it into a
federal appropriations bill as Congress prepares to adjourn is a
shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, drug companies don't like the fact that we have taken
this tack, and perhaps it is unusual for a university to act this
way, but we are not asking Congress to give us the extension, just
the chance the present our case to the US Patent and Trademark
Office,'' said Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Columbia has little bipartisan support beyond Gregg and
Moynihan. New York's other senator, Democrat Charles E. Schumer,
declined to support Columbia's request.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities have had lucrative patents expire without
seeking extensions. Stanford University's patent that helped
Genentech create its first drug expired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Columbia waited until the eleventh hour to come
forward and seek a contract extension, Crow said school officials
began talking to members of Congress last fall after learning that
some drug companies, which used its patent, were about to seek
extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy's office has said it plans to stop any attempt
by Gregg to include the Columbia patent-extension amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Kennedy, along with Democratic Senator Richard J.
Durbin of Illinois and Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona,
asked congressional colleagues to vote against the Columbia
amendment, which they called ``the greening of the ivory tower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, this provision's main effect will be to
increase drug prices,'' noted the three senators. ``Breast cancer
patients, heart and stroke patients, people with multiple sclerosis
or other debilitating diseases are the ones who will pay for
Columbia's new royalties.''

CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST'S PENALTY SPURS WIDE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as The Boston Globe and columnist Jeff Jacoby both say his
suspension was not connected to his conservative politics, Jacoby's
fate became a raging ideological battleground this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, citing ``serious journalistic misconduct,'' the
Globe suspended Jacoby for four months without pay for writing a
July 3 column on the signers of the Declaration of Independence
that was based on other accounts without alerting readers to those
sources. Factored into the punishment was his practice of
circulating his column early without Globe permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Globe badly overreacted,'' Jacoby said Wednesday.
``I don't think I deserve to lose my income for four months for an
oversight.'' Acknowledging the Globe's standards, he added that ``I
have very high journalistic standards too . . . My hope at this
point is to be back in my office writing a column.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the heated media debate over Jacoby's suspension
surfaced everywhere from the editorial pages of The Wall Street
Journal to a story by media critic Howard Kurtz of the Washington
Post to the Globe newsroom. (Business writer Hiawatha Bray is
circulating a petition among Globe staffers asking publisher
Richard H. Gilman to reconsider Jacoby's suspension.)
</P>
<P>
   And as ideological allies rallied around him, the discussion
quickly began to focus on whether Jacoby paid a price for being the
conservative columnist on a liberal editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision had nothing to do with ideology or with Jeff's
religion'' or any other, random issue such as ``whether he's an
easy edit or a hard edit or whether he's popular or not,'' said
editorial page editor Renee Loth. ``The decision is about
standards. Readers deserve to know that the material that appears
underneath someone's byline in The Boston Globe is his material.
That really seems to me to befundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the allegations that he is the victim of his
conservative politics, Jacoby says flatly: ``I haven't seen any
evidence to think that this about ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a July 11 Wall Street Journal column critical of the the
suspension, James Taranto wrote that `Mr. Jacoby happens to be the
Globe's only conservative columnist and some conservatives now
accuse the paper of singling him out on ideological grounds.'' In a
July 11 story, Kurtz noted that Jacoby was ``an unabashed
conservative on a famously liberal op-ed page'' and cited several
journalists' concerns about a connection between Jacoby's politics
and his fate.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 11 letter to the Boston Globe, radio talk host David
Brudnoy broached the subject cautiously, writing that ``the Boston
Globe is well-armed with columnists who provide a liberal take on
the news . . . The Globe speaks endlessly and forcefully of
`diversity.' That is precisely what Jacoby has provided on the
Globe's op-ed page.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were blunter. JewishWorldReview.com
(www.jewishworldreview.com) editor-in-chief Binyamin L. Jolkovsky
had this explanation for the suspension: ``In the past, Jeff had
the audacity to question frequently and with eloquence, what is
more and more becoming the accepted norm in this era of moral
revisionism. His views are conservative and based upon his value
system as a Sabbath observant Jew.'' Commentator David Horowitz
wrote that Jacoby had been rendered an ``unperson by his leftwing
bosses at the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe ombudsman Jack Thomas says he's gotten hundreds of calls
and more than 1,000 e-mails since Jacoby's suspension. But he says
more than 90 percent of those e-mails originate from states outside
the Globe's circulation area and are ``steeped in right-wing
rhetoric that denounces the Globe as Marxist lefties engaged in a
McCarthy-like purge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, there are a few dispassionate opinions. Bob
Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter Center for
Media Studies, says that without knowing ``all the pieces of the
puzzle, for me . . . or anyone from afar to give a meaningful
interpretation (of Jacoby's case) is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Media analyst Tom Rosenstiel says, ``as an observer from a
distance away, it's a little murky what the crime is because they
didn't use the word plagiarism. . . . The important thing in these
cases is (for the Globe) to make clear to the staff and the public
what their standards are. What you say in these cases is as
important as what you do.''
</P>

   While Harvard decides whether to name Freedom Forum senior vice
president Robert Giles as curator of the Nieman Foundation, the
lobbying continues. Trying to counter unions who have argued that
Giles's role during the Detroit newspaper strike _ when he was
editor and publisher of The Detroit News _ should disqualify him
from the post, top officers of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors recently weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-American Statesman editor Richard Oppel; Tim McGuire,
editor of the Minneapolis Star Tribune; Diane McFarlin, publisher
of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune; and Peter Bhatia, executive editor
of The (Portland) Oregonian, signed a letter to Harvard President
Neil Rudenstine supportive of Giles.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Nieman watch continues, there is speculation that
Harvard may ultimately bypass Giles, choose a temporary curator and
reopen the search in earnest next year. Insider gossip suggests
that should the search be restarted, another possible candidate
might emerge: former Wall Street Journal staffer and PBS Democracy
Project Director Ellen Hume.

ALCANTRA'S MISDEEDS BRING SCORN, BUT NO EXPLANATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Izzy Alcantara was styling, commemorating his three-run homer
with a slow-motion, hot-dog jaunt around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing pitcher took offense. The next time Alcantara came
to the plate, the pitcher buzzed him, sending him reeling backward.
</P>
<P>
   It was the summer of 1998. Alcantara was an upward-bound slugger
for the Double A Reading (Pa.) Phillies. He responded by pointing
his bat at Mark Guerra, the Binghamton Mets pitcher, and heading
for the mound, according to published reports and eyewitness
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets catcher, Pedro Grifol, intervened, whereupon Alcantara
launched a left jab and, in return, got whacked in the head with
the catcher's mask.
</P>
<P>
   For his antics, Alcantara was suspended for three games and
fined $300.
</P>
<P>
   And that isolated incident, according to several of his former
managers and other baseball personnel, represented Alcantara's
worst contribution to professional sports _ until he seized his
spot in Red Sox infamy July 1 by all but quitting on the basepaths
and in the field in a game against the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since his afternoon of notoriety, Alcantara has
silently endured the backlash: his teammates' scorn, his manager's
refusal to play him, and a seething fandom's incessant call for his
pillorying.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Bill Buckner of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But ask managers who policed Alcantara before he arrived last
month on Jimy Williams's doorstep and none can recall the Dominican
power hitter displaying such poisonous behavior. No blatant
loafing. No watching lazy fly balls fall at his feet, as he did in
Chicago. No punching out of work in the middle of a rundown, as he
also did, to his team's shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never did that with me,'' said Al LeBoeuf, who managed
Alcantara at Reading in 1998 and now is a coach for the Clearwater
Phillies in the Florida State League. ``I never, ever had a problem
with him. He was always on time, always worked hard and played
hard, and, as a manager, that's all you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara's fiasco began in the third inning of a 7-2 loss when
his lackluster reaction to a routine single to right by Ray Durham
allowed White Sox catcher Mark Johnson to score from first. One
batter later, Alcantara's lackadaisical effort turned Jose
Valentin's single into a double, allowing another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, he was charged with an error when he
scooped up Chris Singleton's single, then dropped it as he prepared
to throw, allowing Singleton to reach second.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara extended the nightmare in the eighth inning when,
rather than advance on a wild pitch, he ambled off second base, got
caught in a rundown, and made no effort to escape. As a result, he
prevented Jeff Frye from advancing from first.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the Double A All-Star team last year and to the
International League squad this year before he was summoned by the
Red Sox June 25, Alcantara was known throughout his eight-year
minor league career as a defensive liability, a slugger many teams
would covet if they could find a safe spot for him in the field.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the Red Sox should have known when they signed
Alcantara that they would use the journeyman minor-leaguer in the
field at their peril. He had struggled at every defensive position
he has played: third base, first, and the outfield. But his
shortcomings apparently were not for lack of dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys are better defensive players than him,'' said
Pawtucket manager Gary Jones. ``He's an offensive player. But he
worked on his defense when he was here. He went out every day and
took fly balls and worked hard and tried to be a better player, and
I did see improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he had no reason to criticize Alcantara's work ethic
or effort. ``I don't know what happened up there,'' Jones said,
referring to the Chicago disaster. ``All I'm saying is that he
played hard every day and I never had a problem with his work
habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Same story in Trenton, N.J., where Alcantara hit 20 homers in 77
games for Boston's Double AA affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be the best defensive player of all time,
certainly. But he was anything but a loafer,'' said Andy Freed, the
team's radio announcer. ``He was awesome for us and everyone knew
he was better than the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, what in the name of Jimmy Piersall was
Alcantara thinking that fateful afternoon in Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   A farmer's son from the coastal town of Bani in the Dominican
Republic, Alcantara has yet to publicly explain his lapses in his
sixth game as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara was signed by Montreal, when Duquette was general
manager there, in 1992. Tampa Bay picked him up in 1997 after
Montreal left him off their 40-man roster, but Duquette got him
back in 1998 as a minor league free agent when Tampa Bay left him
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   He had endured a long journey to the bigs, playing more than
3,000 minor league games, riding countless overnight bus trips, and
sleeping in cut-rate motels from South Florida to northern Vermont.
At 27, he is older than Nomar Garciaparra, Trot Nixon, and Derek
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   So why risk it all by failing to hustle?
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the clubhouse Sunday for an interview, Alcantara said,
``No hablo ingles.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not true, because he has spoken English to reporters
for many publications. When it was suggested to him that he must
know enough English to converse, he tersely replied, ``Thank you,''
as if to say, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Alcantara has become a pariah and only general manager Dan
Duquette has publicly uttered a word in his defense. Despite
Williams's refusal to play Alcantara since the rookie shrank from
responsbility in the ``City of Big Shoulders,'' Duquette has said
he will not jettison Alcantara for ``one bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette believes the Red Sox need Alcantara's bat. After
struggling for years to hit breaking balls, Alcantara was whaling
Triple A pitching and leading the International League in home runs
(22) and RBI (63) before he was told after a game in Louisville
last month to awaken the next day at 4 a.m. and report to Toronto
to play that night for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara homered in his first three at-bats for Pawtucket last
year in his Triple A debut. He was on pace this year to hit 47
homers for Pawtucket and he showed a hint of big league batting
talent in his six-game run before his benching: .375, with a homer
and three runs scored, in 16 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't the 1998 incident suggest he was a showboat, a
potentially disruptive force?
</P>
<P>
   ``He did (showboat),'' LeBoeuf said. ``But in the minors you
have guys who hit four or five home runs all year and stand there
watching them. He didn't do anything out of the ordinary,
especially for a guy with his kind of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette insists Alcantara is going to play for the Red Sox. But
that may hinge on what Williams believes the definition of ``is''
is.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last weekend about Alcantara's status, the manager said,
``Any player in that locker room has a chance to play. They're all
major league players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams has not spoken a word on Alcantara's behalf since
he described the team's performance that day in Chicago as
``U-G-L-Y.'' The manager has allowed Alcantara to do little more
than take batting practice, which even backfired last weekend when
his line drive struck rehabbing pitcher Bret Saberhagen in the
buttocks, cutting short the pitcher's throwing session.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also has shown Alcantara none of the benevolence he has
afforded other players, like Ed Sprague, whom the manager patted on
the back Sunday before a sell-out Fenway crowd after Sprague was
booed repeatedly in lowering his Red Sox batting average to .118.
</P>
<P>
   As Alcantara left the clubhouse Sunday for the All-Star break,
Bernard Gilkey momentarily clutched his shoulder and Carl Everett
tapped him on the arm as if to wish him well. But no one said
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   And baseball people who knew Alcantara before he took the field
that day in Chicago continue to ponder the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he would do that at the major league level,'' LeBoeuf
said, ``I just don't know.''

DEE DEE QUEASY OVER TALL SHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee is feeling even more lightheaded than usual due to the
recent outbreak of Tall Ships Fever. Our all-purpose advice
columnist hasn't succumbed to the epidemic; however, she has been
overwhelmed by questions from the legions of afflicted. Some of
these sufferers are in desperate straits, to toss off a
nauticalism, so Dee Dee feels an obligation to address their issues
without delay. Fire when ready.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the origin of the term ``Tall Ships''? _ Inquisitive,
Howling Point, ME
</P>
<P>
   The phrase had its popular origin in John Masefield's poem ``Sea
Fever,'' which begins with the haunting stanza ``I must go down to
the sea again, to the lonely sea and the sky, / And all I ask is a
Sail Boston 2000 T-shirt and matching cap and a bottle of SPF 25
sunblock /And a ticket on a Tall Ships harbor cruise to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I heard a television commentator say that this Tall Ships
extravaganza is a ``once-in-a-lifetime event.'' If I recall
correctly, and I think I do, we were told the same thing when the
Tall Ships first visited Boston in 1976, and again, repeatedly,
when similar flotillas entered local waters in 1980, 1986, and
1992. How many more times must I brace myself to hear the same
nonsense? _ Fed Up, Flotsam, MA
</P>
<P>
   As a Tall Ships survivor you must know by now that there will
never be an end to the blather surrounding these events, so Dee Dee
advises you to remain braced, permanently.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since I suffer from an extreme fear of cliches and superlatives,
my philologist has advised me to avoid the Tall Ships at all costs.
This seems an extreme measure, especially since I have been looking
forward to kicking up my heels while the fleet is in. What do you
think? _ Frisky, Bloater Beach, CT
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from Dee Dee to question a medical specialist, or
whatever he or she is, but this advice is unsound. By all means see
the Tall Ships, and frolic with those who sail them. But try to
avoid hearing or reading about them in the news media, since that
is where you're most likely to encounter the language you fear,
words such as ``magnificent,'' ``awesome,'' ``breathtaking,''
``legendary,'' ``larger-than-life,'' etc. Dee Dee apologizes if
this language has frightened you. Try to think of it as aversion
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How tall does a ship have to be to qualify as a Tall Ship? My
ship, Hyperbole, measures 28 feet 6 inches from the base of her
hull to the top of her mast. Could she be called a Tall Ship? _
Hopeful, Styx River, RI
</P>
<P>
   One might as well ask, along with Irving Berlin: How deep is the
ocean? How high is the sky? How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew? Dee Dee's getting a little
carried away, but you get the point. Tallness is a personal matter,
between you and your ship. If you think of her as tall, she will
be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why are Tall Ships referred to as ``she''? Is this an example of
seagoing sexism? _ Stymied, Shagbark, NH
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee's dog-eared copy of ``The Bias-Free Word-Finder'' says
this ``outdated, unnecessary, and unacceptable'' custom dates back
to ancient times, when ships were named for goddesses, under whose
protection they sailed. But Dee Dee thinks there's a more obvious
explanation: Most ships are female.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HINGHAM, Mass. _ Three years ago, a half a century after it
first began selling classically styled women's clothing from a
17th-century colonial-frame home here, The Talbots Inc. seemed to
disastrously veer away from its traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1947, sensible wardrobes from Talbots have found favor
with women between 35 and 55. But looking to broaden its appeal to
include women in their late 20s and early 30s, Talbots began
flirting with trendier styles and shorter hemlines in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a marketing flop. Not only did new styles fail to
win over younger customers, but they also alienated women who had
been intensely loyal to Talbots for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the pendulum and swung it all the way out,'' says
Arnold B. Zetcher, Talbots chairman, president, and chief
executive. ``And that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Today 1997 is ancient history, and Talbots now may be one of the
hottest apparel retailers in the business. (That's hot by the
standards of Wall Street and not necessarily hot by the fashion
standards of Paris and New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Check out the chain's nearly 700 stores, and it's clear that
Talbots has returned to its classic roots.
</P>
<P>
   Page through some of the roughly 57 million catalogs that
Talbots mails out in a year, and aggressively fashion-forward
clothing is nowhere in evidence. Instead there is page after page
of tasteful twin sets, blazers, and capri pants, only sometimes in
larger sizes and in a wider range of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Such styles have wowed both consumers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when many other publicly traded retailers are
reporting ho-hum sales and watching their stock prices languish,
</P>
<P>
   nearly everything seems to be going right for Talbots _ even the
performance of its new Web site at www.Talbots.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been profitable since day one,'' Zetcher says.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1999, Talbots sales rose 13 percent to $1.29 billion.
Profits rose 59 percent to $58.5 million. For its most recent
quarter, profits were up 69 percent to $32.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving profits at Talbots? CIBC World Markets analyst
Dorothy Lakner offers one explanation: ``Their customers are
willing to pay full price.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case for all retailers. Many of their customers
won't buy an item unless it's marked down. That's great for the
consumer, but it cuts into profits.
</P>
<P>
   There may be another reason Talbots customers are willing to pay
full price. At many department stores, shopping for clothes can be
a time-consuming hassle, analysts say. Talbots, in contrast, can
offer customers one-stop convenience, a place where a wardrobe or
an outfit can quickly be assembled and accessorized, retail
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialty chains can offer similar convenience, but
Talbots is the only specialty chain that focuses on classic
clothing, says Harry A. Ikenson, senior analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Zetcher has his own theory for why his customers are willing to
pay full price: Classic clothes don't go out of style. A Talbots
wardrobe is ``like an investment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For a retailer, full prices at retail translate into healthy
profits, and healthy profits translate into strong stock
performance. On the New York Stock Exchange, Talbots shares have
risen about 60 percent in the last 12 months, closing Wednesday at
$59.5625, down 6.25 cents. During the same period, many publicly
traded retailers have seen their stock shares fall.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to capitalize on its momentum, Talbots recently unveiled
a plan to open more than 400 stores by the end of 2005. That would
bring the chain's store total to more than 1,100 and projected
annual sales to more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the rebound is a response to the disaster of 1997,
which happened because past successes were taken for granted and
the chain stopped paying close attention to its best customers.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the downward slide, Zetcher initiated several
changes, adopting a team approach to the design and styling of
future merchandise. So customer feedback would have more weight,
store managers were given a voice in the design process, something
they hadn't had before. In addition, the financial department was
brought in to help plan inventory levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the merchandise being right on and the
inventory being kept at the appropriate level'' is a big part of
the Talbots comeback story, Zetcher says.
</P>
<P>
   Such fixes won back the traditional customers who had cut back
on their purchases at Talbots in 1997. But there was still the
challenge of bringing in new customers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of courting younger women, Talbots decided to
focus on capturing a far larger percentage of the women between 35
and 55 and converting them into Talbots customers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Zetcher launched Talbots Woman, a larger-size line,
and he hired Boston ad agency Arnold Communications to launch a
brand campaign that included the chain's first TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   With the theme of ``Talbots _ It's a classic,'' Arnold ads
portray Talbots customers as ``contemporary, successful, and
fun-loving'' and the antithesis of the Martha Stewart devotee, says
Francis J. Kelly III, Arnold's chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the ads are ``not all throwing dinner parties with
crystal and silverware,'' he says. ``They don't spend their whole
day trying to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   For Talbots, early signs of a turnaround began to appear in
mid-1998, and the turnaround has gained momentum ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In three of the last four quarters, Talbots has alerted Wall
Street to adjust profit targets upward, according to First Call
Corp., a Thomson Financial company.
</P>
<P>
   How much higher can Talbots share price climb? That's a good
question. Six of the 13 analysts who follow Talbots have a hold
rating on the stock, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Talbots is moving ahead with the retail Web site it
launched in November and recently touted with ads that feature
cartoon character Jane Jetson.
</P>
<P>
   Early results hint that Talbots.com may achieve what the
youthful fashions of 1997 couldn't do _ bring Talbots new
customers. On a monthly basis, 25 to 40 percent of shoppers at the
Web site are new to Talbots, Zetcher says.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the big question for Talbots is whether it can
sustain its impressive sales momentum. If Talbots keeps listening
to its customers, some retail analysts don't see any reason why the
chain's momentum can't continue to build.
</P>
<P>
   Zetcher vows not to become complacent. Referring to the troubles
Talbots encountered when it pursued younger customers with younger
fashions three years ago, he says: ``I don't think 1997 can happen
again. But we know success is not owed us or due us. We have to
continue to earn it.''

BUSH AND GORE: A CHOICE, NOT JUST AN ECHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There isn't much evidence that Wall Street is paying attention
yet to the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, corporate earnings and summer vacations are
higher priorities. But once the conventions are over, money
managers will focus on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai thinks they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the candidates are saying is immensely significant for
Wall Street,'' said Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision
Economics. On a host of issues, the two candidates offer Wall
Street a choice, not an echo.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush supports the partial privatization of Social
Security; Al Gore doesn't. Bush wants the private sector to lead
the way on prescription drugs for Medicare; Gore wants a bigger
role for the government. Bush wants big tax cuts; Gore wants
medium-size ones. Bush is likely to rein in the Justice
Department's aggressive antitrust policies; Gore is apt to leave
them in place.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two candidates has grown sharper in the
past few weeks as Gore has stepped us his populist rhetoric. For
much of his career, Gore has stressed his free-market credentials,
his support for high technology, and his track record on reducing
the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent speech before the American Federation of
Teachers, Gore sounded more like William Jennings Bryan. ``We know
our opponents in this election are on the side of the powerful, not
the people,'' he said. ``They have powerful interests lined up
against us like the big oil companies, like the HMOs and the
polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of speeches, Gore has accused the ``high-profit''
drug companies of ``gouging'' consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk may go over well in some quarters, but not on
Wall Street, where high profits are a good thing and the prefered
language for ``gouging'' is ``charging a premium price for a
premium product.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goodman, senior economic adviser for Putnam Investments,
said that what Wall Street will be focusing on is quite basic.
``Money managers want to know what will affect the ability of
corporations to generate profits,'' he said. ``It is very cold and
pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many on Wall Street, Goodman, a conservative on economic
matters, prefers the market-oriented philosophy of the Republicans
to the more ``redistributionist'' policies of the Democrats. And at
the moment, he doesn't see much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. According to Goodman, there are four possible
outcomes to the November elections:
</P>
<P>
   A Republican president and a Republican Congress; a Republican
president with Democrats holding at least one house of Congress; a
Democratic president with Republicans holding at least one house of
Congress; and, finally, a Democratic president and a Democratic
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Goodman's view, the first three options should all be fine
with Wall Street. He points out that stocks did well in the Reagan
years and in the Clinton years, when divided government was the
rule in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The only scenario he worries about is a Democratic sweep. ``The
probability of that seems very low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Perna has a somewhat different take on the election. An
economic consultant in Connecticut, Perna thinks the ideal outcome
for Wall Street would be a split decision _ Congress controlled by
one party and the White House by another. Perna has coined a term
for that condition: ``flexible gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What ends up happening is that the pendulum doesn't swing as
much,'' he said. ``Some things get done, and you avoid the dangers
of excesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the excesses to be feared would be too much fiscal
stimulus from either Republican tax cuts or Democratic spending
programs. Either one, argues Perna, could end up putting upward
pressure on interest rates by pumping money into an already hot
economy.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Wall Street is calm. That could be because Bush appears
to be in the catbird seat. He is ahead in all the opinion polls.
According to Barron's, a recent survey of institutional investors
conducted by one Wall Street firm showed 75 percent of those polled
expected a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers may explain why Gore's attacks on oil companies
and drug companies have had no obvious impact on stock prices in
either sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore comes on after the convention, you may see some
concern in the market,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA
Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm. By contrast, if
Bush looks as though he is headed for victory, there could be a
preelection rally, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   It is fashionable these days to say that government doesn't
matter anymore. The truth is that it does _ even on Wall Street.

VENTURE-BACKED IPOS STILL SHOWING SOME LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bucking all forecasts, the IPO market for venture-backed
start-ups still had a pulse in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four venture-backed companies made it through the gate
nationally last quarter, raising $4.3 billion in initial public
offerings, even as a grim stock market dealt death blows to
teetering dot-coms in April and May.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the volume marked a decline from the euphoric first
quarter, when 77 companies went public and raised $8.5 billion,
according to Venture Economics, a Boston research firm that tracks
such data. But it wasn't so far below the activity of a year ago,
when 70 IPO deals raised $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Observed Paul Ferri, a general partner with Matrix Partners, a
Waltham, Mass. venture firm, ``The very high-quality deals get done
in any market. What all this market turmoil has done was flush out
the junkier companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture money was behind about half of the total 104 companies
that went public in the quarter. All told, companies raised $24.69
billion in IPOs, the second-biggest quarter ever, thanks largely to
AT&AMP;T's $10 billion wireless offering.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, IPOs have fueled the technology boom, as
venture capitalists who finance young companies were able to reap
fast returns on their investments _ sometimes in as little as a
year or two, compared to four to six years in the past.
</P>
<P>
   April's market drop brought with it a glum sense that the party
was over. Venture partners started talking about the need to pump
additional money into portfolio companies that would have to stay
private longer than planned. Some start-ups were warned to get
thriftier with their cash. Others were dumped entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A new sense of caution showed up in the roster of venture-backed
companies that did manage to go public. Only 12 Internet companies
hit the market, down from 29 in the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
   California, led by Silicon Valley, scored the largest number of
IPOs, claiming 21 of the 54 offerings in the quarter. Massachusetts
was a distant second, with three deals.
</P>
<P>
   Several local deals were pulled after the Nasdaq plunged 25
percent in one week in early April. They included Furniture.com and
Internet consulting firm Zefer Corp., which recently refiled to go
public. Other start-ups had to seek buyers and scrap their plans to
go public.
</P>
<P>
   But the three Boston-area deals that went public have been
stunning successes, especially given the market's rocky treatment
of many tech stocks this year.
</P>
<P>
   Backers Matrix and Charles River Ventures watched Sonus Networks
Inc., a Westford supplier of networking software and equipment,
soar 782 percent since its IPO on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Storage Networks Inc. of Waltham _ backed by Greylock Management
Corp. and Sigma Partners _ has jumped 327 percent since it went
public June 29. And, Praecis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Cambridge
company financed in part by Highland Capital Partners, has gained
273 percent since its April 26 offering.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix's Ferri recalls with some awe that many deals of the
quarter were priced at levels below what the companies had hoped.
In the case of Sonus, he said, ``We did it above the filing
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing stability in the IPO market will affect how freely
venture capitalists invest in new companies _ and whether they are
able to raise new funds, said Jesse Reyes, a vice president with
Venture Economics.

EVEN ON LIVE-ACTION SITE, `BIG BROTHER' IS A SNORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cast of ``Big Brother'' is in the discovery phase of its
great adventure, which is sort of like the ``Getting to Know You''
scene in ``The King and I.'' But without the orchestra, the cute
kids, and the froufrou hoop skirt, it's hard to sustain interest in
the taped CBS show or the ``live'' Web site. This group could
really use a big splashy production number, some ol' razzle-dazzle
as they unpack those metal suitcases and settle into those little
bunks.
</P>
<P>
   But no. So far the Web site, which promises unedited footage and
includes a parental advisory, has been as tame as the show's
television debut. Immediately after the show ended Wednesday night,
the Web site was overwhelmed with traffic as folks raced to their
computers to watch the preliminary howdy-dos. Just as one ``house
guest'' was about to reveal her secret recipe for chocolate-chip
cookies, the site crashed. Oh, the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the folks at America Online, which is handling the Web
component, seem to have worked out the kinks in the site
(www.bigbrother2000.com). But they haven't been able to generate
much tension or drama, unless of course, you're interested in
watching strangers eat and sleep. So far, the best thing about the
Web site is that it doesn't feature the wooden commentary of
co-hosts Julie Chen and Ian O'Malley. Just a thought: Do viewers
get a chance to vote the hosts off the show before they start
eliminating the house guests?
</P>
<P>
   But back to the Web site. Frankly, I never understood the
fascination with the JenniCam or the coffee pot cam or other Web
sites that chronicle the minutiae of everyday existence. Certainly,
there's nothing particularly riveting about www.dotcomguy.com, the
site started by a rather dull fellow in Texas who vowed to
sequester himself away from the world and survive off the Internet.
He just sits around and buys stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is something seductive about the concept
of bigbrother2000.com. After all, it provides an opportunity for
self-respecting intellectuals who would never _ never! _ take part
in such a stunt: We get to make fun of the folks on the show and
dish about their outfits, their hairdos, their temperaments, and,
with any luck, their mating habits.
</P>
<P>
   But by late last week the only clucking going on in Big
Brotherville was happening in the chicken coop, as the residents
learned how to feed and water the hens. Most of the action was
mundane getting-to-know-you stuff as the residents made breakfast
and small talk. There was some sort of minor crisis over the lack
of an electric shaver, but other than that, everyone seemed to be
getting along swimmingly. But hey, who knows what will happen when
they have to change the chemicals in the pool?
</P>
<P>
   For now, tuning into the Big Brother site is a bit like watching
corn grow, which, by the way, is a popular online activity (see
www.iowafarmer.com/corncam/corn.html). The residents are making
nice: No one has asked Jordan to elaborate about her career as an
exotic dancer, and no one has challenged beauty queen Jamie to a
duel of wits. And the only hint of creepiness occurred when a
disembodied voice instructed the residents to change the batteries
in their microphones, reminding us that Big Brother is watching
them as we watch ``Big Brother.'' Orwellian, it's not. But things
may heat up. Apparently Jordan is trying to convince everyone to
perform a Big Brother rap. We may get that production number, after
all, and who knows what kind of costumes the former exotic dancer
will design.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nielsen/Net Ratings released figures for the top
live-action and animated Web sites. At the top of the list? None
other than www.joecartoon.com, the home of animated games like the
Frog in the Blender and Shoot the Singer. The mom-and-pop site beat
out corporate ventures like atomfilms.com and Warner Bros.'
entertaindom.com.
</P>
<P>
   So who is the mastermind behind these sick games for geeks? That
would be Joe Shields, who will be happy to tell you about himself
if you give him a minute to go fetch a beer.
</P>
<P>
   So who are you, Joe? The short version: ``I'm a big, fat,
beer-drinkin', fishin' cartoonist,'' says Shields, 39.
</P>
<P>
   The ``log cabin'' version: ``I'm one of those guys who drew on
his desk in high school,'' he says, explaining how he grew up in
Michigan, learned screen-printing in Gloucester, Mass., got an arts
degree from Montserrat College of Art in Beverly, and later
returned to Michigan for a short-lived career in auto parts. He
then worked as a T-shirt designer and put a few of his designs up
on the Web in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His work mixes the adorable and the macabre: Let's say it's an
acquired taste. ``Someone said I was a cross between Stephen King
and Gary Larson,'' he notes. It was that comparison that inspired
him to create the famous frog animation, which he posted on his Web
site in April 1999. Suddenly, the obscure fishin' and drinkin'
cartoonist wasn't so obscure anymore; at the height of the frog
frenzy, his site generated 700,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   The site now makes a comfortable profit (``We do very well'')
for Shields and his Webmaster, who goes by the nickname Russ the
Barbarian. The secret? ``There was no business plan, no target
audience, no market stategy, no nuthin' _ just me feeling free,''
explains Shields, who says he has turned down offers from film and
television producers but hopes to get a film deal within the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
   So much for ``Big Brother'' and other Hollywood attempts to make
a buck off entertainment online. ``You have dot-coms out there with
all kinds of venture capital and committees and business plans, and
then there's one guy out there all by himself,'' says Shields, who
doesn't suffer from insecurity. His motto: ``If Joe thinks it's
funny, it is. If you don't, you're stupid.'' Consider your options.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Sunday night, and a queue of impatient sailors forms
outside a brightly lit room aboard the USS McFaul. It's not the
chow line; the main evening meal is over and the late-night
``midrats'' snack is some hours away. Nor are they waiting for
permission to enjoy a night on the town; the McFaul is cruising at
18 knots, heading eastward into the Atlantic from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the men and women of the destroyer McFaul are lined up
waiting to check their e-mail. There was a time when sailors would
be out of touch with home for weeks or months. The youngsters
aboard McFaul will never know such a world. These days, the Navy
depends on an intricate system of global communications that
ensures that a ship is never out of touch. Neither are its sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is the stuff around here right now,'' says Garlon
Payton, a fireman aboard the McFaul.
</P>
<P>
   Payton knew nothing about e-mail when he joined the Navy three
years ago. Neither did his father and sister, who live in
Charleston, S.C. Today, they're all hooked up; father and sister
each have America Online accounts, and like every member of the
McFaul crew, Payton has his own e-mail address. Whether he's tied
to the dock at the McFaul's home port of Norfolk, Va., or cruising
the Mediterranean, Payton and his shipmates are never very far from
home.
</P>
<P>
   Providing e-mail access for its 320-person crew is a trivial
matter for the McFaul, a floating showpiece of advanced technology.
Named for a US Navy SEAL commando killed during the 1989 invasion
of Panama, the McFaul was commissioned in 1998 and still hasn't
lost its new-warship smell. It's one of the most advanced surface
ships in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of old-fashioned boilers or diesels, its propellers are
driven by four jet engines similar to those used on DC-10
airliners. As a result, the 9,000-ton ship accelerates dramatically
under full power, and at its top speed of about 30 knots, or 35
miles per hour, the McFaul kicks up a wake like a speedboat.
</P>
<P>
   The superstructure is covered in spongy plastics to make the
ship harder to spot on radar. Meanwhile its own radar detects every
ship and aircraft for miles in all directions, though the Navy
won't say exactly how many miles.
</P>
<P>
   The ship seems lightly armed with a single five-inch naval gun.
But then there are ominous gray doors, fore and aft, flush with the
deck so a visitor can sit on them. Each of the doors can be loaded
with a Tomahawk cruise missile or a Standard anti-aircraft missile
There are also anti-submarine missiles and six torpedoes, and room
to park a sub-hunting helicopter on a pad in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The McFaul can go someplace fast, and do a lot of damage when it
gets there. But the Navy believes that its ships will become
dramatically more effective when they can share information, in a
process that Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Randy Britton calls
``network-centric warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined data stream from dozens of warships and planes can
be blended into a three-dimensional ``battlespace.'' Commanders are
transformed into information managers, analyzing the battlespace
and dispatching those assets which are best suited to cope with
particular tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With targeting information from one ship,'' Britton said,
``you could actually launch a weapon from another ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has launched a program called Information Technology
for the 21st Century, or IT21, which aims to achieve this kind of
seamless coordination. Today, many ships have a patchwork of
computer and communications systems, but when the work is done,
every warship will use standardized software, data formats, and
communications systems. Not only will information be accessible
from any ship in the fleet, but the significance of the information
will be clear to any experienced officer.
</P>
<P>
   The IT21 program began in 1997. ``We started with the command
ships and the carriers,'' said Lt. Flex Plexico, spokesman for the
US Pacific Fleet. By the end of last year, nearly all of the Navy's
ships had at least some features of the new systems, including
e-mail and limited World Wide Web access. Plexico says the IT21
system will be installed Navy-wide by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of IT21 extend beyond the battlespace.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT21 is about war-fighting,'' said Plexico. ``It's also about
administration . . . and quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy can save time and money by using efficient computer
networks to plan maintenance and order supplies. And sailors
scattered around the globe will be able to contact families and
friends without even having to pay for a postcard.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail goes out from standard PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows NT operating system, and Microsoft's Outlook e-mail
program. The e-mail computers are connected to the ship's
unclassified data network, used to link administrative computers
throughout the vessel. Secret information is handled over a secure
network that never comes in contact with the Internet-connected
system.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors get no access to Internet chat rooms, instant messaging
services, or the Usenet system of bulletin boards. Web access on
the ship is quite limited. Sailors can check out CNN, the ESPN
sports site, and a few others. But the ship uses software to block
out all Web sites that haven't been officially approved. That cuts
down on porn-site viewing, of course, but also prevents access to
thousands of innocuous and valuable Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the McFaul isn't the best place in the world to do
Web-surfing. It's connected through the ship's Inmarsat satellite
telephone system. This system provides just 64 kilobits per second
of data bandwidth, and half of that is reserved for voice traffic.
So all Internet users on the ship must share a mere 32-kilobit
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually pretty fast compared to some of the satellite
systems used for military communications. Critical traffic often
goes over radio links that can handle just 2,400 bits per second.
Slow as this is, it's enough to let ships exchange vital tactical
information. If more speed is needed in a combat situation, the
McFaul can commandeer the Inmarsat bandwidth as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy isn't immune to computer vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a couple of virus incidents, very limited in
scope,'' said Warrant Officer Stephen Fowler. For example, the
McFaul received an unwelcome visit from the Melissa computer virus
during its global rampage last year.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa was designed specifically to attack computers running
Microsoft software. In addition, Microsoft products have a
reputation for unexpected breakdowns, including the notorious
``Blue Screen of Death'' crash that forces the user to restart the
machine. Such a malfunction left the cruiser USS Yorktown dead in
the water for three hours in 1997, when Windows NT-based engine
room computers crashed during a test.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was caused by entry of bad data, not a bug in NT
itself. But Microsoft critics say that in a well-designed operating
system, incorrect data should not cause a crash. In any case, the
failure demonstrated that in a warship, the software for critical
ship systems has to be absolutely reliable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the weapons, navigation, and engineering systems on
McFaul and other ships rely on specially designed, highly reliable
software, not off-the-shelf products from Microsoft or other
vendors. In warfare, said Lt. Cmdr. Britton, ``if you get the Blue
Screen of Death, it really is the Blue Screen of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy continues to experiment with civilian gadgets as
well. For instance, it's begun issuing Palm Pilot handheld
computers to officers as replacements for their traditional paper
``wheelbooks.'' If it works out, it's possible that every sailor in
the fleet will be similarly equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the sailors more productive, because there
are likely to be fewer of them. In recent years, the Navy has found
it difficult to recruit new sailors and retain its veterans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men lined up to send e-mail, 20-year-old
Machinery Repairman Peter Chiu, has been with the McFaul since it
was commissioned. Chiu gets out in another month, and he can hardly
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been around here since commissioning,'' he said,
``and they're all ready to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's working hard to bolster recruiting, even hiring
controversial filmmaker Spike Lee to make TV commercials for the
service. But it's also planning a new generation of highly
automated warships that simply won't require as many sailors. The
next generation of destroyers, due to set sail by decade's end,
will be as capable as the McFaul, but will be operated by just 95
sailors. If it works, it'll save the Navy millions in personnel
expenses. And there'll be shorter lines outside the e-mail rooms.

TEEN GETS MICROSOFT'S RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joel Lamousnery didn't get his first computer until
three years ago _ but he hasn't wasted any time learning to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Dorchester High graduate has passed several Microsoft
exams on the first attempt _ a feat many adults fail, according to
Microsoft officials.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 17-year-old has passed three of six Microsoft
Certified Systems Engineer exams, which measure technical
proficiency and expertise. Many technology companies require them
as hiring criteria, but they are designed for experienced
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a student to pass of his age and experience level shows
dedication and commitment on his part,'' said Anthony Salcito,
Microsoft director of education for the East region. ``They are
difficult tests. They aren't easy to pass on the first try.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider a sample question:
</P>
<P>
   You have just installed a NE2000 Ethernet network adapter card
in a workstation with the following configuration: IRQ(EQ)3,
I/O(EQ)300h, MEM(EQ)CC000. What type of problem could result from
this installation?
</P>
<P>
   A. A potential IRQ conflict with COM1
</P>
<P>
   B. No problem, the PC is configured correctly.
</P>
<P>
   C. A potential IRQ conflict with COM2
</P>
<P>
   D. A potential IRQ conflict with the floppy drive
</P>
<P>
   The answer is C.
</P>
<P>
   Lamousnery will be in elite company if he passes all the exams.
To date, only 268,000 people nationwide have earned the credential.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a big deal that carries a lot of weight in the IT
world,'' said Marie Smith, a manager at Bell Atlantic's technical
support division, where Lamousnery is interning this summer. Smith
knows of managers who have taken courses to prepare for the exams _
but shied away from taking them in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Lamousnery the secret of his success on the exams, and he
shrugs it off with ``maybe I got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the exams, he says, to prepare for his career. He will
attend Northeastern University in the fall to study management
information systems. His goal: to oversee an information technology
company.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the exams, Lamousnery took courses through
TechBoston, a Boston public schools program that trains high school
students to get certified in several computer fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of Joel,'' said Mary Skipper, TechBoston
director. ``He's the epitome of what we want TechBoston students to
be. . . . He's the active student in his learning. We're feeding
him stuff, but he's taking it and learning on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamousnery asked his father years ago to buy him a computer, but
he can't recall exactly what he wanted to use it for. Initially, he
used it to research and write papers for school, then to manage a
life brimming with after-school activities that included mentoring
middle school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to use it like a very important tool to do all the
stuff I have to do in my life, and I wanted to learn it more,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamousnery's passion also led him to build his own computer,
piece by piece, ordering parts over the Internet from eight
companies and paying for it with money he earned working as a
grocery store cashier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something faster,'' he said. It cost him about $900
and took him about an hour to put together.

TRANS AM'S THE EPITOME OF RETRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dude!''
</P>
<P>
   These days, that passes for a sentence, as when the 16-year-old
pumping gas takes one look at the 2000 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am
convertible, with Ram Air, that you are driving and makes the
exclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: That's one boss car.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had some doubts the first time I climbed into this car. At a
time when ``retro'' is in _ Beetles, PT Cruisers, throw-back
convertible sports cars _ the Trans Am doesn't have to don the
retro mantle. It's always been retro and I felt, well, kind of old
driving it.
</P>
<P>
   The kid looked at the Trans Am's snout and saw snorting power. I
looked at it and saw _ Tori Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   I'll grant you, the car does not lack muscle, bold styling, or
raw sound _ all things I like. It's just that it is rooted in the
muscular past. Call it the anti-Porsche: From the driver's seat,
its front fenders disappear from view while the center of the hood
bulges like a popped bicep.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Mustang and the Camaro, the Trans Am still roams
the Pony Car range. Pontiac bills it as a muscle car with modern
control.
</P>
<P>
   Flick the traction control system on and off in various
situations and you'll see what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans Am, fresh air introduced into its 5.7-liter pushrod
V-8 via gaping hood snout and through the air cleaner, is a
320-horsepower charger that delivered a remarkable 20 miles per
gallon in a week of driving.
</P>
<P>
   And where many performance cars today seem to suck themselves to
the ground and pin you down in your seat at acceleration, the Trans
Am romps like a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Its nose lifts, it snorts, and it throws you back in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead on the highway, it bursts past other vehicles
and, with or without traction control, changes lanes smoothly.
Cornering on lesser roads, or accelerating (OK, stomping it) from a
standing start, however, can show you both sides of this beast.
</P>
<P>
   Without traction control, stomped starts generate immediate
oversteer (as in the north end of the horse tries to pass the south
end of the horse). With the control on, you still sense this effect
but it fixes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Without traction control and entering a corner as you should at
speed _ that is, with a slight tap of the brakes to set the weight
on your forward, steering wheels _ you find yourself plowing into
the turn and now you are in the world of understeer. Again,
traction control doesn't eliminate the sensation that this is about
to happen, but it does fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission made its upshifts before I
would like in some instances and if I were to buy this car, I'd go
with the optional 6-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans Am is not a small car so you are throwing around a bit
of bulk at high speed when you push it. I was surprised when I
passed a Grand Am on the highway and realized my car was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Handling this bulk requires beefy suspension and the Trans Am
has got that. Up front there are coil springs of gas-charged shocks
and stabilizer bars. The rear has a rear axle with torque arm,
trailing arm, track bar, coil springs, and stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a very stiff _ jarring on bumpy roads _ ride and
could not prevent a feeling of torsional twist in corners. In fact,
there was a strange sense of weight shifting to the rear and the
front end floating. You could get into trouble with this car.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes were also not the quickest I have encountered and
larger discs _ over a foot in diameter _ would help here.
</P>
<P>
   All this said, the Trans Am does carry a certain panache for a
particular segment of the population _ either young drivers or
older types still living hot-rod dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Car and Driver magazine has a category for cars such as this:
LAF.
</P>
<P>
   That's loud, affordable, fast.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, the car bulges just sitting there. Muscle car in full
flex.
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up headlights, distinct side moldings running down the side,
that Tori Spelling nose.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it has a distinct ``Star Wars''/performance persona. The
bucket seats _ front and rear _ are deep and supportive. Good
legroom up front, OK headroom. The rear seats don't have great
legroom, but lay you down nicely with their low posture.
</P>
<P>
   The gauges on the dash can disappear with certain steering wheel
settings, though the rumble of the engine pretty much tells you
what you are up to. Cabin noise is subdued _ you want to hear that
engine burbling, and you do. You don't want to hear wind whistling
through the gaps in a convertible top, and you don't. It's
remarkably quiet, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly didn't like the odd lump that eats up much of the
floor on the passenger's side up front. Trunk space is adequate
(you certainly could not take four on vacation in this rig), but
thankfully, the rear seat folds down, so you could travel as a
pair.
</P>
<P>
   I understand what this car is _ an enduring throwback _ and
respect its power and twitchiness. Makes me want to climb into a
Camaro and Mustang, just to compare Ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch
</P>
<P>
   --The ease with which the roof goes up and down. Even with
manual clips above the windshield, it's only a 20-second job.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors. Way too small, especially given the
C-pillar blocked view caused by so much canvas roof.
</P>
<P>
   --The dash vents. Circles that don't rotate. It takes an awkward
dual-twist of fins to redirect air.

WHY HARRY HAS SPECIAL POWERS _ OVER US

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' says educational consultant Jim Trelease,
whose career is devoted to getting children to read. `` `Harry
Potter' is the best thing to happen to children's books since the
invention of the paperback.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about ``Harry Potter,'' anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth book
in the series by J. K. Rowling, debuted Saturday, children have
been spotted reading in some of the darndest places, from the
bleachers of a Little League game to the line outside an ice cream
shop. At a family anniversary party in Weston, Mass. Sunday, four
10-, 11-, and 12-year-olds were walking around with heads stuck in
the 734-page tome.
</P>
<P>
   So what has Rowling tapped into that no other author of
children's literature ever has managed to do, landing two of her
books on the New York Times's Best Seller List simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   Trelease's theory is that they are page-turners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many books written for kids in recent years have been
issue-driven, about topics adults think kids should be reading,''
says Trelease, of Springfield, Mass. and author of ``The Read-Aloud
Handbook, 4th Edition'' (Penguin). ``These books are exciting. You
can't wait to know what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but Andy Barza, a ninth-grader at Beaver Country
Day School in Boston's Chestnut Hill section, gets to the nub of it
perhaps better than any adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry has powers every kid wishes he could have,'' he says.
``What kid doesn't want to be in control of his life as well as the
world around him?''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Rowling writes about issues that most children
spend a lot of time thinking about, even if they can't or don't
talk about them, and she does it without hitting them over the
head. She grabs readers almost immediately by making Harry an
orphan and a scapegoat, someone treated by his aunt and uncle
``like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Killing off parents is a familiar refrain in good children's
literature because it makes the children the main doers, says
internationally known language-arts educator Lucy Calkins. As an
orphan who goes to boarding school and whose foster parents are
glad to see him go, Harry gets a double whammy. That alone
translates to enormous control. That he has magical powers on top
of that makes Harry even more delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling is onto some big themes here, the universal childhood
fears of desertion, rejection, and inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As scary as it is for them, all kids fear they will be
abandoned,'' says children's literature specialist Masha Rudman, a
professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``They
think about losing their parents, being isolated, and not being
able to survive. Harry offers reassurance that they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes of his own doing, sometimes not, Harry frequently gets
into frightening dilemmas, and because Rowling is so clever, we
can't be sure he'll survive unscathed. Therein lies another
strength of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fails on occasion, but it doesn't kill him,'' says Rudman.
``Since fear of failing in all sorts of ways is another big issue
in childhood, he gives us hope that even when we fail, there is
still a chance for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also creates personalities children can identify with,
says reading specialist Julie Wood of Harvard's Graduate School of
Education. ``Every child knows an overachiever, a strict but
affectionate mistress, a bully,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of characters is one reason 10-year-old Conor
Detwiler is a big fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book isn't just about Harry,'' he says. ``There are other
people talking, so you hear people your age, no matter what your
age is, and you can wonder, `Well, would I do that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman speculates that Conor isn't the only reader framing
questions like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rowling's characters constantly battle with the give-and-take
between good and evil, and so do children,'' she says. ``In the
book, you don't know which direction things will go in, to the dark
side or the light side, the evil or the good, and that's often how
children feel: as if there's a war going on within them and the
outcome is a mystery, right down to the minute they act.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wood, it's more than the universality of Harry's struggles
that make the books work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut across social class and economics. They aren't full
of middle-class affluence the way `Babysitters Club' and other
series are,'' she says. ``Harry lives under the staircase (in his
uncle's home). He's impoverished, economically and emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   As cofounder of the Literacy Institute at the Neighborhood House
Charter School in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, Wood has seen
``Harry Potter'' serve as an entry into reading for kids who
previously didn't like to read. One 12-year-old boy was so excited
by the books that he got involved in a Web publishing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a breakthrough for him,'' says Wood, who urges parents
and teachers of nonreaders to find ways to put Harry into the hands
of children, especially those from low-income backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ``Goblet of Fire'' has been surrounded by so
much marketing hoopla that, depending on your point of view, it was
either brilliant or manipulative, Wood says in one way, at least,
the July date is a gift from the publisher: Children who don't read
over the summer typically lose some of the reading and writing
skills they gained in the previous academic year. The more they
read, and better yet, the more we engage with them about what they
read, the less likely they will fall victim to what educators call
the summer reading lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading is not just eyes over the print. The more thinking and
talking you do with your child between the pages of a book, the
better,'' says Calkins, director of the Reading &AMP; Writing Project
at Teachers College at Columbia University. Her newest book, ``The
Art of Teaching Reading'' (Addison Wesley Longman) is due out next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your child is reading the first ``Harry Potter'' or the
fourth, here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   --Read aloud to him/her. For children who are old enough to
understand it but might not read it themselves, you become a magic
carpet, taking them beyond their ability, says Calkins. Expect a
child who can read for himself to tell you at some point, ``I can't
wait for you.'' Even for him, our involvement is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every book has a song,'' says Calkins. ``You helped him feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood says reading aloud expands a child's background knowledge:
``There's great vocabulary in these books, but some kids will read
through words they don't understand. Reading aloud, you can pause:
`What a great word/phrase! Do you know what that means?' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Read along with your child. ``It's a draw to a child to have
you loving the same book,'' says Calkins. Because ``Harry Potter''
is chock full of nuance and foreshadowing, it lends itself to
exclamations such as, ``My gosh, did you realize what that
meant?!'' and to conversations not only about the content but also
about the writing.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask questions. The book could lead a child to form negative
opinions about foster parents (they're all cruel) and rich families
(they're all bad). Rudman recommends asking questions to help a
child argue with the author: How realistic is Harry's foster
family? What is it that makes Ron's family so wonderful? Other
topics to explore: How much did the characters change from the last
book? How good are Harry's decisions? After all, he often succumbs
to temptation even when he knows he shouldn't. Ask a young reader,
``Do you agree with all the decisions Harry makes?'' and an older
one: ``What's the difference between making a good decision and
writing a good story?''
</P>
<P>
   --Alter your child's identity. If your son has always hated
reading, instead of seeing this as a one-time event (``At least
you're reading a book.''), act as if it will continue, says
Calkins: ``What a reader you are! Here you are at 11, entering a
whole new phase of your life!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what educators like most about Rowlings's series is what
Calkins calls the Harry Potter phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect illustration of how social reading is for
kids,'' she says. ``Just like kids want to cut their hair the same
as peers, or dress the same, they want to read books that are the
talk of the town. They like to be part of what's in. That the
hottest thing around is a book, well, how fantastic is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Conor Detwiler says ``Harry Potter'' is never boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay attention to every detail because you know
sooner or later it will be important,'' he says. ``I talk to all my
friends about `Harry Potter.' I don't know anyone who doesn't read
them if they can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Reading specialists do not recommend ``Harry Potter'' for
children under 7, even if you read it to them. The relationships
among the characters are developmentally beyond them, as is the
line between reality and fantasy. (When the first book came out,
even author J.K. Rowling said her 6-year-old was too young for
it.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
--A child who reads ``Harry Potter'' at 8 or 9 may well enjoy it
again at 12 or 13 because she's at a different developmental stage
and will get something different out of it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Readers who like the ``Harry Potter'' series may also like the
Redwall series by Brian Jacques, the Narnia series by C. S. Lewis,
or books by Virginia Hamilton or Philip Pullman. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Help your child avoid the summer reading lag by making reading
and writing part of summer activities. Some ideas: a summer journal
or diary, an e-mail relationship, a photo essay of a trip, a
library reading program, a kids' publishing project on the
Internet. For other ideas, check out the America Reads Challenge

DO SUNBLOCK FILMS FOR WINDOWS REALLY WORK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C.   HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We're moving into a steel-beamed condo soon. The windows are
double pane and rated highly for wind resistance. My concern is
about UV rays from the sun, fading carpet, and furniture. I have
heard of a film that can be applied to block the rays. Are such
films effective, and how well do they hold up under washing?
</P>
<P>
   RUBY ANN PRITCHETT, Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. If your double-paned windows have Low E glass, they are
already UV resistant, and nothing more need be done. Low E glass
increases the window's insulating value and tends to reflect heat
and cold, and it helps filter out UV rays. To find out, check with
the manufacturer of the windows or the contractor.
</P>
<P>
   If the windows do not have Low E Glass, you can have them tinted
or coated. Find a company that does this in the Yellow Pages under
``glass coating and tinting.'' Properly done, these coatings should
last through many washings. They are professionally installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are renovating a 20-year-old, U-shaped ranch and would
like to add ridge vents when we redo the roof. We have four gable
vents now, with an attic fan in one of the vents, and soffit vents
all around. Do we keep the gable vents when we add ridge vents?
Also, the soffit vents, which are 12-inch rectangles every 6 to 8
feet, are rusted and bad looking, and my husband wants to replace
them with continuous vent strips. Would this work?
</P>
<P>
   MADELINE and AlAN ARON, Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. What you suggest doing is the best thing you can do for your
attic ventilation and for the house. The ridge vent on all ridges
is state of the art, and the continuous 2-inch-wide vent strips in
the soffits will complete the ventilating scheme. Those rectangular
soffit vents are OK except for the rusting, but are way too far
apart to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally recommended that when ridge and soffit vents are
installed, the gable vents should be closed, because open, they
will interfere with the efficiency of the ridge and soffit vents. I
agree.
</P>
<P>
   You can get rid of the attic fan, unless it is used as a whole
house fan, drawing air from outdoors into the first floor and out
the attic vent. If it is a whole house fan, you can leave it in
place and use it as needed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are considering changing our screened-in porch to a
sunroom, with good windows and screens, but we are afraid we would
be creating a hothouse. We don't want to get into heating and air
conditioning. What considerations should be keep in mind?
</P>
<P>
   MARY SONNER, Zionsville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your idea of converting the porch into a sunroom is a good
one, particularly if it's on the sunny side of the house. The idea
of a sunroom is to bring sun and heat into the room and into the
house in winter.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, shading and ventilation are important to keep the
room from getting superheated. Also, keeping it separate from the
house, that is, closing it off with an insulated door in summer, is
equally important.
</P>
<P>
   Venting can be done by keeping the windows open for
cross-ventilation, and shading the windows as well. Because heat
rises, it might be a good idea to put in some louvered vents above
the windows. These, of course, should be closed in winter, but in
summer will allow any heated air to escape more readily than
through lower windows.
</P>
<P>
   Shading can be done with window quilts, if you can get them in
the Midwest, sold in specialty home shops. These are most
expensive, but room-darkening shades will be helpful. Outside
awnings also will do a lot toward shading the sunroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son bought a 1930s Tudor-style house in Beverly. Roll
roofing was used to make the siding look like stucco. It is dirty
and weathered, and he'd liked to paint it, but the painters said
asphalt cannot be painted. Is that so? If so, what can he do?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK SHEA, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It ain't necessarily so. There are paints designed to cover
asphalt, but if you cannot find such a paint, consider painting the
siding with Reroof, a special, rubberized coating normally for
apshalt roof shingles. It's made by Masters Choice of Jamestown,
N.Y., 800-766-7622.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever heard of vinyl shingles, instead of the
standard vinyl siding (horizontal clapboards)? Are they any good,
or better than the siding?
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN McMAHON, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, we have heard of them, and have seen them at home shows.
They are different from the standard siding, but they are still
vinyl and, in my opinion, not worth putting on your house. If you
can't opt for wood, consider fiber-cement siding that comes in
clapboards and shingles. While it is an artificial siding, I think
fiber-cement is the best of the non-wood siding. Call 888-542-7343.

CARDINAL GIVES BUSH A RANGE OF CATHOLIC ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, Cardinal Bernard F. Law prepared for a
private sessionhe'd requested with George W. Bush. But when,
without public notice, the two met last week in San Diego, the
archbishop of Boston raised the issue of abortion only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to two others who sat in on the meeting, Law
used most of his 90 minutes with Bush urging him to take the bold
step of supporting universal health care coverage, a policy goal
more popular with liberal Democrats than conservative Republicans
and even more sweeping and costly than the plan proposed by Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush nears a decision on a vice presidential candidate, he is
carefully considering the importance of the Catholic vote and the
church's antiabortion view. An early favorite for the vice
presidency, Governor Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania, is under attack
by some Republicans because he is a Catholic who favors abortion
rights. As a result, some Bush associates who once backed Ridge are
now looking closely at prospects such as Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, who is Catholic and opposes abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But as Law's session with Bush demonstrates, the idea that
Catholics are focused solely or even mostly on abortion may be
simplistic. No one doubts Law's fervent opposition to abortion,
which is in accord with the teachings of his church. But less
noticed is the Catholic hierarchy's support for expanded health
care and anti-poverty programs. In addition, the church opposes the
death penalty, which Bush favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics are a complicated question,'' said James Guth,
professor of political science at South Carolina's Furman
University. ``They differ on a lot of things, and the one issue
that binds them is anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stirred sensitivities to anti-Catholicism last February
when he spoke at Bob Jones University, whose leaders had referred
to Catholicism as a cult. Since that appearance in South Carolina,
Bush has been trying to make amends with Catholic voters, assuring
them he has no bias and is seriously considering a Catholic running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means certain that Bush will pick a Catholic, but it
is clear that religious affiliation is a concern for the Texas
governor. Catholics make up about 25 percent to 30 percent of the
electorate and a sizable portion swing between the two main
political parties. They are especially numerous in the upper
Midwest, where the Bush campaign believes the election will be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is under pressure regarding the abortion issue. Some
Catholic leaders recently told the Bush campaign they would be
personally offended if Bush picked Ridge, according to a top Bush
associate, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said, `Don't stick a finger in the eye of the
Catholic Church. If you want to put a prochoice running mate on
your ticket, pick someone from another religion. Don't embarrass
us,' '' said the Bush associate, who now thinks Keating would be a
good choice because the Oklahoma governor, like Bush, opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the
mother is endangered
</P>
<P>
   Catholics used to be considered reliable Democrats. John F.
Kennedy captured about 80 percent of the Catholic vote in 1960,
according to Guth. In 1996, the Clinton-Gore ticket won about 54
percent of the Catholic vote, and played a key role in the election
outcome, Guth said. Current polls show that Bush and Gore would
roughly split the Catholic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics usually end up on the winning side,'' Guth said,
noting that Catholics are just as split on the abortion issue as
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond L. Flynn, the former Boston mayor and former US
ambassador to the Vatican, said both the Democratic and Republican
parties are ``out of touch'' with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion is one issue, certainly an important one,'' said
Flynn, president of Catholic Alliance, which encourages voter
participation and which Flynn said has 15,000 members. ``But there
are other issues, social and economic justice, that are the
cornerstone of the Catholic faith. The media focus on abortion.''
Flynn said the candidates should court his brand of Catholicism:
``pro-life, pro- family and pro-poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's meeting with Bush echoed that theme, and the cardinal was
specific about the need for the Republican Party to embrace
universal health coverage. Law has requested a similar meeting with
Gore, but the cardinal's associates said no session has been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Law currently is on a retreat and thus would not respond to
interview requests, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Law, who requested the meeting weeks ago, met with Bush July 5
at the San Diego Marriott. Two other participants, officials of the
Catholic Health Association, provided an account of the five-person
session. The fifth person was one of the cardinal's aides, while
Bush brought no one from his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Law and the Catholic health officials began by telling Bush the
effort by Congress to balance the budget has been too harsh,
leading to a $100 billion, five-year reduction in federal
assistance to hospitals, many run by Catholic organizations. The
Catholic leaders then presented Bush a written proposal that calls
for providing basic health insurance to the 45 million uninsured
Americans, with an estimated cost of $1,800 to $2,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a variety of federal tax credits and other
programs to help pay for health insurance. Gore has proposed
providing health insurance to all children and says his ultimate
goal is universal coverage. The proposal from Law for universal
coverage is most similar to the plan offered by Bill Bradley during
the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not make any commitment to Law's proposal, according to
one of the participants, Dr. Michael F. Collins, president of the
Caritas Christi Health Care System of Boston and vice-chairperson
of the Catholic Health Association of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Law did not mention the vice-presidential selection
and made only a brief comment about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal made a statement during the meeting that he felt
a commitment to a just health care system was a pro-life message,''
Collins said. ``That was the only reference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Michael D. Place, president of the Catholic Health
Association and another participant at the meeting, stressed they
were not playing down abortion, but rather they were trying to
expand the meaning of ``pro-life'' to include health care for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far to say he shares our concerns'' about health
coverage, Place said of Bush. ``He did not go on to agree with our
strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Law and the others handed Bush could be viewed as
tying the antiabortion position and universal health care together.
``Human life is sacred and each person has inherent dignity,'' the
document said. ``There is a human right to basic and compassionate
quality health care, regardless of age, income, illness, or
condition of life, and a morally responsible society has an
obligation to provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Fournier, a co-founder and chaplain of the Catholic
Alliance, said the proposal for universal coverage is an emerging
focus of Catholic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes from conception to natural death,'' Fournier said.
``Of course we oppose abortion. It is a barometer issue. But there
are many more issues. How we do we treat people across their lives?
There is concern for the poor. Either party is mistaken if they
think they can just get the Catholic vote by pandering.''

DRAWING A LINE IN SUBURBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday apparently is a lively night in the seemingly deserted
old factories of Attleboro, Mass., but a slow night at the Police
Department across the street.
</P>
<P>
   That must be the explanation for why two enterprising detectives
decided to while away some time last weekend in a search for
missing musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   They found better stuff than they bargained for. Not the kind of
guys to be dissuaded by a sign on the factory door _ it read,
``Anger Within'' _ they came back with the goods.
</P>
<P>
   They found 50 sex freaks, some of them naked. They discovered
whips and wooden spatulas. Paddles and spikes.
</P>
<P>
   And they did their public duty. This isn't New York City, Las
Vegas, or some other sin-drenched destination. This is
Massachusetts, and Boston is not the only place where kinky is
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might describe the booty the police hauled in as sex
``toys,'' but the boys in Attleboro know better. They may not be
able to define filth, but they know it when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the diligence of Detectives Timothy Cook and John
Otrando, Attleboro is safe from 50 people who thought they could
indulge in their bizarre hobby in a God-fearing city. The group
apparently had been meeting regularly since February, a
pay-for-play S &AMP; M club convenient to the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, a few people have already started wringing their
hands about about rights, privacy, those sorts of things. Ignore
them, I say. Privacy is the last refuge of scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   The case does appear to be a legal novelty. Surprisingly,
authorities have not alleged prostitution, for example. And, while
several-dozen people were present at the time of the raid, only two
have been charged, one man from New Hampshire who rented the space
and a woman who paddled another woman, allegedly on the man's
orders. He has been described as the leader of this venture, though
it doesn't sound organized enough to anoint a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much as I admire the diligence of the Attleboro police, it came
as news that spanking someone who was asking for it and paying for
the privilege is a crime. Or that someone could be an accessory to
an assault by spanking.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has hit with a vengeance in Attleboro. For
months, a local religious group has been at loggerheads with the
Bristol district attorney's office, its members refusing to testify
about the deaths of two children. At least eight members have been
jailed for refusing to testify before a grand jury, and 13 children
have been taken away by the state, leaving just a handful of adults
free to prolong the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comment the latest case has attracted has focused on
the fact that it occurred in Attleboro, a typical bedroom community
off Interstate 95 where, supposedly, very little fun ever takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. Suburbia is a teeming petri dish of strange practices,
precisely because it is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Attleboro isn't going to take moral drift lying
down. On Tuesday, the two scofflaws were arraigned. In photos, they
look mortified, especially the would-be dominatrix. That's probably
because she feels exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not as relieved as I might be. I can't help wondering
if this is only the beginning. If 50 people who apparently
connected by e-mail can cause this much alarm, what else is going
on in supposedly sleepy Attleboro?
</P>
<P>
   Are we really supposed to believe that no one else is getting
spanked? Do we know _ really know _ that there are no other spiked
gloves in town, no more black leather that's somehow made it over
the border from Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   I don't like to even mention this, but if people forked over
cash to go to this party, could there be others walking around town
thinking they have some kind of right to be turned on by pain?
</P>
<P>
   And if there are, then what?
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the hard work of saving Attleboro has barely begun.
Filth must be rooted out block by block, house by house, bedroom by
bedroom. Vice anywhere is a threat to virtue everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Someone will probably suggest that consensual spanking is a
victimless crime, that kinky sex is just a matter of taste. They
will prattle about the sexual revolution, the need to be
open-minded, the right to whatever floats your boat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Cook and Otrando know better. Where anger lurks
behind closed doors, vice surely will follow. Moral intolerance was
the making of Massachusetts, and heritage is sacred.

IS THAT A GUN IN YOUR POCKET?: WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF POWER IN
HOLLYWOOD 
By Rachel Abramowitz. 
Random House. 400 pp. $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?'' is an unfortunate title for a
book that is not a ``Boogie Nights''-like peek into the seamier
side of Tinseltown filmmaking. No starry-eyed starlets here. No
replays of famed casting-couch contretemps.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's some good gossip and some self-destructive,
ego-driven, power-lusting male creatures included in these pages:
Bob Evans, Peter Bogdanovich, and the barely literate Jon Peters,
to name a few. But the focus is squarely on the book's subtitle,
``Women's Experience of Power in Hollywood,'' or how women broke
open the male stranglehold on a town notoriously run by men for
men; how women became producers, directors, screenwriters, heads of
studios, and talent agents during the 1980s and '90s; and how their
career successes affected their private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a dry, scholarly, fact-filled look at the power
politics in the movie industry, the book is a folksy glimpse into
how a few gutsy, well-educated women learned to function and play
in this egomaniacal, man's world. Author Rachel Abramowitz began
pouring the foundation for the book in 1992 when she was 26 and was
asked by the editor of Premiere magazine to write about women in
the movie business. Her goal, says Abramowitz, was to put together
an oral history filled with the ``kinds of intimacies women discuss
with one another, usually when men aren't around. I wanted the
messy, unpredictable truth, and I wanted to hear it in their
voices.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of interviews, she's filled her book with the
arresting, witty, loquacious voices of the female pioneers in
Hollywood. There's the late Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a
major studio, who was as famous for her unapologetic ambition and
simmering rage as she was for her long thick tresses, sense of
humor, love affairs and the movies she helped develop _
``Flashdance,'' ``Footloose'' and ``The Accused.'' Her death at age
51 in 1997 opens the book.
</P>
<P>
   While Steel was portrayed as a woman who thrived on toughness,
Sherry Lansing, who became production head of Fox Studios in 1979,
was called a geisha and was savaged by jealous and malicious gossip
after her appointment. As chairman of Paramount Pictures, she's
helped filled the studio's coffers with the proceeds from ``Forrest
Gump'' and, more recently, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the talented production designer, Polly Platt, who
was deeply wounded by husband Peter Bogdanovich's affair with
Cybill Shepherd and soothed her pain and her insecurities with
Valium and beer. Her best work, she feels, was on ``The Witches of
Eastwick.'' There's the impudent, muumuu-clothed, loud-mouthed
agent Sue Mengers, whose clients included Gene Hackman, Burt
Reynolds, Candice Bergen, and her soul sister, Barbra Streisand,
until Jon Peters elbowed his way into the star's life. There are
Elaine May, Carrie Fisher, and Nora Ephron, who all excelled at
writing, and the first woman to become an A-list director, Penny
Marshall, whom Abramowitz says never was able to come to grips with
the fact that ``she wasn't as pretty as the starlets who stocked
Hollywood.'' There's Jodie Foster, who grew from a dutiful and
docile child actor into a disillusioned adult actress only to
eventually take home two Oscars and begin a career as a director.
</P>
<P>
   The brief background sketches of these women give a
pop-psychology insight into their early developments, a history of
their loves and losses, their career highs and lows are skillfully
woven by the author to maximum page-turning effect. The gossip is
juicy, not vicious. And an elementary overview of the industry
helps put the book's women in the context of movie-making _ the
plunging of movie attendance in the early 1970s, the introduction
of the blockbusters (``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'') and finally, the
slow inclusion of films that depicted the problems of modern women,
beginning with ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' ``A League of One's Own,''
and ``Thelma and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   One gaping hole in the book is that the most recent influx of
female directors and producers are mentioned only by name, and a
short epilogue on the popularity of ``Titanic'' tries to move the
book into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is That a Gun in Your Pocket'' is not a book for diehard film
buffs. But it's a good read for moviegoers who want a little
insight into the bigger-than-life female personalities responsible
for paving the way to a more balanced gender representation in
America's favorite industry.

`BIG BROTHER' IS BUSY SPYING, BUT WHO'S WATCHING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point during the first week of ``Big Brother'' _ was it
when schleppy George donned the Lulu wig and William taught him the
funky chicken, or was it when cartoon-haired Brittany sobbed over
an ailing hen? _ I did feel a little unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't because TV voyeurism is pulling up the stakes of
civilization and threatening to turn us all into
dignity-and-privacy-starved Pagongs. And it wasn't because most of
the nation has yet to get hooked on this hugely hyped TV
experiment, whose ratings have been mostly down since last
Wednesday's off-putting primer episode. It was because I was
getting bored and distracted, hungry for some ``reality'' action,
wondering if I could rustle up a tape of the late ``Melrose
Place,'' another soap opera series with a pool conveniently
provided for the baring of flesh. Now, there was some dish on a
platter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, and that's an important qualification, watching ``Big
Brother'' is only slightly more exciting than watching a drugstore
surveillance tape. One week in, CBS's five-nights-a-week series
remains slow, self-conscious, and visually sterile. It is notably
short on its genre's most important ingredients: conflict,
alliance, flesh, and human nature on a binge. Those are what give
us the material to judge the cast members _ and our judgment and
debates are what float shows like this and ``Survivor'' (Richard
sucks!). To be fair, reality melodrama can be a slow-blooming
phenomenon; it takes time for hatred, dissent, contempt, and sexual
tension to grow. But in the meantime, we're left with full-frontal
images of cast members brushing their teeth, a game of poolside
footsie, and 10 characters who have yet to let themselves go.
</P>
<P>
   Once they do, ``Big Brother'' may catch fire. Tuesday night's
episode revealed what the show could become, as some of the _ what
do you call them? detainees? _ began to grate on one another's
nerves. William once again proved to be incendiary, going head-on
with Brittany about her limited view of race in America. He failed
to articulate his criticism, and she was too defensive to help him;
but emotions ran high, with the 25-year-old nose-ringed virgin
sobbing that her best black friend is not token.
</P>
<P>
   The show may gain more momentum as the housemates choose two
candidates for banishment. (Viewers will then vote by phone, and
next Thursday the loser will be kicked out.) This rejection process
will surely raise the house temperature, as well as viewers'
interest; it's what gives ``Survivor'' such water-cooler intensity.
It brings out ``The Lottery'' in us all.
</P>
<P>
   William, of course, is the most likely to be booted, though I'd
hate to see him go. He's openly provocative, trying to make fools
of the group by falsifying a ``Big Brother'' challenge, rolling his
eyes about the sick-chicken crisis, and yet he's oddly sympathetic
as a fish out of water. He has kept ``Big Brother'' from imploding,
particularly as other housemates withhold their controversial data.
Jordan, for instance, keeps quiet about her exotic-dancing job,
even when the conversation begs for disclosure. And Jamie has
whispered to only a sacred few that she is, in fact, currently Miss
Washington USA.
</P>
<P>
   The second nominee for rejection? Despite his cancer history
(where did that get poor Sonja on ``Survivor''?), and despite his
braveness about having lost a leg, Eddie may be annoying the group
with his macho, Rocky-like ways. He can be narcissistic, believing
Jordan's critique of models was somehow aimed at him and his model
girlfriend, and he's too businesslike, wearing a T-shirt that reads
``Potential Millionaire.'' Also on the short list: George, the
suburban dad who wants to be loved a little too much. He's not as
funny as he thinks he is. And Curtis: Say something, dude.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to muster passion about the impending ``Big
Brother'' eviction at this point. Right now, ``Big Brother'' is
what Henry James labeled certain fat 19th-century novels: a loose,
baggy monster. It's filled with dead air _ conversational pauses,
sluggish camera zooms, and mundane tasks as filler. With five
episodes a week, and not much time to edit, the editors leave their
footage ragged and shapeless. Real-time postmodern art? Perhaps.
But the fast-paced episodes of ``The Real World'' and ``Survivor''
are just about poetry compared to ``Big Brother.'' They are
carefully distilled from days of shooting and made dense with
drama. You feel the editors working to create a story to engage you
(at the expense of documentary accuracy, of course). Watching ``Big
Brother,'' you feel abandoned by the man behind the curtain, left
to the eternal rigors of 24/7 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't help that the packaging of ``Big Brother'' is so
very blah. The introductory graphics are cheesy, in a
computer-generated, local-newscast kind of way, and the generic New
Age-y soundtrack is no better. The voice of Big Brother, which
introduces segments with lines like ``Racial tensions heat up in
the kitchen,'' is vacant and humorless. And if the dazzlingly
playful ``Real World'' homes are eye candy, then the ``Big
Brother'' house is the opposite of eye candy; it's visual Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   Who designed this joint _ Samuel Beckett? Is it manufactured to
drive the inhabitants insane?
</P>
<P>
   Dare we hope so?

   1. THERE ARE NO `ARABS' AND `ISRAELIS' AT CAMP DAVID, by Anne
Applebaum
</P>
<P>
   Any Arab-Israeli deal at Camp David is virtually guaranteed to
produce angry, even violent opposition. Therefore, if a really
meaningful breakthrough is to be achieved, Ehud Barak and Yasser
Arafat will have to detach themselves from the factional, domestic
politics at home, ignore the probable negative consequences for
themselves and their political parties, cast aside petty concerns
about things like ``the next elections,'' close their eyes, cross
their fingers, sign, and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   And that's asking a lot of politicians.

   2. THE MACARTHUR GENIUSES: HOW TO BECOME ONE OF THEM, by David
Plotz
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur genius grant has become the United States' most
famous philanthropy project not because it rewards stellar people _
though it does _ but because it's mysterious. Several hundred
talent scouts, whose identities are secret, suggest nominees to the
selection committee. The committee, whose members are also secret,
covertly gathers dossiers on the nominees and selects two-dozen odd
winners.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where self-promotion is a constitutional right, the
MacArthur is endlessly frustrating: You can't nominate yourself,
you can't nominate a friend, you can't lobby for it if you are
nominated. What's an unappreciated genius to do?
</P>
<P>
   Don't fear, the MacArthur is less cryptic than it seems. It can
be gamed. Here's how to improve your odds of becoming a certifiable
genius.

   3. ALLISON FISHER IS THE TIGER WOODS OF NINE-BALL, by Joseph
Nocera
</P>
<P>
   Nine-ball has become the default billiards game in both the
men's and women's professional circuits. And at the Woman's
National Championship, Allison Fisher is the Tiger Woods, the
Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky, of nine-ball. Like them, she
makes the impossible look easy, and the difficult routine. Maybe
it's time for The Nine-Ball Battle of the Sexes.

<P>
   There is nothing more refreshing than a chilled soup on a hot
summer day. And when the soup seems rich and satisfying but is not
calorific it offers a double bonus because it fills you up without
fattening you up. Soup, salad and really good country bread are all
that you need for a summer supper.
</P>
<P>
   The soup recipes here have another great feature: one requires
no cooking at all, another barely any cooking and even in the one
where some cooking is necessary it is only a matter of about 10
minutes. It will hardly heat up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are quite simple and easy to put together, but
everything depends on the quality and flavor of the ingredients. If
the corn is not sweet, if the tomatoes are not deeply red and very
ripe, and if the basil is not crisply fresh you will still have a
soup, but it will not provide you with the essence of summer. This
season is far too short for anything but the very best.
</P>
<P>
   The colors of the corn and basil soup and the corn and pepper
soup are particularly alluring. The tomato basil soup is not as
handsome but the flavors make up for what it lacks in beauty.
</P>
<P>
   You can make any of these soups thicker or thinner by adjusting
the amount of kefir or buttermilk that you use. If you have never
used kefir before think of it as a thinner version of yogurt.
</P>
<P>

AUTO INDUSTRY RETHINKING THE FUTURE OF SUVS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ America's marriage with sport utility vehicles has
always been a love-hate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   We love them for their utility, the sense of security they give
to occupants, and what they say about our active lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   We hate them for their gas-guzzling and environmentally harmful
ways, their tendency to tip over, the threat to occupants of
smaller vehicles, and what they say about our selfish lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors' Desert Proving Grounds in Mesa, college teams
from 15 engineering schools around the country worked recently, in
a program called FutureTruck, to help save the marriage. Each team
was given a new Chevrolet Suburban, modest financial backing, and
free expert advice. Their mission: Build the SUV of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge came as SUVs and pickups (classified, along with
vans, by the government as trucks) approach a regulatory and
consumer crossroads _ over safety questions, the reality of
escalating gasoline prices, and stricter government rules on
emissions and gasoline mileage _ even as their sales numbers
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive News projects that this year 9,138,184 trucks will be
built in North America, and 8,172,244 cars. By 2004, that gap will
widen from 9,692,789 to 7,492,446.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation, says Shelley Launey, director of the Clean
Cities Program for the US Department of Energy, that could put both
the FutureTruck participants and their experimental vehicles at the
heart of efforts to build a cleaner, more efficient fleet of
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Already manufacturers recognize the conflict between consumers'
hearts and consciences. Ford Motor Co. recently acknowledged in
presenting its corporate annual report that its SUVs need to be
cleaner and safer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Toyota had announced, even as it unveiled the latest in
what will be a fleet of five SUV models, that it needs to become
``greener'' in its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   And before that, Dodge announced that its popular Durango will
be offered with a 6-cylinder, hybrid gasoline-electric engine that
is cleaner, gets better mileage, and is stronger than its current
V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of testing the Suburbans at the Desert Proving Grounds
showed that GM and the students _ along with Dodge and its Durango
SUV _ are riding what could become a wave of hybrids that use
electric motors to boost the efforts of smaller gasoline engines.
It exploits technology that is already being introduced in cars
from Toyota, Honda, Ford, and GM.
</P>
<P>
   Students, engineers, and industry officials all agreed that the
lineup of rebuilt Suburbans at the Desert Proving Grounds was
symbolic of where America stands today in its efforts to build
cleaner, more efficient vehicles. Of the 15, there were no solely
electric SUVs; 14 of them were some variation of the hybrid, and
the one fuel cell vehicle (a technology believed to be 10-20 years
away) was lacking a major component: the fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell _ with liquid hydrogen as its key element _
generates electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a
reaction with only two byproducts: water vapor and heat. But it
remains prohibitively expensive _ as much as $1 million for a
single cell today.
</P>
<P>
   In hybrids, electric motors work in conjunction with regular
gasoline engines, sometimes powering the vehicle themselves on
short trips or at times working to boost the power of the gas
engine that would be smaller than typically used. When the vehicle
is running on the gas engine, braking causes the electric motor to
work as a generator, charging the car's batteries for future use.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Insight and Toyota's Prius, two small cars powered by
hybrid engines, are selling well in the United States, and both
will probably become the basis for hybrid models of more standard
autos. Honda will offer its popular Civic model in the United
States as a hybrid beginning in 2002. GM and Ford have displayed
high-mileage prototypes of hybrid sedans.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that trucks now outsell cars in the United
States, and that they tend to consume far more fuel than their
smaller counterparts, specialists say that modest gains in fuel
efficiency in the truck fleet would be more beneficial than strides
in smaller vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as gasoline prices soared this spring and summer,
there was no noticeable effect on the sales of trucks and SUVs.
Those in the industry, from Ron Zarella, president of General
Motors-North America, to Don Madden, a local Ford dealer, say that
SUVs continue to sell because people who can afford to drop $40,000
to $50,000 for a vehicle aren't fazed by spending a few hundred
dollars more per year for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But reform is surely on the way. Half of the participants in
this year's and subsequent FutureTruck competitions will end up
with jobs in the auto industry, said Launey of the Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll bring with them the interest in and understanding of
advanced vehicle technology that includes an appreciation of fuel
economy and reduced emissions,'' Launey said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the fuel cell concept appearing ``like it's a long time
before it's going to be competitive,'' she added, ``any program
where maintaining the power and utility of the vehicle is the goal,
you almost have to be hybrid.''
</P>
<P>
   So the students from colleges and universities in the United
States and Canada came to FutureTruck _ sponsored by GM, the
Department of Energy and Yahoo.com _ with hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Institute of Technology kept the stock 5.3-liter V-8
Vortec engine that came in the Suburban, burned reformulated
gasoline and aided it with a high-torque electric motor to help cut
gasoline consumption during heavy tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Davis powered its Suburban with
a 1.9-liter Saturn engine and aided it with an electric motor that
kicked in to help with acceleration and towing.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland went with a 3.8-liter 6-cylinder
engine that ran on ethanol and was boosted by an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Wisconsin replaced the Suburban's steel frame
with an aluminum frame to save weight.
</P>
<P>
   And West Virginia University coupled a 4.2-liter turbocharged
diesel engine with an electric motor and managed a powerful 260
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The schools competed in safety, performance, towing ability,
greenhouse emissions, fuel economy, and consumer acceptability. No
one offered radical safety solutions _ though advances in this area
are already coming from manufacturers in the form of SUVs and
trucks with lower impact rails to prevent them from climbing over
smaller vehicles in crashes. In addition, manufacturers are
planning a host of SUVs that more closely resemble the
old-fashioned station wagon with big but safer lower stances.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for gasoline mileage and environmental
improvements presented by the students was impressive, judges said.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia, whose Suburban reduced greenhouse emissions 23
percent, was the overall winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech truck won the towing competition, a grueling
test through 112-degree heat across the arid landscape, even as it
saved gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   And the UC-Davis SUV, which can run on strictly electric power
while in the city, managed 18.7 miles per gallon, nearly a 20
percent increase over stock Suburban performance.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers must still be convinced that hybrid powerplants can
perform much like standard engines _ and Honda's Insight is
apparently doing just that as sales have persuaded the manufacturer
to boost its 2000 production for the United States from 4,000 to
6,500 and expand the hybrid concept to the Civic.
</P>
<P>
   So the marketplace and the SUV experimenters appear to be moving
in the same direction: more efficient and more environmentally
friendly hybrid power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have electric until we have the fuel cell, and right
now nobody's got it,'' said Luciano Martin, the technical adviser
for the team from Montreal's Concordia University. ``Right now,
hybrid is what we've got.''

&HT;     ROSEMARY: A PERFECT DINNER COMPANION

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rosemary, long the symbol of remembrance, love
and death, was used in ancient Greece and Rome in weddings and
funerals to signify enduring affection.
</P>
<P>
   Greek students wore rosemary in their hair to help their memory
during exams. Wreaths containing rosemary were also worn during
festivals. The herb was often called for in magic spells. People
also used to place sprigs of rosemary under their pillows to ward
off nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that the dense, evergreen, aromatic herb, which
grows wild along the Mediterranean coast, is derived from the Latin
meaning ``dew of the sea.'' Use rosemary's soft, blue flowers to
float in punches, in salads or as garnish. The needlelike leaves
are flavorful in a variety of dishes, and the stems, stripped of
their leaves, can be used as skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary is also known for its medicinal traits. The herb fights
bacteria, can be used as an astringent, aids digestion and
stimulates circulation. It also is good for headaches and high
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The herb's historical significance is associated with the Virgin
Mary, according to Arabella Boxer and Philippa Back, authors of
``The Herb Book,'' (Peerage Books, 1985). ``The flowers are
believed to have taken their color from her blue cloak when she
threw it over a rosemary bush to dry,'' the authors write. Another
legend claims the flowers received their color when Mary, fleeing
to Egypt, placed her blue cloak over a rosemary bush.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT: Rosemary
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: A pungent evergreen herb that is a member of the mint
family.
</P>
<P>
   FORMS: Fresh, dried
</P>
<P>
   LOOK FOR: Thin, dark-green needlelike leaves that are aromatic
with a woodsy perfume.
</P>
<P>
   STORE: Fresh sprigs in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for
several days. Store dried rosemary in an airtight container in a
cool, dark place for up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   USE IN: Lamb, chicken, pork and fish dishes, egg dishes,
tomato-based sauces, breads, vegetables, pizza, potato gratins,
apple jelly.

IT'S OFFICIAL: THE THUNDERBIRD RETURNS IN '02 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the buzzing afterglow that automobile designers and
manufacturers dream about. They unveil a new model at an auto show
and the reaction is electric.
</P>
<P>
   Build it, the public demands. The buzz lingers; the demand is
unending. What's a manufacturer to do? Curiously, however, the
latest buzz vehicles have been, rather than something totally new,
a step back in time. Hence, Volkswagen's New Beetle and Chrysler's
PT Cruiser. See them in a parking space near you.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, readers have asked me.
</P>
<P>
   I give you the Ford Thunderbird, another retro intro, unveiled
as a concept car at the 1999 Detroit International Auto Show. There
has been a constant buzz about the T-Bird ever since. And now it is
official: Ford will build a two-seat Thunderbird beginning next
year and sell it for the 2002 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the New Beetle, like the PT Cruiser, it is not really a
retro car. It is purely evocative and that is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to those mid-1950s Thunderbirds, before Ford lost its
way and made them bigger and uglier down the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ford itself acknowledges the history of the T-Bird to be one of
``glory years, dark days'' but now proclaims a triumphant return.
Thankfully, with its mesh grille, rounded and subtle lines, and
seating for just two, Ford is giving us the best of what the T-Bird
once was. It is reaching back through the decades, through designs
called ``square,'' ``projectile,'' ``jet aircraft,'' and
``luxury,'' through variations that included four doors and
horrific, bulging noses, to give us the car they dreamed up in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   This was in 1954 _ for the '55 model year. The goal, in upbeat,
postwar America was a two-passenger, canvas-topped sports car. They
wanted it under 3,000 pounds, V-8 powered, and capable of topping
100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ford delivered a car just over 3,000 pounds with a 102-inch
wheelbase and overall length of 175 inches. It sat just 52 inches
high and was powered by a 292-cubic-inch V8. Price? $3,000-$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to name the car, there was some debate.
Imagine if any of these suggestions had been adopted: Beaver, Hep
Cat, Arcturus, or El Tigre. Would we be panting today over the
reintroduction of the Hep Cat?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the new Thunderbird draws its lines not from any of
the abominations of the 1970s and '80s, but instead from the '50s
with a dash of the 1961 model tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   The two-seater was a huge success. But Ford, for some reason,
had to tinker with it. The changes for 1956 were fine _ better
cabin ventilation, more trunk space created by moving the spare
tire outside above the rear bumper. Even the portholes in the rear
of the hardtop roof had a certain class to them. But by 1957, the
two-seater was dead. Killed by a bad case of big and ugly. For the
next four decades, we got four-seaters, long roofs, fender skirts,
sharp sculpted lines that looked more Lincoln Continental than
sports car, and those deeply-browed twin headlights. The brows
looked like George Chuvalo after Muhammad Ali pounded on him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1958, the wheelbase had grown to 113 inches and the car was
nearly three feet longer than the original. It also weighed nearly
two tons. The T-Bird retained this ``square'' look until 1961 when
the ``projectile'' look _ with cleaner body lines and sharply
creased where hood met grille _ was introduced. This was a better
looking car, but by the mid-'60s square was back and the ugly
plunge continued.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, the T-Bird had hit the wall. It got a long hood that
ended in an extruded aluminum grille, called a ``poke-thru-nose.''
The designer of this 4,551-pound behemoth should have been poked in
the nose. By 1997, the T-Bird was, mercifully, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's coming back. New platform, new power, new technology.
More on that in a later column. For now, let's just enjoy the
new/old lines. We're gonna party like it's 1955.

TRANS AM'S THE EPITOME OF RETRO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dude!''
</P>
<P>
   These days, that passes for a sentence, as when the 16-year-old
pumping gas takes one look at the 2000 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am
convertible, with Ram Air, that you are driving and makes the
exclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: That's one boss car.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had some doubts the first time I climbed into this car. At a
time when ``retro'' is in _ Beetles, PT Cruisers, throw-back
convertible sports cars _ the Trans Am doesn't have to don the
retro mantle. It's always been retro and I felt, well, kind of old
driving it.
</P>
<P>
   The kid looked at the Trans Am's snout and saw snorting power. I
looked at it and saw _ Tori Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   I'll grant you, the car does not lack muscle, bold styling, or
raw sound _ all things I like. It's just that it is rooted in the
muscular past. Call it the anti-Porsche: From the driver's seat,
its front fenders disappear from view while the center of the hood
bulges like a popped bicep.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Mustang and the Camaro, the Trans Am still roams
the Pony Car range. Pontiac bills it as a muscle car with modern
control.
</P>
<P>
   Flick the traction control system on and off in various
situations and you'll see what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans Am, fresh air introduced into its 5.7-liter pushrod
V-8 via gaping hood snout and through the air cleaner, is a
320-horsepower charger that delivered a remarkable 20 miles per
gallon in a week of driving.
</P>
<P>
   And where many performance cars today seem to suck themselves to
the ground and pin you down in your seat at acceleration, the Trans
Am romps like a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Its nose lifts, it snorts, and it throws you back in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead on the highway, it bursts past other vehicles
and, with or without traction control, changes lanes smoothly.
Cornering on lesser roads, or accelerating (OK, stomping it) from a
standing start, however, can show you both sides of this beast.
</P>
<P>
   Without traction control, stomped starts generate immediate
oversteer (as in the north end of the horse tries to pass the south
end of the horse). With the control on, you still sense this effect
but it fixes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Without traction control and entering a corner as you should at
speed _ that is, with a slight tap of the brakes to set the weight
on your forward, steering wheels _ you find yourself plowing into
the turn and now you are in the world of understeer. Again,
traction control doesn't eliminate the sensation that this is about
to happen, but it does fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission made its upshifts before I
would like in some instances and if I were to buy this car, I'd go
with the optional 6-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans Am is not a small car so you are throwing around a bit
of bulk at high speed when you push it. I was surprised when I
passed a Grand Am on the highway and realized my car was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Handling this bulk requires beefy suspension and the Trans Am
has got that. Up front there are coil springs of gas-charged shocks
and stabilizer bars. The rear has a rear axle with torque arm,
trailing arm, track bar, coil springs, and stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a very stiff _ jarring on bumpy roads _ ride and
could not prevent a feeling of torsional twist in corners. In fact,
there was a strange sense of weight shifting to the rear and the
front end floating. You could get into trouble with this car.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes were also not the quickest I have encountered and
larger discs _ over a foot in diameter _ would help here.
</P>
<P>
   All this said, the Trans Am does carry a certain panache for a
particular segment of the population _ either young drivers or
older types still living hot-rod dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Car and Driver magazine has a category for cars such as this:
LAF.
</P>
<P>
   That's loud, affordable, fast.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, the car bulges just sitting there. Muscle car in full
flex.
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up headlights, distinct side moldings running down the side,
that Tori Spelling nose.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it has a distinct ``Star Wars''/performance persona. The
bucket seats _ front and rear _ are deep and supportive. Good
legroom up front, OK headroom. The rear seats don't have great
legroom, but lay you down nicely with their low posture.
</P>
<P>
   The gauges on the dash can disappear with certain steering wheel
settings, though the rumble of the engine pretty much tells you
what you are up to. Cabin noise is subdued _ you want to hear that
engine burbling, and you do. You don't want to hear wind whistling
through the gaps in a convertible top, and you don't. It's
remarkably quiet, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly didn't like the odd lump that eats up much of the
floor on the passenger's side up front. Trunk space is adequate
(you certainly could not take four on vacation in this rig), but
thankfully, the rear seat folds down, so you could travel as a
pair.
</P>
<P>
   I understand what this car is _ an enduring throwback _ and
respect its power and twitchiness. Makes me want to climb into a
Camaro and Mustang, just to compare Ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch
</P>
<P>
   --The ease with which the roof goes up and down. Even with
manual clips above the windshield, it's only a 20-second job.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors. Way too small, especially given the
C-pillar blocked view caused by so much canvas roof.
</P>
<P>
   --The dash vents. Circles that don't rotate. It takes an awkward
dual-twist of fins to redirect air.

NETWORK ENGINES TAKES OFF ON DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Network Engines (NENG:Nasdaq) shot up 62 percent after
they made their stock market debut on Thursday, showing that
investors now reward only those new issues that can stand up to
intense scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Network Engines was trading up 10 5/8 at 27 11/16 by early
afternoon. Its initial public offering was priced at $17 a share,
at the top of the $15 to $17 range that had already been increased.
The number of shares offered to the public was also increased, to
6.5 million from 5.5 million, enabling the company to raise $110.5
million with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Randolph, Mass., Network Engines is part of the
emerging market server appliance market, which is projected to
enjoy 70 percent annual growth over the next five years. ``We like
investing in companies that are building the information
superhighway,'' said Yusuf Haque, an analyst at the financial
information portal 123Jump.com.
</P>
<P>
   Network Engines creates specialized Internet servers, which dish
out information over the Web, at a faster rate and lower cost than
the multifunctional servers developed by such companies as Sun
Microsystems (SUNW:Nasdaq).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they only do one function, their servers perform at a
higher level than a general purpose server that has a lot more
applications involved,'' said Paul Bard, an analyst at Renaissance
Capital. ``And since they're focused on one particular market,
generally the price point is lower.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the company is not currently profitable -- having
lost $5.8 million on $10.5 million of sales for the six months
ending in March -- it did post a profit back in 1996. In any case,
``it's in such a rapid growth segment that this is not something I
would worry about as an investor,'' Haque said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of competition, Bard said, ``the market's wide open and
really new.'' Network Engines has only two direct competitors,
Cobalt Networks (COBT:Nasdaq) and Network Appliances.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news, but on the flip side, Bard noted that the
major server manufacturers such as Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) and Compaq
Computer (CPQ:NYSE) recognize the demand for specialized servers
and are starting to develop their own products.
</P>
<P>
   George Nichols, an analyst at Morningstar.com, also worries
about the company's concentrated customer base. ``IBM (IBM:NYSE)
and Microsoft's (MSFT:Nasdaq) WebTV are great clients to have, but
if they generate 44 percent of sales, the company needs to find
more customers,'' he said.

A LITTLE `STARDUST' ON DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Video Column) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it plain-wrap Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, ``The Woody Allen Collection,'' eight of the
filmmaker's works, arrived in stores on DVD and video. Starting
with his 1971 film, ``Bananas,'' the collection covers Allen's '70s
period, ending with the 1980 film ``Stardust Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   And, except for ``Annie Hall,'' this is the first time the other
seven titles are on DVD. But don't expect a lot of extras on DVD _
unless you count the original trailers. When Allen was in Los
Angeles a few months ago to promote his latest film, ``Small Time
Crooks,'' he flatly stated he wasn't interested in going back and
examining his films _ no sense second- guessing himself. He wanted
them to stand on their own; there would be no director's commentary
or deleted scenes included on the video discs.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they stack up? As Allen noted, his early films were
basically a series of gags strung together. Three of the films in
the collection _ ``Bananas,'' ``Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask'' and ``Sleepers,'' to some
extent _ fall into that category. But the humor, for the most part,
is enough to sustain the films. True, some of the jokes are dated,
but having the late outspoken sportscaster Howard Cossell playing
himself in ``Bananas'' _ first doing play-by-play of a banana
republic revolution and then of the wedding of Fielding Mellish
(Allen), the film's nebbish hero _ is comic genius. Likewise, there
are scenes in ``Sex'' (remember Gene Wilder's infatuation with a
female sheep?) and ``Sleeper'' that are as funny today as they were
then.
</P>
<P>
   His 1975 film ``Love and Death,'' his parody of Russian
literature (think ``War and Peace''), was the first time that Allen
integrated his comedy brilliance into a more cohesive, cinematic
work. While there are references to everyone from Tolstoy to the
Marx Brothers to filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Ingmar Bergman,
this handsomely shot film illustrates Allen's growth as a
filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, blossomed in ``Annie Hall,'' the 1977 romantic
comedy that won four Oscars, including best picture, best actress
(Diane Keaton) and Allen as best director. In retrospect, the
romantic comedy is a bit overrated, in retrospect (the inclusion of
some slapstick scenes seems somewhat out of place _ almost as if
Allen needed to fall back on reliable shtick), but it's his first
truly mature work.
</P>
<P>
   Allen followed up the success of ``Annie'' with ``Interiors,'' a
drama. If Allen disappointed his fans by abandoning comedy for
Bergman-like angst, he nevertheless made one of the best films
about family in the last 25 years. And as in the case of most of
his films, Allen coaxed outstanding performances from his cast,
this time the magnificent Geraldine Page.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 ``Manhattan'' is perhaps Allen's best dramedy. The
gorgeously shot black-and-white film (with a George Gershwin score)
is a bittersweet ode to life. The theme of an older man with with a
teen-age girl, though, is bound to be disturbing in light of
Allen's own scandal involving his now wife, who was Mia Farrow's
adopted daughter. If you can divorce yourself from the ``reality,''
it's a fine film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stardust Memories,'' also shot in black-and-white, is a film
that has grown in stature over the years. Another mature work (this
one with a Fellini-esque quality), it points the way to much of
Allen's later films, like ``Bullets Over Broadway'' and ``Purple
Rose of Cairo,'' that examine life in terms of art.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Allen's right _ the films do stand on their
own. &QL; 
--- The ``Woody Allen Collection'' is priced at $99.98 for VHS and
$134.98 on DVD. Each title is available individually for $14.95 and
$19.98 on DVD. &QL;

&HT;     CLINTON'S OWN MARCH OF FOLLY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAGG HINES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Think Trojan horse, the sack of Rome, Maginot Line.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton ponders his next move on the proposed
national missile defense, he could profit from considering Barbara
Tuchman's ``The March of Folly'' more closely than the increasingly
dubious data, analyses and excuses from the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons having more to do with short-term political
expediency than long-term national security, Clinton still seems
likely to go forward with the latest demented progeny of Ronald
Reagan's Star Wars fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton should unexpectedly pull the plug, great; maybe he
will tell us what took him so long.
</P>
<P>
   The president has a list of high-minded criteria he says he'll
use in judging whether to go forward with the project. And when he
announces his formal decision later this year, he may claim it's
only to keep the program alive into the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Clinton acts before the presidential election, his
decision will in large part be intended to provide protection for
Al Gore from facing a ``missile gap'' attack from George W. Bush.
The presumptive Republican nominee, like many Republicans in
Congress, already supports a more expansive anti-missile system
than would be provided by the program currently in the works. Bush
also should add Tuchman to his limited reading list.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1984 ``Folly'' book, Tuchman looked back at a long string
of self-defeating (and self-deluding?) political decisions
stretching from Troy to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``A phenomenon noticeable throughout history regardless of place
or period is the pursuit by government of policies contrary to
their interests,'' Tuchman began. ``Why do holders of high office
so often act contrary to the way reason points and enlightened
self-interest suggests? Why does intelligent mental process seem so
often not to function?''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seems to be the case in Clinton's drive, to date,
to keep the missile defense program alive. It was thrust upon him
by the Republican-controlled Congress, but that does not mean he
has had to embrace it so warmly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use improved technology to produce a super-fast,
super-accurate weapon that can hurtle through space and knock out
incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles. These missiles could
be the mad work of, say, North Korea, Iran or Iraq - the once and
probably future ``rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. technology had better be significantly improved, because in
the roughly two decades that the Pentagon has salivated over
similar systems, more than two-thirds of the tests have failed. The
dud shot last weekend was only the latest misfire, and the most
recent problem wasn't something really high tech. The ``kill
vehicle,'' which we now know looks like a cross between a fire
hydrant and the corner mail box, didn't even separate from the
booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more pressing questions that the latest tests leave
unanswered is: How can the system distinguish between a real
missile and the dozens of decoys that probably would be launched at
the same time. Pentagon tests on the point appear to have been
dumbed down to meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a unilateral disarmer or a shill for
Russian President Vladimir Putin to think this program is cuckoo
and that the project should be renamed the Pentagon Job Protection
and Defense Contractors Bonanza Act. Fifty Nobel winners, almost
half of them physics laureates, have written to Clinton asking him
to reject the program, saying: ``The system would offer little
protection and would do grave harm to this nation's core security
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The program also throws a lot of money at a single threat -
missiles - without doing anything about an equally serious
terrorist proposition, say a thimbleful of a deadly bacterial agent
being driven across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile system is one of those government projects that
if you have to ask the price, you really can't afford it. Sixty
billion is a rough opening bid. Last weekend's failed test alone
cost $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   You could probably take the tens _ if not hundreds _ of billions
of dollars that would be spent before this thing became operational
and buy off every bureaucrat and secret agent in Pyongyang, Tehran
and Baghdad for the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then they could call the Pentagon collect far enough in advance
of a missile attack so we could get the Israeli air force to go
bomb the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   Farcical? No more so than the cockamamie national missile
defense system you may be about to pay for.

GE BEATS EXPECTATIONS BY A PENNY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BAYOT   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric (GE:NYSE) Thursday topped Wall Street estimates
by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfield, Conn.-based corporation posted earnings of $3.378
billion, up 20 percent from $2.820 billion in the second quarter
last year. Earnings per share for the second quarter increased 21
percent to 34 cents from last year's 28 cents. Wall Street
analysts' consensus forecast was 33 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $32.9 billion, 20 percent higher
than $27.4 billion in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, GE purchased $523 million of its stock to
reach $16.5 billion, or 934 million shares, toward the $22 billion
goal of its stock repurchase program, begun December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GE were lately trading down 1 3/8, or 2.56 percent, to
52 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   GE stocks rallied yesterday on news that both GE and Yasuda
Mutual Life,, New York brokerage firm PaineWebber's two largest
shareholders, had agreed to sell their combined 30 percent stake to
Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg in its bid to acquire
PaineWebber. GE expects a $2.3 billion windfall from the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   GE's variety of businesses, which range from GE Appliances and
its new electronic washers to NBC and the Tonight Show with Jay
Leno, helped it to report higher earnings, said J.J.B. Hilliard
W.L. Lyons analyst Steve O'Neil. O'Neil has a long-term buy rating
on GE, and his firm has done no underwriting for GE.
</P>
<P>
   At GE Power Systems, anticipated summertime swelter drove orders
for power generators up 80 percent, and shipments of heavy-duty gas
turbines more than doubled to 60. Demand for another type of gas
turbine tripled, and GE Power Systems completed more installations
and preventative maintenance orders during the quarter than it did
any prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Power Systems also secured long-term service agreements worth
$913 million, bringing the total value of multiyear contracts to
$11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GE Aircraft Engines sold the majority of airline jet engines
worldwide, and orders for a handful of GE Medical's products and
services grew by double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, variety spurred second-quarter earnings at GE Capital
Services, whose segments in specialized financing, consumer
services and midmarket financing each showed double-digit
increases.
</P>

   Revenue for GE's industrial businesses likewise grew by

&HT;     COLORADO'S GODLY IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just when you think public schools are going to
hell in a handbasket, along comes the Colorado State Board of
Education to show us the way to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a 5-1 vote, the board approved a resolution that
urges Colorado schools to display the official motto of the United
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   No, that is not ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``In God We Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   First engraved upon our money in 1864 _ as a nose-thumb to all
those European nations with portraits of kings and queens on their
currency _ ``In God We Trust'' became the national motto in 1956
under President Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   To some folks it might seem that the practical effects of Ike's
move have been minimal. How many times a day are YOU inspired to do
something (or not) because you remember ``In God We Trust''?
</P>
<P>
   Clair Orr is not some folks.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Colorado education board, Orr sponsored the
motto resolution. To him, ``In God We Trust'' is as powerful and
worthy of display as any document from the founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation has lost its way on the road to virtue and moral
character,'' Orr said of his resolution. ``We have a moral
obligation to educate our children in the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other board members (all Republicans like Orr) agreed. The
only dissenter: Gully Stanford, a Denver Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The way Stanford sees it, the number of ingredients in America's
melting pot continues to increase. Thus, it seems pushy,
narrow-minded and kind of asking for it to jam the Judeo-Christian
God down every American's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, a United Church of Christ minister and the executive
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
agrees with Stanford. He called the Colorado board's decision an
attempt to ``meddle in the religious lives of young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens Clair Orr and the majority of the board pay Lynn
no mind. They saw an urgent need among public school students and
they responded.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``In God We Trust'' is stamped on every piece of
paper currency in sight, right? Money is the most ubiquitous and
cross-cultural public forum we have.
</P>
<P>
   If kids are not connecting the acquisition of an Old Navy
T-shirt or boxed collector's set of Tupac CDs to our
Judeo-Christian God, then we must try harder to help them. As Orr
said, we've got a moral obligation.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's say we all take the Colorado board's resolution and
run with it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not just encourage public schools to display a banner or
sign, let's chisel ``In God We Trust'' above every entrance to
every grammar, middle and high school and every state-supported
university in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, we could completely wrap each school, from roof to
ground level, in ``In God We Trust,'' the way we now wrap public
buses in dot-com and Pepsi ads.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the kids themselves could become walking billboards that
point the way back to the Road to Virtue and Moral Character.
</P>
<P>
   They already perform a similar function for dozens of shoe and
clothing manufacturers. Why not employ one of the Republican
Party's most sacred rituals _ the public/private partnership _ and
get corporate sponsorship for all kinds of national-motto jackets,
shirts, vests, caps and sneakers?
</P>
<P>
   Can't you just see a hall full of 14-year-olds wearing
sweatshirts emblazoned with, ``In God (and Tommy Hilfiger) We
Trust''?
</P>
<P>
   To get kids really into our Judeo-Christian God, each school
district could hold national motto drives. Students, teachers and
parents could compete to see which school could slap ``In God We
Trust'' on the most surfaces. The winners would display a special
congressional banner that proclaims:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 1 in Trusting God!''
</P>
<P>
   As for kids and parents who don't subscribe to the
Judeo-Christian God _ the millions of Americans who are Muslims,
Buddhists, Hindus, nature worshippers, secular humanists and
atheists _ well, that's their tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   When you've gotten so lost on the Road to Virtue and Moral
Character that you believe the posting of a national motto can
actually bring you back, you can't afford such luxuries as freedom
of (or from) religion for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And that, according to the Colorado State Board of Education, is
``the truth'' we must teach our children.
</P>

WORKER CONTRACT EXPIRATION WORRIES UNITED AS IT TRIES TO WIN
MERGER  APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already in the midst of trying to negotiate a new contract with
pilots whose refusal to work overtime has been blamed for the
cancellation of thousands of its summer flights, United Airlines
now faces more potential labor problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the contract for United's 44,000 groundworkers ran
out, adding one more issue for the airline to resolve as it tries
to win approval to acquire US Airways (U:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the International Association of Machinists, or
IAM, the union representing the United workers, say they have not
ruled out the possibility of exercising their right to refuse
overtime work. However, no organized action has been approved.
Those covered by the contract include mechanics, ramp workers,
reservation and ticket agents and baggage personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of labor-related flight reductions has to be
weighing heavily on officials at the world's largest airline. The
last quarter was one of the worst ever for United in terms of
delays and cancellations - many of them due to weather and
air-traffic-control backups.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are suffering similar problems. But United's
situation has been exacerbated by the forced 4,800-flight reduction
in the summer schedule after United members of the Air Line Pilots
Association exercised their right to refuse to fly overtime when
their contract became amendable in April.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts represent almost 2 percent of the total flights
operated between May and September by United, which is owned by Elk
Grove Township, Ill.-based UAL (UAL:NYSE). The carrier operates
about 2,500 flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   The groundworkers' contract expired Wednesday after almost seven
months of negotiations between the union and United. Still, Frank
Larkin, a spokesman for the United union workers, said it is not
unusual to extend talks beyond the amendable date, and that
progress has been ``satisfactory'' in negotiations now underway in
San Francisco and Chicago. Issues over job security, pension and
retirement and wage increases remain to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said progress is being made in
the talks with the unions representing both the machinists and
pilots. ``We are very committed to the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the labor issues put more pressure on the airline as it
awaits approval from US Airways shareholders, the U.S. Justice
Department, and states' attorney generals for the $4.3 billion
proposed merger between United and US Airways. The two airlines
have said they hope to complete the deal by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That is unlikely to happen unless labor issues have been
resolved. In a letter to IAM members earlier this week,
international president R. Thomas Buffenbarger, bluntly stated:
``Either the United negotiations prove successful. Or the merger
dies. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   The United unit of the Air Line Pilots Associations has also
expressed ``strong concerns'' about the merger, but says it could
support the deal if issues surrounding pilot seniority and other
labor-related matters are resolved. The union represents about
10,000 United pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Midday Thursday, shares of UAL were up 1/8, about 0.2 percent,
at 59 1/4. Shares of US Airways were down 1/4, or 1 percent, at 41
15/16.

LACK OF RAW MATERIALS MAY HINDER CHIP PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Semicon West semiconductor industry conference this week,
one voice briefly spoke in somber tones: James Bagley, the chief
executive of Lam Research (LRCX:Nasdaq), a Fremont, Calif.-based
maker of semiconductor assembly systems, said shortages in raw
materials could slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   His caveats were shouted down as a chorus of analysts filed
reports from the convention, but a weightier voice soon joined
Bagley's. Robert Growney, the chief executive of Motorola
(MOT:NYSE), a semiconductor industry powerhouse, said his company
is ``not ready to talk about what the industry numbers are for next
year yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``we're starting to forecast a little bit less growth
than we've seen this year,'' he told analysts in a conference call
Thursday morning. ``We're in the stages right now of that
discussion. We're going to be talking about that in future
meetings, future calls.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the procrastination seems to suit Wall Street better
than the warnings. After a year and a half of torrid growth, the
notoriously cyclical industry must eventually enter a downturn. But
in this time of raving self-appraisal, analysts have been loath to
predict its start.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, a trade
association sponsoring the conference, which takes place in San
Francisco July 10-12 and in San Jose July 12-14, said the equipment
industry would grow as much as 37 percent this year, reaching $34.5
billion. The trade group polled 65 of its member companies.
</P>
<P>
   And hopes for the chips themselves are nearly as ebullient. The
Semiconductor Industry Association predicts that chip sales will
grow 31 percent to $195 billion this year and 25 percent to $244
billion in 2001. Dataquest, the semiconductor arm of the research
house Gartner Group, expects sales to reach $222 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The nicely dovetailed enthusiasm is unsurprising, if only
because the separate businesses of assembling computer chips and of
making equipment for that purpose are hopelessly interlocked.
``It's kind of a chicken and egg situation,'' said Joseph Byrnes,
senior analyst of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's reaction to Bagley's comments showed brokerage
house analysts are hesitant to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management of Lam Research expressed the view that component
shortages could limit the growth in wafer fab equipment sales to 55
percent in 2001 [compared to higher earlier estimates],'' wrote
Edward C. White, analyst for Lehman Brothers. ``Among the items the
company cited as being in short supply was aluminum.''
</P>
<P>
   But White added that equipment makers are prepared for supply
problems and will likely still expand their capital spending by 76
percent over the 1999 level. And other analysts, including Robert
Maire of Bear Stearns, reported from the conference that Bagley's
comments could be safely ignored. They were ``taken out of
context,'' he wrote, and ``blown way out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Yeung, analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, wrote that
investors' reaction -- Lam's shares fell 1 5/8 to close at 35 5/8
Tuesday after the analyst meeting -- showed that Bagley's comments
were ``clearly misinterpreted by the press.'' Lam finished
Wednesday regular trading up 3/8, or 1 percent, at 36 and was up 1,
or 3 percent, at 37 in midday trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The statements ``were simply meant to note that the demand for
equipment was pushing the limits of the equipment company's ability
to supply the market [usually a positive dilemma],'' Yeung wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts did not dispute his point, though many have long
maintained that supply has driven the 18-month surge in
semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained
602 percent from October 1998 to March 2000. The index was up 3
percent Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ironically, even a supply crunch on equipment makers
could bear a silver lining, offering chipmakers potential salvation
from one of few publicly forwarded negative predictions. Byrnes,
the Dataquest analyst, said he expected a ``supply side-driven
downturn after the companies over-invest.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, chipmakers are bound to feel the
swelling demand and spend too much on new factories, partly because
semiconductor manufacturing equipment is added in large increments.
Intel (INTC:Nasdaq) and Texas Instruments (TXN:NYSE) have already
announced plans for new factories.
</P>
<P>
   If a shortage of parts for assembly equipment develops, the
companies will likely base their decisions on demand. Seeking to
provide reassurance against a supply shortage, Maire, the Bear
Stearns analyst, offered a scenario that would seemingly amplify
Byrnes' over-investment thesis:
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies will go to extremes before they'll let the lack of a
25-cent part stop the shipment of a multimillion-dollar system,''
he wrote. ``If we have to pay a buck to get that 25-cent part
during a shortage, it's a small price to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   For the chipmakers, even Motorola's disappointing quarter -- the
company failed to meet many analysts' revenue expectations
Wednesday, reaching earnings estimates by slashing sales, general
and administrative expenses -- has failed to draw negative
predictions from analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In their conference call, Motorola officials predicted 30
percent growth for the remainder of the year, but lowered
predictions for next year to 25 percent from the previously stated
25 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to read too much into it because it's early,''
said Ariane Mahler, analyst for Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ``But
it's a bit of a slowdown.''

REALNETWORKS SOARS AFTER AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in RealNetworks (RNWK:Nasdaq) surged Thursday after the
company said that America Online (AOL:NYSE) will deploy its
Internet media software, RealSystem 8, throughout its network,
enabling AOL to provide users more interactive and broadband
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Under a pact between the companies, Dulles, Va.-based AOL will
also include a part of the software, which is used for broadcasting
rich audio and video over the Internet, in its AOL 6.0 service due
out later this year to deliver a multi-platform media player using
RealPlayer's streaming media technology.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the pact were not disclosed, though The Wall Street
Journal reported that it is worth between $20 million and $29
million to Seattle-based RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With AOL's more than 23 million members and outstanding
content base, working closely with AOL is a fantastic opportunity
for RealNetworks,'' said Rob Glaser, founder and CEO of
RealNetworks, in a statement. ``Through this agreement we have not
only enabled the largest single Internet population in the world to
experience the compelling audio and VHS video quality of RealSystem
8, but we have also made fundamental and substantial progress
toward realizing our vision of the Internet as the next mass
medium.''
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks shares jumped 5 11/16, or 12 percent, to 52 7/16 in
midday trading. AOL inched up as well, climbing 1 1/16, or 2
percent, to 58.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the RealPlayer will be distributed with
AOL's Netscape browser and through Netcenter. RealNetworks will
also distribute Spinner, the free Web radio player based on
RealPlayer technology, as well as bundling software with its
RealPlayer that lets users sign up for the AOL service.

<P>
   AGINCOURT REEF, Australia _ Cutting across the Coral Sea aboard
the sleek Quicksilver VIII catamaran, there is little hint of the
intrigue and grandeur hiding beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Then, soaring above the waves in a helicopter based at a pontoon
90 minutes out from Port Douglas, a first clue: more shades of blue
than you ever imagined existed.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the pontoon, plunge beneath the surface, snorkeling or
scuba diving or in a semisubmersible vessel with picture windows,
and enter an underwater world unlike any other: living coral in
brilliant orange and yellow and red and blue; jagged cliffs and
rocky boulders, one amazing formation after another; blue-spotted
trout and green-and-red parrotfish and their kinfolk swimming past
by the thousands, unperturbed by human intruders.
</P>
<P>
   This is the wonder of the Great Barrier Reef, Earth's largest
living organism and most diverse environment.
</P>
<P>
   Defining a lagoon 15-150 miles wide on Australia's eastern
coast, the Great Barrier Reef encompasses almost 3,000 reefs and
900 islands and stretches for 1,250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements were formed as long ago as 18 million years, but
most of what visitors see today has developed much more recently.
Indeed, the Reef is constantly changing and building, with coral
formed by billions of small, primitive marine animals (or polyps)
that die and let new polyps grow on their skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   While the coral lives only beneath the water's surface, debris
can form small sandbanks that tides sweep together. These provide
refuge for sea birds, which deposit plant seeds (attached to their
feathers or in droppings). This allows the development of
vegetation and, over time, the emergence of a coral island.
</P>
<P>
   This magnificent system is now home to an estimated 400 types of
hard and soft coral; 1,500 species of fish; 4,000 types of
mollusks, including colorful clams and snails; 350 types of sea
urchins, starfish, sea cucumbers and other echinoderms; and
thousands of species of crustaceans, worms and sponges.
</P>
<P>
   It also welcomes hundreds of thousands of humans each year,
requiring concentrated efforts to protect the reef and its
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Access is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Some continental (noncoral) islands now boast resorts; in the
Whitsundays well to the south, Hayman Island is regarded as one of
the world's most luxurious vacation retreats, combining reef
exploration with gourmet cuisine, fine wines, idyllic swimming
pools and other pampering.
</P>
<P>
   A few true coral cays welcome overnight guests, most notably
Green Island.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships ply reef waters on multiday excursions; Captain
Cook Cruises' 168-passenger Reef Endeavor operates leisurely
itineraries from Cairns that last as long as a week.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with limited time and money, day trips by boat
provide a good introduction and memories to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   A huge advantage, too, of lodging on the mainland, especially in
Tropical North Queensland, is that so many other natural wonders
merit exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Port Douglas and Cairns make ideal gateways because of the
reef's proximity to this part of the coast and because the
combination of warm water and sunlight allows maximum coral growth
just beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Quicksilver, the region's principal reef tour-boat operator, and
acclaimed for its high-quality product, offers daily excursions to
Low Isles, on the reef's inner fringe about eight miles offshore,
and to Agincourt Reef, 45 miles from Port Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   At Agincourt, the continental shelf rests at depths of only
60-90 feet, in water so clear that visibility averages 50 feet.
Nearby, the ocean floor drops to depths of almost 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Voyages to Agincourt Reef aboard the 440-seat Quicksilver VIII
(or a smaller companion catamaran) begin at 8 a.m. from Cairns or
10 a.m. from Port Douglas' Marina Mirage, within walking distance
of downtown. Bus transportation from area hotels is included in the
price, about $85.
</P>
<P>
   (All prices mentioned are in U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   During the 90-minute ride, marine biologists give background on
the reef, its environmental concerns and reef safety. (Don't stand
on or bump coral; don't harass animals.) Snorkeling lessons are
offered at the reef.
</P>
<P>
   The pontoon _ one of two used here by Quicksilver _ is
remarkable for its practicality. Swimmers and snorkelers depart
from a submerged platform; an underwater observatory allows viewing
of coral and fish; and semisubs depart every 15 minutes. All are
included in the tour price.
</P>
<P>
   A two-minute boat ride takes guests to a floating helicopter pad
from which air excursions depart every 15 minutes. The flights
provide perspective on how the brownish living coral and breaking
surf combine with other factors to create such marvelous blue-green
colors. (Cost is about $65; bookings must be made in
advance.)Organized diving tours (about $40) take place on the edge
of the continental shelf; operators choose from among 20 sites
depending on the day's weather and visibility. Equipment is
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who prefer not to get wet can enjoy the Reef
immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from the semisub, the underwater landscape is as
bewildering as it is beautiful, dotted with caves and tunnels,
cliffs and shelves, full of contrasts in color and substance. Coral
appears less like animals than like plants clinging to rocks, even
a floral garden. Fish dart in every direction. And don't take those
sluggish sea cucumbers for granted, Quicksilver biologists caution:
They are the ``vacuum cleaners'' of the Reef.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller fish are striking in shape, color and ability. Some
change color when threatened. If a male angelfish dies, biologists
say, its female partner can change sex. Parrotfish are said to
begin life as dark-colored females, complete at least one
reproduction season, then become brightly colored males.
</P>
<P>
   Red-and-blue damselfish, 2 inches in length, share the sea with
900-pound grouper, sharks, six species of marine turtles, dudongs
(also known as sea cows, with whalelike bodies as long as 9 feet)
and, in winter, humpback whales.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are cautioned against feeding fish, but organized
feedings are conducted twice during the 3 1/2-hour stay at the
pontoon, letting everyone see large schools up close.
</P>
<P>
   Human feeding is scheduled as well; a buffet lunch is included
in the tour price.
</P>
<P>
   Quicksilver's 10 marine biologists, employed in the company's
Reef biosearch division, monitor the area daily to ensure its
protection and preservation. Among recent projects, they have
studied the effects of mainland nutrient runoff on water quality,
the progress of corals around tourist platform sites, the effects
of sunscreen on corals, and the growth rate of 200 giant clams near
Agincourt Reef.
</P>
<P>
   The catamaran arrives back in Port Douglas at about 4:30 p.m.

   If, even then, the Reef remains a mystery of sorts, don't feel
alone.

&HT;     TIPS ON VACATIONING IN TROPICAL AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are tips for planning a vacation to Australia's Tropical
North Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Advance Planning: An important firststep in planning a visit to
Queensland - or any other Australian state _ is to request a
vacation planner kit from the Australian Tourist Commission. Call
800-369-6863.
</P>
<P>
   Or access www.australia.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other comprehensive online sites include
www.destinationqueensland.com (the official site of Tourism
Queensland), www.great-barrier-reef.com, www.cairns.aust.com and
www.portdouglas.com.
</P>
<P>
   Packages: A tour packager can help in two ways: (1) combining as
many or as few elements of a trip as the traveler desires; and (2)
supplying discounted air service and lodging. We used Austravel, an
experienced firm. Call 800-633-3404. Qantas Vacations also offers
packages to Queensland that include most of the attractions
mentioned in this section. Call 800-532-6717 or access
www.qantasvacations.com.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents work closely with these and other tour companies
and can provide brochures and other information.
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Queensland's climate is ideal year-round assuming
heat and humidity aren't a bother. Seasons are reversed in
Australia; our summer is their winter. Many travelers may want to
combine a trip with the 2000 Sydney Olympics scheduled Sept.
15-Oct. 1. For information about remaining Olympics tickets or
packages, call Cartan Tours, the designated U.S. distributor, at
800-841-1994. Or access www.cartan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation: A valid U.S. passport and an Australian visa are
required. A visa costs nothing and is produced electronically, so
you don't have to carry a document. A travel agent or tour packager
can handle details. The visa is valid for up to three months in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: The Australian dollar has been trading at about $1
Australian to $1.65 U.S. (making Australia a remarkable value for
Americans this year). All prices listed here are in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Car rental firms familiar to Americans have
offices in Cairns and Port Douglas. Prices are reasonable, and a
travel agent or tour packager can make reservations. One caution:
Driving is on the left side of the road. Most day-tour operators
offer hotel pickup service.
</P>
<P>
   Major attractions: The Rainforest Habitat Wildlife Sanctuary is
on Port Douglas Road about three miles south of town. Hours are 8
a.m.-5 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is about $9.75 (half-price for children). A daily
``breakfast with the birds'' includes entry costs, and staff
members introduce several of the most unusual birds. The cost is
$18.25 (half for children). Access
www.radisson-resorts.com.au/rhab1.html for more information.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Butterfly Sanctuary is at 8 Rob Veivers Drive in
Kuranda. Hours are 9:45 a.m.-3 p.m. daily. Admission is about $6.50
(half for children). Access www.australianbutter-flies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Skyrail operates from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. daily (except Christmas Day)
between Kuranda and Cairns. The one-way cost is about $16.50 (half
for children). Access www.skyrail.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairns-Kuranda Scenic Rail operates daily. One-way tickets
cost about $14. Travel agents or tour packagers can make
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park is on Kamerunga Road at
Carovonica Lakes, about a 15-minute drive from Cairns and adjacent
to the Skyrail terminal. It's open daily, with shows beginning at
9:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   and continuing until 4:40 p.m. Prices start at about $14.50
(half for children). Access www.tjapukai.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   One-hour walking tours conducted by KuKu-Yalanji guides in
Mossman Gorge National Park can be booked in advance. Tours are at
10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. Access
www.internetnorth.com.au/yalanji. E-mail
yalanji(at)internorth.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Tours: Quicksilver is the area's leading day-tour operator to
the Great Barrier Reef. Round-trip catamaran trips depart Cairns at
8 a.m. and Port Douglas at 10 a.m. Costs range from $82 to $90 and
include morning and afternoon tea, lunch, snorkeling equipment,
swimming at a pristine reef and semisubmersible coral viewing. Reef
tours by helicopter cost extra. Reservations are essential. Access
www.quicksilver-crui-ses.com.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail quicksilver(at)quicksilver-cruises.com. Call
011-61-7-4099-5455.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Cook Cruises offers three-, four- and seven-day
excursions aboard the 168-passenger Reef Endeavor from Cairns to
remote parts of the reef. A travel agent can provide details about
itineraries and costs. Access www.captcookcrus.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Downunder Tours, headquartered in Cairns, is recommended for day
tours to Kuranda and other attractions. A travel agent or tour
packager can make arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Coral Coaches offers day tours into the Daintree rain forest and
other packages that include area attractions and multiday
excursions. The company also offers scheduled point-to-point bus
service. A travel agent can provide information.
</P>
<P>
   Most Daintree River boat tours areheadquartered at makeshift
stands near the ferry terminal. Several advertise in local
publications. Bruce Belcher's one-hour tour costs about $9 (half
for children); his covered vessel seats up to 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   Additional resources: Lonely Planet, which publishes one of the
most in-depth series of guidebooks, is based in Australia, so it's
no surprise that Queensland (Lonely Planet, $24.95) is a
comprehensive account.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the same series and also recommended is the third
edition of Islands of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (Lonely
Planet, $14.95) by Hugh Finlay.
</P>
<P>
   The Maverick Guide to the Barrier Reef (Pelican, $14.95), by Len
Rutledge, offers historical, geological and practical insight.

 &HT;    Bits of cyber wisdom
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - My cousin, who does a good job of keeping my e-mail
in-basket stocked, sent me this list of interesting yet
questionable bits of cyber wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these have been floating around for years, but every
item in this particular compilation is a gem.
</P>
<P>
   See if you don't agree:
</P>
<P>
   _ Experience is something you don't get until just after you
need it.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal
your neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced, you can't be
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never test the depth of the water with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as
a warning to others.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a
couple of car payments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their
shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and
you have their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't squat with your spurs on.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good judgment comes from bad experience, and a lot of that
comes from bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome of a rain
dance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duct tape is like the Force; it has a light side and a dark
side, and it holds the universe together.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one
works.
</P>
<P>
   _ Experience is the sinking feeling you have made this mistake
before.
</P>
<P>
   And one I'm still trying to master:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never miss a good chance to shut up.

<P>
   DAINTREE RIVER, Australia _ Cap'n Bruce silences the motor and
maneuvers his small boat ever so slowly and ever so quietly toward
the Daintree River bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, over there. At the edge of the water. Know what that
is?''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, every eye is fixed on a mysterious object - long,
thin, brown, menacing.
</P>
<P>
   It's ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a log-odile,'' Cap'n Bruce says. ``They're all over this
part of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   A log-odile?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it, mate,'' Cap'n Bruce says, his voice booming
with laughter. ``Don't bother staring any longer, though. It won't
be moving anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, let's go meet Gummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gummy, holding court just around the bend, is not a log-odile.
``He's the largest and oldest croc we see around here,'' says Bruce
Belcher, aka Cap'n Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him Gummy because he's lost his teeth through all the
battles he's had with the other males,'' Belcher continues. ``Most
crocs aren't territorial. But Gummy protects his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, he gets his choice of all the girls in the river,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically, female crocodiles aren't attracted to an inferior
male.''
</P>
<P>
   Gummy lives within Daintree National Park along Australia's
upper northeast coast, an area known as Tropical North Queensland,
``where the rain forest meets the reef.''
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors include almost 300 bird species, including the
rare and threatened 6-foot flightless Southern cassowary, as well
as marvelous multicolored butterflies, exotic flying foxes that
hang from ceilings, tree-hugging kangaroos and enough snakes to
elicit shivers from even the most ardent outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got lizards that stand 6 feet tall,'' one Aussie boasts.
``But don't worry. If they're bothered, they usually head up a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look for the highest spot. Of course, if that's you ...''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, eager to explore the Great Barrier Reef just
offshore, bypass this remote region. Don't make that mistake. By
all means visit the Reef - it's one of the world's natural wonders
- but save time for Cap'n Bruce, Gummy and the Daintree rain
forest, too.
</P>
<P>
   And prepare to be mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   A brief orientation: Queensland, Australia's second-largest
state, stretches 1,250 miles along the continent's eastern
seaboard. The southern extreme, near Brisbane, is famed for its
Gold Coast, where glitzy hotels and condominiums overlook the
Pacific Ocean. But to the north, the topography and ambience are
studies in contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors to northern Queensland arrive in Cairns, a city of
100,000, an international airport and no riveting personality.
Thirty miles up the Captain Cook Highway hugging the Coral Sea,
Port Douglas is more compact, more fun-loving - care for a trim at
the Severed Ear barbershop? - and an ideal gateway for day trips to
the Reef or rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Rent a car in Port Douglas, then follow signs to Mossman and
Daintree Village, a drive that can take 45 minutes or all day,
depending on how well you resist temptations to pause en route.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing Daintree Village, a choice:
</P>
<P>
   If time permits _ and a deep spirit of adventure takes over _
ferry across the river into the heart of Daintree and Cape
Tribulation national parks, part of a nearly 500-square-mile Wet
Tropics World Heritage Area.
</P>
<P>
   A living museum for animals and plants, this vast rain forest
protects 25 rare or endangered vertebrate species, and its canopy
includes giant palms that have stood for 3,000 years. More than
3,000 plant species have been identified here, including the
highest concentration of primitive flowering plants in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tread carefully since not all roads are paved. Or consider a
tour, which can provide perspective and identify some of the
world's most colorful wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   On a tight schedule? Back near the ferry dock, a handful of
small-boat operators conduct wildlife tours several times daily.
Although they cover only a tiny portion of a river that meanders
for 85 miles from the Pacific, even a one-hour excursion can
provide rich insight.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher relishes pointing out native birds. ``Over there, that's
a great egret,'' he says. ``And in the distance, that's a
yellow-spotted honeyeater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming up on a black-necked stork; it's the only species
of stork in Australia.'' Belcher points to a striking iridescent
black-and-white bird also known as a jabiru.
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers are looking for crocodiles. ``This is one of
their favorite nesting grounds,'' Belcher says. ``We have about 70
adult crocs in this part of the river. And lots of baby crocs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gummy, perhaps 20 feet long, sunbathes half out of the water and
seems unbothered by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a marine park, we're not allowed to feed the crocodiles,''
Belcher says. ``And because we don't feed him, Gummy has had no
influence from humans. But we give him about 10 meters distance -
not for our safety but for his peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Caution is essential, though. ``During winters, a croc is like
licorice in a refrigerator; he can't move,'' Belcher says. ``But
summertime increases the appetite. He's hungrier and more active.
The accidents involving people happen in summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gummy is left in peace, at least until another tour boat
arrives. The next stop is Daintree Village, identified by signs as
``the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the Daintree Village Restaurant and Coffee Shop
_ ``famous for its pan-fried barramundi and homemade scones since
1986,'' a sign proclaims _ is temporarily blocked by dozens of
peacocks flaunting their brightly colored feathers as they parade
in the town's only street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peacocks live all around here,'' says restaurant owner
Bill Kromhout, who moved to Daintree Village from the Netherlands
and owns the eatery. ``They just take over the town whenever they
please. We've got about 100 people here, too, when we can find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Visions of Gummy preclude ordering a Croc Burger, one of the
house specialties. And a combo of pancakes and prawns _ well,
enough said. But the pan-fried barramundi (a locally caught fish),
chips, salad and Aussie beer represent a feast for $8. The peacock
show is free.
</P>
<P>
   On your way back to Port Douglas, a recommended midpoint stop is
Mossman Gorge National Park, home to the KuKu Yalanji, indigenous
inhabitants known here as the rain forest people and custodians of
the forest.
</P>
<P>
   This is a perfect afternoon escape, a place to swim and picnic
or to enjoy walks in the bush, rendered more accessible by tracks
and a suspension bridge. The KuKu Yalanji lead tours, too, telling
about native plants and their practical uses, identifying birds and
other wildlife, and adding perspective to a captivating day.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only place in Australia where the rain forest grows
all the way to the coast. The canopy is so thick that when rain is
pouring above, only a mist penetrates the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Rest for a spell. Keep your eyes peeled for a tree kangaroo. But
don't worry: There isn't a log-odile in sight.

&HT;     LUXURY LODGING IN A TREEHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK

<P>
   PORT DOUGLAS, Australia _ In a land where nature reigns supreme,
what better way to spend the night than in a treehouse? Especially
when the treehouse and its surroundings are the height of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Kewarra Beach Resort and Thala Beach Lodge, sister properties
just off scenic Captain Cook Highway between Cairns and Port
Douglas, provide idyllic retreats after a day of active
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   With his eco-resorts, Queenslander Robert Prettejohn meshes
local character and style with modern creature comforts in settings
so lush that guests may be tempted not to venture beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   Thala, a 15-minute drive south of Port Douglas, spreads over 145
acres of bush rising sharply from the Coral Sea. Its main lodge is
built on poles reaching into the forest canopy, with views
extending over the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Bungalows with private balconies are placed high in the canopy,
at various levels of the steep hill (shuttle service is available).
Designs incorporate natural materials and finishes to harmonize
with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The rustic exterior gives little inkling that within the
bungalows are spacious bedrooms with air conditioning, ceiling
fans, color televisions and minibars and a bathroom with separate
tubs and showers.
</P>
<P>
   Kewarra, 20 minutes north of Cairns, occupies flatter land and
hugs the beach on the site of a former sugar-cane field; it is
better suited for travelers with limited mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty acres of gardens are beautifully landscaped, and the
resort provides listings of the 180 species of birds and the many
butterflies and plants on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping accommodations are known as mouds, Western Torres
Straight Islanders' dialect for house. Many of these bungalows are
built on poles; all are well-furnished.
</P>
<P>
   Lobby and dining areas at both resorts have ceilings but leave
sides open to the breeze and ocean air.
</P>
<P>
   Cuisine is hardly routine treehouse fare.
</P>
<P>
   At Thala, breakfast options during a visit included a starter of
half a dozen oysters accompanied by a glass of champagne, followed
by smoked salmon eggs Benedict and topped off by a bowl of
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner entrees at the lodge's Osprey's Restaurant, which exudes
romance, included Tasmanian salmon pan-seared in sesame sauce. It
was rivaled only by Kewarra Beach'sSpanish mackerel on zucchini
noodles with a minted lemon marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   Only Kewarra touted Mississippi Mud Cake, topped with a Mandarin
syrup and hazelnut praline.
</P>
<P>
   Both resorts are members of the exclusive Small Luxury Hotels of
the World chain.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for a bungalow at Kewarra Beach start at about $60 per
person, based on double occupancy, and include airport transfers;
costs increase to about $131 per person for a two-room suite.
Double-occupancy rates at Thala Beach Lodge start at about $80 per
person. All rates vary by season and type of accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can make reservations. For more information,
access www.thalabeach.com.au, www.kewarrabeach.com.au or
www.slh.comon the Internet. Call Thala Beach Lodge at
011-61-7-4098-5700. Call Kewarra Beach Resort at
011-61-7-4057-6666. Write to either resort at P.O. Box 199,
Smithfield, Queensland, Australia 4878.
</P>
<P>
   Other highly regarded eco-resorts in the area clude Silly Oaks
(north of Port Douglas), Daintree Eco Lodge (near the river
and(known for its program of physical and mental therapies) and
Coconut Beach Rain Forest Resort and Ferntree Rain Forest Resort
(both on Cape Tribulation).
</P>
<P>
   Northern Queensland also offers standard hotels and motels,
including many chains familiar to Americans. A travel agent or tour
packager can provide details.

&HT;     EXOTIC BIRDS ABOUND IN HABITAT PARK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORT DOUGLAS, Australia _ The shop owner can't hide her
amusement when an American visitor points to a photograph in a
nature book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I go to see this beautiful rainbow lorikeet?'' the
stranger asks. ``Are they only found deep in the rain forest?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where've you been, mate?'' the merchant guffaws. ``Just look
around. Those rainbow lorikeets are more common than dishwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a convoy of lorikeets _ brilliant orange, yellow,
blue, green, red _ alights in a nearby tree. Maybe 100 lorikeets.
No, maybe 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pause almost anywhere in northern Queensland and, if you are
patient, richly decorated native birds will come your way. Near
dusk, the appropriately named rainbow lorikeet flaunts its colors
even in downtown Port Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   But by some estimates, only about one-third of Australia's
estimated 800 bird species are commonly sighted on organized
bird-watching tours. Most are found only in specific habitats; many
are rare or endangered.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason even dedicated bird-watchers relish a visit to
the Rainforest Habitat Wildlife Sanctuary just outside Port
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 species live and fly freely within a canopied
rain-forest aviary designed to mirror a natural environment. Maps
and illustrated spotters' guides help with identification.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most captivating residents is a bird that doesn't fly
at all: the endangered Southern cassowary, which can reach a height
of 6 feet and is among the world's largest birds.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdily built but with tiny wings, the Southern cassowary is
notable for the red-and-blue color patterns on its head and neck
and also on wattles that hang from its neck, and for a hornlike
casque on its head that is used for protection.
</P>
<P>
   The cassowary, found only in far North Queensland and in New
Guinea rain forests, is related to the emu but is shorter, stockier
and heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Both are members of a flightless group known as ratites, which
includes New Zealand kiwis, South American rheas and ostriches.
Flightless birds are believed to have lived in Australia for 35
million years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rainforest Habitat's cassowaries merely move about in
water or on land, other birds provide a spectacular show of sights
and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Australian king parrots, eclectus parrots, Eastern and crimson
rosellas, sacred kingfishers, fruit doves, galahs and yellow
orioles _ all colorful and dazzling _ maneuver almost to within the
grasp of wide-eyed visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Employees and seasoned bird-watchers eagerly provide lessons,
too _ about the eclectus parrot, for instance: The male glitters in
green, while the female's head is a bright red that yields to blue
and brown on the body.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Australia's parrot group (including cockatoos) totals 52
species, 43 of which are found nowhere else. Many are represented
here.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular is the fabled laughing kookaburra, a member of the
kingfisher family.
</P>
<P>
   Birds aren't the only attraction. Other residents include gray
and red kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, bandicoots, fresh- and
saltwater crocodiles and spectacled flying foxes _ dubbed masked
rain-forest raiders as they hang from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow lorikeets? Yes, they're here, too. But then they're as
common as dishwater.

   CLINTON-NAACP _ BALTIMORE _ President Clinton launched a
broadside attack against the Republican Party on Thursday, saying
the record of Senate opposition to his judicial appointments _ and
the ``stone cold silence'' on the matter by Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas _ reflects a bias against African Americans and other racial
minorities. ``They don't want them on the court, but they don't
want you to know they don't want them on the court,'' Clinton said
in remarks before the NAACP's national convention. Clinton singled
out Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., by name as a long-term opponent of
African Americans on the Supreme Court. And, while he didn't name
them, Clinton assailed both Texas senators for their role in
thwarting his nomination of Enrique Moreno to the 5th Circuit
Federal Court of Appeals. (Deans, Cox News Service)

the Bourque brothers, Coby and Cody, are really my cousins, though

   IMPROVING A BAD CREDIT HISTORY, by Dagen McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   If you have done serious damage to your credit history, you can
take your time shopping for a house. Most negative information will
stay in your credit record for seven years. Bankruptcies can hang
around for 10. To start rebuilding your record, you'll first need
to clear any bad debts and outstanding balances and start making
regular payments to your creditors. Then you'll have to wait and
wait and wait.

<P>
   UNDERSTANDING YOUR CREDIT SCORE
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've spent hours scrutinizing every item on your
credit report, you still may not know if you've got a good credit
record or a bad one. For that you need to have an idea of your
credit score. This score may be unfamiliar to everyday people, but
it looms large for the lenders that are deciding whether to let you
buy that house or other item.
</P>
<P>
   Your credit score is a triple-digit number that tells a lender
how likely you are to pay back a loan. Essentially, it compresses
your entire credit report into a single number, ranging from 300 to
900. Generally, you need a 620 or better to get a loan or a
mortgage from an established lender.
</P>
<P>
   You may be wondering how you can get your hands on your score.
It's not so easy, but, thankfully, that may be changing.

   WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION?
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't want a stream of strangers digging through your
file cabinet at home. Unfortunately, due to advances in technology
and stepped-up merger activity across the financial-services
industry, strangers may have free rein to comb through your
personal financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy in the digital age has become an incendiary issue that
would have made George Orwell smile. More and more, consumers want
to know: Who has access to my personal information? Who is selling
it to other business to make a buck? What rights do I have to
prevent the spread of my personal data?

hunting lizards and diving in caves. Others boasted of being
natural leaders, black belts and mediators. Someone ate a live
goldfish.
</P>

featured contestants on two competing teams eating bugs and rats.
At the end of each episode, members vote off one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the hopefuls strode up like confident warriors trying
to get a spot in the ultimate showcase for their skills. There were
a few freaks _ one group arrived in leather masks and whips _ but
most of the aspirants spared the theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was Devin Kochis, a 32-year-old UC-Berkeley police
officer who passed up a sergeants exam to try out Wednesday. Armed
with a tiki torch, Kochis tore off his shirt and revealed the word
``survivor'' written across his chest and stomach. ``Why would I
make the best survivor?'' asked Kochis, with a deadly serious
stare. ``Because I've got survivor written all over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as he stood in front of a camera recording his
audition tape, Kochis backed up his bravado by swallowing a gold
fish. ``It didn't taste like anything, but it was a big fish,'' he
said later.
</P>
<P>
   As the contestants stared into the cameras recording their
auditions, they all insisted they were the epitome of survivors.
Whatever life has thrown at them, they had all managed to come out
on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my ability to survive; I'm in great shape for my
age,'' said 67-year-old Pat McAlonan, a recreational cave diver
from San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   As if addressing such a topic would force them to break from the
rugged adventurist persona each came with, hardly anyone
acknowledged the monetary payoff. Even fewer talked of the fame
that would accompany an appearance on the popular show.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them insisted they were in it for the experience and
challenge of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in it for the adventure,'' said Jennifer Downey, a
26-year-old environmental scientist from Noe Valley, Calif. ``It
sounds so exciting; it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And to that end, the candidates said they were prepared to do
just about anything to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything, get naked, whatever,'' said Damien Schot, 24
of San Bruno, Calif. ``If I have to dance around like a chicken,
I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schot said he was not afraid of eating rats, either. He's
already dined on crickets, snails and meal worms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even eaten a moth on a dare,'' he said proudly, as only
someone who's eaten bugs can.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits, of course, to what people will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to roll around naked with an ugly, fat man, I don't
think I could do that,'' said Jonathan Critcher, a 28-year-old
member of the Coast Guard from Richmond, Calif. ``Other than that,
there's nothing I couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as the physical stamina and ruggedness
involved in ``Survivor,'' the show requires a balance of
Machiavellian scheming and selfless benevolence. Go too far one
way, and you get booted off the show.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tender balance that all Wednesday's contestants believed
they had down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the mediator,'' said Downey. ``I'm usually in the
middle, the team player.''
</P>
<P>
   But Downey was not sure that would fly on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of enemies,'' she said thoughtfully.
``Maybe that's too boring, and people will kick me off.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The largest concern for some of the people was not how far they
would advance; everyone seemed to think they were winning material.
But the chance of being selected made some contemplate what they'd
have to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband and her pets, Downey was concerned about
getting her daily fix of Starbuck's coffee. Schot said he was
worried about something a little stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a party guy,'' said Schot. ``If I get on the show, you'll
see me microbrewing, trying to make moonshine.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditions plodded on with many of the contestants struggling
to fill their three minutes of camera time. Afterward, they got
back into their cars and returned to their lives, quietly
contemplating a momentary escape from the routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a neat concept,'' said Critcher, the Coast Guard
member. ``Maybe it's a step toward fame for other people, but I
just want to see if I can do it.''

&HT;     DEMOCRATS UNLEASH NEW AD ATTACKING LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Democrats have rolled out their third
soft-money ad of the U.S. Senate campaign as a new poll showed
Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican
challenger Rick Lazio running neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Lazio, the four-term representative from Long
Island, predicted the ad war against him would ``backfire'' by
failing to persuade voters to support the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Quinnipiac University showed Clinton and Lazio tied at
45 percent in a survey of 1,086 registered state voters taken July
5-10. The poll, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
found that upstate New York remains the race's battleground, with
Lazio leading in the traditionally conservative region by 47-41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate is also where the Democratic Party's new ad will run
through next week. It hammers Lazio for voting against a bill
guaranteeing prescription drug coverage under Medicare. The
30-second ad features Frank and Ann Mormile, an Albany couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between her and I we take a total of about 34 pills a day,''
Frank Mormile says in the ad. ``At the age of 72, I went back to
work to help pay for the medication that I need. Where I should be
enjoying my life, which they call our golden years, forget those
words _ it's not our golden years any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   An announcer says: ``Rick Lazio voted against guaranteed
prescription coverage under Medicare. Bowing to the drug companies,
Lazio backed a plan that would leave millions without affordable
coverage. Tell Lazio: Next time, vote for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad brings the state Democratic Party's spending to nearly $1
million in ``issue'' or so-called ``soft-money'' ads that are legal
but largely unregulated. While they don't specifically endorse
Clinton, the subtle message behind the advertising is that voters
should support the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign did not deny his voting record but responded
that Clinton and the Democratic Party had only ``succeeded in
increasing Mrs. Clinton's negative ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Quinnipiac poll, 40 percent of voters surveyed had an
``unfavorable'' impression of Clinton, compared to 13 percent for
Lazio. Thirty-four percent of those surveyed gave Clinton a
``favorable'' rating to 31 percent for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's campaign of search, distort and destroy has
backfired as New York voters prove they're smart enough to see past
her deceptions,'' said Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col. The
poll, he said, ``suggests that New Yorkers have come to realize
that they cannot trust Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is overwhelmingly favored in New York City, 61-30
percent; Lazio holds a healthy edge in the New York City suburbs,
59-33 percent, and a small lead of 47-41 percent among white women,
a voting bloc that nearly always backs statewide winners. Clinton,
however, remains strong among Jewish voters, 54-34 percent.

U.S. AND CHINA VOW FRIENDSHIP DESPITE CONTINUED RIFTS ON MILITARY
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The U.S. defense secretary and Chinese leaders made
hopeful pledges of cooperation and friendship Thursday, despite
evidence of deep rifts over key military policies and dark Chinese
suspicions about U.S. intentions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of high-level meetings began and ended with smiles and
handshakes, a sign of how strongly both sides want to avoid open,
dangerous antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   But officials were also struggling with potentially explosive
disputes including U.S. plans for missile defenses and continued
arms sales to Taiwan, and U.S. charges that China recently helped
Pakistan develop ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials endured a new humiliation after Israel said
Wednesday that it was reneging on a $250 million deal, five years
in the making, to sell Beijing an advanced airborne radar system.
Israel canceled the sale under heavy pressure from the United
States, which fears the system could be used to track fighter
planes in a battle over the Taiwan strait _ the most likely scene
of direct Chinese-American conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute meeting Thursday afternoon, President Jiang Zemin
brought up the canceled sale, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said. ``It was certainly of concern to China,'' Cohen told
reporters, but he said the tone of the meetings was generally
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen met nearly every top political and military leader and
spoke to military officers at the National Defense University. As
he greeted Cohen Thursday, China's top soldier, Zhang Wannian, vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed ``how
important it is for China and the United States to have a healthy
and stable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides said they were pleased that military
visits and talks, suspended after the United States bombed the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year, had been largely restored.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen could offer the Chinese no convincing answers to
concerns about proposed missile defenses and arms sales to Taiwan.
And it was also clear that China had not effectively countered U.S.
charges that it has aided the development of ballistic missiles in
Pakistan and Iran, possibly violating pledges.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate news conference Thursday, China's chief arms
control official, Sha Zukang, said that his country had on three
occasions, most recently in a joint statement by Jiang and Clinton
in 1998, pledged not to help either India or Pakistan develop
missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He scoffed at
reported U.S. intelligence agency findings that China has provided
just such technical aid to Pakistan, its strategic ally, within the
last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen on Thursday afternoon would only say of the missile
charges that ``these issues are still under discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sha repeated China's vehement warnings that it sees the proposed
U.S. missile defense as negating China's small nuclear forces.
China also opposes the U.S.-Japanese program to develop regional
missile defenses, which could be used to shield Taiwan. China
considers Taiwan a part of the nation that must eventually return
to it, if not by peaceful means then by war.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to military officers Thursday morning at the
National Defense University north of Beijing, Cohen described the
U.S. military presence in Asia as a benign, stabilizing factor
rather than, as many Chinese believe, one intended to hem in an
increasingly confident and powerful China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Noting the U.S. military's strong presence in South Korea and
Japan, its close ties with Australia, Thailand and increasingly the
Philippines, and its pledge to help Taiwan defend itself, Cohen
said: ``The truth is that this region is safer, more secure and
more stable because of the United States. And that peace and
stability has benefited every nation, including China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are calls in China for the United States to
vacate Asia,'' Cohen added, departing from his prepared text. ``But
I ask you, who will fill the vacuum?''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen complained that the Chinese press often unfairly
characterizes the United States as out to dominate the world, and
working against China.
</P>
<P>
   His military audience listened intently and applauded. During a
brief, relaxed question period, in an apparently unscripted
outburst, the wife of a Chinese officer won loud applause when she
said the U.S. press maligns China on human rights and that the
United States could promote peace by halting arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But the generally polite reception belied a growing suspicion
here about U.S. intentions. The military journals and newspapers
that are studied by these officers, the cream of the People's
Liberation Army, describe U.S. policy in ever-more sinister terms.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the Liberation Army Daily, on the proposed
national missile defense, was headlined ``Sixty Billion Dollars to
Crush China.'' The U.S. military is routinely described as
encircling China and arming Taiwan to diminish China's power.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Americans saw an editorial in Thursday morning's
China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, titled ``U.S.
a Threat to World Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial, translated from the overseas edition of the
People's Daily, said the United States is causing a global arms
race by seeking military supremacy, and that the U.S. alliance with
Japan _ the core of the United State's Asia policy _ ``constitutes
a threat to regional stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial charged that U.S. military spending last year _
$276 billion _ was 2.5 times the total spending of Russia, Britain,
France, Germany, Japan and China combined and that the United
States is now seeking military control of outer space.
</P>
<P>
   And it said the United States is most responsible for the global
spread of missile technologies because by working with Japan to
develop missile defenses it had provoked other countries to seek
better missiles of their own.
</P>
<P>
   China does not like to admit its dependence on foreign purchases
for advanced weapons, and Thursday, despite anger and dismay over
the canceled Israeli sale, the public response was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   At a regular foreign ministry news conference, spokesman Zhu
Bangzao obliquely criticized the United States for its role, saying
that ``no country has the right to interfere with the bilateral
cooperation between China and other countries.'' He also implicitly
criticized Israel, saying that ``agreements and understandings
reached between states should be observed.''

REVISITING THE REAL `TRIAL OF THE CENTURY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
As ``Nuremberg,'' TNT's laudably ambitious mini-series, takes pains
to demonstrate, the Nuremberg Trials were a pivotal event in global
history. Robert Jackson (Alec Baldwin), the man who led the
prosecution, is told early on that his works ``could establish a
basis for conduct among nations that could alter history for
generations to come.'' Jackson himself later describes the work
before him as ``the secular equivalent of drafting the Ten
Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those platitudes, which really aren't that far off the
mark, the job this film sets both for itself and its protagonists
is given true dramatic heft, both emotionally and intellectually,
and for the most part, ``Nuremberg'' lives up to its billing. Yes,
it has its requisite TV-movie touches _ mercifully, the furtive
romance between Jackson and his assistant (Jill Hennessy) is dealt
with at the fringes of the drama _ and yes, at times, there's a
certain antiseptic sheen over the proceedings, a tacit
acknowledgment that this is TV dealing with Big Ideas and therefore
is best handled with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, this is important history _ and
therefore, by definition, high drama _ executed sanely and smartly
and, frequently, rivetingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Following World War II, the Nuremberg trials
posited the idea of war crimes, that behavior in brutally blind
obeisance to one's fatherland could in fact be immoral if a
country's leaders acted as atrociously as occurred in Germany.
While Hermann Goering poo-poo'd the proceedings as simply a case of
the winners ruthlessly lording it over the losers, the fact that
some German leaders were found ``not guilty'' suggested that this
was no kangaroo court: It was the world, as one, announcing that
some acts simply were not tolerable, even under the extreme
circumstances of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jackson led the legal charge, and though today the trial
would seem a slam-dunk, he experienced both soaring victories and
embarrassing miscues during the trial. ``Nuremberg'' is a courtroom
thriller writ large, larger than any other, and compels in its deft
combination of history and drama.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, performances skirt the stuff of
``Importance'' with a capital I. Baldwin is wonderfully understated
in a role that'd have most actors salivating for their big moments;
he makes a larger-than-life hero smaller somehow, merely human, and
therefore empathetic and winning. Matt Craven, a character actor
whose brilliance can be measured in how underappreciated his career
has been, similarly underplays his role to good effect as a Jewish
psychologist interacting with the German prisoners. Christopher
Plummer, playing a British prosecutor, does little more than wryly
beam how pleased he is to be on hand, but he does it with such dash
and elan that you're glad he's there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Brian Cox's charismatic turn as the amoral Hermann
Goering _ who disquietingly befriends an American G.I. during the
trial _ attempts to underscore how everyday Germans were seduced by
Nazism's lies. Len Cariou, as Francis Biddle, the American judge
assigned to the proceedings, humanizes his monumental pettiness.
Even Hennessy, aping fast-talking '40s movie heroines as Jackson's
inhumanly efficient assistant, manages to scratch beneath the
surface of her veneer-thin character.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter David W. Rintels has keenly telescoped a massive
story into telling segments; director Yves Simoneau has created a
rich visual tapestry against which the story is told. Note: The
last quarter of the second hour includes brutal documentary footage
of Nazi atrocities that to this day remain excruciating to watch.
But, much like Abby Mann and Stanley Kramer's 1961 Oscar winner
``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' the talents assembled have created a
compelling drama for a younger generation who can never be reminded
too much how darkly man's heart can ossify. &QL;

 &HT;    FREE MEALS STOP IN SUMMER FOR MOST POOR CHILDREN
 &HT;    With KIDS-FOOD-DATA.
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts for Cox states are at end of story.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly four-fifths of the poor children who receive
federally subsidized meals during the school year don't get them
during their summer vacation, the Food Research and Action Center
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, only 3.2 million of the 14.9 million low-income
children who received free or reduced-price breakfasts or lunches
during the school year were served by the summer nutrition
programs,'' said Lynn Parker, director of FRAC.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan Washington-based center is known for its
meticulous research. It is funded by foundations and by unions and
companies in the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, states and communities are falling far short of
taking full advantage of available resources, and many needy
children are missing the meals and vital nutrients they need during
the summer just as much as they do the rest of the year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called ``Hunger Doesn't Take a Vacation,'' is based
on state reports on participation in two federally subsidized
programs the summer portion of the national school lunch program
and the summer food service program, which is used at youth
programs sponsored by local governments or nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Participation rates vary enormously by state, the researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, the number of children reported as served in the
summer dropped to only 68 percent of school-year levels in the
District of Columbia, 44 percent in Nevada, 43 percent in
California, 35 percent in New Mexico and 34 percent in Delaware.
Federal auditors are rechecking the figures in the district, but no
serious questions have been raised about the validity of the
numbers from the top states.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom, the number fell in the summer to 3 percent of
school-year levels in Alaska, 5 percent in Wyoming, 7 percent in
Oklahoma and Iowa, and 8 percent in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   At Mathematica(cq) Policy Research, Inc., an employee-owned
research firm in Princeton, N.J., senior economist Anne Gordon
said, ``Given welfare reform and the fact that the food-stamp rolls
are dropping, there is a concern about whether kids are getting the
nutrition they need in the summer, but we really don't understand
what leads to this low participation.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the firm, which recently received a contract from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to find out the reasons, expects to
report on its results by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't even know if they're getting less food
in the summer time, or if families somehow pick up the slack,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The FRAC report did not give reasons for the low participation
rates. In interviews, staff members said that their personal
experience indicates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some sponsors of summer programs for children don't realize
how much they could save by using federal money for meals.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can cost a lot to transport meals from central kitchens in
schools to scattered educational or recreational sites, especially
in rural areas. It can also cost extra to transport children from
scattered sites to a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that serve meals to summer-school students receive the
same federal reimbursements as during the regular school year.
Other nonprofit sponsors of summer nutrition programs receive $2.18
per lunch, $1.25 per breakfast and 50 cents per snack, as well as
administrative fees of up to 22.75 cents per lunch, 12.5 cents per
breakfast and 6.25 cents per snack.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, participation doubled after the state hired
Project Bread, an anti-hunger group, to send people across the
state to encourage school systems and community groups to start
serving summer meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because times are good, we got some extra money from the state
legislature for outreach,'' said dietitian Barbara Ruhs(cq), who
works on child nutrition programs in the Massachusetts Department
of Eduction.

WIRELESS WEB STEPS BACK TO GO FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Remember how crude the World Wide Web used to be? Or maybe
you're one of the millions who never logged on until companies like
Yahoo and America Online had begun to civilize the Internet. Maybe
you missed out on the primitive delights of the Web's Heroic Age.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky you; here comes another chance. The clumsy, klutzy
amateur-hour experience of the early Internet lives on in today's
wireless Web. I've spent a month now using the Web browser on a
Sprint PCS phone. For a relative old-timer like me, it's a chance
to relive the frustrations of a simpler, more innocent time. For
the newbies,.ir's an opportunity to retrace the wagon-ruts of the
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the wireless Web experience can never match the
backwardness of the old days. In 1994, there was scarcely anything
online escept for dry academic papers, crude pornography, and the
occasional set of baby pictures. Today, at least, there's stuff
worth looking at _ news headlines, weather reports, movie listings,
e-mail, all available through a pocket-size cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the early '90s, one did one's Web surfing on a
reasonably fast desktop computer, with a nice color monitor and a
full-size keyboard. Wireless Web devices boast slow processors,
tiny monochrome screens, and a keyboard that looks like the
touchpad of a phone, because that's what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the early days of the Web, a host of corporate touts
insist that life without wireless Web access will scarcely be worth
living. The world's leading computer and telecommunications
companies are designing phones and palmtop computers to deliver the
Web to your pocket, and major online companies are converting their
bloated, colorful sites into leaner wireless formats.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, history seems to be repeating itself. It took years
for the Internet to become a mass medium. For all the hoopla,
consumers are so far giving wireless Internet service ``a good
leaving-alone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from Europe. Portable phones are far more
popular there than in the United States, and so wireless Web
companies have concentrated their efforts on this market. To little
avail, according to a study released last month by Deutsche
Telecom, which found that the average European with a wireless Web
phone used it to go online just once a week. And among Deutsche
Telecom's own cellular customers, just 1 percent used their phones
for surfing.
</P>
<P>
   It must be a European thing. Wireless Web phones are huge in
Japan; the government there says 10 million people are using them.
As for me, I've developed quite a liking for my borrowed Sprint
wireless Web phone. It's plainly awful for casual Web surfing;
indeed, most ordinary Web sites won't even display on the phone.
Sites must first be converted into a suitable format; the most
popular of these is called the Wireless Access Protocol, or WAP.
</P>
<P>
   WAP-ready sites have stripped out the pretty colors and other
useless fripperies, leaving you with the site's useful information
in plain monochrome text. In some ways, this makes a WAP site
simpler to understand than an ordinary Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not easy typing in commands by using a
telephone keypad. I found myself using the phone for only the
simplest online tasks, like visiting America Online and skimming
the news headlines, or checking my e-mail at Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   I never got around to buying anything with my phone, but I could
have. Amazon.com, for example, has a WAP-enabled site where you can
log in and buy that Harry Potter book.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody'll ever use one of these things for casual surfing.
Instead, says Ben Linder, vice president of Phone.com Inc., maker
of WAP browsing software, wireless Web phones are designed for the
``surgical extraction of information'' _ quick snippets of
know-how, delivered on demand wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the money in it? Barry Parr, director of consumer
e-commerce research at International Data Corp., says the wireless
Web is a technology in search of a business model. ``I don't think
people are going to be buying a lot of stuff with these gadgets,''
he says. Besides, the device screens are too small for ads that
might make a WAP site profitable. And Parr notes that companies
like Sprint charge cell-phone prices for wireless Web access,
instead of a flat-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly good arguments, every one of them. And the naysayers
who scoffed at the founders of Yahoo and America Online had
arguments every bit as good. You know the saying _ history repeats
itself, the first time in color, the second time in black and
white.

   DURBAN, South Africa _ Smoking marijuana does not disrupt the
effect of anti-retroviral drugs that keep the AIDS virus in check,
according to a study released Thursday at an international
conference on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the marijuana study are the first to be released
from research conducted at San Francisco General Hospital into the
use of marijuana by people infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV. Given the scarcity of data about the possible
medical uses of marijuana, the results have been eagerly awaited by
advocates in this heavily debated issue.
</P>
<P>
   It took four years for Donald Abrams, a professor at the
University of California at San Francisco, to jump through hurdles
erected by the federal government to get the research under way,
and in the process he was restricted to focusing on marijuana's
safety rather than its effectiveness. The 67 people who
participated in the study were kept in the hospital during the
25-day study period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that any good clinician with his
eyes and ears open has known for a long time that cannabis is very
useful in the treatment of the AIDS reduction syndrome and does not
harm patients,'' said Dr. Lester Greenspoon, professor of
psychiatry at Harvard University and author of ``Marijuana: the
Forbidden Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspoon said that when marijuana is allowed to be used for
medicinal purposes, ``it will be seen as one of the least toxic
drugs.'' He added that Abrams' research has `` put the seal of
approval on a new drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were especially keen to study people on drug regimes
that contain protease inhibitors, because the key ingredient in
marijuana is metabolized by the same system in the liver as those
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The participants, nearly all men, were divided into three
groups, with one set smoking marijuana, another taking a Food and
Drug Administration-approved pill containing the main ingredient in
marijuana, and a third taking a placebo, or harmless pill.
</P>
<P>
   In all groups, tests showed that the level of virus in the blood
dropped or remained undetectable by current tests. But those taking
marijuana either by smoking or in a pill form saw their level drop
slightly more than those on the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, researchers found that those using the pill or
smoking marijuana gained an average of 2.2 kilograms, compared to
.6 kilograms in the placebo group. Marijuana was first used widely
by people with AIDS to combat the nausea and extreme weight loss
that comes with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams called the lower viral levels in the marijuana patients
intriguing, but said it was not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there is no statistical difference
between the three groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've demonstrated the safety in a population as
vulnerable as people with HIV, I think it paves the way for doing
studies of efficacy,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Abrams, an oncologist, said he hopes to soon begin
studying the use of smoked marijuana for cancer patients to see if
it can control nausea and pain, including the nerve-based pain that
is often beyond the reach of opiate painkillers like morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said he expects to release more results from the study
soon, including marijuana's effect on appetite, testosterone levels
and body composition.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study were released at the 13th International
AIDS Conference in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to
serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

SPRINT AND WORLDCOM CALL OFF MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Kan.)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint and WorldCom, two of the United State's largest
long-distance carriers, called off merger plans Thursday and opened
the gates for takeover overtures by both foreign and domestic
telecommunications giants.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was widely expected after U.S. and European
regulators had expressed opposition to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   A formal end to the proposed $115 billion merger means suitors
can begin official approaches. Part of the companies' original
merger agreement barred any formal contacts with other potential
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom of Germany, Europe's largest telephone company,
has been mentioned as the main party interested in Sprint, and
executives of the German company have said it made informal
approaches in the last two weeks. Other potential suitors are
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan and BellSouth of Atlanta.
Sprint is particularly attractive because it owns a wireless
telephone network as well as its fixed-line business.
</P>
<P>
   Both businesses are desirable to foreign companies as footholds
in the world's largest telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department opposed the Sprint-WorldCom merger on the
grounds that it would have left too few long-distance options for
Americans and would have led to higher prices for less service.
European regulators were concerned that it would reduce competition
for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Thursday, both companies repeated their opposition
to those views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of conditions ultimately demanded by the U.S.
Department of Justice would compromise the customer and financial
benefits of the merger,'' they said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's president and chief executive, Bernard Ebbers, said a
policy of quashing such deals ``ultimately will reduce innovation
and choice, and raise the cost of telephone services for
residential customers, particularly those in rural America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., suggested that a court fight of
the Justice Department decision might yield results, but that the
time required for such lengthy litigation was not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sued late last month to block the merger,
and the companies withdrew their application from the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After AT&AMP;T, WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., is the United
State's second-largest long-distance company, followed by Sprint.

&HT;     `BIG BROTHER' IS A BORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ CBS's so-called ``reality'' show ``Big Brother,'' a
tasteless stinkeroo, is supposed to run through September if it
isn't canceled. Help!
</P>
<P>
   If this is reality, give me fiction.
</P>
<P>
   So far ``Brother'' isn't worth the bother.
</P>
<P>
   Why did CBS think that millions of Americans would get hooked on
watching shallow, inarticulate young people do nothing? If we are
going to be peeping Toms, we want to be entertained, amused or _
heaven forbid _ educated. But this is simply boring.
</P>
<P>
   The show debuted before 22 million curious folks on July 5,
helped by its position following the popular ``Survivor,'' which
has topped the ratings chart with an average of 21 million viewers
every week since it was launched six shows ago. By the end of the
first half-hour of ``Brother,'' however, 1.5 million voters had
turned it off. Not an auspicious beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the ``Brother'' audience has ranged from 11 million
to 6 million. This is not good enough to sustain a show that is
scheduled to air five days a week for two more months.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is a bigger audience than the 3.5 million book-lovers
who snapped up ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' last
weekend. Television is a powerful medium, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But the show was touted as a blockbuster, pioneering a new form
of entertainment that would transform our viewing habits forever by
showing us real people having real experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this silly show about 10 strangers sealed in a
house full of cameras and microphones is that so far none of the
stars has had anything to say. The charm of the show is supposed to
be that it is unscripted. But without a play book, the thing
wanders aimlessly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fussing over an injured chicken was the excitement
one night. Another night a mild, incoherent flirtation was what
passed for passion.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to count the number of times the young folks said ``you
know'' and ``like'' in their sentences but lost track. This does
not make for riveting dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Survivor'' actually resembles high adventure. It
is stagey and hokey, as is ``Brother.'' But things do happen. The
participants compete in tests of athletic skill while engaging in a
lot of muttered backbiting and maneuvering against one another. And
they have identifiable personalities to like or dislike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother'' may yet improve, but I doubt it. There's not enough
there, there.
</P>
<P>
   Something good would come of this, however, if it were to dampen
network enthusiasm for other so-called reality shows. A horror is
apparently in the works that would feature a woman shackled to four
men for a week, after which she picks the one she likes best. Ugh!
As a locked-together quintet, how do they manage bathroom
maneuvers? Eating? Sleeping? Spare us, please.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be an improvement on sitcoms, which could
certainly stand a great deal of improving. And it is nice to be
free of a canned-laughter sound track. But the assumption that we
are all mindless snoops is too much.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to see how ``reality'' is going to make it
unless the people and situations are interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The dirty little secret is that real life is often drab,
composed not of grand schemes but of repetitive little chores. Not
everyone dines at the White House, outwits the boss or rescues a
child from a river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' works because the characters revel in the attention
they are getting, the setting is exotic, the tasks are uncommon and
the tension of kicking off one person per show builds nicely.
``Brother,'' by contrast, sits there stupidly, staring back at us.
In terms of action, a cockroach has more to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``Brother'' folks have been speculating about how
much money they will lose if the series is canceled. This may
motivate some of them to stir up trouble or instigate a hot romance
to get the ratings moving in future segments. But viewers can sense
when they are conned. Such artifice could well send more of them
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Brother'' was to do something fresh during the
summer doldrums when many people are at the beach and ignoring all
those TV re-runs. And the two major party conventions, featuring
nominees and platforms fixed in advance, are not likely to help in
the thrill department.
</P>
<P>
   But fresh is not necessarily better. That is the unhappy message
of ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its bad taste, it is not a comment on declining American
morality or slipping cultural standards. The public has more sense
than the producers, and people are voting against this show with
their channel clickers. The show is only a comment on the bad
judgment of those who control TV programming today.
</P>
<P>
   Give it up, guys. Don't wait until September. Try replicating
``Bonanza'' and ``Matlock'' instead.

   STRETCHING A DVD PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting in Las Vegas last week, the video business
acknowledged DVD _ a format that some in the industry have had
their reservations about _ as its most positive development. It
doesn't take a convention to gauge the rise of the disc and its
player, about 10 million of which could be in use by early next
year. On the release horizon, hundreds of films wait to join the
current DVD inventory of about 6,500 movie and music titles.
</P>
<P>
   In true more-is-more spirit, the biggest and the splashiest of
them _ usually meaning the ones with the most special effects _ are
so jammed with extra features that they threaten to spill right off
the disc. DVD makers used to revel in all the room they had, but
now they wonder how to get everything onto two-disc editions or the
new ``18'' (for gigabytes) dual-layered, two-sided discs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old laser discs, 18s will have to be flipped, something
early DVD developers said should not happen. They also take longer
to replicate, which can help delay special editions and in some
cases force studios to issue one disc that is light on extras at
the time the videocassette appears and another one later with all
the features added. ``You have to be very careful consumers know
another edition is coming along,'' said Jonathan Gaines of Acoustic
Visions, a Los Angeles company that helps produce discs for the
movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   One habitual space-grabber, as it was on laser disc, is
``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle
directed by James Cameron. Action-movie buffs always seem to be up
for still more ``T2,'' as it's called by grateful distributors, and
next month a DVD 18 edition from Artisan will carry three complete
versions of the film: the one that ran in theaters, another with 15
minutes added and another with five minutes on top of that. All
this before the added features, which from documentaries (three) to
production stills, number more than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Just released by Fox, ``Independence Day'' fills the first of
two discs (one-sided) with the original film and another version of
it with 9 minutes of material restored; a commentary by Roland
Emmerich, the director, and Dean Devlin, the producer and
co-writer; and another commentary from the effects supervisors. All
the other extras, including a 33-minute ``featurette'' (DVD-ese for
various pieces of film about the film), is left for the second
disc.
</P>
<P>
   Not all DVDs come so fully packed, of course. For example, it is
a relief to encounter ``The Woody Allen Collection,'' available
this week from MGM. Eight Allen films _ ``Annie Hall,''
``Bananas,'' ``Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but
Were Afraid to Ask,'' ``Interiors,'' ``Love and Death,''
``Manhattan,'' ``Sleeper'' and ``Stardust Memories'' _ are
accompanied by just two extras each: a trailer for the film and an
informative four-page circular inserted in the disc case.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs often are dependent on the director to provide extras,
which some do by the trunkful. Allen is said to feel no such urge.
</P>
<P>
   All About My Mother
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Almodovar's complex film takes what he has called
``screwball drama'' to a more deeply felt level. When Manuela
(Cecilia Roth) sees her son run down in the street, she leaves his
heart beating in another man's body and goes off to refigure life
with a variety of iconoclastic women. These include a nun played by
Penelope Cruz and the irrepressible transsexual actor Agrado
(Antonia San Juan), an old friend of Manuela's since the days
before Agrado had breasts. ``Almodovar has expressed the idea of
acting as a divine form of life before,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The
New York Times, ``but never with the kind of clarity and beauty
that glitter here.''

   The very grimness of the poverty in Alan Parker's film, adapted
from Frank McCourt's celebrated book about his brutal Irish
upbringing, oddly contrasts with the lush beauty of its
cinematography and a tidily controlled palette that keeps real
suffering at bay. Jammed into tiny, waterlogged quarters in
Limerick, Ireland, the family of Malachy McCourt, a charming and
caring drunk, exists on little food and not much of anything else,
including shoes, while Malachy fails at any work he tries. But with
due respect to the pain described here, ``the film isn't wrenching
enough to do it justice'' (Maslin).

wife (Rosanna Arquette) and nasty mother-in-law is further rattled
by Jimmy ``the Tulip'' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former Chicago
organized-crime figure who moves in next door. Jimmy, as breezily
confident as Oz is anxiety-ridden, stirs the suburban pot with hit
men, love interests and large sums of money. But while Perry shows
a knack for slapstick, Jonathan Lynn's film remains
``underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts'' (Elvis
Mitchell).

   Isn't She Great
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best line to sum up Jacqueline Susann (Bette
Midler) in Andrew Bergman's bio-pic comes from Jackie's best friend
(Stockard Channing): ``Talent isn't everything.'' Competence is
another matter. Jackie banged out her humid sex-and-drug adventures
_ ``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Love Machine'' _ with game
efficiency. Midler is perfectly equipped to give color to the
character, but she is stymied by a film that only makes Susann's
life campy and crude. ``It's not that there's no talent among the
collaborators; it's just that no one gets much of a chance to show
it'' (Mitchell).

   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a

   SPIDERS and THE THOUSAND EYES OF DR. MABUSE. New editions of one
of Fritz Lang's earliest films and his last one find the director
in his thriller mode. Inspired by the serials of Louis Feuillade,
``Spiders'' (1919, 137 minutes) stars Carl de Vogt as the
adventurer Kay Hoog, who finds a note in a bottle from an
anthropologist being held captive by South American Indians.
There's Incan treasure to locate, a spider cult to avoid and a
treacherous femme fatale (Ressel Orla) to best. (Indiana Jones,
anybody? Well, sort of.) For ``The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse''
(1960), Lang resurrected his master criminal Dr. Mabuse for a
latter-day and rather convoluted international conspiracy (and here
everybody thought Mabuse had died in the '30s). Kino. $24.95 each.

   LATE AUGUST, EARLY SEPTEMBER. Olivier Assayas' film involves the
death of a middle-aged man, but the treatment concentrates on
myopic egos and changing relationships rather than morbidity or
pain. ``If Assayas doesn't always transport his film's events
beyond the all-too-commonplace,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New
York Times, ``his understatement can also yield moments of quieter
simplicity.'' 1999. $89.99. 105 minutes. French with English

`THE WISDOM OF CROCODILES': A BLOODSUCKER FINDS IT HARD TO LIVE AS
A ROMANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever someone wears a collarless shirt in a movie, it's a
signal that there's something otherworldly about him, part of the
tradition that includes Bruce Lee, Steven Segal and Ben Kingsley in
``Gandhi.'' And such is the case with Steven Grslcz (Jude Law), the
languid, parchment-pale vampire in ``The Wisdom of Crocodiles.''
It's the kind of picture in which the bloodsucker is so chic he
probably uses the spelling ``vampyre.''
</P>
<P>
   As Steven takes to his victims, a decorative splatter of
arterial blood hits the backlighted bedroom wall of his groovy
bachelor pad. As he labels crystalline shards with the names of his
female victims and scribbles ``despair'' and ``disappointment'' in
notebooks, there's a glint of despair and disappointment in his
mostly impassive eyes, an expression you will soon recognize on
fellow audience members if you're in a theater showing ``Wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven is also the kind of vampire who may have spent too much
time reading Anne Rice, since his life has the fruity morbidity
associated with her vampire Lestat. He seeks victims who fall in
love with him, so that he can drain the love from their
bloodstreams. Otherwise he sucks down despair and disappointment,
which are taking a physical toll on him: He is dying and needs to
find pure love to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Steven's dialogue sounds like the kind of florid pick-up
lines better used on second-year literature students or the kind of
lonely women seen only in movies. He comes up with insights like
the three-brains theory, saying that everyone has three brains:
Human, mammalian and reptilian. Not only does this lofty locution
confuse his victims, who were probably under the illusion that
humans were mammals, but it also makes one wonder which brain was
responsible for the script.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such lines, and ideas borrowed from Rice and David
Cronenberg _ Steven's dissipation feels like an AIDS metaphor, as
did Jeff Goldblum's state in Cronenberg's ``Fly'' _ ``Crocodile''
is too enervated to be garish. Even when a slow-witted gang whose
leader looks like a teddy boy from one of the musical numbers in
the 1985 film ``Absolute Beginners'' _ and is about as threatening
_ shows up, the movie seems bloodless. Law doesn't disgrace himself
here, though he doesn't have much to do, and the director, Po Chih
Leong, is deft at creating atmosphere, but it's an atmosphere we've
all seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Steven is being tracked by the dogged but kindly Inspector
Healey (Timothy Spall, who gets to offer some feeling that is
either human or mammalian, since he doesn't have to be cloaked in
stylish dissolution). When Steven chats with Healey about the
nature of evil, it's almost as if he is trying to pick up the
detective, but the movie doesn't follow up on the pansexual vampire
idea, since it has a prescribed number of marks to hit.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those marks are hit when Steven pursues Anne, played
by Elina Loewensohn, who for the first time in her career has found
someone paler than herself to play against (no small feat, since
she has been in Hal Hartley movies and played a vampire herself in
``Nadia''). Anne is moody and thin-skinned, and her temperament,
which suggests passion, brings dramatic tension to her scenes. It
was a good idea to make her not easily won over, though sadly
that's one of the few ideas ``Wisdom'' has.

   In the four years that NAACP President Kweisi Mfume has led the
country's oldest and largest civil rights organization, he has
taken it from $4 million in debt to a $2 million surplus. By
boycotting South Carolina because of its Confederate flag on the
statehouse and bullying major television network executives into
hiring more African Americans, the NAACP's national image has
soared. But what impact have these efforts had at the local level?
Fort Worth's branch has struggled with an aging membership and

`X-MEN' IS A SMART, STYLISH MUTATION OF COMIC-BOOK GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B+  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If comic-book movies get a bad rap, it's largely because most
comic-book movies never quite understand their source. Director
Bryan Singer (``The Usual Suspects'') knows exactly what ``X-Men''
is about: It's the pulp superhero version of ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' played as a parable in prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-so-distant future, evolution hiccups and a sudden
burst of mutations turns otherwise ordinary kids into superpowered
beings. Triggered at puberty, it adds an entirely new dimension to
adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   These social misfits are more than simply confused; they're the
targets of fear, abuse and a growing witch hunt. They're mutants,
and if hysterical Sen. Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has his way,
they'd be locked up for good.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, effortlessly channeling young Clint
Eastwood) is first seen in a Yukon tavern version of a death-cage
fight. He's a scrappy, brooding loner with an indestructible
skeleton, unnatural powers of recovery and razor sharp claws that
shoot from his fists. Rogue (Anna Paquin), a tortured teenager
whose first kiss sends her boyfriend into a coma, is doomed to live
out her life without ever touching another human.
</P>
<P>
   These tragic orphans find their first acceptance at bald,
wheelchair-bound telepath Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart)
School for Gifted Children, an idyllic Westchester mansion whose
wooded grounds hide a high-tech underground bunker of gleaming
spaceships and superhero facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier's human magnet counterpart, Magneto (Ian McKellen), a
bitter Holocaust survivor with his own team of angry mutant
misfits, is a kind of Malcolm X of mutant rights (is it a
coincidence he utters the line ``By any means necessary''?)
opposite Xavier's Martin Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   Singer borrows a few design ideas from the Tim Burton ``Batman''
films and choreographs his fights with the help of Hong Kong
martial arts movie veteran Corey Yuen, but ``X-Men'' is unusually
neither splashy or showboating. The fight scenes between the X-Men
and Magneto's treacherous team are a model of conciseness and
clarity next to the loud, messy action of most films, and Singer's
focus nicely preserves the group dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the veteran X-Men are pale unformed figures next
to Wolverine and Rogue. James Marsden is woefully flat as Cyclops,
the ray-beam blasting team leader, and any talk of his relationship
with Famke Janssen's Jean Grey comes off as pure wishful thinking:
There isn't a spark between them. Most of the other characters wind
up shortchanged as well (Halle Berry seems breathlessly poised for
lines she never delivers). With so much to cover, the film feels
oddly weightless by the end, as if a preamble to a coming epic.
``X-Men'' has franchise written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a franchise I'd be happy to see continue. In a swift 95
minutes, Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that
balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being
different. With parallels to the Holocaust, the communist witch
hunt, modern homophobic hysteria and racism, obvious as they may
be, it provides a dimension that grounds this fantasy in the real
world.

`CHEERLEADER' LACKS SATIRICAL EDGE IN LAMPOON OF HOMOPHOBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C+  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natasha Lyonne (``The Slums of Beverly Hills''), the most
sardonic young actress working today, puts on a cheery face and
wears her pom-poms with pride as picture perfect cheerleader Megan.
</P>
<P>
   But she's got a problem: her boyfriend's sloppy, slobbering
kisses don't get her all hot and bothered (``Maybe he just doesn't
do it right,'' she ponders), she loves tofu, and she proudly hangs
a Melissa Etheridge poster in her bedroom. In this cookie- cutter
suburb of Anytown USA, those are the telltale signs of lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
   Ambushed with an intervention, Megan is sent to a homosexual
deprogramming clinic known as True Directions run by shrewish
matriarch Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty). In a life-size dollhouse
that looks like a Fisher Price version of a ``Father Knows Best''
set, girls dressed in powder-puff pink vacuum, embroider and scrub
linoleum floors while outdoors, chirpy ``ex-gay'' Mike (RuPaul out
of drag and in a T-shirt that reads ``Straight is great'') tosses
footballs and teaches auto-mechanics to a group of limp-wristed,
highly disinterested baby blue boys.
</P>
<P>
   The girls may be earnestly trying to wash those same-sex
impulses out of their system by day, but at night they rebel. When
they're not using the electroshock aversion therapy as foreplay,
they sneak out on the ``underground homosexual railroad'' to boogie
their conformist impulses away at a gay bar.
</P>
<P>
   Good girl Megan finally admits her true feelings to dour rebel
Graham (Clea DuVall) and they share the kind of smooch that sends
Mary Brown into eye-rolling convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   There's an inoffensive energy to Jamie Babbit's lampoon of
homophobia hysteria. Driven by a peppy girl-group rock score, the
film plays gay stereotypes as broad farce and middle-class fear as
frantic panic, but there's no bite beyond the cartoonish laughs.
Afraid to take the film into genuine satirical territory, Babbit
finally stalls it in an insistently earnest climax that's supposed
to be defiant but melts into mushy cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a shame, as Babbit has gusto to burn. His art direction
and parody of 1950s TV stereotypes played out by modern teens
doesn't carry the insight or the edge of satire. But his film is
disarmingly funny in its own naive way.

`XMEN': POW! MISFIT HEROES TO THE RESCUE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cyclops (James Marsden) unleashes bolts of energy from his eyes
and has to wear shielding glasses to keep those rays in check. Jean
Grey (Famke Janssen) is telepathic and telekinetic. Storm (Halle
Berry) can control the weather, conjuring lightning bolts to do
with as she will. The hotheaded, confrontational Wolverine (Hugh
Jackman) has superstrength, healing abilities that allow him to
recover from almost any injury, and a metal alloy grafted onto his
skeleton that gives him claws he can project from his knuckles. And
Rogue (Anna Paquin) absorbs the essence of others, which makes her
an energy vampire; she discovers her power when she steals her
first kiss and almost kills the boy.
</P>
<P>
   These are the X-Men, at least the ones that made it into Bryan
Singer's movie adaptation. It's disheartening to see the X-Men
depicted so earnestly here, given what they've been through _ the
cancellation of their comic book and their resurrection as the most
popular characters in Marvel Comics history. Clumsy when it should
be light on its feet, the movie takes itself even more seriously
than the comic book and its fans do, which is a superheroic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, as in the comics, mutants _ Homo superior _ are
the next evolutionary stage for human beings, and they're
persecuted because (gasp) they're different. The X-Men are mutants
and misfits shepherded into altruism by the compassionate mutant
Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has the ability to
read minds and affect the thoughts of others. It's a part Stewart
was born to play: He has the vocal command to convince you that he
knows what you're thinking. (His name went out as perfect casting
in Internet chat rooms as soon as talks about an X-Men movie
materialized.)
</P>
<P>
   Xavier's nemesis is his former mutant friend, Magneto (Ian
McKellen), whose roiling syllables make you want to see him square
off against Stewart. Listening to them trill their vowels at each
other is one of the movie's few pleasures, since the parallels to
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Xavier) and Malcolm X
(Magneto) are made wincingly plain; Magneto promises to defeat his
opponents ``by any means necessary.'' Stewart and McKellen are a
pair of austere hams, and their wrestling is the only consistently
enjoyable note in the film. When they go golden throat to golden
throat, it is like watching members of another species in action.
Most of the other battles in ``X-Men,'' fights between Xavier's
team and Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, consist of stuntmen
taking blows and being jerked across rooms the length of
high-school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison, using a pinched voice)
leads a charge against all mutants, he causes a boiling fury in
Magneto, a Nazi concentration camp survivor. After the X-Men were
created in 1963, almost 20 years passed before this aspect of
Magneto's character was written into the comics, and it makes sense
to use it in the movie. His specific goal is revenge against
anti-mutant bigots, which elevates Magneto above the routine motive
of world domination. But his methods are so uncontrollable that
they cause death.
</P>
<P>
   Magneto's forces include the mountainous Sabertooth (Tyler Mane,
who brings his mast-size World Wrestling Federation persona to the
role); the Toad (Ray Park), who leaps and unleashes a tongue
several feet long, and the shape-shifter Mystique (Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos). In the best piece of supermodel casting of all
time, she is deep-sea-blue, with scales pasted onto her body; you
can almost hear Dennis Rodman sighing in envy. She moves well, too.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does an extensive job of cramming in much of the
mythology from the comics, loyal dollops of exposition that are
both touching and ponderous, a setup to a sequel. The compassionate
Xavier wants to reach an accord with both Magneto and the human
race, with peaceful coexistence as his goal. At his private school,
Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (and before you giggle, that
name is right out of the comics, too), where he houses and trains
young mutants, there are cameos by X-Men like Bobby Drake, the
Iceman. (When he speaks, wisps of frost emanate from his mouth.)
When Wolverine comments on the black leather X-Men outfits, which
look like something you would see on the counter staff at a bondage
version of McDonald's, Cyclops responds, ``What would you have us
wear? Yellow spandex?'' The line will get a laugh from comics fans,
since the original X-Men and Wolverine costumes featured that
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter Tom DeSanto's love for these characters and
their histories is obvious, but it's just as obvious that he
doesn't have any distance from them. There are elements that work
on the page that just don't lend themselves to film. The tortured,
shy Cyclops is reduced to a decent-guy cipher in the movie, and he
is made even more vague because his eyes are never visible; his
suffering is clear to comics readers because of interior monologues
provided via thought balloons. (Storm and Jean Grey are less
defined.) That's the kind of problem that devotion to the source
material doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Singer, the director who massaged the
parlor-trick malice of ``The Usual Suspects'' into an event? His
adaptation of Stephen King's short story ``Apt Pupil'' had a leaden
quality not unlike that of ``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-fisted Wolverine, well played by Jackman, is perhaps the
only other semi-rounded character who animates the picture besides
Xavier and Magneto. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero
without complication. (Bits of his back-story, lifted from the
``Weapon X'' comic series, are suggested here.)
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed quite a bit since 1963, or 1975, the year
Wolverine and Storm first showed up. These days, Magneto would
probably turn up on ``The Howard Stern Show,'' insulting dull, weak
Homo sapiens. It might have been better to have the characters
express themselves through action rather than having to explain
themselves in the style of their comic book origins. The clear,
bold strokes of comic books are what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The X-men comics' creators, Stan Lee (who is also featured in a
cameo) and Jack Kirby, had a genius for such touches. The ``X-Men''
series was a precursor of the WB television network; the comic book
was one of the few popular media venues in the 1960s in which
complex teen-age characters were focal points instead of bland
grown-up do-gooders like Superman, the world's only well-adjusted
split personality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was the reason ``X-Men'' comics struggled and
failed initially; the world wasn't ready for misunderstood young
martyrs with special powers saving the world and living through
unrequited flushes of love. The alternation of nonstop-action and
lower-lip-chewing heartbreak _ action melodrama _ was what Lee
pioneered in ``Spider-Man'' and fried to a crispy crunch in
``X-Men.'' (It may be what attracted the film's producer, Lauren
Shuler Donner, since her husband Richard's ``Lethal Weapon''
brought the same thing to the big screen.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, when the threat of nuclear radiation was filling the
screens of drive-in theaters with monsters from Japan and monsters
in our own backyard, Marvel Comics came up with a benevolent spin
and the X-Men were the result. To make it work as a film, someone
needed to use the same brand of inventiveness. This movie is proof
that imitation is the sincerest form of flattening.

BANKRUPTCY OF SOGO CORP. SPREADS ANXIETY OVER JAPANESE BUSINESS
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The collapse of Sogo Corp., a department store operator
that owed more than $17 billion, cast a dark cloud over business
activities here Thursday and resurrected anxieties about the
fragilities in Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei stock index fell 1.8 percent, as investors
sought to protect themselves from the potential fallout from Sogo's
bankruptcy filing on Wednesday. Even the currency and bond markets,
typically indifferent to the travails of individual Japanese
companies, were uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and bureaucrats sought to blame one another for the
ham-handed way in which Sogo's bankruptcy, one of the biggest in
Japan, came about and the uncomfortable financial issues its demise
will force them to confront.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party laid responsibility for the
bankruptcy on the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the
government agency responsible for overhauling Japan's debt-ridden
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding debt relief procedures in the future, the Financial
Reconstruction Commission should be more cautious,'' said Hidenao
Nakagawa, who as chief Cabinet secretary is the ruling party's
leading spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, the commission announced that the government would
spend 97 billion yen, or $915 million at current exchange rates, of
taxpayer money as part of a rescue plan to reduce Sogo's debt, thus
setting the retailer back on its feet but inciting a rare burst of
public fury that forced politicians to call off the deal on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction commission officials rejected Nakagawa's
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easy for him to say,'' said one commission official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He would be just as upset if
we had let Sogo fail right from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sogo, which operates 25 department stores in Japan and employs
10,000 people, has had one foot in the grave since April, when it
asked banks to forgive 631.9 billion yen, or $6 billion, in
outstanding debt, a legacy of its speculative borrowing during
Japan's boom years.
</P>
<P>
   But Shinsei Bank, a Sogo creditor with its own history of
financial crises, objected to Sogo's request. Shinsei, which a
group of foreign investors purchased from the government last year,
not only refused to forgive any Sogo debt, it also refused to cast
itself as the bank responsible for Sogo's demise. Instead,
Shinsei's foreign owners exercised a provision in their purchase
agreement that forces the government to take responsibility for
loans that have soured since they acquired the bank.
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation Thursday that the indirect role of
Shinsei's foreign owners in the Sogo collapse would arouse some
resentment. Foreign ownership of Japanese banks is still a relative
rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think that in some quarters, this is going to
reinforce the idea of well, we shouldn't have sold an important
institution to people who won't play the game our way,'' said
Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sogo debacle raises even more painful, pointed issues
for a country that typically defers hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   How can politicians allow legions of debt-laden construction
companies that are their biggest supporters to suffer the same fate
as Sogo? Shinsei is also a major lender to Kumagai Gumi and Hazama
Corp., which has already asked for debt forgiveness, and other
general contractors are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Japanese economy withstand a flood of bankruptcies?
Japan is nurturing what it hopes is a fledgling economic recovery,
but a large increase in bankruptcies could derail that recovery by
increasing unemployment, forcing fire sales of assets, eroding
consumer confidence and pushing the banking system toward a new
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Minoru Nakano, an analyst who has been
following the Sogo saga at Teikoku Data Bank, a data collection and
credit-monitoring company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nakano said he believed the ruling party was trying to position
itself to avoid the fallout from a rash of big bankruptcies, not to
stop them from happening. He noted that the ruling party assigned
responsibility for the Construction Ministry, long the primary
source of party power, to a member of a coalition party, Chikage
Ogi, after the June election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This construction minister is not a member of the ruling
party, and that says the ruling party does not want to exert its
influence over the industry,'' he said. ``The Liberal Democrats do
not want to be involved right now.''
</P>
<P>
   How big an impact a series of large bankruptcies would have on
the banking system is unclear. Many banks have set aside reserves
to cover potential losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Bank of Japan was Sogo's biggest creditor,
holding some 380 billion yen, or roughly $3.6 billion, but it said
Thursday that while it might lose 235.6 billion yen of those loans,
the bankruptcy would have no impact on its bottom line. Asahi Bank
said it might lose 47.8 billion yen, or $451 million, but that the
loss would not affect its profits.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts worry that the banks may have underestimated
the extent of the losses they may have to absorb. Many considered
the Financial Reconstruction Commission's planned rescue of Sogo as
little more than a bank bailout in disguise. ``If they do allow
these companies to collapse, it will precipitate a second banking
crisis,'' said one economist who asked to remain anonymous. ``The
public is going to pay for this one way or the other.''

`CHUCK AND BUCK': CHILDHOOD LONGINGS IN A GROWN-UP WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT1    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shot in mostly hand-held video and featuring a character whose
mental balance is questionable, to say the least, ``Chuck and
Buck'' might be described as a Dogma 95 version of ``Disney's `The
Kid.''' The two films share some underlying themes _ the pain of
growing up, the persistence of primal fears and desires into
adulthood, the desperate human need for love _ but their methods of
exploring them could hardly be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, ultimately, is between easy sentiment and
difficult emotion. Though ``Chuck and Buck,'' Miguel Arteta's new
film, is frequently funny and always sincere, there is nothing cute
or heartwarming about its view of childhood. It's an intimate,
slightly creepy, often disturbing look at loneliness and need _
something, in other words, for the child in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jon Turteltaub's sudsy ``Kid,'' ``Chuck and Buck'' tells
the story of a confident, successful man confronted by an unwelcome
visitor from his boyhood, a reminder of painful memories and lost
innocence. The revenant encountered by Charlie Sitter (Chris Weitz)
is not a time-traveling younger incarnation of himself, as in ``The
Kid,'' but rather his boyhood friend Buck (Mike White), who has
gotten stuck in time. Buck is functional enough to keep himself
supplied with lollipops _ his main source of nutrition, it seems _
and clean clothes. He can even drive a car. But for the most part
he dwells in the mental and emotional world of the 11-year-old he
was when he and Charlie, whom he insists on calling Chuck, were
inseparable buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with a slow pan across Buck's bedroom, a visual
inventory of the board games, figurines, model airplanes and cars
that furnish his life. In the background we hear his mother
coughing herself to death. Charlie, summoned by a handwritten
letter on juvenile stationery, goes to the funeral, and Buck, after
making a fumbling sexual advance at his old friend, decides to
follow him to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There he installs himself _ along with his toys, his lollipops
and his vaporizer _ in a motel, which soon becomes the base of one
of the strangest stalking enterprises ever recorded on film. When
Charlie rebuffs Buck's incessant phone calls and unannounced
visits, Buck decides to catch his pal's conscience with a play
called ``Hank and Frank,'' an allegory of their fairy-tale
friendship and its cruel termination.
</P>
<P>
   With his weak, wobbly chin, pale skin and paler eyelashes, White
is an uncanny embodiment of arrested development. His character
elicits both protectiveness and revulsion. The movie's female
characters _ Chuck's fiancee, Carlyn (Beth Colt); his assistant,
Jamila (Maya Rudolph); and a sympathetic theater manager (Lupe
Ontiveros) _ respond to his guileless, scary innocence with
confusion, alarm and enough maternal solicitude to keep him from
unraveling entirely. The audience may find it hard to believe that
White is acting, despite a record of grown-up achievements that
include producing several television shows and writing the script
for this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and Buck'' as a whole exhibits the quiet sensitivity and
quicksilver intelligence that infuse White's performance. Ontiveros
is especially fine in a role that is in many ways the key to the
film; she's a bedrock of sanity and good humor. In a brilliant
stroke of casting, Weitz's brother Paul appears as Sam, a thuggish
would-be actor who becomes Buck's unlikely surrogate for the lost
Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   Arteta, whose first feature was the arresting and offbeat ``Star
Maps,'' presents Buck's world with delicacy and tact, but he never
flinches from the more discomfiting implications of the story.
Buck's childlike longing for attention and acceptance expresses
itself as sexual desire. He is desperate not only to recapture the
intimacy he and Charlie knew as boys, but also to revive the sexual
play that was part of their bond. How this longing is resolved is
both shocking and, by the time it happens, entirely credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and Buck'' is a strange, intense and moving film about
friendship and loss, an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy
nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically,
one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this
year.

   SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ A new analysis of the climate of
the last 1,000 years suggests that human activity is the dominant
factor behind the sharp global warming trend seen in the 20th
century. The research, described in the journal Science, offers the
most direct link yet between people and the 1.1 degree rise in
average global temperature over the last hundred years. The study
has already sparked debate among camps of scientists who dispute
the existing climate record and others who say the oceans play an
underappreciated role. But many climatologists said it marked a
substantial move forward in understanding forces that are warming
the earth _ and are likely to continue warming it in coming

   SCI-NJ-COAST (Undated) _ Geologists have long viewed the West
Coast as the dynamic side of North America, the shore where
earthquakes, tidal waves, and other potentially dangerous
geological forces are most likely to strike. But there are
increasing signs that the outer sloping edge of the continental
shelf along the East Coast has the potential to cave in, possibly
abruptly enough to send destructive tidal waves, or tsunamis,
speeding toward shore. The latest evidence comes in a study being
published in the journal Science, which found that rock buried
nearly 2,000 feet under the sea bed off the New Jersey coast is so
porous that it is actually mostly water. By Andrew C. Revkin.

   SCI-AIDS-INFANTS (Durban, South Africa) _ Research described
Thursday at the International AIDS conference shows that a simple
drug regimen given to pregnant women infected with HIV can protect
their infants, possibly as long as 18 months after they are born,
even if they are breastfed. The regimen differs from another
treatment, whose benefits, according to research reported last
week, seemed to be offset by transmission of the virus through
breastfeeding. Authors of both studies said they would work
together to attempt to unravel the apparent contradiction. By
Lawrence K. Altman.

 &HT;    NO EASY SOLUTIONS TO MINORITY GAP IN THE HIGH-TECH WORLD
 &HT;    1000&AMP;add. With TECH-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Twenty-year-old Greg Bogin grew up in the mean
streets of Compton, Calif., just blocks away from the public courts
where the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, got their
introduction to tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Like the famous duo, Bogin is a whiz, too _ at math and science.
He is using his intellect to lift him out of the gang-infested
neighborhood where he was raised and where he saw friends die.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the computer world from the inner city. You
don't see Bill Gates as a role model. Well, I've seen it now,''
said Bogin, a college junior doing research this summer for Verizon
Laboratories near Boston in a program jointly sponsored by the
United Negro College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   America's business attire has changed from stuffy suits to
casual cool, but the faces remain largely the same. The New
Economy, like the old economy, is dominated by white males.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech professions have a disproportionately small number of
women, blacks and Hispanics in high-paying technical jobs. Bogin
and others like him are the exceptions in the fastest-growing
sector of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The trickling pipeline of science and math majors from American
colleges and universities suggests that the situation will not soon
improve, leaving the specter of a growing wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, without a doubt, a vast untapped talent pool in the
United States among women and minorities, currently
under-represented in engineering and information sciences,'' the
president's Information Technology Advisory Committee said in a
report last year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation called it a ``serious national
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal commission studying the imbalance warned
that America risks losing its competitive edge in the global
marketplace if it fails to provide adequate math and science
education to draw women, African Americans and Hispanics into the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that women _ 51 percent
of the population _ make up only 28 percent of computer
programmers, 26 percent of computer scientists and 9 percent of
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House advisory group noted that African Americans,
Hispanics and Native Americans constitute one-fourth of the total
U.S. work force, but only 6.7 percent of the information and
computer science work force and 5.9 percent of the engineers.
Asian-Americans, who comprise 4 percent of the nation's population,
tend to be over-represented, at least double their proportion to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like the one operating at Verizon (formerly GTE before
its recent merger with Bell Atlantic) are seeking to correct the
imbalance for blacks. At its leafy campus west of Boston, Verizon
each summer offers 20 college students the chance to work side by
side with laboratory researchers brainstorming the company's next
leaps forward in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bogin, a junior at Xavier University in New Orleans, is helping
write new data encryption software for the Palm Pilot handheld
device that would improve e-mail security. He works in the
facility's top-secret lab room and in a simple, cramped office
where he calculates algorithms and writes code.
</P>
<P>
   It is a road that began in fifth grade, when he scored high on
an aptitude test and was able to study at a math and science magnet
school that required him to rise at 4 every morning for a
three-hour bus ride to school.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his father, a baker for Nabisco, and his strict
mother for keeping his nose to the books and out of trouble. Yet he
is not necessarily looking for a pot of gold at the end of the
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in quick and easy money. Growing up in the
inner city, I saw it ruin too many people in my neighborhood who
were attracted to crime by the idea of a Mercedes and nice clothes
and all that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a comfortable living for my family. But if
becoming a millionaire is part of that, I won't turn it down,'' he
added with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame for the lack of diversity?
</P>
<P>
   The industry faults public education for failing to prepare
students for careers in technology. Women and minority groups often
criticize the industry for not doing enough to support education
and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also blamed is the ``geek'' factor: a supposed cultural gulf
between the white and Asian male world of computers and women and
minorities, who feel they are not welcomed and thus do not wish to
be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity problem, a politically charged issue as high-tech
wealth has grown, has prompted 25 tech corporations, including IBM,
America Online, Intel and Sun Microsystems to pledge $250 million
for recruitment and training aimed at bring more women and
minorities into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a high-risk, highly competitive world that rewards
talent, regardless of gender or skin color, said industry
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that people care about are your results,'' said Patricia
Sueltz, president of the software products division at Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high-hurdle mark that is color-blind, whether
you're white, African-American Asian, Hispanic or whatever. The
issue is getting the numbers up in middle schools and high schools
and educating students to the opportunities in math and science
fields,'' said Erik Phelps, who heads education programs for the
Verizon Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   College students continue to shun math and science, despite
national efforts to promote them. And while the number of women and
minorities gaining degrees in technical fields has grown over the
past two decades, it remains small.
</P>
<P>
   The total of U.S. undergraduates earning computer and
information sciences degrees declined from a high of 41,889 in 1986
to just 24,768 in 1997, at a time when demand for them was growing.
Evidence suggests that the Internet boom has spurred more current
students to major in the field, but still far below the level of
industry demand.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology firms currently have about 800,000 job vacancies now
or projected through the end of 2000, according to the Information
Technology Association of America. The industry is seeking approval
from Congress to nearly double the current limit of 115,000 H-1B
visas, which allow technical workers from India, China, Russia and
elsewhere into the United States to take high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Importing talent would not be necessary with a full commitment
by government and high-tech companies to improve public schools and
training opportunities for workers in need for updated skills,
argue minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley, an
organization that represents minority professionals, is lobbying
against the bill in Congress, claiming that there are enough
Americans _ including minorities, women and older workers _ who
could be hired and trained to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs almost to be a national emergency act to improve
the pipeline of engineering and computer science graduates,'' said
Butch Wing, director of the Silicon Valley office of Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a great irony that with high-tech and the New
Economy creating jobs we find ourselves to unprepared, and we're
not doing enough to improve our education system and re-train
workers and make this a priority,'' Wing said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small but positive signs.
</P>
<P>
   A national campaign led by government and industry is seeking to
close the ``digital divide'' by providing computers to inner city
schools, libraries and community centers.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of women and minorities earning undergraduate
and post-graduate degrees at an all-time high, evidence suggests
that they have begun to make inroads into jobs in marketing, public
relations and other non-technical areas of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the big money still goes to the people with the technical
skills. The starting salaries for computer systems managers at tech
firms in Silicon Valley can be as high as $80,000 a year. The
average annual income for software techies in Seattle is $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wage gap will only get worse. I think the consensus in the
industry is that the talent wars are going to get worse, not
better, and that means salaries are going to continue to
skyrocket,'' said Gary Chapman, head of the 21st Century Project at
LBJ School at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting the imbalance also may be a slow task of overcoming
cultural barriers and rigid attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic leaders fault insular attitudes within their
communities that do not fully value academic success and negatively
stereotype ``nerd'' professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're put down if you're smart, and called a 'Tom' for trying
to get ahead,'' said Bogin.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, those with the skills often
avoid the white dominated high-tech world in favor of careers in
medicine or teaching, which they can practice in their own
communities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the American Association of University Women
found that girls are avoiding high-tech careers not because of math
and science phobia, but because they consider computer-related jobs
to be boring and lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Raegan(CQ) Higgins, 20, another Verizon-United Negro College
Fund scholar, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   A math major from Baton Rouge, La., her summer experience in the
lab confirmed her belief that she would not enjoy a job working
exclusively with computers and software code. Higgins wants to go
on to earn a doctorate and then become a university professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a people person,'' she said. ``It kills me to be
at a computer terminal all day.''

and others like him are the exceptions in the fastest-growing
sector of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The trickling pipeline of science and math majors from American
colleges and universities suggests that the situation will not soon
improve, leaving the specter of a growing wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, without a doubt, a vast untapped talent pool in the
United States among women and minorities, currently
under-represented in engineering and information sciences,'' the
president's Information Technology Advisory Committee said in a
report last year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation called it a ``serious national
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal commission studying the imbalance warned
that America risks losing its competitive edge in the global
marketplace if it fails to provide adequate math and science
education to draw women, African Americans and Hispanics into the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that women _ 51 percent
of the population _ make up only 28 percent of computer
programmers, 26 percent of computer scientists and 9 percent of
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House advisory group noted that African Americans,
Hispanics and Native Americans constitute one-fourth of the total
U.S. work force, but only 6.7 percent of the information and
computer science work force and 5.9 percent of the engineers.
Asian-Americans, who comprise 4 percent of the nation's population,
tend to be over-represented, at least double their proportion to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like the one operating at Verizon (formerly GTE before
its recent merger with Bell Atlantic) are seeking to correct the
imbalance for blacks. At its leafy campus west of Boston, Verizon
each summer offers 20 college students the chance to work side by
side with laboratory researchers brainstorming the company's next
leaps forward in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bogin, a junior at Xavier University in New Orleans, is helping
write new data encryption software for the Palm Pilot handheld
device that would improve e-mail security. He works in the
facility's top-secret lab room and in a simple, cramped office
where he calculates algorithms and writes code.
</P>
<P>
   It is a road that began in fifth grade, when he scored high on
an aptitude test and was able to study at a math and science magnet
school that required him to rise at 4 every morning for a
three-hour bus ride to school.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his father, a baker for Nabisco, and his strict
mother for keeping his nose to the books and out of trouble. Yet he
is not necessarily looking for a pot of gold at the end of the
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in quick and easy money. Growing up in the
inner city, I saw it ruin too many people in my neighborhood who
were attracted to crime by the idea of a Mercedes and nice clothes
and all that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a comfortable living for my family. But if
becoming a millionaire is part of that, I won't turn it down,'' he
added with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame for the lack of diversity?
</P>
<P>
   The industry faults public education for failing to prepare
students for careers in technology. Women and minority groups often
criticize the industry for not doing enough to support education
and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also blamed is the ``geek'' factor: a supposed cultural gulf
between the white and Asian male world of computers and women and
minorities, who feel they are not welcomed and thus do not wish to
be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity problem, a politically charged issue as high-tech
wealth has grown, has prompted 25 tech corporations, including IBM,
America Online, Intel and Sun Microsystems to pledge $250 million
for recruitment and training aimed at bring more women and
minorities into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a high-risk, highly competitive world that rewards
talent, regardless of gender or skin color, said industry
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that people care about are your results,'' said Patricia
Sueltz, president of the software products division at Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high-hurdle mark that is color-blind, whether
you're white, African-American Asian, Hispanic or whatever. The
issue is getting the numbers up in middle schools and high schools
and educating students to the opportunities in math and science
fields,'' said Erik Phelps, who heads education programs for the
Verizon Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   College students continue to shun math and science, despite
national efforts to promote them. And while the number of women and
minorities gaining degrees in technical fields has grown over the
past two decades, it remains small.
</P>
<P>
   The total of U.S. undergraduates earning computer and
information sciences degrees declined from a high of 41,889 in 1986
to just 24,768 in 1997, at a time when demand for them was growing.
Evidence suggests that the Internet boom has spurred more current
students to major in the field, but still far below the level of
industry demand.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology firms currently have about 800,000 job vacancies now
or projected through the end of 2000, according to the Information
Technology Association of America. The industry is seeking approval
from Congress to nearly double the current limit of 115,000 H-1B
visas, which allow technical workers from India, China, Russia and
elsewhere into the United States to take high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Importing talent would not be necessary with a full commitment
by government and high-tech companies to improve public schools and
training opportunities for workers in need for updated skills,
argue minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley, an
organization that represents minority professionals, is lobbying
against the bill in Congress, claiming that there are enough
Americans _ including minorities, women and older workers _ who
could be hired and trained to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs almost to be a national emergency act to improve
the pipeline of engineering and computer science graduates,'' said
Butch Wing, director of the Silicon Valley office of Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a great irony that with high-tech and the New
Economy creating jobs we find ourselves to unprepared, and we're
not doing enough to improve our education system and re-train
workers and make this a priority,'' Wing said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small but positive signs.
</P>
<P>
   A national campaign led by government and industry is seeking to
close the ``digital divide'' by providing computers to inner city
schools, libraries and community centers.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of women and minorities earning undergraduate
and post-graduate degrees at an all-time high, evidence suggests
that they have begun to make inroads into jobs in marketing, public
relations and other non-technical areas of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the big money still goes to the people with the technical
skills. The starting salaries for computer systems managers at tech
firms in Silicon Valley can be as high as $80,000 a year. The
average annual income for software techies in Seattle is $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wage gap will only get worse. I think the consensus in the
industry is that the talent wars are going to get worse, not
better, and that means salaries are going to continue to
skyrocket,'' said Gary Chapman, head of the 21st Century Project at
LBJ School at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting the imbalance also may be a slow task of overcoming
cultural barriers and rigid attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic leaders fault insular attitudes within their
communities that do not fully value academic success and negatively
stereotype ``nerd'' professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're put down if you're smart, and called a 'Tom' for trying
to get ahead,'' said Bogin.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, those with the skills often
avoid the white dominated high-tech world in favor of careers in
medicine or teaching, which they can practice in their own
communities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the American Association of University Women
found that girls are avoiding high-tech careers not because of math
and science phobia, but because they consider computer-related jobs
to be boring and lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Raegan(CQ) Higgins, 20, another Verizon-United Negro College
Fund scholar, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   A math major from Baton Rouge, La., her summer experience in the
lab confirmed her belief that she would not enjoy a job working
exclusively with computers and software code. Higgins wants to go
on to earn a doctorate and then become a university professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a people person,'' she said. ``It kills me to be
at a computer terminal all day.''

`SHADOW HOURS': NIGHT CRAWLERS, BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who can recognize a cliche when he hears one,
Michael Holloway sure takes a long time to wake up, smell the
mercaptan and realize that his newfound pal, Stuart Chapell, is not
the big-time writer he professes to be.
</P>
<P>
   But if Michael did, ``Shadow Hours'' would not be the tedious
descent into cinema hell that it turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, a smug cicerone on Michael's tour of the Los Angeles
netherworld, stands for the proposition that it is an ill windbag
that blows no good. Part Mephistopheles with his black suit,
gleaming black Porsche and pearly white smirk, Stuart is also part
guardian angel, determined to save Michael's soul by showing him
that the path to goodness lies through the dens of iniquity.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has debauchery been such a bore.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that seems to have been budgeted by the watt, Los
Angeles becomes a night town of drugs, alcohol, sex and seedy
premises that quarter everything from orgies and sadomasochism to
bare-knuckle, no-holds-barred fights and, shades of ``The Deer
Hunter,'' Russian roulette played for money.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Isaac Eaton and starring Balthazar
Getty, one of its co-producers, as Michael, and Peter Weller as
Stuart, ``Shadow Hours'' is a sluggish tale of redemption dragged
down on the one hand by Michael's monotonous depression and on the
other by the asinine dialogue furnished Weller.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a murder investigation subplot and all sorts of
sketchily rendered sin, ``Shadow Hours'' remains a film without
dramatic momentum, an involving protagonist or more than a
skittishly voyeuristic and superficial approach to its conflict
between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   When first encountered, the hangdog Michael is trying to recover
from a past of drugs, alcohol and treatment centers. Enrolled in a
group-support program, he has the good fortune to have a loving,
pregnant wife, Chloe (Rebecca Gayheart) and the not-so-good fortune
to have a depressing, low-paying job on the graveyard shift in a
self-service gas station that also peddles sodas and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the drawling, advice-spouting Roland Montague (Brad
Dourif), the premises, besieged occasionally by raving derelicts,
drug-addicted robbers and combative husbands and wives, are also
right across the street from the apartment house where a serial
killer with a habit of twisting his victims' heads 180 degrees has
struck again.
</P>
<P>
   With surroundings like these, little wonder that the weak-willed
Michael is primed to accept the ever-so-friendly Stuart's
invitation to do a bit of night crawling, especially after Stuart
decks him out in a new suit and arranges for him to win a few
thousand dollars at one of those bloody brawls he likes to
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't long before Michael is back to swilling hard liquor,
puffing on a ``magic cigar'' while Stuart fondles a couple of
bare-breasted hookers in a den of evil, snorting cocaine and lying
to poor Chloe, who would dearly and wisely like to move somewhere
up north.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, between the people with the fishhooks in their
faces and the Russian roulette game, not to mention the creeps
around the gas station, Michael is beginning to get a bad case of
the frights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go all the way down or you'll never finish it,''
Stuart has been telling him.
</P>
<P>
   As a cautionary tale, ``Shadow Hours'' may not persuade everyone
to swear off sin, but anyone who buys a ticket to it seems likely
to learn to become more discriminating in choosing movies.
</P>

`IT'S THE RAGE': LINKED, SOONER OR LATER, IN A SEMIAUTOMATIC
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's the Rage'' begins with gunshots as a suburban homeowner
(Jeff Daniels) accidentally shoots an intruder who turns out to be
the business partner he has suspected of cuckolding him. From this
promising film noir beginning, James Stern's debut feature quickly
_ or rather, slowly, since the pacing is that of a long, talky
evening of repertory theater _ becomes an excruciatingly
literal-minded, floridly literary application of Chekhov's dictum
that a gun on the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be
fired by the end.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nine characters whose fates entwine in the manner of
a limping homage to Robert Altman is the victim or the perpetrator
of an act of gun violence, or sometimes both. ``It's the Rage,''
based on a play by Keith Reddin, who also wrote the screenplay,
purports to be a darkly comic look at our national obsession with
firearms, a satire of their seductive power and an expose of the
harm they do. But it's more like a ham-fisted high-concept public
service announcement, directed with stagy deliberateness and
written with tin-eared vernacular speechiness. Guns are bad, kids,
and if you can stay awake, you'll understand why.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the high-mindedness of the project attracted its
impressive cast, one of the densest concentrations of Oscar winners
and nominees ever assembled for a noble bad movie. Some fare better
than others. Joan Allen as a repressed housewife who flees her
husband's murderous jealousy is, as ever, the picture of
understated, suffering poise.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Sinise, as the reclusive computer genius with whom she
takes refuge, is all shtick in Coke-bottle glasses and ratty nerd
clothes. Anna Paquin as some kind of bleached-blond hip-hop
shoplifter is outdone in her pointless emoting only by Giovanni
Ribisi as her hopped-up hoodlum brother, who dresses in vintage Sid
Vicious fashions and looks, at one point, as if he might gnaw
through the chassis of a Lincoln Town Car just to vent his rage.
</P>
<P>
   The television actors do a bit better: David Schwimmer (Ross
from ``Friends'') and Andre Braugher (Pembleton from ``Homicide'')
shake loose their NBC personas in their portrayal of a gay couple
riven by jealousy and undone by the inevitable and implausible
outbreak of gunfire that pulls the movie to its conclusion. ``It's
the Rage'' does offer the dubious pleasure of watching superb
actors read terrible lines with evident conviction and impersonate
characters untethered to any known human reality. This wouldn't be
fatal if the film didn't festoon its literary posturing and its
contrived ``Columbo''-style narrative with the trappings of
political relevance. At the end, a Cheryl Wheeler song announces
that ``if it were up to me, I'd take away the guns.'' A fine
sentiment, but one that comes almost two hours too late.

   Al Gore and his vanquished rival, Bill Bradley, buried the
hatchet and campaigned together today for the first time since the
Democratic presidential fight ended. With Gore at his side in Green
Bay, Wis., Bradley said: ``Today I want to make it clear that I
endorse Al Gore for president of the United States.'' Bradley said
that ``winning is a team sport'' and Democrats need the strength of
unity. In turn, Gore called Bradley a leader ``who brought high
purpose and high ideals to our contest.'' It was Bradley's first
campaign appearance since he conceded to Gore after Super Tuesday,
March 7.

<P>
   A NEW MISSION FOR VETERANS
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Veterans of Foreign Wars Pennsylvania State
Convention in Pittsburgh, George W. Bush unveiled a $75 million
program today offering U.S. military veterans ``a new mission'' as
mentors and role models for the nation's youth. Pushing his
``compassionate conservative'' message ahead of the convention that
begins July 31, Bush's five-year proposal would provide matching
grants to organizations that connect veterans and retired military
personnel with young people through mentoring, tutoring,
after-school and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ME, MYSELF, AND ONLY TWO OTHERS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today he's winnowed his list of possible
vice presidential candidates, and he quickly added that only his
wife, Laura, and the man in charge of the search, Dick Cheney, also
know who remains in the running. With speculation rising about his
pick in the run-up to the convention, Bush said there has been
``serious vetting'' of medical, legal and financial records of the
contenders. He indicated he doesn't intend to invite candidates for
publicly disclosed meetings, saying, ``I know everybody pretty darn
well.''
</P>
<P>
   JUST A SLIP OF THE TONGUE?
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on MSNBC, Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer was
discussing the relationship between George W. Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain since their meeting in Pittsburgh in May. Fleischer, on
McCain's role at the convention: ``The governor and the senator
have been in frequent touch on the telephone talking about various
issues, particularly saving Social Security. So we're working
shoulder to shoulder, and the vice president, of course, is going
to be featured prominently at the Republican convention in a prime
time speaking role.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SOLIDLY BEHIND CAMP DAVID TALKS
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Camp David peace talks, one of
George W. Bush's foreign policy advisers counseled Israeli
officials to accept only a comprehensive peace agreement and to
resist any efforts by the Clinton administration to use the summit
meeting in the presidential campaign. Those comments by Richard
Perle caused Bush to distance himself from those views. Bush said
Perle had been ``speaking for himself'' and not the Bush campaign.
``I wish the administration all the best when it comes to bringing
peace to the Middle East,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-SHRILLARY
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican Party chairman has sent out a fund-raising
letter branding Hillary Clinton ``cold-blooded and hotheaded'' and
a ``shrill and scheming person'' who is trying to ``lie her way
into high office.'' In the letter, obtained today by the Associated
Press, William Powers also rips the first lady as ``abrasive and
annoying, brash and bitter, calculating and scheming, distant and
deceitful, polarizing and power-hungry.'' Clinton spokesman Howard
Wolfson said ``these kind of personal attacks have no place in
politics'' and called on Clinton's Senate opponent, Rick Lazio, to
disavow the letter. Lazio's campaign said, though, that Powers has
a right to express his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   PART OF THE SOLUTION OR PROBLEM?
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, irked by Al Gore's complaints about a
``do-nothing'' Congress, had some advice for him: Quit campaigning,
come back to Washington and roll up your sleeves. ``Before he can
criticize us ... he ought to be willing to pitch in and help,''
said Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), George W. Bush's point man in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS TIME FOR A FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee plans to cap its convention
next month by raising $2 million for its candidates. All of the
money raised will go for advertising and other vote-getting
activities for Democratic candidates all down the line. As a
result, contributions are limited to a maximum of $20,000 from
individuals and $15,000 from political action committees. No
corporate or union donations _ the unregulated sums known as ``soft
money'' _ will be accepted. The event is set for the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles on Aug. 17, right after Gore delivers his
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   WIRED UP IN PHILLY
</P>
<P>
   The electricians' union local in Philadelphia is in a dispute
with TV networks over wiring for the Republican convention, and the
mayor has stepped in to try to resolve the problem. The
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98 is
questioning why the major networks are not using local union
laborers for their telecommunications work. At least one network
says it has the right to use its own employees. The union has met
with Mayor John Street several times, and Street in turn has met
with network officials. The sides have yet to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   JIG'S UP FOR 527S
</P>
<P>
   Political groups that until now have enjoyed the anonymity and
secrecy of Section 527 of the tax code will have to file disclosure
forms with the IRS by July 31. Moving quickly to implement a law
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on July 1, the
IRS sent word to the 527s that they must disclose their officers,
address and other identifying information, along with donor names,
size of donations and expenditures. Until now, 527s have not been
required to divulge even their addresses or phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTHOOD AND POLITICAL PLANNING
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood plans $2.5 million in TV ads spotlighting
George W. Bush's anti-abortion views, hoping to reach independent
and Republican women who support abortion rights. The group's
research suggests a sizable number of women respect Planned
Parenthood, but are leaning toward Bush. ``We're focusing on those
`compassionate conservative' Republican and independenrsal health
care coverage, a policy goal more popular with liberal Democrats
than conservative Republicans and even more sweeping and costly
than the plan proposed by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TO BURN
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic Senate campaign committees are
both showing big bank balances. The Democratic group said it had
$27 million in the bank on June 30 after having raised $49 million
since January 1999. The Republican counterpart reported $21 million
cash on hand at the end of June, having raised $55.7 million in
this election cycle. Both said they had more cash on hand at this
point in the election calendar than they ever had in previous
elections.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR KIND OF GUY NO LONGER
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, Democrats and other liberals have
reveled in Ralph Nader's success as a corporate scourge, an
all-round common scold of Big Business. But they're chortling no
longer. For Nader now has a new pack of scoundrels: Al Gore and the
Democratic Party. Gore, who rarely takes any position that might
offend anyone, would seem ill-cast as a villain. But in Nader's
view, the vice president is tainted by his association with the
pro-business, pro-globalism policies of the Clinton administration.
So Nader, as the nominee of the Green Party, is set on sending Gore
off into the political sunset.

   SHIPSHAPE AT OLD NAVY QUARTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's a defense contractor's dream: dozens of influential members
of Congress lodging for a week in old Navy barracks just a few
yards from where the companies do their work. This dream will
become reality at the Republican convention in a couple of weeks
courtesy of Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) The House Armed Services
subcommittee chairman arranged for his colleagues to stay in
kitchen-equipped quarters at the converted Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard. There's no pool, golf course, restaurant or bellhop, but
it's the closest digs to the convention hall: less than a mile.
Some hotels where delegations are staying are as far as 30 miles
away.

   MCCAIN GOING BACK ON THE BUS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain , the unsuccessful presidential hopeful, will be
revving up his Straight Talk Express this fall _ for House
Republican congressional candidates in at least half a dozen swing
states. McCain and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking
House Republican, are planning to team up after the convention to
go on the road in several states, including Ohio, California,
Florida, New York, Illinois and Michigan. The campaign seeks to
exploit the appeal of McCain and Watts, the only Republican
African-African in Congress, with independents and other swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   THE UPCOMING GENERATION
</P>
<P>
   As Al Gore and George W. Bush continue to kick up dust on the
campaign trail, their younger surrogates also are getting busy.
Earlier this week, George P. Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
kicked off a tour on his uncle's behalf that will bring him to 20
college campuses before the Republican convention in Philadelphia.
On Friday, Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Schiff, will speak to
the College Democrats of America Convention in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T BEAT 'EM, SUE 'EM
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate John Hagelin, the transcendentalist
meditating alternative to Pat Buchanan, threatened lawsuits against
the Buchanan campaign unless it releases its petition-signer list
to the Hagelin campaign. The list, which Buchanan submitted to the
national Reform Party, was used to determine who received ballots
in the party's primary, which is currently under way.

   There is nothing more refreshing than a chilled soup on a hot
summer day. And when the soup seems rich and satisfying but is not
calorific it offers a double bonus because it fills you up without
fattening you up. Soup, salad and really good country bread are all
that you need for a summer supper.
</P>
<P>
   The soup recipes here have another great feature: one requires
no cooking at all, another barely any cooking and even in the one
where some cooking is necessary it is only a matter of about 10
minutes. It will hardly heat up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are quite simple and easy to put together, but
everything depends on the quality and flavor of the ingredients. If
the corn is not sweet, if the tomatoes are not deeply red and very
ripe, and if the basil is not crisply fresh you will still have a
soup, but it will not provide you with the essence of summer. This
season is far too short for anything but the very best.
</P>
<P>
   The colors of the corn and basil soup and the corn and pepper
soup are particularly alluring. The tomato basil soup is not as
handsome but the flavors make up for what it lacks in beauty.
</P>
<P>
   You can make any of these soups thicker or thinner by adjusting
the amount of kefir or buttermilk that you use. If you have never
used kefir before think of it as a thinner version of yogurt.

 &HT;    BRADLEY MEETS, VOWS TO CAMPAIGN FOR GORE
 &HT;    Duplication alert: Moving in the (w) Washington and (p)
Political categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After staying silent for months, former
basketball great Bill Bradley became a cheerleader for Vice
President Al Gore Thursday as the former rivals for the Democratic
presidential nomination united here in a two-on-one break against
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With a noticeably tanned Bradley at his side, Gore reacted to
news accounts of a potential budget shortfall in Texas with the
suggestion that federal tax cuts proposed by Bush could undermine
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Governor Bush wants to do for America what he's done for
Texas: go to Washington and spend our surplus and then more for
budget-busting tax cuts _ and then hope that somehow it will all
add up,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was responding to statements this week by Texas Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry that higher-than-expected costs in existing programs
would eat into the state's surplus. The rising costs mean the state
will be able to carry over just $540 million into the next budget _
less than 10 percent of what it rolled over from the 1998-99
budget. Critics immediately began pointing fingers at Bush, blaming
the $1.7 billion in tax cuts the governor helped push through the
Legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign reacted with the release of a statement from
Rob Junell, the Democratic chairman of the Texas House
Appropriations Committee, calling Gore's attack ``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is dead wrong to claim there is a budget shortfall in
Texas,'' Junell said. ``The current $1 billion surplus in the state
treasury easily meets these routine and unforeseen expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ended a five-month absence from the presidential
campaign with a formal endorsement of Gore that was less than
glowing but included a vow to work this fall for the election of a
Democratic president and a Democratic majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the only Democrat to challenge Gore for the party's
nomination this year, largely ignored his political differences
with the vice president in their first joint appearance since a
March 1 debate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is a place of many different voices, but
we all share the same values,'' Bradley declared to a sun-drenched
crowd of nearly 1,000 supporters at a waterside amusement park.
``It's why we're Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore would do more to tackle child poverty, racial
discord, inequalities in health care, education and employment, and
``a political process dangerously awash in money.'' Compared to
Bush, ``it's not even close,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, after accepting an NBA-style high-five handshake from his
vanquished foe, praised the former New York Knicks star and
basketball Hall of Famer for bringing ``high purpose and high
ideals'' to their often bitter contest.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot 5-inch Bradley sitting on a stool beside him,
Gore repeatedly quoted from speeches Bradley made in their campaign
against each other as he vowed to make Bradley's causes his own in
his challenge of Bush this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to make public amends for some of his
bare-knuckled assaults on Bradley during the primaries, Gore
emphasized that Bradley ``is a good Democrat who speaks and stands
for the principles we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Gore had suggested that Bradley quit the
Senate in 1996 rather than ``stay and fight'' the new Newt
Gingrich-led Republican congressional majority with President
Clinton and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mid-day reunion of the two Democratic rivals, the
Republican National Committee (RNC) distributed 17 pages of quotes
of Bradley criticizing Gore during the Democratic presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   They included a remark Bradley made to Gore during a debate in
New Hampshire after weeks of not responded to what he considered
misrepresentations of his health care proposals: ``Why should we
believe that you will tell the truth as president, if you don't
tell the truth as a candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen hecklers made the same point during Gore's remarks
Thursday. Holding up a photograph of Gore at the Buddhist temple
that is at the center of a controversy over the Clinton-Gore
fundraising in 1996, the hecklers chanted: ``Liar, liar, liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's event helped heal a rift in the Democratic
Party, it was far from clear what effect Bradley's endorsement
would have on the Gore campaign since Bradley did not carry a
single state in the Democratic primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Hauser, the chief spokesman for the Bradley campaign,
offered one explanation: Bradley, like Sen. John McCain in the
Republican primary, attracted new and independent voters to the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are going to be valuable in this election,'' Hauser
added.
</P>
<P>
   ---STORY COULD TRIM HERE---
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has won 300 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, which will be held in Los Angeles next month. But he
has yet to release those delegates to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley met privately for about 40 minutes before
taking the stage at Bay Beach Park. They have spoken only twice by
telephone since Bradley suspended his campaign in March, according
to Gore campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The park was one of the sites Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in
1934 to promote his ``New Deal'' economic program.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt connection provided Gore the opportunity to
compare his economic priorities to Bush's. And the Green Bay
setting allowed both Gore and Bradley to quote the legendary Green
Bay Packer football coach, Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his economic priorities are ``the same priorities that
brought us today's prosperity: balance the budget, pay down our
debt and invest in the best enterprise of all _ the American people
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's top economic priority is tax cuts, adding, ``The
last thing this country needs is an era of Bush economics that
brings us back to deficits, high interest rates, high unemployment,
recession and the bad times of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, noting his presence in Green Bay, said, ``What Vince
Lombardi said is true. `Winning is a team sport!' Our party is
strongest when we're unified, when we speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was reminded of other words from Lombardi: ``People
who work together win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he endorsed Gore, on Thursday, Bradley reflected a
lingering disappointment over his loss to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 15 months I ran for President of the United States,'' he
said. ``I'm honored and grateful to those people across America who
supported me. I had a remarkable experience. Though someone once
told me, when one uses the term `experience' in this context,
`experience' is what you get when you don't get what you really
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the appearance in Green Bay, the two men went their
separate ways _ Gore to a town hall meeting with undecided voters
in Saginaw, Mich., Bradley to an undisclosed location where he is
writing a book, which is set to be published this fall.

   For years, polystyrene foam has been keeping our coffee hot and
our beer cold. Now chemists have taught single molecules of this
plastic a more impressive trick _ how to snatch and store energy
from light in the way that plants do.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, based as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico, are aiming to build a new breed of cheap
polystyrene-based batteries. They say the batteries could be used
to provide power for anything from cars to cellphones.
</P>
<P>
   The project is part of continuing efforts by Tom Meyer and his
colleagues at Los Alamos to find simple materials that can mimic
the complex chemistry of photosynthesis, which allows plants to
store energy from sunlight in chemical bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of a photon-a
particle of light-by an antenna composed of the green pigment
chlorophyll. This energy is then used to propel electrons around
the chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction,
ultimately stripping electrons from water to make oxygen, and
adding them to carbon dioxide to create energy-rich sugars.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's team had already managed to recreate each of these steps
separately, using different synthetic molecules that work in
conjunction with an atom of the metal ruthenium. In his latest
experiments, he decided to link these molecules on a polymer
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because polystyrene polymers are so widely used, their
chemistry is very well understood,'' he says. ``So it was an
obvious choice for the backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   To test out the new molecule, the researchers zapped a solution
of it with a laser. As they had hoped, some side chains containing
the ruthenium antennas were able to absorb the light energy and
pass it along the polymer chain. When the energy reached another
type of ruthenium complex, it was able to do some chemical work,
pushing an electron to a different part of the complex. Mobilizing
electrons in this way is what batteries do-supplying electrons from
an anode that can be drawn around a circuit and back towards its
cathode.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wasielewski, a photosynthetic chemist at Northwestern
University in Chicago, thinks Meyer's choice of polymer was the
key.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the right properties are there,'' he says. ``And we
already have robust manufacturing technology to work with
polystyrene. It's a nice piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Because polystyrene derivatives are inexpensive to create, Meyer
thinks his polymer holds great promise for a wide array of devices
_ such as solar-powered fuel cells that pull electrons from water
to create hydrogen fuel or to generate an electric current.
</P>
<P>
   For now, his team's main aim is to increase the efficiency with
which the molecules convert energy, which is now hovering around 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hard work ahead, but you have to expect
that,'' he says. ``After all, it took natural photosynthesis more
than a billion years to evolve.'' &QL;

   Forget buying shares in ailing dotcoms. You will soon be able to
earn money without lifting a finger _ just by leaving your PC
switched on overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of companies is set to pay computer users for their
machines' spare time. All you need is an Internet connection. And
you might help make a medical or scientific breakthrough into the
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based companies Parabon, Distributed Science and United
Devices plan to divide up corporate computing tasks and farm them
out to tens of thousands of PC owners via the Internet. To join
their efforts, you just download some software, connect to the Net
occasionally and wait to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   How much you'll get paid for doing nothing is still under wraps.
Steve Armentrout, founder of Parabon, says he will be announcing
pay scales in the autumn. Individuals will be paid for their
computers' work, which will be calculated in megahertz-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate an average PC will earn at least $10 a month,''
says Jim Albea, chief operations officer for Distributed Science.
</P>
<P>
   United Devices, based in Austin, Texas, was founded by David
Anderson, the computer scientist who launched the SETIhome project.
SETIhome amassed 300,000 years of computer time during its first
year _ so it's no surprise that Anderson believes there's money in
idle processors.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed Science, based in Huntsville, Ala., plans to run
massively parallel programs over the Internet to model protein
folding, test integrated circuit designs, run fluid dynamics
studies and render 3D graphics in a fraction of the time possible
using a single supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our distributed networks have twice the computer
power of IBM's latest supercomputer, ASCI White,'' Albea says.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed Science claims over 39,000 individuals, with 77,000
computers, have signed up so far. On average, 300 individuals
register 500 more computers each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are dragging old PCs out of the cupboard to get
connected to the project,'' Albea says.
</P>
<P>
   The systems work in a similar way to the SETIhome screen saver.
Big programs will be chopped up into thousands of small, manageable
units that are then farmed out to subscribers. The program only
kicks in when the computer is left idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike SETIhome we are not restricted to a single project,''
Albea explains. ``Our networks can be applied to any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed Science has guarded against hackers by using 128-bit
encryption on all communications. Armentrout claims Parabon's
systems are also secure. But not everyone is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if a pharmaceuticals company would farm
out its data processing,'' says Matthew Woodwark, head of
bioinformatics for AstraZeneca U.K., which models protein folding
for drug development. ``We'd love to use the Internet in this way,
but we can't run the risk of our data being copied. But we are
considering running distributed solutions internally to increase
computer power.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the private sector shares data around domestic PCs,
government-funded scientists in Britain are working on distributed
networks of supercomputers. The High-End Computing (HEC) initiative
is developing a network of supercomputers called The Grid. It will
connect monster machines in Edinburgh, Manchester and Daresbury,
Cheshire, to give researchers undreamed-of number-crunching power.
The Grid will later go international. &QL;

   The skeletons within living cells may not form properly in zero
gravity, say researchers in France. This could dent human ambitions
to live in space _ at least without artificial gravity. Their work
also proves that, contrary to received wisdom, gravity can
influence chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Most cells have cytoskeletons of microtubules, which are fibers
made of the protein tubulin. James Tabony and his colleagues at the
French Atomic Energy Commission lab in Grenoble found that when
cold solutions of mammalian tubulin and the energy _ releasing
compound GTP are warmed to body temperature for six minutes,
microtubules form in distinct bands.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that the bands form at right angles to
gravity or, if spun, to the centrifugal force. To prove gravity is
responsible, the team sent up tubulin on a European Space Agency
(ESA) rocket, which exposed its payload to 13 minutes of
weightlessness. Some tubulin experienced only microgravity while
being warmed for the critical six minutes, but other samples were
spun in a centrifuge. The spinning microtubules formed bands as
usual, but those that experienced only microgravity pointed in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows gravity triggers the pattern,'' Tabony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicists insisted this research worth doing, because gravity
is too small, compared to electrostatic or thermal forces on
molecules, to affect chemical reactions,'' says Didier Schmitt,
head of life sciences at ESA's European Space Technology and
Research Center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. ``This proves they
were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Work by Marian Lewis of the University of Alabama at Huntsville
suggests that gravity may also help orient microtubules inside
living cells. She has flown human white blood cells on board the
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, the microtubules form long, straight fibers
radiating towards the cell membrane,'' Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   But after a day in orbit, the microtubules were going in random
directions, Lewis says. However, it is not yet clear whether
microgravity or the vibrations during takeoff are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The findings might explain some of the health problems people
living in space have, such as depressed immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a long time, or for generations,'' Tabony says, ``I
suspect we wouldn't do well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabony says the formation of the microtubule bands is also the
first experimental model of biological self-organization, in which
chemical reactions spontaneously generate patterns in response to
tiny asymmetries in the environment. This was predicted by Alan
Turing in the early 1950s, and later by biophysicist Ilya
Prigogine, a Nobel prizewinner. &QL;

   Life may have begun not in the sea but in tiny water droplets
drifting high in the sky. Thrown up by ocean waves, these droplets
could have provided the conditions needed for complex molecules to
form.
</P>
<P>
   This radical theory, proposed by an international team of
researchers at the Royal Meteorological Society's millennium
conference in Cambridge this week, could explain long-standing
mysteries about the origin of life, such as how cells got their
membranes and how simple organic molecules became concentrated
enough to join together to form large, complex ones.
</P>
<P>
   The theory arose when Adrian Tuck of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., noticed the work of
Daniel Murphy, also of NOAA. Murphy had discovered that instead of
being just seawater, up to half the material in the droplets in
today's atmosphere is organic matter.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck and his colleagues Veronica Vaida and Barney Ellison of the
University of Colorado realized that the droplets, or aerosol
particles, contain so much organic material because they pick up a
lipid coating from the film of oily molecules on the surface of the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like protocells, with a layer of organic material on
the outside,'' Tuck says.
</P>
<P>
   While the droplets are floating in the upper atmosphere, they
often fuse with other particles, which might contain substances
such as iron and nickel derived from meteorites burning up in the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aerosols in the stratosphere can last up to a year,'' Murphy
says. ``They have lots of time to pick up different things.''
</P>
<P>
   As the water in the droplets evaporates, the diverse substances
within them become concentrated. This, combined with the energy
provided by the strong sunlight, encourages chemical reactions.
That could explain how the simple organic molecules on the
primordial Earth came to form complex chemicals such as DNA and
proteins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't really any question that the building blocks would
be there,'' says Chris Dobson of Oxford University, a protein
chemist and another member of the team. ``The question is how
polymerisation came about.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, when the droplets eventually fall back into the
ocean, they can acquire another coating, ending up with a lipid
bilayer just like the membrane around all living cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``On re-entry, the aerosol with its monolayer of surfactants
comes down to another part of the ocean and picks up a second layer
that would be different,'' Tuck says. ``This is a characteristic of
bacteria that has been hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The droplets are also the same size as bacterial cells, as only
particles between 0.1 and 5 micrometers across make it to the upper
atmosphere. If they are any smaller they fuse together, while any
larger and they fall back to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is ``startling and fertile,'' says Michael Russell of
the Scottish Universities Research and Reactor Center in Glasgow.
But he still has reservations. ``They have something that looks
like a cell,'' he says. ``But it could be a coincidence.'' He also
points out that the organic material in today's aerosols comes from
dead organisms. ``Before life emerged, would these organics have
been around in the ocean?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuck, however, suggests that the organic molecules in the primal
sea could have become gradually more concentrated over tens of
millions of years. He envisages building huge simulators to see
what really happens inside the droplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely imaginative and innovative work,'' says
biochemist Tom Cech, head of the Howard Hughes Institute in
Maryland, although he points out that we can never know for certain
how life began.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other way to test the theory. The size of aerosol
particles depends on gravity and atmospheric pressure, so it's
possible to calculate how big they'd be on other planets. Tuck has
already worked out that aerosol particles on Mars would be smaller
than those on Earth. In fact, he says, they are more the size of
the bacterium-like structures found in the Martian meteorite
ALH84001. But he's careful not to suggest that this means the
structures are signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it's a nice coincidence,'' Tuck says. &QL;

 &HT;    BRADLEY MEETS, VOWS TO CAMPAIGN FOR GORE
 &HT;    Duplication alert: Moving in the (w) Washington and (p)
Political categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After staying silent for months, former
basketball great Bill Bradley became a cheerleader for Vice
President Al Gore Thursday as the former rivals for the Democratic
presidential nomination united here in a two-on-one break against
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With a noticeably tanned Bradley at his side, Gore reacted to
news accounts of a potential budget shortfall in Texas with the
suggestion that federal tax cuts proposed by Bush could undermine
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Governor Bush wants to do for America what he's done for
Texas: go to Washington and spend our surplus and then more for
budget-busting tax cuts _ and then hope that somehow it will all
add up,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was responding to statements this week by Texas Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry that higher-than-expected costs in existing programs
would eat into the state's surplus. The rising costs mean the state
will be able to carry over just $540 million into the next budget _
less than 10 percent of what it rolled over from the 1998-99
budget. Critics immediately began pointing fingers at Bush, blaming
the $1.7 billion in tax cuts the governor helped push through the
Legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign reacted with the release of a statement from
Rob Junell, the Democratic chairman of the Texas House
Appropriations Committee, calling Gore's attack ``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is dead wrong to claim there is a budget shortfall in
Texas,'' Junell said. ``The current $1 billion surplus in the state
treasury easily meets these routine and unforeseen expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ended a five-month absence from the presidential
campaign with a formal endorsement of Gore that was less than
glowing but included a vow to work this fall for the election of a
Democratic president and a Democratic majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the only Democrat to challenge Gore for the party's
nomination this year, largely ignored his political differences
with the vice president in their first joint appearance since a
March 1 debate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is a place of many different voices, but
we all share the same values,'' Bradley declared to a sun-drenched
crowd of nearly 1,000 supporters at a waterside amusement park.
``It's why we're Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore would do more to tackle child poverty, racial
discord, inequalities in health care, education and employment, and
``a political process dangerously awash in money.'' Compared to
Bush, ``it's not even close,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, after accepting an NBA-style high-five handshake from his
vanquished foe, praised the former New York Knicks star and
basketball Hall of Famer for bringing ``high purpose and high
ideals'' to their often bitter contest.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot 5-inch Bradley sitting on a stool beside him,
Gore repeatedly quoted from speeches Bradley made in their campaign
against each other as he vowed to make Bradley's causes his own in
his challenge of Bush this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to make public amends for some of his
bare-knuckled assaults on Bradley during the primaries, Gore
emphasized that Bradley ``is a good Democrat who speaks and stands
for the principles we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Gore had suggested that Bradley quit the
Senate in 1996 rather than ``stay and fight'' the new Newt
Gingrich-led Republican congressional majority with President
Clinton and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mid-day reunion of the two Democratic rivals, the
Republican National Committee (RNC) distributed 17 pages of quotes
of Bradley criticizing Gore during the Democratic presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   They included a remark Bradley made to Gore during a debate in
New Hampshire after weeks of not responded to what he considered
misrepresentations of his health care proposals: ``Why should we
believe that you will tell the truth as president, if you don't
tell the truth as a candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen hecklers made the same point during Gore's remarks
Thursday. Holding up a photograph of Gore at the Buddhist temple
that is at the center of a controversy over the Clinton-Gore
fundraising in 1996, the hecklers chanted: ``Liar, liar, liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's event helped heal a rift in the Democratic
Party, it was far from clear what effect Bradley's endorsement
would have on the Gore campaign since Bradley did not carry a
single state in the Democratic primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Hauser, the chief spokesman for the Bradley campaign,
offered one explanation: Bradley, like Sen. John McCain in the
Republican primary, attracted new and independent voters to the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are going to be valuable in this election,'' Hauser
added.
</P>
<P>
   ---STORY COULD TRIM HERE---
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has won 300 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, which will be held in Los Angeles next month. But he
has yet to release those delegates to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley met privately for about 40 minutes before
taking the stage at Bay Beach Park. They have spoken only twice by
telephone since Bradley suspended his campaign in March, according
to Gore campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The park was one of the sites Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in
1934 to promote his ``New Deal'' economic program.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt connection provided Gore the opportunity to
compare his economic priorities to Bush's. And the Green Bay
setting allowed both Gore and Bradley to quote the legendary Green
Bay Packer football coach, Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his economic priorities are ``the same priorities that
brought us today's prosperity: balance the budget, pay down our
debt and invest in the best enterprise of all _ the American people
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's top economic priority is tax cuts, adding, ``The
last thing this country needs is an era of Bush economics that
brings us back to deficits, high interest rates, high unemployment,
recession and the bad times of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, noting his presence in Green Bay, said, ``What Vince
Lombardi said is true. `Winning is a team sport!' Our party is
strongest when we're unified, when we speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was reminded of other words from Lombardi: ``People
who work together win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he endorsed Gore, on Thursday, Bradley reflected a
lingering disappointment over his loss to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 15 months I ran for President of the United States,'' he
said. ``I'm honored and grateful to those people across America who
supported me. I had a remarkable experience. Though someone once
told me, when one uses the term `experience' in this context,
`experience' is what you get when you don't get what you really
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the appearance in Green Bay, the two men went their
separate ways _ Gore to a town hall meeting with undecided voters
in Saginaw, Mich., Bradley to an undisclosed location where he is
writing a book, which is set to be published this fall.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans unhappy about their state being the
target of political broadsides by the Gore presidential campaign
have formed an organization to counter the attacks on health care,
education and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Proud of Texas Committee described itself in a letter to
Vice President Al Gore as a group of independents and Democrats who
plan to speak out when incorrect or misleading information about
the Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential hopeful, has
criticized Texas' record under Republican Gov. George W. Bush's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members of the Proud of Texas Committee are disturbed by
the extent to which the Gore campaign appears to be willing to
distort the facts about our state in order to discredit Governor
Bush,'' says the letter signed by Texas Monthly publisher Michael
R. Levy and other members of the group, including some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the campaign is not casting
aspersions on Texas but ``pointing out the facts about Bush's
record in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Proud of Texas Committee disputed criticism that it said
Gore has directed at Texas education, health care and criminal
justice, using other sources to defend the state's record in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call these inaccuracies to your attention not as your
rivals, but as concerned citizens who demand truth in
campaigning,'' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you have written off our state electorally, but don't
treat us like second-rate citizens,'' it states. ``There are 20
million people in Texas who also are Americans and who take great
pride in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Others whose signatures appear on the letter are State Board of
Education member Will Davis, an Austin lawyer who was chairman of
the state Democratic Party in the 1960s; Mark Stiles, a businessman
and former Democratic lawmaker from Beaumont; Dr. David Smith,
president of the Texas Tech University Health Science Center and
former state health commissioner; and Dan Pearson, former executive
director of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The group also sent a letter to Bush informing him of the
formation of the committee. The groups leaders said they intend to
disband the committee after the November election. Both letters
said the group does not give or take orders from any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's trying to insult Texas, but point out the reality of
Bush's record as compared to the rhetoric that comes out of the
campaign,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``The fact is under Bush, Texas has become
one of the most polluted states in the country. That's not an
aspersion on the people of Texas. It's a blight on Bush's record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has defended the governor's record on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In answering criticism by Gore on the campaign trail, the Bush
campaign has been known to cite statistics about the United States
under the current administration's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gore was reported as saying that under Bush,
Texas has become first in the nation for the number of people
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told the Associated Press that
since Gore was elected, there are millions more Americans without
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, of the Proud of Texas Committee, said the concern is over
facts that ``sometimes get bent or broken in reporting on a state
as large and varied as Texas. We want to keep the information that
is disseminated about our state honest from now until the end of
the campaign.''

`NAME OF THE WORLD': CIRCLES AND RECTANGLES OF GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a yellowed globe and an antique telescope in the
living room of Ted MacKey, the chairman of the music department at
a Midwestern college. They are elements of a mellow scholarly decor
in which the guests sip hot buttered rum by a blazing log fire. It
is Currier &AMP; Ives does academe, or, as Michael, an adjunct
professor and the shattered narrator, remarks in ``The Name of the
World,'' ``a very expensive gift shop.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fine, acid phrase. The decor comes in more suggestively
in Michael's comment about some of his older colleagues regularly
dusting off ``the lectures they'd been dragging out ... since the
days when Ted MacKey's big beige globe had known what it was
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denis Johnson's fiction, the world no longer knows what it is
talking about, and its denizens' heads are filled with babble. It
and they are fragmented, though the fragmentation varies from book
to book. It is an outright post-apocalyptic vision in
``Fiskadoro,'' his finest work. Fragmentation is intricate social
and personal disarray in the charming if doleful picaresque of
``Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,'' underrated when it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Angels'' and ``Jesus' Son,'' it is young Americans drugging
and drifting; in the much weaker ``Stars at Noon,'' young
drugs-and-drifts meet a chilling, CIA-backed repression in Central
America. In ``Already Dead,'' declaredly gothic, the writing itself
is fragmented, as if the writer had been abducted and blown up,
with shards of character, vision, pith and coherence drifting down
together.
</P>
<P>
   The novella-length ``Name of the World'' is also shards, though
better ones, and for a while they hold a promise of reassembling,
until the author relinquishes them in a swirl of visionary cloud.
The writing gives way to poetic curdle.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmenting event is specific, and mournfully promising: two
deaths. Michael, a onetime high school teacher who became the aide
to a senator from his state, had spent a dozen years as a
Washington insider. (This occupies a page or two; it is a bit of
glib telescoping, like affixing a mask stamped ``King,'' but it is
nothing compared to the arbitrary sped-up dizziness at the end.)
Michael loses his wife and daughter in a car crash for which he
blames himself. He loses himself, as well; his protracted mourning
and disorientation play out in the refuge his connections obtain
for him: a temporary, year-by-year contract to conduct a vague
seminar in history. It is, he admits, a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson creates a few sharp academic scenes. At a dinner party,
a visiting novelist puts down a brash young instructor who
complains that his characters are ``morally uninstructive.'' The
sardonically (perhaps self-mockingly) deconstructive retort: ``Do
you really hope to get your moral lessons from people who don't
exist?''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, Michael attends a faculty party, only to learn
it is to bid him farewell. As someone who hates confrontation, his
department head had neglected to tell him his contract would not be
renewed. Michael recalls confrontation-happy Washington. A campaign
manager calls in an aide. ``Do you want to know how a loser
stinks?'' she asks. ``Put your nose in your armpit. Then empty your
desk.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Johnson scants external circumstances in
favor of internal states of spirit. Incidents and characters get a
dab of treatment, sometimes quite promising, and are relinquished.
The narration is a series of chronological twitches, as if trying
to shake itself off. In ``Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,'' Lenny,
the protagonist, was vividly present, even as the world revolved
cloudily in eccentric orbit around him. Here Michael is sucked into
the orbit; we see him only erratically.
</P>
<P>
   What we do see, though, and it is the strongest part of the
book, is his grief. Johnson renders it with two images. One is the
round campus pond, frozen in winter, where skaters circle
endlessly. Watching them, Michael's obsessive circling of his own
tragedy plays out.
</P>
<P>
   The image is replaced by a stronger one. He sees a drawing by an
amateur painter: a series of concentric rectangles. The innermost
is imperfect, the second imperfectly reproduces the imperfection,
the third magnifies the mistakes of the first two and so on, until
the outer figure is a grotesque distortion of the original.
</P>
<P>
   It is a metaphor, beautifully conceived, for the falsity of
excessively protracted mourning. The beginning of Michael's
deliverance comes in a phrase: he is ``less the man who'd lost his
family, and more just somebody who didn't happen to have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The deliverance buries the book. Deliverance starts with an art
student who calls herself Flower. Michael sees her in a performance
piece, shaving her pudendum. He meets her when she is serving at a
cocktail party, and she recognizes him. He sees her winning a
striptease contest in a bar. It is not the nudity, mainly, that
arouses him, nor is the arousing mainly physical. Johnson conveys
the witchery of sexual attraction and transforms it into the
life-restoring inklings of love.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. But then Flower performs a bewildering series of
transformations. Michael meets her at a Mennonite-style church
service, goes to the deserted schoolhouse where she lives, is led
through various rituals that seem to summon up the ghost of his
dead daughter. He begins to make love to her, then breaks off,
flees and never sees her again. It is all arbitrary and gestural, a
necromancy that is incantation and very little magic.
</P>
<P>
   Michael goes to Alaska, to Greece (a couple of paragraphs for
each), becomes a free-lance journalist, covers the Persian Gulf
War. The writing gets wilder and emptier:
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain a student of history, more of one than ever, now that
our century has torn its way out of its chrysalis and become too
beautiful to be examined, too alive to be debated and exploited by
played-out intellectuals. The important thing is no longer to
predict in what way its grand convulsions might next shake us. Now
the important thing is to ride it into the sky.'' Sky-riding is
announced, but ``The Name of the World'' fails to provide a
serviceable horse of any kind, let alone winged.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Holy blockbuster! Hollywood finally got one
right. With the faltering ``Batman ``and ``Superman `` franchises
grounded, at least temporarily, Marvel's top-selling ``X-Men'' saga
is the comics world's only hope for big-screen salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1963, the Stan Lee-created comic-book series centers
around a team of mutant superheroes. The ``X-Men'' universe has
since expanded to include more than 200 characters and as many as
15 related monthly comics titles.
</P>
<P>
   Given the series' complex story lines and its legion of fans _
as well as the number of disappointing comic-book movies in recent
years _ Bryan Singer's $75 million adaptation, ``X-Men,'' is the
year's most anxiously watched and eagerly awaited film.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic achievement is one of the best comics-based movies
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's faithful production is a beautifully rendered, credible
fantasy that features sympathetic characters in a compelling story
with sharp social and political themes.
</P>
<P>
   The film emphasizes character relationships over action, yet
Singer's intense set pieces capture superhero battles the way
they're depicted on comics pages _ with costumed bodies hurling
through the air, leaving a wake of havoc and destruction _ as
opposed to the hard-to-follow fast cutting of Joel Schumacher's
``Batman'' sequels.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men `` will please most ardent fans and entertain casual
viewers. One need not be familiar with the comic books to follow
the film's allegorical story or to relate to its characters, who
have superhuman powers but suffer from mortal flaws.
</P>
<P>
   A dark, gripping prologue set in a Nazi concentration camp
grounds the story in reality. A subsequent sequence, set in the
near future and involving McCarthy-like congressional hearings on
the ``mutant phenomenon,'' establishes a dramatic parallel between
mutant persecution and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Mutants are the next step in human evolution, possessing
extraordinary powers that manifest themselves at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound
telepath who operates a school for ``gifted'' children, where he
teaches young mutants to control and direct their powers for the
greater good of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier is mentor to the X-Men _ Cyclops (James Marsden), whose
eyes release an energy beam; Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who
possesses both telekinetic and telepathic abilities; and Storm
(Halle Berry), who can manipulate all forms of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Professor X's former friend and colleague, Eric Lehnsherr (Ian
McKellen), is the world's most powerful mutant. Known as Magneto,
he can harness the Earth's magnetic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Magneto believes a war is brewing between mutants and the humans
who fear and despise them. Leading the evil Brotherhood of Mutants
_ who include the vicious Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), shape-shifting
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and lethal-tongued Toad (Ray Park)
_ Magneto plans to be on the winning side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With these two opposing forces locked in physical and
philosophical battle, the deft screenplay by David Hayter focuses
on two solitary mutants who reluctantly team with Xavier: Wolverine
(Hugh Jackman), a fierce fighting machine with retractable metal
claws; and Rogue (Oscar winner Anna Paquin), an alienated teen who
can absorb the powers of anyone she touches, with potentially fatal
results.
</P>
<P>
   Singer (''The Usual Suspects'') is adept at handling multiple
characters and simultaneous action, which suits the story's human
and superhuman elements.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate effects sequences are terrific, as are the
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Australian stage actor Jackman delivers a charismatic turn as
the belligerent but soft-hearted Wolverine. Royal Shakespeare
Company veterans Stewart and McKellen are well-matched as cerebral
foes who share mutual admiration as well as animosity.
</P>
<P>
   Far from invincible heroes, the X-Men grapple with pain, anguish
and self-doubt. Amusingly, they get on one another's nerves. The
film turns on a conventional plot device and drags in spots, but it
succeeds at humanizing the cartoon figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'''s cast has signed to do two sequels. As Wolverine
would say, bring 'em on.

<P>
   REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCTION
</P>
<P>
   In St.-Ouen, a nondescript industrial suburb on the northern
edge of Paris, Eric Rohmer is recreating the French Revolution
inside a converted warehouse. His new film, ``The Lady and the
Duke,'' promises to be the most expansive reconstruction of the era
ever undertaken, a significant change of pace for a filmmaker
famous for intimate romantic, philosophical dramas like ``Claire's
Knee'' and ``An Autumn Tale.''
</P>
<P>
   But this set, too, is surprisingly intimate. On a recent day,
Rohmer was restaging a triumphant march down a Parisian boulevard,
a process that involved no more than nine or 10 people: Rohmer (now
a spindly 80), his cinematographer, Diane Baratier (who, in her
30s, looks as if she could be a Rohmer heroine herself), a couple
of electricians and half a dozen extras.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Rohmer is shooting ``The Lady and the Duke'' on
digital video and using the new medium's resources electronically
to create a Paris that hasn't existed in 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two cameras on the set, one pointing toward a
3-by-4-foot painting, based on a period engraving, of the wide
boulevard, and another aimed at a wooden window frame placed
against a bright green backdrop. Rohmer instructs an extra on how
to lean out and wave while Baratier lines up the image so that it
matches a window on the painted street. By repeating this
meticulous process several dozen times, Rohmer will be able to fill
his 18th-century street with a crowd composed of distinct
individuals, laid in one by one.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, this shot would involve dozens of technicians and
weeks of meticulous post-production. But the less affluent French
cinema is used to a hands-on, do-it-yourself technique that finds
even a figure as august as Rohmer pitching in with the detail work.
Francoise Echegarray, who is producing ``The Lady and the Duke''
for Pathe Images, the specialized division of the French studio
Pathe, suggests that the detail work may be what fascinated Rohmer
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is obsessed by architecture,'' she said, ``the architecture
of the street as well as the architecture of a film.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's $6 million budget is high by French standards but
extremely low by American. It is based on the memoirs of Grace
Elliot, a British aristocrat who during the revolution became the
mistress of the Duke of Orleans, the king's brother. The lady will
be played by the English newcomer Lucy Russell, the duke by the
French character actor Jean-Claude Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Rohmer approaches his job with quiet concentration. He makes it
a rule to decline interviews during production, and a hushed
atmosphere prevails on his set, with none of the usual chatter
among crew members and cast. It feels less like a sound stage than
a laboratory where researchers silently go about their work. For
all of the torrents of conversation that have passed before
Rohmer's camera, very little is to be heard behind it.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER ACT
</P>
<P>
   The Weitz brothers _ Paul, 34, and Chris, 30 _ share an
impressive resume: They wrote the 1998 computer-animated film
``Antz'' and then directed last summer's hit comedy ``American
Pie.'' They wrote the script for ``The Klumps,'' Eddie Murphy's
sequel to ``The Nutty Professor,'' and they've just completed
filming of their own second feature, ``Down to Earth,'' a remake of
``Here Comes Jordan'' (No. 2, after Warren Beatty's ``Heaven Can
Wait'') that stars Chris Rock and is set for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of all that they found the time to star in
``Chuck and Buck,'' an independent feature that was a hit at the
Sundance Film Festival and opens in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weitz plays Chuck, a Los Angeles music producer who finds
himself being stalked by Buck (Mike White, who also wrote the
script), a childhood friend who has preserved an adolescent crush
on him. Buck, rejected, writes a play based on his unrequited
passion, and hires Sam (Paul Weitz), an unemployed actor who looks
strangely like Chuck, to play him onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do this normally,'' Chris said over lunch at a
restaurant in New York City. He has known the director, Miguel
Arteta, since they were film students together at Wesleyan
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day Miguel left a message on my machine asking if I'd act
for him,'' he said. ``I thought he was making a short, or messing
around with a new digital video camera. So I left him a message
saying, `OK, as a matter of fact you've spotted my hidden vanity.'
So then Paul came on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul continued: ``Yeah, first they had the idea of Chris, and
then they realized that this other character was supposed to look
like that character, and they thought of me to play a grotesque
version of Chris. Apart from its humor, the script was so bizarre
and essentially unappealing that it had trouble attracting
investors. The advantage of casting us was that you didn't have to
pay us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Weitzes had never acted before, they did have the
genetic material. Their mother is Susan Kohner, whose performance
in Douglas Sirk's ``Imitation of Life'' (1959) earned her an Oscar
nomination. And their grandmother is Lupita Tovar, a Mexican
actress who went to Hollywood to star in Spanish-language versions
of early talkies, including ``Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we certainly had no idea either that it was going
to get into Sundance or that anyone would see it, so it seemed like
doing something for the heck of it, just for a challenge,'' said
Chris.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of glowing reviews, the brothers have no further acting
plans. ``We're going to keep trying to make different kinds of
films, as opposed to staying in the `American Pie' niche and trying
to do that better and better,'' said Paul. ``That's what's going to
allow us not to be incredibly bored by being a team.''
</P>
<P>
   WINNING GAMBLE
</P>
<P>
   The indie hit of the summer is turning out to be the British
thriller ``Croupier,'' which opened on April 21 in New York and has
now spread to 117 theaters nationwide. ``It's an old-fashioned
word-of-mouth picture,'' said Eamonn Bowles, president of Shooting
Gallery Films, the company distributing ``Croupier'' in the United
States. ``It just keeps getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Made three years ago for Channel Four television in Britain by
the veteran director Mike Hodges (``Get Carter'') and given a very
brief theatrical run in London, the film was rescued from obscurity
by a sales agent, Mike Kaplan, who brought it to Bowles' attention.
In 13 weeks of release ``Croupier'' has taken in $2.1 million in
the United States, not a staggering figure by Hollywood standards
but enough to make it a smash in the independent world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone up 20 percent a week,'' said Bowles. ``I've never
seen anything like it.''

 &HT;    A sleepy Orthodox Jewish soap opera
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he wakes every morning, Meir (Yoram Hattab) begins a day of
prayer. One of his first is this one: ``Blessed is our eternal God,
who has not made me a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a lucky man indeed in ``Kadosh,'' a study of the ways
religion can sometimes be crushingly sexist. As an almost
documentary look at Orthodox Jewish life, the movie can be
fascinating. After all, in this insular community, every facet of
life seems to come with a ritual attached. Even making a cup of tea
on the Sabbath day can provoke a long argument about the proper
brewing method. But as a drama, ``Kadosh'' is a very slow go.
</P>
<P>
   Director Amos Gitai penetrates Jerusalem's Orthodox quarter, Mea
Shearim, with a tale of two sisters, Rivka (Yael Abecassis) and the
younger Malka (Meital Barda). Rivka is married to Meir, the rabbi's
son, and now it's time for Malka to wed _ at least according to the
men of the community.
</P>
<P>
   She's in love with the singer Yaakov (Sami Hori), who
scandalized friends in yeshiva school when he voluntarily left to
join the Jewish Army. But the rabbi has arranged for Malka to marry
Yossef (Uri Ran Klausner), a devout man who motors through the
narrow streets in a speaker-mounted van, praising God to
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   There's another conflict. After 10 years together, Rivka has
failed to bear a child. Because, in the words of one character, a
barren woman is no better than a dead woman, this is cause for more
than personal sorrow. It's enough to dissolve the marriage
contract, no matter how much Rivka and Meir love each other.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Kadosh'' scans as soap opera. But the pace is
stubbornly slow. The script, by Eliette Abecassis, herself an
Orthodox Jew living in France, makes its point about women's
subordinate status in the culture. And it just keeps making the
same point. It doesn't help that Gitai often films his scenes in
long, unbroken takes and has encouraged his actors to bracket their
lines with long, mournful silences. They're like sleepwalkers, and
by the end of ``Kadosh,'' you might feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadosh''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>

   Starring Yael Abecassis, Meital Barda and Yoram Hattab. Unry

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   (backslash)Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual, profanity and
some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterfly'' R (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Manuel Lozano
</P>
<P>
   and Fernando Fernan Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of 6-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano), the
countryside of Galicia, in northern Spain, is a place of young
fears and growing wonders. ``Butterfly'' is about a young boy
inspired to learn by the teacher (Fernando Fernan Gomez) who
frightens him the most. It builds slowly and then explodes, showing
us how fear can turn good people into mundane monsters. (SM) In
Spanish with subtitles. 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM) 1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for wrtiting inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' R (drug use, language
</P>
<P>
   and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lola Glaudini
</P>
<P>
   and Hamish Linklater.
</P>
<P>
   The second rave movie of the year, ``Groove'' tracks a handful
of San Franciscan partiers who venture to an abandoned warehouse in
hopes of an all-night rave party. The problem with any movie about
an altered state _ whether it's a dream, or in this case a
drug-and-sound-fueled dance party _ is it's very hard to capture on
film the subjective highs of the real thing. (SM) 1 hour, 26
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' R (some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,
</P>
<P>
   Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But it's ultimately
a compelling and streamlined vision that lives surprisingly well in
the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and penthouses. (SM) 1 hour,
51 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' R (profanity, sexual and
</P>
<P>
   drug content, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book of Denis Johnson's vivid short stories that it's
based on, the movie mirrors its protagonist's sense of dislocation
as it woozily tours a few years in the life of a boozing,
pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup). The film is like
``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played out on the
suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. (SM) At Tara. 1 hour, 50
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadosh'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Yael Abecassis,
</P>
<P>
   Meital Barda and Yoram Hattab.
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating look at Orthodox Jewish life, undermined by
dramatic sluggishness. The script by Eliette Abecassis makes its
point about women's subordinate status in the culture. And it just
keeps making the same point. It doesn't help that director Amos
Gitai often films his scenes in long, unbroken takes, and has
encouraged his actors to bracket their lines with long, mournful
silences. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) at sea, trying to survive the monstrous
sea. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' R (strong crude sexual humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drug use and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris,
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen (writer/director),
Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _ ``Scary Movie'' is
a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just
because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get skewered in a
thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not funny or
simply crude. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts whiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the United States to rescue a kidnapped
princess. ``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horseshoes and pine
saplings as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell tower, and
contend with a drunken horse. The film lassos all the revisionist
laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild West''
botched. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' PG (some cartoon violence)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a 'toon's backgrounds are more
interesting than the plot and characters. ``Titan'' is an animation
set in the 31st century after Earth has been destroyed. The human
race's only hope is a guy named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) who's
the key to the missing Titan project designed by his dad. Like most
sci-fi flicks, this one is more of a super-deluxe episode of the
old ``Jonny Quest'' series. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect. (Unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations, ``Spawn'' and ``Blade.'')
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Alternative picks to the most recent flicks
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' and its comic-book heroes aren't your bag? You'd
prefer not to face a Wolverine sporting Freddy Krueger claws? There
are good movies out there, just not always brand-spanking-new ones.
Here are a few recent worthy films you can see in new ways. See our
Weekend Movie Guide and showtimes listing for details.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Douse the drought: There's so much water in ``The Perfect
Storm'' that you can't come out and not feel wet. Appreciate the
near-perfect special effects. Every time lightning flashes, you get
a better peek at the immense ocean's rolling waves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A midsummer night's dream: You've seen ``Hamlet'' a thousand
different ways _ but not like this. Modern New York is the setting,
and though the play has been cut, it remains compelling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It's a date: Take him to see ``Croupier,'' a mostly smart
gambling-and-intrigue movie where, for once, all the dough was
spent on the script instead of special effects. Or break down and
finally take her to see ``Erin Brockovich,'' the smartest move
Julia Roberts has made in years. Or make both of you happy and take
each other to ``High Fidelity,'' a movie that makes you love every
character, flaws and all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No, you can't see ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'': Get those hot,
restless kids into a cool theater. The Oscar-winning animated Imax
film ``The Old Man and the Sea'' is a visual, painted wonder. For
the wee ones, there are also two instant classics: ``My Dog Skip''
and ``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Force yourself to read: Subtitles aren't as bad as you think.
Let yourself go with the excellent ``The Color of Paradise,'' a
visually arresting Iranian film about a young blind boy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The old standby: You remember ``Ben-Hur.'' It's now called
``Gladiator.''

 &HT;    `Atlanta's Children' full of innuendo
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Purely as a piece of drama, ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?''
is a typical cable TV movie with generic acting, lots of bluster,
the obli-gatory/gratuitous scene set in a strip club and an
overwrought sense of its place in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' cannot be just
another TV movie for Atlanta. It strongly suggests that white
supremacists were behind at least some of the 29 African-American
missing and murdered children and young adults in the case that
paralyzed this city in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Showtime movie never says this is absolutely so, just as it
never says that Wayne Williams, who was convicted of two of the
murders (and linked to 21 others, according to law enforcement
officials at the time), is innocent. (Williams is a very minor
character in the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Atlanta's Children'' implies a lot and proves almost
nothing, other than how easy it is to still push people's hot
buttons almost 20 years after the fact. Oliver Stone knew this when
he made ``JFK,'' which shares some of this movie's approach to
cobbling together fact and conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes place four years after Williams' conviction.
Spin magazine editor Ron Larson (Gregory Hines) and reporter Pat
Laughlin (James Belushi) come to town to investigate the murders.
Mothers of some of the victims believe (as some do to this day)
that Atlanta police, anxious to end the city's nightmare, pinned
everything on Williams whether he was guilty or not.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, we're in a strange game. Larson and Laughlin are
pseudonyms; their real names were Rudy Langlais and Robert Keating.
Langlais is executive producer of ``Atlanta's Children'' but
appears as a ``fictional'' character. Writer Charles Robert Carner
says he took liberties with the journalists' characters, hence the
name change.
</P>
<P>
   After a red herring that some of the victims were involved in
``a child sex-for-hire ring involving high city officials''
(there's never a single fact given to bolster such an outrageous
charge), the reportorial duo stumbles onto an investigation by the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation. A GBI informant (of questionable
credibility) had heard some rednecks talking about being involved
in the murders; the GBI investigated, but could never make a case.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that the GBI investigated the informant's lead,
this idea becomes the movie's equivalent of the grassy knoll near
Dallas' Dealey Plaza, spawning fictitious scenes in which heavily
armed Klansmen roam the outskirts of metro Atlanta firing automatic
weapons. Also depicted are a GBI agent ``interrogating'' a Klansman
by schmoozing and laughing with him and another agent destroying
evidence by dumping it into a furnace.
</P>
<P>
   What's telling is that the movie repeatedly pulls back from
saying this is what actually happened. There is not a single scene
in which a white is shown harming a black. Hines and Belushi
vacillate in their conviction about white involvement and, although
Hines' character obviously believes there was something to it, one
of his last lines is, ``All we have are unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   (``Unanswered Questions,'' was, in fact, the very apt working
title of the movie, which was shot entirely in Toronto.)
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of unanswered questions in the case of
Atlanta's missing and murdered children. The dead, and their
survivors, deserve answers. But they will not get them from
cut-and-paste collages of fact and fiction such as ``Who Killed
Atlanta's Children?'' any more than they got them from ``The
Atlanta Child Murders,'' the factually slippery 1985 CBS movie that
tried to establish Williams as an innocent victim of hysteria.
(That CBS movie generated enormous controversy; Showtime, available
in fewer than 20 percent of homes, may cause less.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a topic better left to serious, objective historians,
not makers of docudramas in which it's almost impossible to figure
out where the ``docu'' leaves off and the drama begins.

 &HT;    Ex-congressman Stephens recalls real Nuremberg role
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Robert G. Stephens Jr. doesn't need to watch TNT's
``Nuremberg.'' He lived it in a way few others could.
</P>
<P>
   For four months in 1945, the Army major and University of
Georgia law school graduate worked in the documents division of the
trial staff, helping assemble the paper trail necessary to brand
both the Nazis' Schutzstaffel (SS) and the Sturmabteilung (SA)
criminal organizations. He was chosen because of his facility in
German and his legal training.
</P>
<P>
   By the time one of the most dynamic legal teams completed its
work, 12 Nazis would be sentenced to hang, three would spend their
remaining years in prison and four others would serve nearly 20
years each in confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a big responsibility,'' says Stephens, 86, an
Atlanta native who later served as Athens city attorney, a General
Assembly member and finally in Congress for 17 years. ``I felt
these people had caused the deaths of millions of people and should
be punished. They had killed six million Jews and they had caused
the deaths of thousands of British, French and American boys.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not depicted in the production but says he'll ``try to
watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   A droll man with a sudden smile, Stephens says he simply was one
of numerous attorneys and military officials assembling materials
for Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, the head of the U.S.
prosecution team (played by Alec Baldwin).
</P>
<P>
   As grueling as the trial was, Stephens also was moved by
conditions in postwar Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   He first saw the city from a train window in 1935 while touring
Europe as an exchange student. Nuremberg deserved its reputation as
one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Europe, a place
steeped in beauty and tradition, where families had been operating
businesses in the same buildings for five centuries, Stephens
recalls. It was a renowned toy center.
</P>
<P>
   He likewise remembers, with noting alarm, the country's military
build-up, the rise of Adolf Hitler and the growing force of the
ubiquitous Schutzstaffel, the black-uniformed elite corps of the
Nazi party.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 column for the Athens Observer, Stephens wrote of a
rally he witnessed, attended by 40,000. He wrote that he could
still feel ``the hot and cold waves of feeling passing over me,''
the hair rising on his neck at the sight of the storm troopers and
the sounds of their hobnailed boots and roaring motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Most vivid was his sense of ``impending, but inescapable,
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuremberg he returned to in August 1945 had been reduced to
rubble, which seemed somehow fitting to him because the city had
become the symbol of the Nazis. Hitler had built a huge stadium and
massive arena there for annual conventions of the National
Socialist Party and for military reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The badly damaged Grand Hotel was being repaired while
international visitors housed there prepared for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most depressing place I've ever been,'' Stephens
says. ``The city had been utterly destroyed. The Nuremberg trial is
unique in many ways and probably is the only time the prosecutors
had to first build a courthouse before the trial could begin.''
</P>
<P>
   He received a letter of commendation and was discharged in March
1946. He returned to Athens to open his law practice and launch his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stephens remains a committed history buff _ not
surprising, since his great-uncle was Alexander Stephens, vice
president of the Confederacy, and his grandfather was Clement
Evans, a Confederate officer who became a Methodist minister.

Jr.'s small plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing him, his

new cable movie never quite says categorically that Wayne Williams

up to be (drumroll, please) ... Darva Conger, the

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nuremberg'' (8 p.m. Sunday and Monday on TNT)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not meant to be an entertainment, it's meant to be a
trial!'' rages Alec Baldwin as Robert Jackson, the chief prosecutor
of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. He's right, of course, but
TNT's new docudrama, which has some stunning moments but is rather
ponderous overall, could use a little more entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour movie based closely on the trial transcripts (as
opposed to the 1961 movie ``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' which was
heavily fiction), Baldwin projects intelligence, integrity and the
charisma of lumber. Maybe that's how Jackson, a Supreme Court
justice, was, but it's tough on a movie when the hero is frequently
the least interesting person on screen.
</P>
<P>
   For the historically impaired, Nuremberg was an international
tribunal in which the Allies (United States, Great Britain, France
and the Soviet Union) tried 21 Nazis after World War II. It was a
radical concept, given what the defendants had just done, to give
them counsel and rights instead of summarily executing them (as the
Soviets wanted).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuremberg'' takes forever getting going, but soon delivers at
least some of the goods. Actual film footage of the liberated death
camps is played within the movie, as it was at the trial, and is
profoundly moving and disturbing. And British actor Brian Cox is
unforgettable as the highest ranking Nazi on trial, Reichsmarshal
Hermann Goering: fat, smug and evil, but with a dangerous, oily
charm. (Buffs know Cox originated the role of Hannibal Lecter in
the film ``Manhunter.'')
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect a movie called ``Nuremberg'' to be fun,
exactly, but it would have been a less numbing four hours if it had
struck some notes other than earnestness.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In recent weeks, many denominations have held their summer
conventions, large national gatherings to discuss church issues and
set policies regarding theology and practice.
 &HT;    This year the hot-button issue is, as it has been for decades,
sex.
 &HT;    For Southern Baptists, issues of sex centered on whether women
could be ordained and serve as senior pastors in their churches.
The Southern Baptist Convention, having effectively silenced all
liberal voices in their decision-making body, voted overwhelmingly
to support an all-male pastorate.
 &HT;    Most American Protestants, however, approved women's ordination
half a century ago. Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans and
Episcopalians are struggling with the issues related to gay and
lesbian persons in their communions. Should homosexual persons be
(officially) ordained? Should their unions be blessed? The
Protestant jury is still out on these questions.
 &HT;    At this year's conventions, pro-homosexual rights advocates have
been arrested. And convention delegates have been forced to avoid
anti-gay rights protesters on their way into meetings. Some of
these activists _ whether liberal or conservative _ are members of
the church itself. But many more are not.
 &HT;    The denominational meetings have been targeted by two groups,
Soulforce (a pro-homosexual religious organization) and ``God Hates
Fags,'' to push the issue in churches to which they do not belong.
 &HT;    These groups follow a long tradition in American religious
history. Outside special interest groups have often pressured
centrist denominations on highly charged political issues. These
groups are not affiliated with a single church body and draw their
members from a variety of religious bodies.
 &HT;    From temperance and slavery to civil rights and abortion, such
single organizations have energized our society with passionate
commitment to the common good, justice, and human rights.
 &HT;    But for all they contribute, they also have a dangerous
downside. Unlike the single-issue vision of the special interest
groups, mainline churches are diverse institutions comprehending a
wide variety of persons and opinions.
 &HT;    Although not often depicted as such, religious congregations are
pluralistic, flexible and inclusive institutions. In order to
belong to a group, members must submit to baptism or confirmation,
circumcision or bar mitzvah, but beyond the basics congregants
display widely divergent opinions on biblical interpretation,
theology, politics and religious practice.
 &HT;    Priests, ministers and rabbis know this. It is part of what
makes their job so difficult. Getting a congregation to agree on
anything can be a monumental task. So, forget about homosexual
ordination _ how do you agree on a new organ?
 &HT;    Despite being notorious contrarians, church members possess a
skill lacking in civic debate: they know how to remain in community
while disagreeing with each other. They argue about organs
precisely because they know they can. Half the church wants a
traditional pipe organ; the other half, an electronic one. Five
years from now, they will have their new organs. Whoever lost the
argument will be lustily singing ``For All the Saints'' sitting
next to the winner. And neither will remember the conflict.
 &HT;    Ultimately, local congregations know how to argue. Sure, they
sometimes split. But they more often stay together. In the long
run, community is more important then personal opinion. They
practice a kind of relational pluralism in the pews.
 &HT;    Single-issue interest groups are dangerous because they drive a
wedge into pew pluralism. They set Jane against Mary in a
``gay/lesbian rights issue.'' In reality, Jane's son is gay. Yet
Mary, who always thought homosexuality a sin, supported and prayed
for her friend as Jane came to terms with her son's sexual
orientation. Much to her own surprise, Mary even attended a
celebration of his union with a life partner while still
maintaining her own questions about sexual morality.
 &HT;    No matter their politics, Jane and Mary are friends. They have
coffee and serve on the altar guild together. That will not make
the news, but it is the matrix of faith in which millions of
Americans live and worship.
 &HT;    In ``Center Aisle,'' a newsletter circulating at the Episcopal
convention, an editorial stated, ``The real threat to the Episcopal
Church comes from advocates bent on premature closure to a lasting
and complex issue.Extremes must be rejected.''
 &HT;    Yes, extremes should be rejected _ but not in favor of mushy
tolerance or continued injustice. They must be rejected in favor of
working together in community, listening to, caring for, and
respecting one another while seeking to do the right and the good
amid our differences.
 &HT;    The pluralism of the pews is an icon of the kind of society a
religiously diverse America needs to become.

STAINED GLASS, WITH SINNERS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mo., Mass., Austria, Germany, Switzerland)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think you know what 15th-century German stained glass
looks like, you may be wrong. It's not what you see in the Chartres
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have never seen stained glass like the panels in the
J. Paul Getty Museum's exhibition ``Painting on Light: Drawings and
Stained Glass in the Age of Durer and Holbein,'' which opened on
Tuesday and runs through Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The show is full of surprises. Along with the ravishing angels
and pious saints, there are soldiers in the midst of a massacre,
men and women playing roulette, Heracles slaying the Nemean lion
and nude women in a bathhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The show, organized by the Getty, in Los Angeles, and the St.
Louis Art Museum, where it opens on Nov. 4, has 80 preparatory
drawings that artists made for these commissions. They are shown
alongside 60 stained-glass panels that talented glass painters
translated into windows. They were ordered for guild headquarters,
town halls and private houses, as well as churches and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   Stained glass is a collaborative art. Artists prepare the
drawings; then they or their assistants work out the designs in
proportion to the size of the glass panels. These second drawings
become the cartoons for the glaziers. (Cartone is an Italian word
meaning big paper.)
</P>
<P>
   The glazier blows the glass by hand in various colors. The glass
is then painted on both sides. The material is called stained glass
because the outer surface is painted with an enamel called silver
stain. When fired, the stain turns yellow. If the underlying glass
is blue, the stain turns it green. Details are drawn on the inner
surface of the glass with vitreous paint, which ranges in color
from gray-brown to black. Details can also be scratched into the
paint. The glass pieces are then joined together with lead strips
called cames. The process requires close collaboration, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty show is the result of an equally intense collaboration
that lasted 15 years. The story behind it is a bit like the
off-Broadway play ``A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 two American art historians, both specialists in
Renaissance drawings, met in Vienna at a seminar on Durer, the
great German painter and engraver. Lee Hendrix, the drawings
curator at the Getty, was looking for art for her department.
``Begun in 1981, our drawings collection is young,'' she said.
``Our greatest strength in our German drawings is stained-glass
drawings from 1480 to 1530.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Butts had just completed her doctorate at Harvard and
was going to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as a drawings
curator. The two were young and shared a passion for German
Renaissance drawings. They became great friends.
</P>
<P>
   Butts confided that she hoped to organize a show on Durer,
comparing his preparatory drawings with the actual glass panels the
drawings inspired. Hendrix loved the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the drawings had never been seen next to the glass
panels they were made for,'' she said. ``This material is so
overlooked.'' She said the last survey was a two-volume book,
published in German in 1913, on the King of Prussia's collection.
``That glass was stored in Berlin,'' she added, ``and 80 percent of
it was destroyed in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts said, ``We knew the drawings, but there was a lot of
confusion about what glass had survived and where it was.'' The two
curators spent the next 13 years matching the drawings to their
stained-glass counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The art of drawing flourished in Germany and Switzerland from
the late 1400s to the 1600s. Artists like Durer (1471-1528) went to
Italy to study Renaissance painting and returned home with new
ideas. Drawing was no longer simply a process to record nature. It
developed into a true art.
</P>
<P>
   This art is the subject of a companion show of 16th- and
17th-century German and Swiss drawings the Getty has organized from
its own collection (through Aug. 20). It includes detailed figure
drawings, compositional studies, portraits and designs for
woodcuts, stained glass and decorative objects by Durer, Lucas
Cranach the Elder (1472-1553) and Hans Holbein the Younger
(1497-1543).
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting on Light'' explores technique and artistry, but it
also places stained glass in political and religious contexts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stained glass is an art form that vividly reflects its time,''
Hendrix said. ``By the Reformation, the commissioning of monumental
stained-glass church windows was dying out in Germany. Secular
glass came in.'' Soon stained glass became ubiquitous in Southern
Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   From 1400 to 1550 it was used to decorate town halls, private
houses, inns, universities, even hospitals. Themes included the Old
and New Testaments, classical mythology, heraldry, planetary
movements and chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects things people liked to do at that time:
card-playing, wrestling, wine-drinking, fishing and swimming, even
cooking,'' Hendrix said. ``History is also profoundly reflected in
the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hapsburg emperor Maximilian I, called ``the last knight''
because he was constantly at war, and his courtiers became great
patrons of stained glass. They commissioned panels glorifying
knighthood, with scenes of jousting and courtly love.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, by contrast, stained glass was more political,
promoting the drive for independence. In 1513, the Swiss Federation
began an anti-Hapsburg uprising in the Alps that lasted more than a
century. The Swiss cantons eventually won; the secession of the
Swiss Confederation was legalized with the Treaty of Westphalia in
1648.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss ordered stained glass that glorified their legendary
image, the Wild Man of the Alps, the freedom fighter whose body is
covered with hair and who carries a tree trunk as his weapon. He is
``a mythical figure from the medieval imagination, depicted in art
and literature far into the 16th century,'' Barbara Giesicke and
Mylene Ruoss write in a catalog essay: ``The Wild Man's popularity
as shield-bearer was essentially based on the symbolism of his
strength and drive for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   One Holbein drawing shows the Wild Man leaping through a
classical portal from the Alps right into the viewer's space. ``He
is as tall as a tree, a symbol of strength, virility and invincible
power,'' Hendrix said. ``Behind him are Alps.''
</P>
<P>
   In organizing the show, she and Butts went to Europe several
times. ``We got Eurorail passes,'' Butts recalled. ``We crossed and
recrossed Germany and Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix added: ``In 1998, we did 14 cities in 28 days. It was a
journey of discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   They sought out a thermal bath in a spa in Switzerland. The
doctors and nurses did not recall a stained-glass window there. The
curators obtained a key to search the chapel but couldn't find the
panel. ``On the way out, we noticed that a curtain had been pulled
back by the front door,'' Hendrix said. ``There was our panel.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the glass for the show was the next nightmare. ``We
visited nearly all the lenders because we had to explain why we
needed their stained-glass pieces,'' Hendrix said. ``This show
could never happen again because it took four years just to
negotiate the loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Would they try to do it again? ``It was the collaboration of a
lifetime,'' Butts said.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD TIGHTEN ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The dramatic increase in cases of identity theft in
the United States prompted legislation in the House on Thursday to
restrict the use of Social Security numbers in both the public and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security numbers have become the gateway for crooked
con artists to raid your bank accounts, max out your credit cards,
and literally steal your own identity,'' said co-author of the
bill, Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security was created to help Americans enjoy their
golden years, not spend their days trying to restore their good
name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit all sales of Social Security numbers by
governments, agencies, or private industries. It would also bar
third parties from offering services to obtain Social Security
numbers, such as advertising agencies who offer services to stores
in order to obtain the names and Social Security numbers of
prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, Social Security numbers would be prohibited from
appearing on driver's licenses, motor vehicle registration cards,
or other identification-related records, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in the nation,
affecting 600,000 Americans nationally,'' Shaw said. ``Last year,
the number of reported misuses of Social Security numbers increased
233 percent, and we seldom think of that a number as unique as a
fingerprint is such a prime target for theft and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., a supporter of the bill who was himself
a victim of identity theft, said he felt frustrated and violated
that someone could steal his private information and use it to
obtain merchandise at a department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when I found out that I owed over $700 to
Target because someone had stolen my Social Security number and
obtained a credit card with it,'' Foley said. ``I received horrible
treatment from the credit agencies, and I felt violated that
someone could steal my personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would strengthen the government's power to investigate
fraud, and penalties for identity fraud would be increased.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also makes denial of services to people who
refuse to provide their Social Security number a violation of the
unfair trade practices law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security number was not invented as a means of
identification, and some of the services that require it are
outright ridiculous,'' Foley said. ``I have heard stories of Social
Security numbers being needed to buy Girl Scout cookies, purchase
videos, and even for funerals.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would not bar the use of Social Security numbers in
all situations, but would simply prohibit all sales of the numbers,
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers would still be used in banking, by law
enforcement, and for special cases like tracking down deadbeat
dads,'' he said.

LIL' KIM: `THE NOTORIOUS K.I.M.' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIL' KIM: ``The Notorious K.I.M.'' (Queen Bee/Undeas/Atlantic
Records
</P>
<P>
   Lil' Kim, hip-hop's Queen Bee, returns after a long hiatus to
the same base she used to gain supremacy on ``Hardcore,'' her
hugely popular debut: the bedroom. Yes, this album is a declaration
of sexual prowess. But the themes Lil' Kim develops here have more
to do with machismo than with feminine wiles. Declaring herself
``the first female king,'' she explores the fallout from a woman's
decision to take a masculine stance and finds it perilous as well
as powerful.
</P>
<P>
   In fat, highly aggressive mixes that sample widely from the
women-in-pop palette (tracks interpolate work by Sade, Pat Benatar,
Suzanne Vega and Grace Jones), Lil' Kim relentlessly equates
eroticism with her urge to dominate and the male hostility it
causes. The album's many producers, including Puffy Combs and
Yellowman Winans, create action-movie soundtracks for Lil' Kim to
move through. She comes out with guns blazing under her belt: the
album's dominant metaphor is oral gratification as a power play.
It's a mixed-up, cynical vision of female empowerment, but Lil' Kim
clearly believes in it. As she declares in the album's final cut, a
vision of a female-run America, ``Inside we're all animal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Step in, please, and don't forget to pick your jaw
off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   See the papier-mache elephant balancing on a tightrope. The
Victorian hatpin, the turquoise sheen of its 21 hummingbird heads
catching the light. Ceiling-to-floor pre-Raphaelite tapestries.
Miniature wooden clowns. Tiffany chandeliers casting a warm glow in
the museum-toy shop that is Jim Dale's Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And then stand back as Dale, the rubbery English actor who owns
a Doberman pinscher named La-dee-da and a 4-foot rabbit made of
bottle caps, capers around, performing impromptu sketches about his
wondrous and whimsical objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' he says at last, settling into a late-19th-century
armchair. When he and his wife, Julie, come up in the elevator, he
says, ``We pull up the drawbridge, and this is our castle in the
clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is not quite Harry Potter's magical domain, then it is
Hogwarts-by-the-Hudson. This castle is presided over by a man who
is part blithe spirit and who, it now becomes clear, was perfectly
cast to narrate the series' audiobooks, including the latest,
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' for which Dale created 125
speaking voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they sent me the first book, I thought, `I wish it had
been around when I was a kid,'' says Dale, a taut, springy 64, who
has acted on stage and films, been a disc jockey, a pop music and
television star in Britain and the lyricist for ``Georgy Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done all kinds of entertaining, except narration.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking, ``Oh, well, I'm still a kid, and
adventure is adventure wherever you find it, so why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   So precisely imagined is Dale's reading of the Potter tales'
best-selling compact discs and cassettes for the visually impaired,
new readers and travelers on long car trips, that the rare quibbler
did so on Dale's fabulist terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``One critic said, `Where in God's name did Dale get a Welsh
accent for the centaurs?''' says Dale, his face alight with
merriment. Then, assuming a scholarly mien, he intones, ``Clearly,
he didn't know the Welsh are famous for their centaurs!''
</P>
<P>
   While the accents spring largely from Dale's antic mental attic,
he needed guidance from the author, J.K. Rowling, for the
phantasmagorical names. During taping, she would be telephoned and
asked, ``Nagini: hard g or soft?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, nog-EE-nee!'' Dale says brightly. ``That's it, then! God
has spoken!''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine Dale, a die-hard audience man, alone in a
recording booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visualized the reactions of children listening,'' says Dale,
who has five grandchildren. ``Stunned silence here! So hold the
break two, three, four ... This line is worth a giggle, it deserves
more than a laugh, pause, two, three, so their shouts don't drown
the next line. That's what more than 40 years of being on stage
teaches you.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult aspect of narrating was not keeping all those
voices straight _ he says he can memorize three decks of cards _
but sitting still, for the microphones could pick up the rustle of
cloth as he crossed his pants legs. And Dale, who said he taught
Laurence Olivier how to change a lightbulb atop a table on stage,
tumble off a chair and land right side up; twinkled across the
audience's seats during his breakout American performance in
``Scapino''; and walked a 38-foot tightrope for his Tony
Award-winning role in ``Barnum,'' has been restlessly agile since
boyhood, when his prescient parents, factory workers, sent him to
dancing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more fights in tights than any 10-year-old I knew,''
Dale says. ``But, thank God, I grew up solid working class. I
understand what makes most people laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a disappointing Broadway ``Candide'' and a
celebrated ``Travels With My Aunt'' off-Broadway, he hasn't been on
the American stage much recently.
</P>
<P>
   The subject tightens his jaw, brings wistfulness to his eyes. He
blames his resistance to type-casting _ ``I'm not just a song and
dance man!'' _ and his own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't travel,'' he says, ``because I have a lovely wife and
I adore her and I can't bear to be away from her.'' Dale has been
married for 20 years to his second wife, Julie Schafler Dale, a
gallery owner.
</P>
<P>
   So Dale appears on the London stage (Julie visits), brings
Hogwarts to life and tromps around a country home with a
weed-wacker, a chain saw and a child's eye for treasure: In a
field, he found 40 different metal molds of doll heads from an
abandoned factory. They polish up quite weirdly, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   And he performs for anyone lucky enough to bump into him. Like
the police officer on Central Park West who yelled at him for
walking La-dee-da on a leash 20 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leash is a leash is a leash!'' squawked Dale, who recounts
this by imitating himself _ exasperated, veddy British _ and the
towering Noo Yawk cop.
</P>
<P>
   Cop, shouting: ``But what if your dog leaps into a carriage and
scares the people!''
</P>
<P>
   Dale: ``Officer! I can assure you the very first thing I taught
this dog when I got her was, `Never jump into a carriage and scare
people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cop (reddening): ``Are you trying to be funny?''
</P>
<P>
   Dale (stoutly): ``Sir, I'm having no difficulty!''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to have an audience, he dissolves into laughter.

 &HT;    LICENSING PUSH HAS GUN OWNERS FIGHTING MAD
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two words rally gun owners like nothing else:
licensing and registration.
</P>
<P>
   And with the latest Democratic party platform endorsing gun
control measures, such as child safety locks and strict background
checks, gun owners say they are increasingly worried.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Rifle Association's July newsletter, the group's
president, Charlton Heston, warns: ``Once some Gore government has
the names, addresses, photos and ownership inventories of every gun
owner in America, we all know what comes next. Once liberty is
transformed into license, that license can be revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, groups that advocate gun-control say that licensing
and registration will save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Licensing and registration) would make sure that the wrong
people don't get a hold of guns; make sure that people know how to
use guns properly; make it easier for police to trace crime guns
and detect gun traffickers; and it makes sense,'' said Nancy Hwa, a
spokesperson for Handgun Control, Inc., a group that supports gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of licensing and registration say it would help weed
out criminals who are trying to purchase firearms through legal
channels and that it would prevent illegal sales by making the
registered owner responsible for what happens to his or her own
gun.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a license, which includes a photo I.D., applicants
would have to pass a background check, including a check for
violent misdemeanor convictions, domestic violence and mental
illness. In addition, the applicant would have to demonstrate
knowledge of firearms safety and the laws governing the use,
possession, storage and transfer of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Hwa said that many people don't know how their own guns work or
what state and federal laws govern the sale and use of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that it's OK to shoot somebody in the back
or to shoot someone who is not even really threatening you,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way people who get car licenses must learn how the
vehicle works and the laws of the road, people who buy guns should
take a safety course and a test to prove that they know how to
handle a gun and that they know the rules, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But gun owners, such as Ken Bagby, say that licensing and
registration would only burden law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws that they are creating have nothing to do with
stopping crime. It is an issue that deals with the honest citizen
who will go register their gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby, who lives in Shelby, N.C., and has been a hunter since he
was a child, said that charging fees for licensing and registration
would discriminate against poor gun owners, who are often the most
vulnerable to crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it's $25 to register your gun, then it's $50, then it's
$200, then it's what have you...If a poor person can't afford that,
that's unfair as heck,'' he said. ``These are people that live on
the front line. They're in the housing projects. They need the
protection. The cops won't even go in there sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of more federal record-keeping also makes gun owners
uneasy as many are already skeptical of government and fear that
its ultimate goal is to disarm citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ifs, ands or buts about it...the more information
that's there makes it that much easier,'' Bagby said.
</P>
<P>
   Many gun owners have taken to the Internet to express such
fears. Dozens of sites, such as www.thefiringline.com, provide chat
rooms and other forums for concerned gun owners to share
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun owner in America gets really angry and activated by
this,'' said Josh Sugarmann (cq), executive director of the
Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based group that supports the
banning of handguns and other gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The intense reaction of the gun lobby to the issue of licensing
and registration is one of the reasons his group does not push it
as a solution to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger reason, the group says, is that licensing and
registration would have little effect on most U.S. gun violence
because most homicides are the result of arguments between people
who know each other and who purchase guns legally.
</P>
<P>
   The focus should be on the product and the manufacturer, not the
user, Sugarmann said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites as an example that licensing and registering of cars
had no effect on automobile deaths and injuries. Cars became safer
only after the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration
was established and mandated road safety improvements and changes
to car designs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to national licensing and registering also say it
would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the government originally estimated that licensing
and registration of that country's 7 million guns would cost about
$185 million Canadian ($125 million U.S.) over five years. The
project, which began in December 1998, has already cost more than
$320 million Canadian ($216 million U.S.), according to the
Canadian Firearms Centre.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 65 million handguns in the U.S, the cost of
such a system could be staggering.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of a national licensing and registration system
say that saving lives would offset any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely think it would be (worth it) compared to the
costs of the gun violence that we have in this country _ the
economic costs, the human costs and emotional costs,'' Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
   While licensing and registration of firearms is a major goal for
gun control advocates, it has not been on the Congressional radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not included in a package of gun control proposals
_ currently stuck in Congress _ that includes stricter background
checks at gunshows, requiring child safety locks on guns, and
banning the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

multilevel-marketing kin? Because of the flextime, incentive pay
and limitless possibilities for smart, energetic young adults. By

   The following is a selective listing by critics of The New York
Times of new or noteworthy movies. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE,' starring Rene Russo,
Jason Alexander and Robert De Niro, with the voices of June Foray
and Keith Scott. Directed by Des McAnuff (PG, 88 minutes). Fans of
Jay Ward's old ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' television show will enjoy
the first 10 minutes or so of this movie, which employs the show's
characteristically flat animation and goofy humor to update the
biographies of the beloved flying squirrel, his antlered sidekick
and their enemies Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. But the antic
whimsy of the cartoon original is betrayed as the film turns into a
clunky, muddled stew of special effects, lame jokes and labored
attempts at satire. Rocky, Bullwinkle and a young FBI agent save
the world from Fearless Leader (De Niro), but who will save it from
misguided, overpriced and overhyped movies? (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating new film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young
boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `DISNEY'S `THE KID,'' starring Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin and
Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this
cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old,
Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter
with his 8-year-old younger self (Spencer Breslin), who arrives in
Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights, the movie should
be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it
occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong
performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart, and to Audrey Wells'
surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up
fighting for his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire
intensity suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the
movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE IN 60 SECONDS,' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi,
Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13,
119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title
seems to refer to the length of time it would linger in a viewer's
memory. Cage, who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best
car thief. He is dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart
business and returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother
(Ribisi). With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless
hot-rodding entertainment for those who love car chases with
vintage autos, a film so glossy and impersonal that you will
sympathize more with the cars than the people (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GROOVE,' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini and Steve Van
Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86 minutes). If you're
nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city and arriving
to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits of drum and
bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny comedy is
just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive lack of
pretension will win you over. ``Groove'' is a comedy of moments,
tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure
at a rave. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves
are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched
circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture
captures them (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If
``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous
mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking
and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the
Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me, Myself and
Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish
sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may
prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Carrey, in
one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and repellent
performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split
personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie
and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson. Directed by Roland Emmerich
(R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more
than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The
brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will
leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of
prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle
farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits,
using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His
anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief
asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his
children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own
large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and
Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 150 minutes.)
Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the
human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's
best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the
storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the
ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the
appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of
warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the
fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but
the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `PRAISE,' starring Peter Fenton and Sacha Horler. Directed by
John Curran (unrated, 98 minutes). A stunner about a doomed
relationship that's like Tennessee Williams with the ragged
heedlessness of post-punk culture. Gordon (Fenton) is the epitome
of slacker, a slender do-nothing whose passivity is part of his
wasted charm. He attracts the sexually voracious Cynthia (Horler),
whose soft body is racked with eczema. Though the movie feels
aimless, Curran lets the explicit detail spell out the
compulsiveness of the characters and uses jolts of humor to keep
the squalor from lapsing into unrelieved unpleasantness. Horler's
tender and fearless performance is just one of the elements that
wiil stick with you (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SCARY MOVIE,' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon
Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Wayans'
latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ``Scream''
movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy.
``Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male
genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There
are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty
laughter, but Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies
_ like the wildly popular ``Scream'' series _ that already parody
themselves (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAFT,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A
sequel/remake to the 1971 semiclassic, starring the always
dependable Jackson. He plays the nephew of the original Shaft
(Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He
leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Bale), who
joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful
Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically
correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert
archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two
villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But
Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of
retro and modern cliches (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances, and those of Ehle
and Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `TRIXIE,' starring Emily Watson and Nick Nolte. Directed by Alan
Rudolph (R, 117 minutes). In this self-billed ``screwball film
noir,'' Watson plays an undercover detective at a lakeside casino
investigating the murder of a third-rate lounge singer. Nolte is
the alcoholic, womanizing politician she suspects of the murder.
The director is wonderful with actors, and the fine supporting
cast, which includes Lesley Ann Warren, Will Patton and Nathan
Lane, fills in the movie's sleazy atmosphere. But the story neither
connects its narrative dots nor generates suspense, and the humor
(the title character is given to silly malapropisms) falls flat
(Holden).

OUT OF THE PAST, SONGS THAT BITE: CATCHING UP WITH TOM LEHRER 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of
singer/songwriter Tom Lehrer. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    To some of us who were in college in the early 1960s, Tom Lehrer
ranks in a pantheon somewhere below the Almighty and above the
Beatles.
 &HT;    The first time a Catholic friend played me Lehrer's ``The
Vatican Rag'' _ with those memorable lines, ``Ave Maria/Gee, it's
good to see ya!'' _ I was hooked. I needed more and still more of
this cynical rhymester whose humor was as subversive as a
flag-burning and twice as dangerous.
 &HT;    When he deserted the music scene for academia, he left an
enormous vacuum. Such pale imitators as Mark Russell and the
Capital Steps were small consolation for those who dreamed of what
Lehrer would have made of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan or Bill
Clinton.
 &HT;    The bad news is that no new Lehrer songs are forthcoming. The
good news is that Warner Archives/Rhino Records have collected the
entire Lehrer opus for a three-CD set, ``The Remains of Tom
Lehrer.''
 &HT;    To those unfortunates who have never savored Lehrer's acid takes
on everything from senatorial politics to nuclear war _ ``So long,
Mom,/I'm off to drop the bomb,/so don't wait up for me!'' _ allow
me to introduce you.
 &HT;    His father was a well-to-do tie manufacturer, his mother a
lifelong devotee of Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan. He entered Harvard at 15 as
a math major, won his undergraduate degree at 18 and, along the
way, penned a little ditty called ``Fight Fiercely, Harvard,'' a
college-football-song spoof _ ``Won't it be peachy if we win the
game? Oh, goody!''
 &HT;    As a graduate student in Cambridge, Mass., he became a fixture
at local nightspots and in 1953 self-produced an album, ``Songs by
Tom Lehrer.'' It became a cult hit, eventually selling 370,000
albums and counting.
 &HT;    In the conformist 1950s, of course, it was foreordained that
mainstream success would elude the author of, for example, ``The
Masochism Tango'':
 &HT;    ``Let our love be a flame, not an ember,
 &HT;    Say it's me that you want to dismember!''
 &HT;    Nor ``I Hold Your Hand in Mine,'' in which it is gradually
revealed that the hand in question is no longer attached to its
body, or ``The Old Dope Peddler,'' which celebrates a favorite
neighborhood fixture.
 &HT;    A second and third album, ``More of Tom Lehrer'' and ``An
Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer,'' were followed in 1965 by ``That
Was the Year That Was,'' featuring political songs he'd written for
the satiric television program ``That Was the Week that Was.''
 &HT;    Who else would have spoofed that 20th-century man for all
ideologies, German rocket scientist Werner Von Braun, with a
sardonic:
 &HT;    ```Once the rockets go up
 &HT;    Who cares where they come down?
 &HT;    That's not my department,'
 &HT;    Says Werner Von Braun!''
 &HT;    And then, at the height of his success, Lehrer virtually
disappeared. He became a full-time teacher, teaching mathematics
first at Harvard and then at the University of California at Santa
Cruz, where he also offered a course on the American musical
theater. But he stopped writing songs, except for a couple of
specialty numbers for public television's ``The Electric Company,''
and rarely performed in public again.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, on the telephone from his summer home in Cambridge
the 72-year-old Lehrer sounds much as he did in his 30s. To hear
him tell it, the much-speculated-upon reason for his departure from
the public eye wasn't all that complicated.
 &HT;    ``I like to think it's maturity,'' he says, ``the liability that
I can see both sides. You can't write satire that says, `On the
other hand ... '''
 &HT;    This creeping recognition of life's shades of grey, he says, has
killed his desire to pillory.
 &HT;    ``For instance,'' he says, ``I'm for the legalization of drugs _
but you can't write a song about that, because I can see the other
side. I think in the old days my view of life was much simpler:
There were good guys and there were bad guys. Now I feel there are
bad guys and slightly better guys.''
 &HT;    Is he saying that you have to be young to be funny?
 &HT;    ``I think it helps,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Because Lehrer disappeared at the height of his fame, the
wildest rumors found their way to the surface: Lehrer was dead. He
had committed suicide. He'd had a nervous breakdown. He'd been sued
for everything he owned by Werner Von Braun, and had to pay him all
his future royalties.
 &HT;    ``There's an interesting story about that,'' Lehrer says with a
laugh. ``It turns out his daughter applied for admission to Bryn
Mawr, years after my song. And in the course of her interview, she
told the person interviewing her that her father, Werner, was not
just a narrow scientist. In fact, he was learning Chinese.''
 &HT;    The anecdote made its way quickly to Lehrer, whose infectious
ditty had included the following barb:
 &HT;    ```In German or English
 &HT;    I know how to count down,
 &HT;    Und I'm learning Chinese,'
 &HT;    Says Werner Von Braun.''
 &HT;    All those rumors were sparked simply by people's difficulty in
believing that a successful performer could simply have quit.
 &HT;    ``I didn't decide to become the J.D. Salinger of music,'' Lehrer
says, ``although I've always said Salinger and Deanna Durbin were
my role models. People assume, if you're a modest success and then
you stop, there must be a reason. It was simply that funny ideas
occurred to me at a gradually decreasing rate, so I just stopped
doing it.''
 &HT;    Long before he officially retired, however, Lehrer had struggled
with the drawbacks of live performance. A thoroughly private
person, he is generally camera-shy and cringes at the culture of
celebrity.
 &HT;    Not, he adds, that he ever had to face real fame, since his
material ensured that his would be a small, if passionate,
following.
 &HT;    ``I suspect most of the people who liked these things thought,
`Well, we get it, but of course the masses wouldn't,''' he says.
``So it wasn't like women throwing themselves in front of my
chariot. It was people who considered themselves educated and
superior.
 &HT;    ``They wouldn't descend to tearing my clothes off in public,''
he adds. ``They were like the people in New York who pretended not
to recognize Greta Garbo.''
 &HT;    As for today's political scene, he says that he's not sure his
approach would work now. His songs assumed a common philosophy
shared by most in his audience, a consensus which may have faded in
the intervening decades.
 &HT;    ``That's the whole thing,'' he explains, ``a certain literacy, a
certain education and a certain liberal consensus that there was at
that time. There was a general understanding in the '50s about
where we stood vis a vis Joe McCarthy and Adlai Stevenson.
 &HT;    ``Today that doesn't exist anymore,'' Lehrer says. ``The people
who would be my natural audience are split on any given issue _
affirmative action, Israel or whatever.''
 &HT;    Now in semi-retirement from academia, Lehrer says he has no
intention of returning to the music that made him famous. However,
he admits to a sneaking interest in the American musical _ not the
hyper-inflated megashows of today, but the witty, acerbic sort
created by Stephen Sondheim, with whom Lehrer went to summer camp
as a boy. He calls Sondheim ``the greatest lyricist the English
language ever produced.''
 &HT;    So he might yet write a small musical, he says, perhaps for
Off-Broadway _ where a 1980s revue, ``Tom Foolery,'' offered some
of his old songs in a theatrical context. But he'd be interested
only if he could find collaborators who shared his philosophy:
``Let's try it, and if it doesn't work at least we'll have had a
good time.''

PATRICK STEWART MASTERMINDS `X-MEN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Patrick
Stewart in a scene from ``X-Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Charles Xavier.
 &HT;    Sure, Stewart does pretty well for himself playing ``Star
Trek's'' chrome-domed Captain Picard. Yes, his stage turns in ``The
Tempest,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and ``The Ride Down Mt. Morgan''
have been impressive.
 &HT;    But it was his destiny to portray the wheelchair-bound leader of
the mutant superheroes in ``X-Men.'' Everyone on the planet knew
that ... everyone except Stewart.
 &HT;    ``The world kept that a secret from me,'' Stewart says during a
press conference at New York's Essex House. ``It was (producer)
Lauren Shuler Donner who first introduced me to that notion. So I
only lived with it for three or four years.''
 &HT;    Stewart's own family warned him that ``X-Men'' could be an even
bigger enterprise than ``Next Gen.'' And the actor himself harbored
serious concerns about portraying yet another iconic character who
might return again and again in sequels.
 &HT;    ``It felt, right at the beginning, like a lot of baggage,'' he
says. ``But the nature of the story and of this movie is that he's
a modern man in a modern context, in a 21st-century context.
 &HT;    ``Because I wasn't involved in a lot of the sequences that the
rest of the cast were, I didn't feel as though I was in a
comic-book movie,'' Stewart adds. ``I was in a real, modern movie
with serious themes, and `X-Men' is so different from the tone and
quality of `The Next Generation' that I no longer feel any kind of
conflict at all or any unease about this.
 &HT;    ``I'm just proud of the work.''
 &HT;    Much of ``X-Men'' explores the theme of outsiders struggling to
get by in the world. Stewart says it's a feeling that he could
identify with.
 &HT;    ``I grew up with what I experienced as the shame of poverty,''
the Brit says in his familiar booming voice. ``I left school when I
was 15, so my education was minimal. In my late teens, when I went
to acting school, I felt acutely that background.
 &HT;    ``Then I was also made aware of what Dr. Martin Luther King
described as the significant thing being the nature of your
character,'' he says. ``That helped me to change how I viewed
myself. And it's the nature of these characters that Xavier
emphasizes in this movie.''
 &HT;    Many moviegoers who've seen ``X-Men'' may be shocked that
Professor X spends a hefty chunk of the saga in a coma _ though
fans of the comic books will recall that the professor is usually
absent for long periods, for one reason or another. Others may
bemoan the lack of scenes between Stewart and Ian McKellen, who
plays Magneto, a former friend who is now Professor X's greatest
nemesis.
 &HT;    ``I don't think it's out of order to say that there were a lot
of discussions about whether there should have been more scenes,
about whether we should have met more often, about whether there
should have been more open conflict between us,'' Stewart says.
``Simply because I enjoyed Ian's company a lot, I would have liked
that.
 &HT;    ``I do think the two encounters, coming at the beginning and end
of the movie, are so strong and reverberate so well that, in fact,
there is no need for other encounters,'' he says. ``Actually, there
is a third encounter, isn't there? But it's a little odd, that
middle one.
 &HT;    ``And the film never allows you to forget the fundamental
philosophical differences the two men have,'' Stewart says, ``while
we're also sharing some points of view and a history, which is a
history of companionship and collaboration, in fact, until some
time when they parted ways.
 &HT;    ``I would hope,'' he adds, ``that, if there is a future for this
franchise, we might find more time for Magneto and Xavier to be
together.''
 &HT;    In closing the ``X'' file for now, there's one more
not-so-philosophical question for Stewart to consider: If Professor
X and Captain Picard duked it out, would the good professor kick
Picard's butt?
 &HT;    Stewart smiles.
 &HT;    ``No, but he certainly could kick s--t out of Captain Kirk,'' he
says. ``And you may quote me.''

&HT;     ELDERLY MAN SEES `MIRACLE' IN VISION PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Beebe loved to read, play poker and mow the
lawn until deteriorating eyesight prevented him from doing those
things.
</P>
<P>
   Now an experimental form of eye surgery has restored much of his
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, it's saved my life,'' said Beebe, 78, a former trader
at the Pacific Stock Exchange who underwent the surgery at the
University of California at Davis Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery involves replacing the eye's deteriorating cornea
with lab-grown cells from a donor, in this case, Beebe's sister,
Sally Kittredge of Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   An article on mostly positive results of similar surgery,
performed on six Taiwanese patients left blind or nearly blind by
damaged corneas, appears in the Thursday issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a report on mostly upbeat results of surgery on 15
patients at UC-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento is featured in
the July issue of the medical journal Cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement is ``a unique and important step'' toward
producing off-the-shelf replacement tissue for damaged corneas,
Ivan Schwab, the ophthalmologic surgeon who operated on Beebe, said
in a statement released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been transplanting corneal cells from donor eyes
for years. But the new technique allows the donor to furnish a far
smaller percentage of corneal cells (about only 5 percent, compared
with about 50 percent in the past).
</P>
<P>
   Similar techniques might allow future doctors to grow tissue for
other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we hope to translate this knowledge to the
lung, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder and other epithelial
tissues throughout the body,'' said Schwab's colleague, Dr. R.
Rivkah Isseroff. Isseroff, a UC-Davis cell biologist and
dermatologist, grows the donated cells in tissue cultures for
several weeks before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Before the surgery, Beebe said he was an omnivorous reader. He
and his wife, Jean, live in Brookings, Ore., near the California
border.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the mid-1980s, Beebe's vision gradually was
spoiled by glaucoma, or damage to the optic nerve caused by high
pressure within the eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   To read, Beebe said, he had to use ``four-power glasses plus a
magnifying glass,'' and to hold his head no more than a foot from
the printed page. He found himself paying more and more visits to
the local library, where he checked out large-print books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to quit driving,'' Beebe said. ``That was my decision,
not the state's.''
</P>
<P>
   During several years of frustration and ineffective treatments
with eye drops, he never lost hope of regaining effective vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes kept getting worse and worse,'' Jean Beebe said. ``I
thought it would take a miracle, and I didn't believe in miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem for me, was that last Christmas Eve, he
told me he couldn't drive anymore, and I hadn't driven for 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, experts referred Beebe to UC-Davis Medical Center, one
of at least two international research centers developing the
corneal growing technique.
</P>
<P>
   Kittredge donated a small percentage of the corneal stem cells
from one of her eyes. Doctors placed the stem cells in a tissue
culture and grew them for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in August 1998, Beebe underwent the surgery at UC-Davis
Medical Center. Schwab sewed the newly grown corneal tissue into
Beebe's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe went through several months of recovery, which included
drugs to prevent his immune system from rejecting the new corneal
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Now Beebe can see with 20/40 vision, compared with the former
20/200. Not perfect, but it beats the blurry vistas he once
perceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle,'' Jean Beebe said.
</P>
<P>
   The article in Thursday's New England Journal, by Dr. Ray
Jui-Fang Tsai, reported that the surgical procedure appeared to
benefit about 60 of more than 90 patients who underwent it at Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in Taipei. The article includes detailed
case histories on six of those patients.

PANTANI WINS ON MONT VENTOUX 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARPENTRAS, France _ A Tour de France daily stage has finished
atop the barren Mont Ventoux six times in the race's 97-year
history, and some of bicycle racing's strongest climbers have won
there _ Eddy Merckx, Raymond Poulidor and Charly Gaul, among them.
On Thursday, Marco Pantani added his name to the list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Italian won with a gracious assist from Lance Armstrong, who
allowed Pantani to pass him at the finish line without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   With the American setting the pace for the last 2 kilometers
(1.2 miles), the pair opened a lead of nearly half a minute over a
few chasers, including Jan Ullrich, the German who is in second
place overall behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the opportunity because Ullrich was there and he's my
top rival,'' Armstrong, the leader of the U.S. Postal Service team,
said afterward, referring to his sudden acceleration with nearly 3
kilometers (1.9 miles) left in the 149-kilometer (93.2-mile) 12th
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important to win the stage,'' he continued. ``It's
more important to win in Paris,'' where the three-week Tour
finishes July 23. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledged that he had not contested Pantani's final
surge, saying: ``In the minds of many people, he's the greatest
climber in the world. He deserved to win here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pantani acknowledged it, too, calling the Texan ``exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great champion,'' said the Mercatone Uno rider, the
winner of the 1998 Tour. Great champions, especially Miguel
Indurain, the Spaniard who won five consecutive Tours last decade
and who is an idol to Armstrong, have occasionally let a companion
in a long attack win at the line while they consolidated their hold
on the overall leader's yellow jersey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the second-place bonus of 12 seconds deducted from his
overall time and with the 29 seconds he finished ahead of Ullrich,
in fourth place, Armstrong widened his lead to 4 minutes 55
seconds. He also further demonstrated his climbing power and
domination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pantani and Armstrong were clocked in 4 hours, 15 minutes and 11
seconds, a speed of 35 kilometers (21.9 miles) an hour into a
mistral wind blowing from the front. The stage, which started in
Carpentras in sunny and moderately warm weather, finished with the
same sun but temperatures in the 40s. ``The wind was the hardest
part,'' Armstrong said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Pantani, the victory was his first in more than a year.
After he failed a blood test that indicated the use of illegal
drugs, he was expelled from the Giro d'Italia, the world's
second-ranked multiple-day race, in June 1999. He was then two days
from the finish and on his way to easy victory.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated and crushed psychologically, the Italian retired from
racing until this spring. He competed for two days then in a minor
race in Spain before withdrawing into solitude again. Late in May,
he entered the Giro at the last moment and showed his rustiness
despite a strong showing on just one of many mountain stages, where
he formerly danced away from the pack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His lack of competition has been evident in the Tour, where he
ranked 24th, more than 10-and-a-half minutes behind Armstrong, at
the start Thursday. He now ranks 12th. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left behind early in the ascent of the Ventoux, Pantani fought
back, with the veins standing out on his shaved head testifying to
his struggle. When he rejoined the leaders, he tried four times to
bolt away from them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each time he was caught, but remained strong. When Armstrong
made the decisive attack, only Pantani could stay with him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they neared the top, Armstrong was still doing all the work
at the front, continually glancing over his shoulder to see if he
had left his rival behind. He hadn't.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As usual in a bicycle race on the Ventoux, honor was paid
beforehand to Tom Simpson, the Briton who was world road race
champion in 1965 and the winner of many one-day classics in the
1960s.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was just short of his 30th birthday in 1967 when he
began the 13th stage of the Tour in blazing heat. Determined to win
a race in which he had never finished higher than sixth, the rider
had slid in the Alps to seventh place in the overall standings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Briton attacked early on the Ventoux, fell back, struggled
upward past the tree line, weaved across the road and then fell. He
was clearly exhausted and workers for his team begged him to quit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He refused, rode 200 meters more and then collapsed. Doctors
worked on him for 40 minutes and he was taken by helicopter to a
hospital in nearby Avignon, where he was pronounced dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traces of amphetamines, a common performance-booster then, were
found in his blood and his belongings. The medical explanation for
his death was that the drug had shut down his body's warning system
against overexertion in the day's terrible heat.

SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEEN BITTEN BY 9-FOOT ALLIGATOR, SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT ECKHART   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA GORDA, Fla. _ Daniel Denslinger didn't worry about the
9-foot-5-inch alligator that lived in his favorite swimming hole
until it bit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up to get air and then went back down real fast,'' said
Daniel, 14, who was swimming Tuesday afternoon with two friends in
Preacher's Lake, a 9-acre lake in this southwest Florida town.
``Wham, it snuck up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   He first thought one of his swimming buddies had grabbed him.
Then he reached down and felt the alligator's jaws locked on his
calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I punched it three times,'' said the 6-foot-tall, 220-pound
boy. ``I guess I hit it hard enough because it let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Martinoli, 15, who also was swimming, yelled at Daniel
to leave the water. Once he was on the bank, Daniel saw the blood
and said he threw a brick at the alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I put on my clothes and left,'' he said. ``I didn't want
it coming back for seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and his friends scrambled to a nearby street and flagged
down a sheriff's patrol car. The youth was taken to Charlotte
Regional Medical Center, where he received 11 stitches in his left
calf and five in his right.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Greg Cadzow, 38, said he has told the boy not to
swim in the lake, but can't monitor him during work hours. ``Short
of chaining him to the fence, I can't watch him every minute of the
day,'' Cadzow said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel promised that he would listen from now on. Several of his
friends, however, said they'll go back to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have always done it. This isn't going to stop them,''
said John McGaughey, whose son also swam at the lake Tuesday.
``I've been here for 20 years. We used to go swimming there. It's
part of living in Florida. The gators are around.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and his friends said they saw the alligator regularly
during their swims. Most days, it came out at about 7 p.m. and
stared them down as they were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The gator attacked Daniel at about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, while he
and Michael were seeing who could hold his breath under water the
longest. Daniel had rolled himself into a ball and was holding his
knees to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Officers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission trapped and killed the 9-foot-5-inch alligator late
Tuesday. Harry Dutton of the commission's alligator management
section speculated that the gator and the boy accidentally bumped
into each other underwater, where visibility is limited.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth reported alligator bite in Florida this year.
None have been fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation commission spokesman Gary Morse said Daniel was
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he extended himself and started beating on this
alligator, it probably figured it was more than it could handle,''
Morse said. ``Alligators are opportunistic feeders, but they are
not indiscriminate. They are generally afraid of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse said the alligator was the only one in the lake. Last
fall, officials drained most of the water out of Preacher's Lake to
search its muddy bottom for a missing 4-year-old girl. At that
time, trappers pulled three alligators out of the lake and killed
them to search their entrails for signs of the girl, who is still
missing.

`NUREMBURG' :  HUMANIZING HISTORY IS A TRICKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the defining problem with ``Nuremberg,'' TNT's ambitious,
well-meaning two-part miniseries about the trial of Nazi war
criminals: the ``best'' character in the movie is Hermann Goering.
</P>
<P>
   Through Brian Cox's complex performance, Goering _ founder of
the Gestapo and Hitler's No. 2 _ becomes his finest self. He is
urbane, loyal and courageous _ and he gets the best lines. ``The
victors will always be the judges, the vanquished always the
accused,'' he says with world-weary knowingness.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his fellow defendants, he refuses to cower or
apologize to curry favor with his accusers. He even sounds
reasonable as he explains German anti-Semitism to the Jewish
therapist sent by the Allied lawyers to gather information. When
his wife and young daughter are kept from visiting him in prison,
it seems downright unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the filmmakers haven't whitewashed Nazi war crimes.
Like the 1961 film, ``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' this docudrama turns
testimony of deprivation and unimaginable cruelty into riveting
courtroom drama and plays its emotional trump card with film from
the Nazi camps. So while the production's Goering may seem like an
engaging fellow, he was clearly a reigning spirit in an enterprise
of unsurpassing evil.
</P>
<P>
   The humanizing of history _ especially in dealing with difficult
subjects like genocide _ is a tricky business, especially in the
context of a television miniseries. The dialogue is crammed with
explanations: ``Our task is to make sure this is not the trial of
superior might, but the trial of superior morality,'' says Robert
Jackson (Alec Baldwin), the U.S. Supreme Court justice who was the
chief prosecutor at Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   But even trials of superior morality can become tedious, so the
filmmakers decided to spice the proceedings with Jackson's budding
extramarital romance with his assistant, Elsie Douglas (Jill
Hennessy). Two questions compete for our attention during the first
two-thirds of Part 1: Will the Nazis be given a fair trial? Will
Elsie and Bob kiss?
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, sober and appropriately more portly than sexy, delivers
Jackson's lofty courtroom speeches with quiet dignity. There isn't
much, however, that he can do to deflate the pompousness of his
character's private musings. When Elsie admires his eloquence, he
agrees with her: ``I've tried to capture a tone, a mood for the
entire case, a melancholy grandeur if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Hennessy has the thankless task of casting moony glances at
her boss-lover _ and the equally thankless task of elucidation
through stating the obvious. When she and Jackson _ she calls him
Bob _ first confront the sad rubble of Nuremberg the city, she
says, ``When my brother came here as a college student _ I still
have a picture book he bought me _ it was nothing like this. This
isn't even the same city. There were medieval bridges and
gingerbread houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob explains further, like a tour guide, ``Nuremberg was also
the spiritual center of the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have set themselves an enormous task, trying to
sort out the moral and behavioral conundrums that gave rise to the
Third Reich. They've assigned the job of illuminating the biggest
questions _ of German compliance and the very nature of evil _ to
Capt. Gustav Gilbert (Matt Craven), the American psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   Goering, amused to find out that his shrink is a Jew, says to
him, ``This is a very interesting situation for both of us.'' The
obedient Albert Speer (Herbert Knaup) explains to the doctor that
Germans like to follow orders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to Jackson, Gilbert confides his conclusions. ``I think
I've come close to defining it,'' he declares. ``Evil, I think, is
the absence of empathy.'' Well, maybe, but aren't there many cold,
unfeeling unempathetic people who don't commit torture and murder
on a genocidal scale?
</P>
<P>
   Through its educational division, Turner Broadcasting will
distribute study guides to schools along with the film to help
students ``analyze the trials from multiple perspectives, explore
how history is interpreted in film and study themes of individual
responsibility and the nature of evil.'' That sounds promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the film itself reminded me of the conclusions of the
novelist and journalist Rebecca West, in her brilliant first-hand
reports on the Nuremberg trials. ``We were going to hang 11 of
these 18 men, and imprison the other seven for 10, 15, 20 years or
for life; but we had no idea why they had done what they did,'' she
wrote (never mentioning their empathy, or lack thereof). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``We had learned what they did, beyond all doubt,
and that is the great achievement of the Nuremberg trial. No
literate person can now pretend that these men were anything but
abscesses of cruelty. But we learned nothing about them that we did
not know before, except that they were capable of heroism to which
they had no moral right, and that there is nothing in the legend
that a bully is always a coward.''

&HT;     ABORTION GROUP GIVES WOULD-BE BUSH RUNNING MATES A FAILING
GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading abortion advocacy group on Thursday
attacked potential running mates for Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
giving all but two poor or failing grades on abortion rights while
awarding good or excellent marks to likely Democratic vice
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a
30-year-old Washington-based organization that lobbies lawmakers
and runs a political action committee that gives money to
pro-choice candidates, rated the 10 possible nominees from each
party on a scale from ``A'' (staunchly pro-choice) to ``F''
(staunchly anti-choice).
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, NARAL gave New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman and New York Gov. George Pataki good marks for supporting
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Republicans received the organization's top score.
Whitman, considered one of the most pro-choice among her party's
leaders, received a ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   NARAL said in its assessment of Whitman that she ``demonstrates
leadership'' on pro-choices legislative matters, however, ``more
consistency is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said Whitman's record was tarnished because she signed
a bill last year requiring women under 18 to notify their parents
to obtain an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL gave Pataki a ``C,'' calling his efforts to support
abortion rights ``unfocused.'' While Pataki ``has urged the
Republican Party to moderate its anti-choice stance,'' the group
said in a statement, he also has supported restrictions on access
to abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   The group gave Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge a ``D,'' labeling his
record ``disappointing,'' and asserting that his state is one of
the most restrictive in the nation in terms of access to abortion
services.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible GOP vice presidential nominees assessed
received ``Fs.'' They are: former Red Cross chief Elizabeth Dole;
Michigan Gov. John Engler; Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel; Ohio Rep.
John Kasich; Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating; Tennessee Sen. Fred
Thompson; and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, NARAL said seven of the possible vice
presidential nominees earned ``As'' on abortion rights. They are:
Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin; California Sen. Dianne Feinstein;
Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry; Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman; former Maine Sen. George Mitchell; Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson; and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sen. Bob Graham received a ``B,'' while the lowest
grade, a ``C,'' went to Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Graham received his grade, the organization said, because he has
voted to trim public funds for abortions. While Gephardt's record
has become increasingly pro-choice, NARAL concluded that his
``votes that safeguard the tenets of Roe and access to reproductive
health care and abortion services for low-income women are
wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
hopeful, and Bush are keeping the names of potential running mates
closely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Referring the vice presidential candidates, NARAL executive vice
president Alice Germond said: ``These are the people who may one
day be president. Will they protect or jeopardize every women's
right to choose? For the millions of pro-choice Americans who take
their values with them to the voting booth, the answer could well
determine whether and how they vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the advancing age of Supreme Court members, some abortion
rights activists believe that Bush might seek to undo the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision to legalize abortion by naming anti-abortion
justices to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion except in the case of rape, incest or when
the life of the mother is in danger. Gore supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of a woman's right to choose may well determine the
outcome of this election, and this right may ultimately be
determined by its result,'' Germond told a news conference, calling
abortion rights a ``swing issue'' with voters that could resonate
in key battleground states in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   In its assessments of the officials, NARAL considered voting
records, overall commitment to upholding the Roe vs. Wade decision,

CHILDREN FAIL TO GET PRESCRIBED MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM LOCKETTE   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Many children who suffer from chronic
illnesses don't receive the daily medications they need, even
though medications are available, a recent University of Florida
study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that failure to take prescription medication is the
biggest health care problem we face today,'' said Leslie Hendeles,
a pharmacy professor at the University of Florida and one of the
study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Hendeles and pediatric medicine professor Dr. James Sherman
conducted a study of the pharmacy refill histories of 116 children
who suffer from asthma. The refill histories _ obtained with the
permission of the children's doctors _ showed that 43 of the
children had received only half the medication they were
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers determined that only half the doctors they contacted
knew their patients weren't taking their medicine as prescribed.
The researchers say they were not surprised to find that one-third
of the children were receiving only half their medication. Previous
studies have shown that as many as 30 percent to 70 percent of
adult asthma patients don't take their medications as prescribed,
Hendeles said, and similar results have been reported in studies of
patients with other chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem,is known as ``medication non-adherence,'' Hendeles
said. And patients may lie to their doctors about the medicine they
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``People lie to their doctors all the time,'' Sherman said.
``About 10 percent of the patients I see for the first time never
pick up their prescription, but they leave here saying they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that adult patients cite a number of
reasons for not taking medications doctors prescribe, Hendeles
said. Adults often avoid medications because they have busy
schedules, have begun to feel better or don't trust a doctor's
diagnosis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parents in the study were not asked why they didn't fill
prescriptions for their children, though Hendeles said some parents
may cut back on the dosage for their children because they don't
trust the doctor's opinion. ``They do it as a form of passive
resistance,'' Hendeles said.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age patients often refuse to take medications because they
don't want to admit they have an illness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are urging doctors to check with their patients'
pharmacists to determine whether patients are filling
prescriptions. Most doctors do not check, Sherman said, because of
the time required.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the practice disturbs some patients. ``I've had a
lot of patients get very angry at me when I've checked on them this
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hendeles said that doctors should take the time to check,
especially when their patients are children. ``It's not a
comfortable subject, and a lot of doctors don't want to deal with
it,'' he said.

&HT;     MOTHER ARRESTED IN WAKE OF CHAT ROOM `ADOPTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a case an adoption expert calls rare and
dangerous, a California woman is accused of giving her 10-year-old
son to a stranger, a Florida man who had expressed interest in
adopting a boy in an Internet chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said her son's discipline problems were stressing, so
she allowed the man to pick up the boy at her Vacaville, Calif.,
home April 20 and fly him back to St. Petersburg, Fla., the next
day, said Vacaville police Detective Patrick Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Chase, 29, who now lives in Elmira, was arrested after her
stepson alerted the police last Friday. She has been charged with
child endangerment, child abandonment and failure to provide for a
child. Chase, who has been freed on $1,000 bail, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg police retrieved the boy, apparently unharmed,
early Saturday from the home of Gustaf and Deborah Sjoberg, Cowan
said. The couple, who have four legally adopted children and a
child born to them, have not been charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were cooperative but upset when the boy was taken,
said St. Petersburg police spokesman Dan Bates. Bates quoted a
police report that stated, ``They said they were seeing how (the
boy) did living with them before they started the adoption
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy is in a Florida foster home awaiting a judge's order
returning him to California. He will most likely be placed in a
foster home in California, Cowan said, although child services
workers are attempting to reach his father in a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to come home,'' Cowan said. ``He does want to be with
his mom. It's pretty amazing what kids can go through and still
want to be with a parent.''

`THE FIVE SENSES': FILM DRIFTS AMID SHALLOWNESS OF CHARACTERS AND
PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Five Senses'' engages the sense of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Jeremy Podeswa, gives the picture the warm
darkness of autumn, with shadows drifting through the scenes like
lost thoughts. It's too bad narrative isn't a sense; the attempt to
deal with each of the senses here is so schematic that the movie
drifts just like those shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The most enjoyable scenes are those between Rona (Mary-Louise
Parker, who, with her suggestive lower lip and brimming, clear
eyes, looks like Mary Tyler Moore with all the primness ironed out)
and her best friend, Robert (Daniel MacIvor), cattily going over
the pitfalls of relationships. Their sense of smell is involved
because they think most relationships stink. Robert also thinks he
can smell love, which is why he is meeting with his former lovers,
male and female, to determine if any have true feelings for him. He
wants to meet Rona's current lover, an Italian chef (Marco
Leonardi) with whom she had a fling while on vacation in Europe.
And although they have no language in common _ no spoken language,
anyway _ he is about to move in with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Five Senses'' is centered on a single office building
where Rona is a baker. On another floor is an ophthalmologist
(Pascale Bussieres), who is going deaf and wants to re-experience
the sounds that have brought him comfort before he completely loses
his hearing. Down the hall from him is Ruth (Gabrielle Rose), a
masseuse who is totally out of touch with her teen-age daughter,
Rachel (Nadia Litz). When the young child of one of her clients
disappears while in her daughter's care, their rocky relationship
is further disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The film uses its umbrella to deal with urban alienation, and
all its characters are out of touch and having a hard time
communicating except on the shallowest levels. Each character is
estranged from the world and has a hard time trusting others. By
interweaving several stories, the movie suffers from a peculiar
multiplier effect: it deepens its shallowness. The vanished-child
subplot, a dreary melodrama, almost derails a movie that is too
diffuse for its own good anyway. And as a metaphor for loss, this
plot element brings added strain to a movie that's almost all
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rona-and-Robert scenes (the names of all the major
characters start with R) have a prickly zest. Parker's squirminess
radiates unsureness; she can often seem like a little girl trying
to get comfortable in a grown woman's body, and the shifting
translates into a physical manifestation of neurosis. MacIvor's
character is an eager busybody whose discomfort comes from
involving himself in his own life. There is more going on with
these characters than with the others because they are talking to
each other, and their inability to assess themselves is a more
satisfying version of the ideas that Podeswa, who also wrote the
script, is pushing to get across elsewhere. The film's smaller
moments last. Rachel is lured into a park by a boy (Brendan
Fletcher), and the charge that these two misfits get from their
voyeurism _ watching a couple make out in the park is almost
presexual _ is a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa shows some talent with his actors, but there is too much
underplayed sobriety, a deliberate quality that may strike some as
nuance but is more like politeness filling in for anomie. What he
wants to do in ``The Five Senses'' is show residents of a city,
members of a community _ as represented by the building _ as being
so wrapped up in themselves that they've lost the capacity for
simple stimulation. This is overarticulated in the scene with
Bussieres, who is instructed in smaller joys by a heart-of-gold
hooker with a deaf child. If all compromises were worked out as
easily as they are in this movie, there would be no need for drama.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will increase in coverage over the northeast
quarter of the nation as a large disturbance in the jet stream
develops over the eastern Great Lakes. A warm, humid air flow from
the south will draw moisture inland along the East Coast. At the
same time, cooler winds from the northwest will follow a cold front
as it traverses the Ohio Valley. A few strong thunderstorms will
erupt in western New York and Pennsylvania and move slowly east.
</P>
<P>
   A torrid air mass will cover the Plains and eastern Rockies with
afternoon temperatures approaching 100 degrees in many sections
from Texas to Montana. Slightly cooler air will filter into
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air over the South will produce a few clusters of
thunderstorms. Gusty winds will accompany the storms in northern
Florida. Afternoon thundershowers will spread into the deserts of
the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler weather is expected in the Northwest as a front pushes
inland. Clouds will cover the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUMMER SNOW
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers fell over the higher terrain of eastern France on
Thursday as an unusually cold air mass swept inland from the North
Sea. Snow was noted as low as 5,940 feet or the altitude of the
suburbs of Denver. The remarkable feature of this mid-summer cold
snap is its proximity to last week's record heat wave along the
Mediterranean. Just a week ago, temperatures exceeded 100 degrees
in southern France.

   CLINTON-NAACP _ BALTIMORE _ President Clinton launched a
broadside attack against the Republican Party on Thursday, saying
the record of Senate opposition to his judicial appointments _ and
the ``stone cold silence'' on the matter by Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas _ reflects a bias against African Americans and other racial
minorities. ``They don't want them on the court, but they don't
want you to know they don't want them on the court,'' Clinton said
in remarks before the NAACP's national convention. Clinton singled
out Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., by name as a long-term opponent of
African Americans on the Supreme Court. And, while he didn't name
them, Clinton assailed both Texas senators for their role in
thwarting his nomination of Enrique Moreno to the 5th Circuit
Federal Court of Appeals. (Deans, Cox News Service)

KIMBELL-STROGANOFF-TEX STROGANOFF COLLECTION A RARE INSIGHT INTO A(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Once in a very long while, an art exhibition
bursts on the scene that holds the imagination hostage.
``Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble
Family'' is just such an exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Through its sheer size and stellar quality, Stroganoff acts as a
polished mirror on the cultural ebb and flow of an entire nation
over a long swath of time. On display for the next three months at
the Kimbell Art Museum, the collection sets innumerable high-water
marks. Almost all of its 230 pieces deserve the encomium
``masterwork.'' To add to the allure, the art comes shawled in
mystery, as so much of it has been hermetically sealed away from
public view, not seen together since the collection's
nationalization following the 1917 Russian Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the Stroganoff collection's ultimate distinction is
how singular it is. It is synonymous with the bubbling aesthetic
ferment of a historically shuttered society yearning to Westernize.
The Stroganoffs, both as a family and as Russia's unofficial
cultural curators, maintained their noble standing over 500 years
of Russia's imperial history, even as they steered the
sensibilities of its famed autocrats (Peter the Great and Catherine
the Great, among others) toward the highest expressions of the
Western aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the rarefied altitude of the Stroganoffs' collection
that it is comparable only to that of the Russian czars. Everything
including gilded, large-paneled Russian icons (taken from several
of the Stroganoff family churches), choice classical antiquities,
sumptuous palace furnishings, and a selection of some of the most
noteworthy old-master paintings have been assembled in an
unprecedented reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Culled from the opulent collections at the State Hermitage
Museum in St. Petersburg, the State Russian Museum in Moscow and
various imperial palaces, many of the Stroganoff pieces stand out
simply because of their link to Russian history. A stunning
tripod-legged coupe done in malachite, mosaic and gilt bronze, for
example, acts as an artistic greeting card from the picture gallery
of the Stroganoff Palace, one of 18th-century St. Petersburg's
finest architectural statements.
</P>
<P>
   Though the scope of the Stroganoff collection will tug a
patron's attention in many directions, it is a safe bet that one
will be inexorably drawn to the exhibit's collection of old-master
paintings. Works by Sandro Botticelli, Anthony Van Dyck, and Claude
Lorrain are of particular note. Such is the collection's
versatility that it can time-travel from the 17th century's ``The
Battle of Lapiths and Centaurs'' by Luca Giordano through some
choice 18th-century French works by Antoine Watteau and
Jean-Baptiste Greuze.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stroganoff exhibit's breadth cannot be overestimated.
The exhibit lopes through hundreds of years of civilization,
showing neither geographic nor epochal favoritism. The family's
peregrinations helped it accumulate antique silver from the Middle
East's Sasanian dynasty, pre-Columbian works unearthed in ancient
Mexico, Chinese decorative pieces, and medieval crosses from
Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   And from the era when the Stroganoffs founded various churches
and monasteries come textiles richly braided in gold and silver
thread, various precious objects filigreed in enamel and silver,
and a jaw-dropping collection of icons acting as powerful
ecclesiastic tools with intrinsic artistic value.
</P>
<P>
   Given such a rich selection of objects and objets d'art _ from
figurines to grand tableaux _ ``Stroganoff: The Palace and
Collections of a Russian Noble Family'' is an exhibit to be seen
more than once. ___

EXCLUSIVE! INTERVIEW WITH HARRY POTTER!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's Note: After months of secret negotiations,
Star-Telegram Books Editor Jeff Guinn was granted an exclusive
interview with boy wizard Harry Potter, star of the J.K. Rowling
books bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   Following three international bestsellers, ``Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth book in the series, was released
last weekend. In a wide-ranging interview with Guinn, the
14-year-old discussed the pressures of fame, the real stories
behind certain hitherto-inexplicable phenomena, and even his crush
on an American TV star.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difficulty in securing the interview was in reaching
agreement with Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, on just how much Harry would be allowed to
tell us about magic, parallel universes and the school.
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth the protracted negotiations. Guinn reports:
``I thought I'd meet with Harry at Hogwarts, but instead Hogwarts'
groundskeeper Hagrid took me to a nearby village called Hogsmeade,
where he said only `magic folk' can live. He kept repeating what an
honor it was for a `Muggle' like me to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry was waiting in a pub called Three Broomsticks. I
recognized him right away _ the round glasses, the zigzag scar on
his forehead, and his bright green eyes were giveaways. But as he
asked if I'd care for a mug of butterbeer, I found myself overcome
by the feeling that I'd seen this kid somewhere before.'' ___ &QC; 
By JEFF GUINN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Q: First, I have to say I feel like I've seen you before _
somewhere else, that is, outside of Rowling's books.
</P>
<P>
   HP: (Smiling sheepishly) Well, before Ms. Rowling began writing
about my life, I did some modeling. It was for another book series,
so they don't really want me talking about it. There were quite a
few titles, fiction books, and they were all about finding this boy
Waldo. I modeled for the illustrations. My Uncle Vernon set that
job up for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whoa! In the first three ``Harry Potter'' books, your Uncle
Vernon, his wife, Petunia, and their son, Dudley, are portrayed as
nasty Muggles _ nonmagical humans _ who hate you. So why would
Vernon help you get the Waldo job?
</P>
<P>
   HP: (Laughs.) You don't believe everything in the Rowling books,
I hope. Haven't you heard of dramatic license? Uncle Vernon is my
business manager. He and Aunt Petunia lovingly raised me. They're
really a bit put out with Ms. Rowling, how she characterizes them.
The whole idea behind the books was to raise money for the school's
endowment, and none of us knew why they hired an unknown writer.
But I guess Ms. Rowling has turned out OK. And besides, Uncle
Vernon got a nice royalties deal for the books, so why complain?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused. Are Rowling's books about real things that
happened to you, or not?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Oh, there's some truth in each of them. There are some of us
in the world with magical powers. We call the rest of you
unfortunates ``Muggles,'' as you know. We go to Hogwarts for seven
years to become fully trained wizards and witches.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the Sorcerer's Stone, and the Chamber of Secrets _ was all
that made up?
</P>
<P>
   HP: No, no. Well, not entirely. There's a boulder on the
Hogwarts grounds we call the Sorcerer's Stone. They have to
sandblast it about once a month to remove graffiti. It's sad,
really. The Chamber of Secrets is the faculty lounge, where our
teachers prepare their examination papers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other characters in the books, like your pals
Hermione and Ron?
</P>
<P>
   HP: They're really students at Hogwarts. Look, don't be mistaken
_ the magic is real. You Muggles occasionally encounter some of it,
which in turn creates many of your myths and legends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you prove that?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Fine. Where do you think you are?
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade. We're drinking
butterbeer, which, by the way, is good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   HP: That's where you think you are. But where is Hogsmeade,
really?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Somewhere in England.
</P>
<P>
   HP: Wrong! When you got aboard the Hogwarts Express, you passed
through spatial dimensions to another part of the world entirely.
This town, this pub, though invisible to other Muggles, is actually
in the American state of New Mexico, just outside a rather
interesting little town. I believe you have a TV series that's
supposed to be set here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not Roswell?
</P>
<P>
   HP: How did you know that? Oh boy, I think I might be in
trouble. Well, what the heck. You see, we needed space to practice
quidditch, the sport where we fly around on brooms. Over the years,
sometimes one or another of us would get frisky and fly a little
too close to the Muggle townspeople. ``Voila,'' your alien invasion
stories begin. See?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes, I'm beginning to. What other inexplicable phenomena are
you responsible for?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Just think for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Um ... Sasquatch?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Yep. He strayed away from one of our Care of Magical
Creatures classes. Very docile, really. Loves almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Loch Ness Monster?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And Britney Spears?
</P>
<P>
   HP: We had nothing to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No, what I meant was, any truth to the rumors that you're
dating her?
</P>
<P>
   HP: None whatsoever. This is what I hate about fame. The media
and the fans think they should know everything about your private
life, and they make up what they can't learn. Yes, I met Britney.
Nice girl, I guess. But, really, she's a bit old for me. To be
honest, though, there is an American girl I have a bit of a thing
for.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not that I, personally, am curious, but, for the sake of our
readers, could you tell us more?
</P>
<P>
   HP: (Sighs.) All right. Alyson Hannigan. You know, Willow on the
TV show ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' She's a great girl. Hogwarts
alum, in fact. She was graduating just as I came in. The witchcraft
she practices on the show? Learned it all in school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It all makes sense when you explain it. But I'm still
wondering about something else.
</P>
<P>
   HP: Ask whatever you like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the books, there's so much about evil Lord Voldemort, who
supposedly killed your parents and gave you that scar on your
forehead. The one who is trying to take over the world for his own
evil purposes. True or false?
</P>
<P>
   HP: True AND false. I got this scar playing Zorro with Ron and
Hermione. At Hogwarts, when we have pretend duels we use real
swords. But there IS an evil wizard out to rule the world, and he
has equally evil minions. And my poor parents, yes. I don't like to
talk about that, if you don't mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's frightening! Evil minions? Can you tell us who?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Frankly, all of us magical folk are amazed you Muggles
haven't figured it out. It's so plain. (Looks at his watch.) Are we
nearly done here? I hope I'm not being rude.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No, not at all. Last thing. What about you? What's in Harry
Potter's future?
</P>
<P>
   HP: Well, I'm under contract for three more books. After that, I
graduate, and we'll see what happens from there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you're so well-known for these books, will it be
hard to move on to something else?
</P>
<P>
   HP: I don't think so. After the second book sold in the tens of
millions, Uncle Vernon renegotiated my contract. Now I get a cut of
everything _ book royalties, film rights, video games, clothing
lines ... the money will be there to let me do exactly what I want.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what would that be?
</P>
<P>
   HP: What I really want to do is direct.

&HT;     NOTED FLY FISHERMAN PROTECTS HIS WATERY DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRED LeBRUN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The king and his river, Lloyd Bull and the West
Canada Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other legends of fly fishing in New York state _ Lee
Wulff, Harry Darbee, Walt Dette and Fran Betters, to name a few _
Lloyd was never one to court the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, like the river he's fished for more than a
half-century, Lloyd has kept a low profile and kept relatively
obscure considering the high level of his expertise, the company
he's traveled in, and his innovations and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' is Lloyd's immediate and thunderous reaction to that
assessment, complete with big, beaming smile. ``Let's keep it that
way. We have somewhat of an unspoiled river here, and the quickest
way to have that change is too many fishermen. Oh yes, it has
changed anyway, sure. It's a lot busier than it used to be ... but
one of the reasons I resisted writing a book about the West Canada
is that I know the pressure would increase incredibly if word got
out.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, this man could write some book.
</P>
<P>
   West Canada Creek _ but it's really a river _ originates for all
practical purposes from the Hinckley Reservoir, some 15 miles north
of Utica. But the reservoir, notes Randy Kulig, owner of the Golden
Drake Fly Shop in Middleville, fills up from the Moose River
drainage in the Adirondacks. Acid rainwater neutralizing over
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   There's about 30 miles of surprisingly uniform river on the West
Canada, all of it good general trout water, dropping at a pretty
steady pitch, from Trenton Falls out of Hinckley down to Herkimer,
where it joins the Erie Canal. The top 2 1/2 miles are maintained
by the state as a year-round, no-kill trophy section, and gets a
lot of use. Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)
biologist Al Schiavone, supervisor of natural resources out of
region 6 in Watertown, said, ``We'd like to expand the no-kill. But
we have to hear from the sportsmen's groups and the fishermen
before we can, and sure, there's always opposition. Maybe over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown trout, big browns and lots of them, dominate the upper
reaches. Some escaped rainbows and brookies from the feeder streams
and tribs are there, as well, Schiavone said. ``There are no
waterfalls or dams breaking up the West Canada, which is unusual in
New York State,'' he said. ``This stream is more like a western
river. It's mostly gravel base, a freestone, with good hatches.
Water quality has definitely improved, and so has the fishing, and
that is primarily due to improved water release out of Trenton
Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, especially, with all the rain, water flows have been
constant and substantial. Hatches are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the West Canada as two distinct rivers,'' Kulig
said. ``It's a freestone stream when the dam opens up. But when it
shuts off, the river is more like a spring creek, low, clear, and
very tough fishing. The trout get very spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dam does open up, and water temperatures drop as the
river rises, it takes eight hours for the effect to be felt all the
way down river in Herkimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, the water on this river has gotten much
better,'' Kulig said. ``There's been a lot of septic cleanup by the
state, and the Borden condensed milk plant is gone, and so is the
plywood plant. No tanneries anymore. This used to be known far and
wide as a caddis river. But now we're noticing more and more
mayflies that used to be rare, like brown drakes and little
sulphurs dominating the hatches.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Blue Rose Diner in Newport on Route 28, about
halfway up the river, Lloyd paused over his meat loaf and made an
observation as if it just occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Canada is the best trout stream in the state.'' He
raised his eyebrows and smiled conspiratorially. His wife, Carol,
used to his antics, just laughed. You can tell, they still get a
kick out of each other.
</P>
<P>
   At 75, Lloyd has the limber walk and confidence of a man half
his age. Later, when we strode down to the stream not far from the
diner, he walked right along and shuffled over slick boulders like
he'd done this all his life, which he has. He's a wet-fly
fisherman, somewhat out of vogue these days, but still darned
effective in the right hands, and these are the right hands. He
uses a tandem setup of three flies at a time, minuscule gray and
brown nymphs that he has tied lean and mean. Patterns he's devised
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He reads the water, stares hard at it, then makes a purposeful
cast of a moderate distance, and quickly mends the line back
against the current to maintain a drag-free drift. A sharp dip to
the rod. He's got a good brown on, which he plays and releases in a
quick motion. It's a rare day when Lloyd Bull goes fishing that he
doesn't hook more than a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I only keep one good one, for Carol. And then not
always,'' says Lloyd, who's a little hard of hearing but otherwise
as sharp and full of life as ever.
</P>
<P>
   He can be a rascal. He's long been a professional angler on the
Cortland Line Company team of endorsers and pros, and he loves
nothing more than guiding fly fishers and teaching them. Or merely
following the experts down a stream and catching twice as many as
they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady luck always seems to be good to me,'' he said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The West Canada has been good to Lloyd, but he's made his own
luck. He turned out to be a very good businessman, retiring from
the fuel oil business, which afforded him the luxury of plenty of
travel and all the fishing he wants. As a young man, he was in the
right place at the right time. He was at Penn State taking the
first fly fishing course from George Harvey, the dean emeritus of
American fly fishing, who has remained his lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Bull has a ton of stories about his friend Leon Chandler,
the president of Cortland and a member of the Fly Fishing Hall of
Fame. Of meeting Vince Marinaro on a stream outside State College
and being persuaded into trying an ant pattern for a big brown, and
the ensuing battle. Of the yearly family outings on Great Bear Lake
and his catching world-record lake trout.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are his designs and innovations. His peacock herl
nymph, introduction of lead core shooting head. After the DEC
closed Catherine Creek to fishing with natural fish eggs, he
devised from bits of sponge the first egg patterns, ``and I caught
76 rainbows in one day, some big ones,'' Bull said
matter-of-factly. Not bragging, not exaggerating. A 10-inch fish is
a 10-inch fish, I found when we got on the stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who's forgotten in one week more about this river
than I've accumulated in 25 years,'' said Randy Kulig, no slouch
himself with a fly rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. All important stuff you're writing down there,'' Bull
said, rising from the Blue Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? Let's go fishin'.''

BUSH DEBUNKS REPORT ABOUT VP SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ There is a short list. Only three people know who's
on it. And some prospects have already been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Hard into the processs of choosing a running mate, Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush talked at length Thursday
about his decision-making process, the timing of his announcement,
and the sympathy he feels for reporters desperate to scoop the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said the only people who know anything are
his wife, Laura Bush; the search director, Dick Cheney; and
himself. Staff members, he said, ``may think they know something
based on a hint or two.''
</P>
<P>
   He called a recent report by Bloomberg News Service listing
three finalists _ New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania
Governor Thomas Ridge, and former Red Cross director Elizabeth Dole
_ false. ``It's not true; I promise it's not true,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard his chartered campaign plane, Bush told reporters that
``there has been serious vetting'' of the candidates. Financial
documents, legal documents, and medical records all are being
examined closely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was headed for this important battleground state to attend
the Pennsylvania Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. In a brief
speech in which he called for rebuilding the military's morale, he
proposed a $75 million program to pair veterans with at-risk youths
through community centers.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference with Ridge at his side, Bush was asked
whether he was standing next to his running mate. ``I'm not
telling,'' he said, though he called Ridge ``a good friend'' and
said, ``Tom's under consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   When a local reporter suggested that he would carry Pennsylvania
with Ridge on the ticket, Bush shot back, ``I would certainly hope
so.''
</P>
<P>
   On the vice presidential selection process, Bush said he has no
plans to bring people to Austin for interviews, requiring them to
make dramatic entrances past hordes of prying reporters. ``It's
just not my style,'' he said, adding that ``I want to bring some
order and privacy to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not reveal the list of people he's
scrutinizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stress the candidates,'' he said. ``I just
want to keep this as close to the vest as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is weighting his decision according to geography,
Bush said, ``I'm more interested in the compatability and who could
be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust is an important ingredient, too. ``I don't have to be
looking over my shoulder or watching my back if I'm president,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The job of vice president, which Bush said he knows something
about from his father's years in the office, has become more
important during the past quarter-century. He even gave credit to
his Democratic opponent, the current vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondale, my dad, Quayle, and Al Gore,'' said Bush. ``All of
them have been very able vice presidents. All have been assigned
specific tasks. All of them gave counsel to their president, and
all of them did a very good job keeping their counsel private.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been thinking about announcing his choice during the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, which begins July 31, though
he worries about stepping on the message of the day with a big
piece of news. He's also been thinking of rolling out his running
mate in the days before the convention, like Bob Dole did in 1996
with Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you want to make the announcement too early,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Bush said he feels sympathy for the reporters under
orders to get the running mate news first. He even offered to call
up editors and tell them to knock it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do feel for you because it's not fair,'' he said.
Later, he said, ``I don't want you to get fired. I want everybody
to get a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he hasn't made up his mind yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew,'' he said, ``I would tell you.''

FAMILIAR ICONS WITH A BOLD FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lot has changed about the art world during the 20
years or so since Barbara Kruger came onto the scene with her
photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Depending
on one's perspective, she has bravely stuck to her guns or she has
become a one-note relic. Either way, her retrospective, which has
landed at the Whitney from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles, where it was even bigger and flashier, represents a career
whose concerns were fixed, as were the arguments about it, by the
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put off those arguments for just a moment to delay what
has become a familiar and fairly dreary debate over politics and
art. You probably know Kruger's work, even if you don't recognize
her name. Not many contemporary artists can say their art has
reached masses of people outside the art circuit. Kruger can.
</P>
<P>
   Her message-bearing billboards, magazine covers, op-ed
illustrations and window displays (there's one now at Saks on Fifth
Avenue), along with her designs for T-shirts, coffee mugs, baseball
caps and tote bags have made her art part of the visual culture at
large. There have even been knockoffs. The recent pro-abortion
rights advertising campaign in the New York City subways is one.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether Kruger's own messages about women,
money and power have in the slightest way changed the minds of
these anonymous masses whose minds she presumes need changing. But
just the visual format of the work, the trademark red, white and
black text-and-photograph montage, became, if nothing else, a brand
product of the immediate past.
</P>
<P>
   She hit upon her style by the early '80s, borrowing heavily from
Russian Constructivism, Hannah Hoch, John Heartfield and
advertising. The style consists of red frames enclosing old
black-and-white pictures culled from magazines, manuals and
photographic annuals. The pictures are overlaid with words in bold
italics. Kruger favors offbeat and opaque photographs, '40s and
'50s vintage, often funny. Her texts are short, blunt and
accusatory. They are sometimes cliches, egregiously sarcastic,
inferentially linked to the photographs. Pronouns, liberally used,
incline toward you, we and I.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear the word culture, I take out my checkbook,''
across a photograph of a ventriloquist's dummy, is a typical print
from the mid-'80s that you'll find in the Whitney show. The
implications that money corrupts art and that rich collectors are
dummies, as is usual with Kruger, jokes about without quite
resolving the tricky problem that her work is a part of the
commodity culture it ridicules. And not a cheap commodity, by the
way. But that is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dense and noisy, the Whitney exhibition, including audio
embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without
frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of
generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and
sense of humor. People tend to praise political art that confirms
their own politics. But an art about control and button pushing
demands that you give yourself over to it completely. If not _
well, then you are missing the point or don't get the joke or
aren't trying hard enough or actually hate political art or hate
women or hate yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your comfort is my silence'' accompanies a picture of a man
holding a finger over his lips. Notice once again Kruger's use of
pronouns.
</P>
<P>
   She has packaged her messages variously, printing images on
vinyl and on convex lenses called lenticulars. She has engraved
them into metal plates. She has designed video installations and
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The show starts with an adaptation of an installation she did
for Mary Boone's gallery years ago: ``All violence is the
illustration of a pathetic stereotype,'' printed big on a wall,
flanked by screaming faces and sandwiched into a list of racial and
ethnic epithets. In the room directly behind this installation is a
sculpture, from a recent Boone show, of John and Robert Kennedy
beaming, a peek-a-boo Marilyn Monroe on their shoulders. Another
installation, of videos of scolding heads in a room with projected
texts, pushes confrontation to an extreme _ you may judge it to be
condescension rather than confrontation _ borrowing a tip or two
from the work of Bruce Nauman, minus his essential black humor.
</P>
<P>
   Being a product of her generation, Kruger articulates its
familiar obsessions and self-regard. She was born in Newark, N.J.,
in 1945, and studied with Diane Arbus and Marvin Israel at the
Parsons School of Design in the '60s, getting a background in
photography and graphic design. A starter job at Mademoiselle
magazine turned into a position as head designer. She quit
full-time magazine work after a while and began to write poetry,
dabbled in painting and made woven pieces of brightly patterned
cloth laced with metallic yarn and sequins, one example of which
was in the 1973 Whitney Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-'70s she switched gears, juxtaposing deadpan
photographs with texts. She took her own pictures at first, of
parts of the outside of nondescript stucco buildings. The
photographs looked like the work of the Los Angeles artist Ed
Ruscha, which Kruger says didn't occur to her. Accompanying her
pictures were paragraphs she wrote about imaginary people,
presumably in the buildings. Personal melodrama belied anonymous
architecture. Distress beneath implacable surface became an
essential ingredient in her artistic recipe.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Hospital'' (1978) the texts shrank to short phrases or
words. She printed ``the manipulation of the object/the blaming of
the victim/the accusation of hysteria/the making mute'' beside a
photograph of tongue depressors, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It was then simply a matter of superimposing text onto image,
which she did in a 1980 collage of a woman on a bed with a fashion
magazine, the image stamped ``deluded.'' Kruger had gone full
circle back to Mademoiselle, which prints words on its cover
photograph every month, except, of course, that her messages were
different.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing pictures rather than photographing them made Kruger
one of the appropriationists of the '80s. The issues they raised
can seem trite now: how photographs create reality, how the media
shape power and reinforce stereotypes. Feminist artists being
particularly focused on stereotypes of women, Kruger was linked
most closely with a group that included Louise Lawler, Sarah
Charlesworth, Cindy Sherman, Silvia Kolbowski, Yvonne Rainer and
Chantal Akerman.
</P>
<P>
   Does it need to be said again how victim credentials often came
before aesthetic value? Or that choosing the art community as a
context in which to denounce elitism always seemed strangely
contradictory and unreflective? These things having been pointed
out ad nauseam, we might say instead that Kruger was one of the
'80s artists adapting Conceptualism via mass-media forms for
political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of
contemporary art, if not necessarily to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   The art world became more sex-balanced by the end of the '90s,
which was certainly a contribution. The already shaky hierarchy
involving fine art, photography, graphic design, film and video was
further disturbed. This allowed the next generation of artists to
move about more freely and un-self-consciously among different
media.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where we are today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Where is Kruger? It's hard to get too worked up about her art
any longer. An art that lives by the rules of advertising dies by
the rules of advertising. Politicians and Madison Avenue executives
know to accommodate the shifting mood. Strategies change so that
the messages won't. Images now get old by the minute. Watch
television: beer ads about beer ads' being manipulative try to
manipulate a generation that takes for granted what artists in the
'80s evidently found shocking about mass-media manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   As for what has happened inside art, young artists reacting
against the previous political stridency now explore subtler, more
aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Kruger,
operating at the same pitch and in the same modes as before,
occupies a curious place. She helped to pave the way for her own
diminished currency.
</P>
<P>
   For a political artist, at least, this probably should be viewed
as a kind of success.

   COLOMBIA-MILITARY (El Sando, Colombia) _ A three-day rampage of
torture, rape and killing by a paramilitary group took place in
this tiny village last February, with no effort by military and
police units just a few miles away to stop the slaughter. The
incident _ at the very moment when President Clinton was pushing an
aid package to step up antidrug efforts in Colombia _ strikes at
the heart of the debate over the growing American backing of the
Colombian military. For years the U.S. government and human rights
groups have had reservations about the Colombian military

   BUSH-BROTHER (Tallahassee, Fla.) _ If Gov. George W. Bush is
still hunting for a running mate, here's an ideal choice: He's a
popular young governor from the fourth largest state, one where
Democrats hope to compete ferociously. He is something of a policy
wonk, a nice balance to Bush's celebrated aversion to policy
minutiae. He is beloved among Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc.
And he has star appeal as a scion of one of the most famous
political families. Trouble is that family is named Bush. An

   GORE-BRADLEY (Green Bay, Wis.) _ With Al Gore at his side, Bill
Bradley endorsed the vice president for the White House on
Thursday, saying that ``winning is a team sport'' and Democrats
need the strength of unity. Gore called Bradley a leader ``who
brought high purpose and high ideals to our contest.'' With that,
the rivals in a harsh winter's presidential primary campaign, swept
by Gore, joined forces for the fall. It was Bradley's first
campaign appearance since he conceded to Gore after the March 7
presidential primaries. (Summary from wires) By Katharine Q.

   NY-HIP-INQUIRY (New York) _ A Special Report: Both the State
Insurance Department and the attorney general's office are
examining the finances of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New
York, looking into what former executives describe as a clubby
atmosphere that often seemed at odds with HIP's special role in the
city's health care system. Most of the questions focus on Anthony
L. Watson, a former Olympic long jumper whose taste for fancy cars
and corporate apartments has infuriated the regulators as some of
HIP's financial reserves have dwindled far below the amount
required by state law. By Christopher Drew and Melody Petersen.

   PHILADELPHIA-POLICE (Philadelphia) _ All decked out in bunting

during a running gun battle through the streets. By Francis X.

   Blame it on the Muggles.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to trump traditional bookstores, Amazon.com Inc. promised
to deliver copies of the latest Harry Potter book to customers'
doorsteps on Saturday, July 8, the first day of its release.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the Web's biggest retailer acknowledged that it
missed about 3,800 orders of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire,'' the fourth in the popular series about a young orphan
wizard-in-training. The company blamed a glitch in software
installed to handle the anticipated surge in orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received well over 300,000 pre-orders for this title and
unfortunately omitted a small percentage of eligible orders by
accident,'' the company told a customer in an e-mail message
obtained by The Boston Globe. ``We are very sorry that your book
was not shipped via FedEx Saturday Delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Amazon.com would not have botched the deliveries if
it had continued processing these orders by hand _ the old-way of
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The new software failed to recognize addresses if customers did
not fill out the first of three lines on the Web site's address
box. An Amazon.com employee _ or Muggle, meaning nonwizard, in the
Potter books _ would have started reading on the second line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of software,'' said Patty Smith, a
spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering that their packages had not arrived, jilted
shoppers began flaming Amazon.com on Web chat sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found out that Amazon screwed up on my Harry Potter
(number)(NU)4 order,'' a shopper wrote Saturday. ``So everyone else
who may be expecting FedEx to show up later this morning, you might
want to re-check that order confirmation e-mail and see if they
blew it for you or your child, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 1.5 percent of orders were not delivered on time, Smith
said. To make up for the inconvenience, the retailer has promised
to refund customers for the cost of the book and shipping fees _ a
remedy that could run as much as $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Van Winkle, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, said
he doubted the late deliveries would affect Amazon.com's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more people who walked into their local
bookstore, which didn't have the books _ and their kids screamed
all the way to the car,'' Van Winkle said. ``They got nothing.
Amazon gave them free books and free shipping.''

`THE NIGHT LARRY KRAMER KISSED ME': 1-MAN FILM CAPTURES THEATER
SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)

<P>
   Commanding the stage in a one-person show is a daunting
undertaking. Even more daunting is the attempt to command the movie
screen with such a show.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,'' David Drake,
reprising his roles as writer and performer of this Obie
Award-winning monologue, manages that feat to a praiseworthy degree
under the intelligent direction of Tim Kirkman, whose credits
include ``Dear Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   The translation of a series of monologues about the life and
times of a gay American growing up in the era of the Stonewall
riots, the first Gay Pride parade and the plague of AIDS poses the
challenge of making material based mainly on words at home in a
medium normally at its most hospitable to action.
</P>
<P>
   But Drake, whose actorly skills include movement, and Kirkman,
who resists any impulse to open the proceedings beyond the bounds
of theater while deftly employing restrained lighting and a few
props, meet and overcome this challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me'' is a reference to
the life-changing occasion on which Drake, on his 22nd birthday, on
June 27, 1985, went to see ``The Normal Heart,'' the play by
Kramer, who founded the gay rights organization Act Up and was
shaken into an angry awareness of society's indifference to the
AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's performance takes the audience through his early years
of gayness in Baltimore and his decision to leave for New York. He
recalls a symbolic Christmas gift for his father, and in the most
affecting three scenes he recreates the ambience of a gay
gymnasium, takes the onlooker through a sex-drenched night in a gay
bar, recalls friends who died of AIDS and envisions a future of gay
power.
</P>
<P>
   At his least interesting, in some of the material about Barbie
dolls and his childhood neighbor Janice, Drake can be cloying; and
the show's little touches of humor draw only titters of recognition
from its unseen audience. But in discussing indifference to AIDS,
in recreating the charged, curious atmosphere and mixed motives of
the gym, at the gay bar, and in the midst of death, Drake can be
rivetingly angry, intense, frenetic, frank and touching.
</P>
<P>
   Theater is ephemeral. The film ``The Night Larry Kramer Kissed
Me'' serves the valuable function of preserving not just a
performance but the spirit of a time.
</P>

 &HT;    There are no bionic bikers, yet
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The director sportif of the U.S. Postal Service recently ordered
Lance Armstrong and his teammates to take their laptops out of
their suitcases. For three weeks, while the Postal Service team
competes in the Tour de France, Armstrong must be without one of
his constant traveling companions.
</P>
<P>
   However, he and just about every other competitor in the Tour's
180-man field carries a cell phone at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists have lots of gadgets that make it easier for them
to ride and communicate during this intense, three-week long
marathon of a race that will end July 23 in Paris. The bikes are
high-tech and are made of carbon fibers to make them lightweight,
aerodynamic and durable.
</P>
<P>
   The watches the cyclists wear measure heart rates as well as
tell time. Even the shoes are aerodynamic and give cyclists every
advantage for a sport in which mere tenths of a second can
determine first and second place.
</P>
<P>
   Even communication is high-tech. In past Tours, sportifs would
ride by their cyclists and scratch words on a chalkboard, urging
the riders to pedal faster, even to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is two-way radio.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong wears an earpiece and a microphone, which is pinned to
the collar of his racing jersey. Wires run under the jersey to a
lightweight pack carried in his back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The radio allows him to stay in constant contact with his
sportif, Johan Bruyneel, during the race. Bruyneel, using his
radio, then can locate members of the peloton, or pack of riders,
such as Kevin Livingston, and inform Armstrong of their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's our look at some of the gizmos this year's stylish,
high-tech, hometown hero is using.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD WIDE WHEELS
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's private coach, has known the
defending Tour champion for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But with Carmichael in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Armstrong
either in Austin or somewhere in Europe, it got to be hard to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   So the two started e-mailing each other workout information.
Last fall, Carmichael, a 1984 Olympian and a competitor in the 1986
Tour, started his own Web site _ www.ridefast.com, which is the
home of Carmichael Training Systems _ that gives any cyclist,
amateur or professional, expert advice. All a cylist has to do is
log on to the site and provide information on past and current
fitness levels, specific goals and a telephone number. A CTS
representative will call the cyclist and assign him or her a coach.
There are five training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The process is easy . . . and expensive. Want to be coached by
Carmichael for a mandatory six-month period? That will be $13,800,
please.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclist gets a personalized training regimen and then must
log on and furnish specific data each time he or she works out. The
training regimen changes as the cyclist reaches his or her goals.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same way Armstrong interacts with his coach when he's
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   BIKE TO THE BEAT
</P>
<P>
   Heart-rate monitors are the only accurate measurement of an
athlete's intensity or exertion level. Defending Tour de France
champion Lance Amstrong wears a monitor made by Polar Electro, Inc.
($100 to $300; www.polar .fi). It comes with an elastic belt and a
strap that wraps around the chest, transmitting information to a
wrist watch, which is attached to the handlebars of the bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can look down and see his heart rate as he rides,'' said
Jim Autberg, a Carmichael Training Systems Coach. ``The information
can be downloaded and printed out so Chris (Carmichael, Armstrong's
coach) can analyze the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's monitor can calculate time spent above, below or
within a target heart-rate zone. In other words, Armstrong can tell
if he is exerting too much energy at a given place in the tour
race. ``The technology is similar to an EKG. It measures electric
impluses of your heart rate,'' Autberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart monitors have been around for a decade, but the latest
models on the market are more accurate, less cumbersome and more
readily available. Basic models cost $100 or less. Higher-end
models can reach $300.
</P>
<P>
   A LOT TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   When you're on the road in the middle of France, you may care
about shaving time in the race, but you may not particularly care
what time of day it is. Nike's ACG Ascent Compass ($199,
www.nike.com) is more than a watch _ it's a self-contained crew.
The watch, being used in the Tour de France, includes a digital
compass, an altimeter with ``Zero Drift Technology'' to give you an
accurate altitude reading and functions that will tell you
barometric pressure, the temperature and even forecast the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a rugged aluminum outer shell, data capture,
chronograph, multiple-time-zone calendars, alarms, backlighting and
_ whew, you may get more worn out describing the features in the
ACG than actually pedalling through the race. The watch will be
available to the public later this year.
</P>
<P>
   THE FRAME OF THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the most important piece of gear on
the Tour (besides the human body itself) is the bike. Lance and the
rest of the U.S. Postal Service team ride three varieties of Trek
bicycles (prices range from $1,400 to $4,500 for frames. Some are
sold as complete bikes; www.trekbikes.com). The team uses the USPS
Team Time Trial Bike, the USPS Team Bike and the USPS Team
Superlight, which Trek boasts is the lightest stock frame ever at
2.27 pounds. That frame uses 110 grams of carbon fiber per square
meter, shaving nearly a third off of the carbon fiber used on
Lance's 1999 Tour-winning bike. One of the most interesting
features is a ``hydration system'' (read: for drinking water) using
a water bladder in the downtube for fast, fast drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Trek bikes are American-made, just like Lance, and also are
able to withstand a grueling 2,300-mile trek.

BRUINS HOPE COFFEY WILL BRING WELCOME CHANGE TO TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the phone rang last Friday, Paul Coffey had a hard
time believing who was calling. It was Bruins president/general
manager Harry Sinden, asking if the unrestricted free agent would
be interested in coming to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the 39-year-old Coffey and the club agreed on a
two-year deal. Sinden said he's hoping the fluid-skating
defenseman, who has won the Norris Trophy three times and the
Stanley Cup four times, can help the Bruins change to a more
uptempo and offensive style of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things is our obvious lack of offense from our
blue-line group, not only on the power play, but in five-on-five
situations as well,'' said Sinden, when asked what attracted them
to Coffey. ``Also, the way Paul plays, I felt he could bring
something to this team that we really haven't had for awhile, and
that is a little bit of offense and risk. I think our conservatism
is a result of some players being not sure of whether they can get
away with that or not, and he's been able to show almost everybody
that you can if you do it properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he could bring that to the team and show people like
(Kyle) McLaren and (Jonathan) Girard and (Nick) Boynton in
particular that there's a way to go about this that works pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey, who will be playing for his eighth NHL organization, had
wanted to land in his native Toronto, but the Maple Leafs weren't
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto was always in my plans, it just seemed as if I wasn't
in theirs,'' said Coffey. ``We had talked a couple of times but
nothing real serious. I had this opportunity with Boston and the
team definitely intrigues me. That's why I went that way. To be
perfectly honest, when Harry called me last Friday, it was a total
surprise but something that intrigued me right off the bat, looking
at their lineup. It really excited me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said he's completely healthy now. Over the last few
years, Coffey has struggled with his health. The worst of it was
the 1998-99 season, when he was in Chicago. He suffered a
debilitating sciatic nerve problem that extended down his leg. For
a time, it appeared his career was in jeopardy. But doctors told
him it would take 8-10 months to heal completely. After a slow
start with Carolina last year, he finished strong and looked more
like the Coffey of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years prior to last year hadn't been great, so
it's a chance for me to get back out there and show what I can
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The one dilemma facing both team and player is what number he
should wear. The first seven years of his career, Coffey wore No.
7, which is out of the question since the Bruins retired Phil
Esposito's sweater. For the last 13 seasons, he has worn No. 77.
Sinden said Coffey will not wear the number that belongs to Ray
Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't yet figured what number he'll wear but we'll give
him a number of options,'' said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' said Coffey. ``Maybe Ray would let me wear
it for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said this signing was in no way an attempt to replace
Bourque either in the hearts and minds of Bruins' fans or in the
club's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't lose a player like Ray and ever get over it,'' said
Sinden. ``In terms of numbers only, we replaced Ray with Peter
Popovic and Don Sweeney and the two draft choices (27-year-olds
Jarno Kultanen and Pavel Kolarik). The reason for Coffey is very
evident to me. If this team is going to move up, make the playoffs,
and move up further than that, we're going to have to complement
what I consider to be a highly skilled group of forwards
offensively with a defenseman like Paul Coffey. We're fortunate
he's available to come in and really give this group of forwards a
feeling that, yes, you can play offense and you can entertain your
fans and still win games in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, was one of the biggest reasons I thought Paul
could come in and help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said he's looking forward to being reunited with coach
Pat Burns, for whom he played during two Canada Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man I really respect,'' said Coffey. ``He, especially,
doesn't take losing easily. Nobody wants to change the team around
successfully more than Pat Burns. I'm quite excited about playing
for him again. Harry and I talked about what I can bring to the
team. I know the way I play and the way I've played on every team,
and that's trying to play an upbeat tempo with give and gos and
skating. With some of the younger forwards they have, things should
work out very well.''

   EL SALADO, Colombia _ The armed men, more than 300 of them,
marched into this tiny village early on a Friday. They went
straight to the basketball court that doubles as the main square
here, announced themselves as members of Colombia's most feared
paramilitary group and with a list of names began summoning
residents for judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A table and chairs were seized from a house, and after the death
squad leader had made himself comfortable, the basketball court was
turned into a court of execution. The paramilitary troops ordered
up liquor and music, and then embarked on a calculated rampage of
torture, rape and killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, it was like a big party,'' said one of a dozen
survivors who described the scene in interviews earlier this month.
``They drank and danced and cheered as they butchered us like
hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time they left late Sunday afternoon, they had killed at
least 36 people whom they accused of collaborating with the enemy,
left-wing guerrillas who have long been a presence in the area. The
victims ranged from a six-year-old girl to an elderly woman. As
music blared, some of the victims were shot after being tortured;
others were stabbed or beaten to death, and several more were
strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during the three days of killing, military and police units
just a few miles away made no effort to stop the slaughter. At one
point the paramilitaries had a helicopter flown in to rescue a
fighter who had been injured trying to drag some victims from their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting back, the armed forces set up a roadblock on
the road to the village shortly after the rampage began and
prevented human rights and relief groups from entering and rescuing
residents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Colombian military has opened three investigations
into what happened here and made some paramilitary arrests, top
officials insist that fighting was underway in the village between
guerrillas and paramilitary forces _ not a series of executions.
They also insist that the colonel in charge of the region has been
persecuted by prosecutors and human rights groups. Last month he
was promoted to general, despite the fact that examinations of the
incidents are pending.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in El Salado in February _ at the very moment when
President Clinton was pushing an aid package to step up antidrug
efforts here _strikes at the heart of the debate over the growing
U.S. backing of the Colombian military. For years the U.S.
government and human rights groups have had reservations about the
Colombian military leadership, its human rights record and its
collaboration with paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian armed forces and police are the principal
beneficiaries of a $1.3 billion aid package that Clinton signed
Thursday. The Colombian government says it has been working hard to
sever the remnants of ties between the armed forces and the
paramilitaries and has been training its soldiers to observe
international human rights conventions even in the heat of combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramilitaries are some of the worst of the terrorists who
profit from drugs in Colombia, and in no way can anyone justify
their human rights violations,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
White House drug czar. But he added that ``the Colombian military
is making dramatic improvements in its human rights record,'' and
noted that the aid package includes ``significant money, $46
million for human rights training and implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups, pointing to incidents like the massacre
here, say these links still exist and that mechanisms to monitor
and punish commanders and units have had limited success at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Salado was the worst recorded massacre yet this year,''
said Andrew Miller, a Latin American specialist for Amnesty
International USA, who spent the past year as an observer near
where this massacre occurred. ``The Colombian armed forces,
specifically the marines, were at best criminally negligent by not
responding sooner to the attack. At worst, they were knowledgeable
and complicit.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary attack on El Salado indeed killed more people
and lasted longer than any other in Colombia so far this year. But
in most other respects it was an operation so typical of the
5,500-member right-wing death squad that goes by the name of the
Peasant Self-Defense of Colombia, that the Colombian press treated
it as just another atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 18 months, more than 2,500 people, most of them
unarmed peasants in rural areas like this village in northern
Colombia, have died in more than 500 attacks by what the Colombian
government calls ``illegal armed groups,'' involved in the
country's 35-year-old civil conflict. And according to the tally of
the government ombudsman's office, right-wing paramilitary groups
are responsible for most of those killings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the El Salado massacre, nearly 3,000 residents of the area
fled to nearby towns, including Carmen de Bolivar and Ovejas, as
well as the provincial capital, Cartagena. Early this month, more
than a dozen of the survivors were interviewed under the protection
of human rights groups or the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to protect them, however, some have recently
been killed in individual attacks or have disappeared, actions they
blame on the same paramilitary group that attacked their village.
As a result, all of the survivors interviewed for this story spoke
on condition that their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Their accounts, however, coincide with investigations conducted
by the Colombian government prosecutor's office and by the Colombia
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   A paramilitary unit had attacked this village in 1997, killing
five people and warning that they would eventually come back. Many
residents fled then, but returned after a few months believing that
they were safe until the death squad suddenly reappeared on the
morning of Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up at the hills, and could see armed men everywhere,
blocking every possible exit,'' a farmer recalled. ``They had
surrounded the town, and almost as soon as they came down, they
began firing their guns and shouting ``death to the guerrillas.''

<P>
   ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' doesn't answer its own
question. Instead, it jumbles a series of obfuscating factoids,
derivative melodrama and meaningless conjecture in an admittedly
often interesting, usually overheated fashion that concludes _
well, not much, really.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telefilm that plays so fast and loose with the facts that
it doesn't even use the real name of the journalist who helped
break the story, even though he produced the film (Rudy Langlais,
here named Ron Larson and played by Gregory Hines). By film's end,
you're not sure what to believe, except that someone messed up
big-time _ but was it in the course of the investigation or the
movie? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   Larson is an editor at Spin magazine at constant loggerheads
with reporter Pat Laughlin (James Belushi) over the inflammatory
tone and content of the writer's work (since the film is written
and directed by the same guy, Charles Robert Carner, there's no
danger of such dialogue here). Nonetheless, Larson and Laughlin
venture together to Atlanta. They pursue claims that the
investigation of the infamous string of African-American child
murders in the early '80s _ which concluded with the conviction of
one Wayne Williams, an African-American, of two of the murders that
seemed peripherally linked at best to the other 30 or so _ was
incompetently botched, at best, or at worst criminally tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Carner's script runs through a number of scenarios, some of
which have been discredited, others of which have not been
verified, others of which seem wholly likely but unsubstantiated.
Piles of documents conveniently turn up on Larson and Laughlin's
doorstep, leading to more bickering and dramatic (if fairly
irrelevant) personal revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Hines' turn is smooth and credible; Belushi adds but another
earnest lout to his resume. Carner aspires for Oliver Stone-like
portent but is undone by his predilection for dream sequences,
lonesome-road mayhem and exposition that absolutely must be
delivered in strip clubs. If in fact Carner felt he was dealing
with important material here, he might have been inclined to let
the fairly compelling facts speak for themselves rather than travel
the lurid route again and again. &QL;

 EL SALADO, Colombia: the guerrillas.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The death squad troops, almost all dressed in military-style
uniforms with a blue patch, made their way to the basketball court
at the center of the village. They took tables and chairs from a
nearby building, pulled out a list of names and then began the
search for victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were shot, but a lot of them were beaten with
clubs and then stabbed with knives or sliced up with machetes,''
said one eyewitness. ``A few people were beheaded, or strangled
with metal wires, while others had their throats cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of those to be executed was supplied by two men, one of
whom was wearing a ski mask. Paramilitary leaders, who have
acknowledged the attack on El Salado but describe it as ``combat''
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, later
said that the two men were FARC deserters who had dealt with local
people and knew who had been guerrilla sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all done very methodically,'' said one eyewitness.
``Some people were brought to the basketball court, but were saved
because someone would say `not that one,' and they would be allowed
to leave. But I saw a woman neighbor of mine, who I know had
nothing at all to do with the guerrillas, knocked down with clubs
and then stabbed to death.''
</P>
<P>
   While some paramilitaries searched for people to kill, others
were breaking into shops and stealing beer, rum and whiskey. Before
long, a macabre party atmosphere prevailed, with the paramilitaries
setting up radios with dance music and ordering a local guitarist
and accordionist to play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a young waitress from a cantina adjoining the
basketball court was ordered to keep a steady supply of liquor
flowing. As the armed men grew drunk and rowdy, they began to
fondle her, and she ended up being repeatedly raped, along with
several other women from the town, according to residents and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, some residents fled to the wooded hills above
town. Others stayed in their homes, afraid of being caught if they
tried to escape, unable to move because they had small children or
convinced that they would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was more of the same. ``All day long we could hear
occasional bursts of gunfire, along with the screams and cries of
those who were being tortured and killed,'' said a woman who had
taken refuge in the hills with her small children.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 people who were killed in town, 16 people were
executed at the basketball court. An additional 18 people were
killed in the countryside, residents and human rights workers said,
and 17 more are still missing, making for a death toll that could
be as high as 71.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, news of the slaughter had spread to Carmen
de Bolivar, the county seat, about 15 miles away. Alarmed,
relatives of the residents rushed to local police and military
posts, but were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a scandal and nearly caused a riot, we were so
insistent,'' said a 40-year-old-man who had left El Salado early on
Friday because he had business in town. ``But they did nothing to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the armed forces and police not come to the aid of
the villagers here, but the roadblock they set up prevented
humanitarian aid from entering the village. Anyone seeking to enter
the area was turned back, told the road was unsafe because it had
been mined and that combat was going on between guerrilla and
paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, three Colombian navy admirals said
that residents of El Salado were accusing the military of
complicity in the massacre because they ``have been coerced by
guerrillas,'' into doing so. The roadblock was set up, they said,
``for the security of the people themselves, because we did not
want to see more deaths or injuries to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no point was there collaboration on our part, nor would we
have permitted their passage'' through the area, Adm. William
Porras, the second in command of the Colombian navy, said of the
death squad unit that attacked this village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never at any point were covering up for them or helping
them, as all the subsequent investigations have shown.''
</P>
<P>
   But local residents, Colombian prosecutors investigating the
massacre and human rights groups say there was no combat of any
kind. In fact, villagers report that the armed forces had not been
in the center of El Salado recently, and that they had left the
outlying areas a day before. Residents also say they had passed
over the dirt road as recently as Friday morning and there were no
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army was on patrol for two or three days before the
massacre took place, and then suddenly they disappeared,'' recalled
a 43-year old tobacco farmer. ``It can't be explained, and it seems
very curious to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What has been established, however, is that the villagers were
simple peasants, and not the guerrillas the paramilitary leader
says his troops were fighting. ``It is quite clear that these were
defenseless people and that what they were subjected to was not
combat, but abuse and torture,'' said a foreign diplomat who has
been investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to residents, the paramilitaries felt so certain that
government security forces would stay away that late on Friday they
had a helicopter flown in. It landed in front of a church and
picked up a death squad fighter who had been injured when a family
he was trying to drag out of their house to be taken to the
basketball court resisted.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, Human Rights Watch found ``detailed, abundant and
compelling evidence of continuing close ties between the Colombian
army and paramilitary groups responsible for gross human rights
violations.'' All told, ``half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level
units have documented links to paramilitary activity,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from moving decisively to sever ties to paramilitaries,
Human Rights Watch's evidence strongly suggests that Colombia's
military high command has yet to take the necessary steps to
accomplish this goal,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the El Salado incident, the senior military
officer in this region was Col. Rodrigo Quinones Cardenas,
commander of the 1st Navy Brigade, who has since been promoted to
general. As director of Naval Intelligence in the early 1990s, he
was named by Colombian prosecutors as the organizer of a
paramilitary network responsible for the killings of 57 trade
unionists, human rights workers and members of a left-wing
political party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Quinones and seven other soldiers were charged with
``conspiring to form or collaborate with armed groups.'' But after
the main witness against him was murdered in a maximum security
prison and the case was transferred from a civilian court to a
military tribunal, he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the same investigation by Colombian prosecutors,
one of Quinones' closest associates in that paramilitary network
was Harold Mantilla, a colonel in the Colombian marines.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mantilla is commander of the 5th Marine Battalion, which
operates in the area around El Salado and is one of the units said
by residents and human rights workers to have failed to respond to
appeals for help.
</P>
<P>
   After the paramilitary unit left El Salado, police captured 11
paramilitaries northeast of here on the ranch of a drug trafficker
who is in prison in Bogota. Along with four others who were
arrested separately, they are now facing murder charges, but their
leaders and most of the others who carried out the killings remain
free.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months after the massacre, El Salado is virtually
deserted. Only one of the town's 1,330 original residents was
present when a reporter and human rights workers visited early this
month, and he said the village remains as it was the day the death
squad left, except for the two mass graves on a rise near the
basketball court where the bodies of the dead were buried and later
exhumed for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At the basketball court, the table and chairs used by the
paramilitary ``judges,'' smashed or overturned as they left, are
still strewn across the playing area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the people are ever going to want to come back
again,'' he said. ``What happened here was just too terrible to
bear, and we didn't deserve it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS INACTION ON JUDGES REFLECTS BIAS IN GOP
 &HT;    Eds: Seeking Bush response to Clinton remarks.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In a broad attack on his Republican foes, President
Clinton said Thursday that Senate opposition to his judicial
nominations reflects a party bias against African Americans and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He took specific aim at Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, both Texas Republicans, for blocking his nomination of
El Paso attorney Enrique Moreno to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of those senators, who contend that Moreno was
nominated to help Clinton raise Democratic funds from the Hispanic
community, the nomination has been stalled in the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they want to give these people a hearing and a
vote?'' Clinton asked during remarks at the annual convention of
the NAACP. ``Because they don't want him on the court, but they
don't want you to know they don't want him on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Clinton said, ``the leader of
the Republican Party of Texas'' has responded only with ``stone
cold silence'' to the inaction on Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint June 19 letter to Clinton, Gramm and Hutchison
chastised Clinton for ``trading on judicial nominations as a device
to generate money for Democratic political campaigns,'' and went on
to cite the Moreno nomination as part of a ``strategy of mixing
judicial nominations with partisan hectoring in order to extract
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that Moreno is a highly qualified nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also singled out Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., by name,
accusing him of standing in the way of Clinton's efforts to
integrate the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms won't let these people get confirmed,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over seven years now, he has stopped my attempts to
integrate the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Republican
majority has made no move to change the tide,'' said Clinton.
``This is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Helms aide dismissed the criticism as ``election-year
politics,'' and said the senator stands by his contention that the
Fourth Circuit doesn't need any additional judges.
</P>
<P>
   When Helms was told of the president's remarks, ``he chuckled
and he said, 'the president just can't tell the straight (truth)
about anything, can he?' '' said Helms's aide, who declined to be
quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit _ comprising Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,
North Carolina and South Carolina _ has the largest black
population of any federal circuit in the country, and has never had
a black judge. There are 15 federal judgeships on the circuit; four
are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has opposed Clinton's nomination of two African Americans
_ Richmond, Va., attorney Roger Gregory and North Carolina state
appellate Judge James Wynn _ to the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want justice to be blind,'' said Clinton. ``But we also
know that when we have diversity in our courts, as in all aspects
of society, it sharpens our vision and makes us a stronger
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   All presidential nominations for the federal bench are subject
to the review of the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   White House statistics show that Senate confirmations closely
mirror Clinton's nominations in terms of percentage of women and
minorities allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has nominated 104 candidates to the federal bench over
the past year and a half, 50 of whom _ 48 percent _ are either
women or minorities. The Senate has confirmed 64 of those nominees,
30 of whom _ 47 percent _ have been women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has highlighted a few high-profile cases that
have drawn sharp criticism from groups like the NAACP, including
the nominations of Gregory, Moreno and Missouri Supreme Court Judge
Ronnie White.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Senate voted, in a straight party-line vote,
to kill the nomination of White _ the first African American judge
to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court _ to the federal appeals
court, contending that he was not likely to be tough enough on
death-row cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lambasted the vote, which drew sharp criticism from the
African American community, but he stopped short of calling his
opponents racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president was being polite when he called it
partisanship,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP _ the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said Clinton's remarks would persuade many African
Americans to see the judicial nomination process as a key issue in
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as outraged as he was,'' said Bond. ``They're going to
go back to their homes and say to their senators, 'What about
it?'''

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Jane Broadway's office seems innocuous enough _ papers
are scattered about her desk, a laptop softly chirps, the phone
occasionally rings. Like a doctor's waiting room, the walls are
dotted with framed photos and awards attesting to some of her
professional accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't until you really look at the photos, which casually
hang under the plaques, that you fully grasp what Broadway does for
a living.
</P>
<P>
   One particular snapshot says it all: Looking like a victorious
company softball team, Broadway and the rest of her male and female
colleagues are smiling for the camera, some of them resting on
their haunches, others standing. But behind them isn't a ball field
_ it's a horror story: the twisted, smoldering remains of the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, which a bomb tore through in
August 1998, killing 11 people, all Africans, and injuring 86.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being another corporate climber, Broadway leads the
Evidence Response Team, or ERT, for the FBI in Dallas. And
according to the bureau, she and her team are very good at their
job, so much so that her division of the ERT is the most widely
used such team in the FBI. Throughout the past few years, they've
been summoned to some of the most notorious disasters in the world:
the embassy bombings in Africa, the Branch Davidian standoff near
Waco, the Oklahoma City bombing, buried bodies on ranches near
Juarez, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the team has helped with the massacre at
Wedgwood Baptist Church and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite having the respect of her fellow agents, despite the
awards and accolades from the bureau, despite years of facing death
and tragedy every day, Broadway says it never becomes easy to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get used to it,'' she says, staring at the U.S.
Embassy bombing photo. ``You separate yourself from it. You have no
choice but to. But do you ever get used to it? No.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas FBI building where Jane Broadway works is not what
you'd expect, especially if your idea of the FBI has been formed by
``The X-Files.'' Tucked inside the city's trendy West End area, the
space is carved out of upscale red and white brick and shares a
roof with the corporate offices of a popular restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you will not find men in black sunglasses smoking
cigarettes, whispering among themselves or talking into their
jackets. The only immediate signs that this is not your typical
corporate atmosphere: a metal detector. That is, until you get
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   There, it's maximum security: Plates of bulletproof glass
separate a waiting room from a receptionist area, wallet-size cards
are electronically used to trigger doors and elevators, visitors
must don stick-on badges and be escorted by an agent at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting room leads to mazes of offices where FBI agents buzz
about, some dressed in suits, some in casual khakis. Everyone is
friendly, offering a ``hi,'' or a ``congratulations on your
promotion.'' Unlike Hollywood's version of the FBI, no one here
swaggers.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Broadway spends most of her time. And she's the
first to admit it's not always very exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend half my time doing paperwork,'' says Broadway, a
soft-spoken, slender woman with short brown hair pushed to the
side. ``Ordering, restocking supplies, making sure we have
everything we need in case of a call-out. It's really kinda boring
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But if real FBI work can be much more mundane than what you see
on TV, it can also be much more dramatic and horrifying _ and
emotionally demanding. Although much of her day-to-day work
involves ``boring'' office work, she knows a phone call can spice
up her life at any time. Special Agent Broadway's official job
title is ERT team leader and overall response coordinator. She's in
charge of a 32-member team that is called upon when local law
enforcement needs special expertise with a crime scene or when a
massive crisis occurs, such as a bombing or kidnapping, and an
extensive amount of lab work and legwork is needed.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, she and her team can be ready to respond to any
crime-related event. A trailer equipped with thousands of dollars'
worth of high-tech, evidence-gathering equipment _ like the one
featured in the Kevin Costner/Clint Eastwood movie ``A Perfect
World'' _ sits only a few miles away, in a modest warehouse; each
member carries in his or her car a bag of bare-necessity supplies:
a change of clothes, toiletries. And, like other special agents,
they all carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go in a minute's notice, national, local, international,
wherever,'' says Brent Chambers, one of four team leaders. ``We're
one of the only teams in the bureau that is equipped to go anywhere
in the world in a minute's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   One unusual characteristic of the ERT is that, with the
exception of Broadway, who's the full-time team leader, all the
members of the group have assignments outside the team and have
volunteered to be part of the elite outfit. Each has his/her own
other FBI job: public corruption, hazardous material, violent
crimes and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a volunteer fire department,'' says Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Each member brings to the team a wealth of specialized
knowledge. Broadway, for instance, is a former Army medic. Special
Agent Katy Gossman is a former helicopter pilot. Deborah Eckart,
who works out of the FBI's Fort Worth office, is a one-time nurse.
Two other team members, Chambers and Special Agent Michael Hillman,
were police officers before they joined the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a well-trained cadre of professionals and experts; that's
why they get used so often,'' says Assistant Special Agent In
Charge Bob Garrity, who is responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the entire Dallas FBI division, the 10th-largest
field office in the bureau. ``Much of what they do is crime-scene
work. It's tedious, methodical, painstakingly organized. And it can
also be traumatic. Very traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the one thing they all agree on. ___ &QC; 
(MORE)nn
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: xxx agree on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agents and Evidence Response Team members Jim
Kendall and Deborah Eckart are sitting in an office at the Dallas
FBI headquarters, trying to put the unspeakable into words.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at Broadway's desk while she's running an errand, they
bring up the Opal Jennings case, in which the ERT was dispatched
last year to search for the missing 6-year-old kindergartner from a
Fort Worth suburb for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Their work helped lead to the arrest of Richard Franks, whose
trial last month ended in a mistrial. The 30-year-old was charged
with aggravated kidnapping in Opal's disappearance. She has never
been found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conversation shifts to Kyle McElroy. The 18-year-old man was
found beaten to death in New Summerfield, a small town 10 miles
south of Troup in East Texas. The ERT worked the crime scene where
McElroy's body was found; they couldn't move his body until all the
evidence-gathering was done.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherokee County Sheriff's Department and the FBI have
arrested three men in the kidnap-slaying: Daniel Rios, 26; Ernesto
Bailon, 17; and Alfredo Romero, 23. All three face capital murder
charges. A woman who made ransom calls to McElroy's family is still
on the run, the FBI says.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City was another trying situation, Eckart says. The
April 19, 1995, bombing, which killed 168 people, found the ERT
spending two weeks at the site, where, initially, they helped look
for survivors, then sifted through the building's remains for
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One team was set up at the local morgue, where ERT members
examined bodies for bomb shrapnel and other clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around death, all the smells, the sounds, the sights,
the families and friends crying, it's difficult. You never forget
it, especially when kids are involved,'' says Kendall, 43, who has
two children. ``But we work as a team, and we're all very
supportive. You just try to take care of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the scents and sounds of death are so emotionally
overwhelming, ERT members seek counseling _ among themselves, with
religious counselors, with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy's case was especially difficult for some team members.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Troup, we had a crisis debriefing in which everyone was
required to go,'' says Garrity. ``Chaplains sat and talked with the
group about trauma and how it may be affecting them. We had agents
who were having a difficult time sleeping at night. They kept
thinking back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular case was traumatic in two senses: One, we had
a very high-intense investigation looking for a victim who we
believed was still alive; two, we then discovered he was dead,''
Garrity continues. ``When we learned he was dead, there's that
unknown equation: ``Would he be alive if we hadn't made a mistake?'
`Could we have prevented his execution?' We later learned that he
was already dead before the first phone call had been received by
the father. But racing against the clock and the unknown, then, of
course, to discover his body beaten beyond recognition, that can be
extremely stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   But even that awful case might not be the most nightmarish
they've faced. Out of the dozen or so high-profile crime scenes the
ERT has been called to investigate, the burials near Juarez,
Mexico, say the agents, remains truly unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first joint investigation of that kind between us
and Mexico,'' Broadway says. ``But it wasn't safe for us to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In November of last year, 65 FBI agents and 600 Mexican military
and federal judicial police descended on three ranches in different
parts of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso. A U.S.
government informant tipped off authorities, saying there might be
as many at 100 bodies buried there. The drug cartel of the Carrillo
Fuentes family controls the area.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 65 agents, eight belonged to the Dallas ERT. Fearing
the ERT members were targets, the Mexican government gave them
bodyguards, which, initially, added to an already tense atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, this was not the best situation,'' says
30-year-old Special Agent Michael Hillman, the youngest member of
the ERT. ``It can become difficult when you're deployed and you're
away from your family and you don't know when you're going home. On
top of that, we were concerned about our safety, surrounded by
these bodyguards that, at that point, we really didn't know,
working long hours, on the news every night and digging up
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the sandstorms, which twice forced the ERT to
halt its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like bullets hitting us,'' says Chambers. ``You could
hardly see in front of you. We had to leave, they were so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears and setbacks, the Dallas ERT, with Broadway
leading the way, found a mass burial site where nine bodies were
excavated, three of which were those of Americans. Chambers says it
was an excruciating assignment, but not one without a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely living minute-by-minute there,'' he says.
``You put your faith in God and keep going forward. We were there
for the greater purpose _ to recover evidence that, hopefully, will
prosecute someone. I don't want to sound John Wayne, but that's why
I got into the bureau _ to make a difference.'' ___ &QC; 
(MORE)nn
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: xxx a difference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jane Broadway also wants to make a difference _ always has. And
her dedication, discipline and talent have led her to the top of
her profession.
</P>
<P>
   Born 35 years ago in Atlanta, Broadway grew up on a 200-acre
farm in Virginia. Her mother was a nurse, her father an employee of
the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Right out of high school, Broadway joined the Army Reserves,
while she started college at Mary Washington in Fredericksburg,
Va., majoring in economics. Before she had even finished school,
she applied for a CIA job, a rigorous process that results in few
hires among the thousands of applicants every year.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway was one of the chosen few. ``I always had a taste for
adventurous, off-the-beaten-path-type things,'' she says. ``I went
to work for the CIA before I even finished school'' _ work she
still isn't supposed to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, it had to do with money.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Broadway applied for a position with the FBI and, in
November of that year, began training at the FBI Academy in
Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four months of school, but you're paid for it,'' she
says. ``Your paychecks start the day you do. But it's not like
going to class, then going home. You live there. It's like boot
camp. Everyone gets the same block of training and skills and
knowledge. You get more specialized when you get in the field and
get assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadway's first post-school assignment: bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   She was sent to Dallas in March 1991, to investigate a series of
bank failures and savings and loan scams. ``As a brand-new agent,
it was very complex work,'' she says. ``I had to review all these
complex financial land transactions, and I had never even signed my
own loan documents.'' Her work on the case led to indictments of
several bank executives and land developers.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Dallas branch of the FBI formed the ERT,
taking cues from similar teams in Boston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to volunteer for the team, Broadway, who's
single, has since worked her way up to team leader and coordinator.
It's a job she relishes _ even though it sometimes gives her
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that still bothers me the most happened a few years
ago in Pottsboro out in East Texas,'' she says. ``A 16-year-old boy
kidnapped a little girl out of her bedroom window. He sexually
abused her before he killed her. We were brought in to process the
house where the kid was from and the storm cellar where her body
was found.''
</P>
<P>
   Their work turned out to be successful. In 1996, Jonathan Joe
Johnson pleaded guilty to abducting and killing the toddler,
23-month-old Tabitha Baker. He received a life sentence for three
felony counts: murder, aggravated sexual assault of a child and
aggravated kidnapping. In 30 years, he will be eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said there was evidence showing that Johnson raped
and strangled Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was so up-close and personal,'' Broadway says. ``We
had to be down there in the cellar for hours at a time with (the
body), meticulously working around her. It was the first time I
thought, `How could someone do this to someone else?' I remember
them all, but that one still bothers me.'' ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The stories go on, with most ending unhappily _ dead bodies,
crumbled buildings, the missing still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The one ray of light that shines down on such cases, Broadway
says, is that she and her team often get a first-hand view into the
minds of criminals, information that the ERT _ and the entire FBI _
can learn from.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway cites two cases as examples: that of Richard Franks,
the man accused in the disappearance of Opal Jennings, and that of
Larry Ashbrook, the man who fatally shot seven people last year at
Wedgwood Baptist Church, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fascinating,'' she says, flipping through a photo
album of pictures of Ashbrook's disheveled house. In the disturbing
photos, trash is scattered everywhere; a toilet is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell so many things about some people by their home,''
Broadway says of the psychological-analysis aspect of their work.
``What they did before they left, the kind of temperament they were
in, the way they lived. We learn so much from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that gleaning such useful information makes the stress and
pain any easier to handle _ especially when the crimes seem, as
they often do, to defy explanation. The men and women who work on
the ERT find satisfaction in a job well done, in seeing successful
prosecutions come from their work. But the cost is great, and they
all recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is realizing how cruel people can be to
other people,'' says Special Agent Brent Chambers, 36, who has a
wife and children. ``You see the dead bodies, the thoughtlessness
of people and how they can be so hurtful. You never get used to it,
but you learn to deal with it. Talking to other team members helps
more than anything. You can't keep it in. There's no way.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS INACTION ON JUDGES REFLECTS BIAS IN GOP
 &HT;    Eds: Seeking Bush response to Clinton remarks.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In a broad attack on his Republican foes, President
Clinton said Thursday that Senate opposition to his judicial
nominations reflects a party bias against African Americans and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He took specific aim at Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, both Texas Republicans, for blocking his nomination of
El Paso attorney Enrique Moreno to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of those senators, who contend that Moreno was
nominated to help Clinton raise Democratic funds from the Hispanic
community, the nomination has been stalled in the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they want to give these people a hearing and a
vote?'' Clinton asked during remarks at the annual convention of
the NAACP. ``Because they don't want him on the court, but they
don't want you to know they don't want him on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Clinton said, ``the leader of
the Republican Party of Texas'' has responded only with ``stone
cold silence'' to the inaction on Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint June 19 letter to Clinton, Gramm and Hutchison
chastised Clinton for ``trading on judicial nominations as a device
to generate money for Democratic political campaigns,'' and went on
to cite the Moreno nomination as part of a ``strategy of mixing
judicial nominations with partisan hectoring in order to extract
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that Moreno is a highly qualified nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also singled out Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., by name,
accusing him of standing in the way of Clinton's efforts to
integrate the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms won't let these people get confirmed,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over seven years now, he has stopped my attempts to
integrate the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Republican
majority has made no move to change the tide,'' said Clinton.
``This is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Helms aide dismissed the criticism as ``election-year
politics,'' and said the senator stands by his contention that the
Fourth Circuit doesn't need any additional judges.
</P>
<P>
   When Helms was told of the president's remarks, ``he chuckled
and he said, 'the president just can't tell the straight (truth)
about anything, can he?' '' said Helms's aide, who declined to be
quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit _ comprising Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,
North Carolina and South Carolina _ has the largest black
population of any federal circuit in the country, and has never had
a black judge. There are 15 federal judgeships on the circuit; four
are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has opposed Clinton's nomination of two African Americans
_ Richmond, Va., attorney Roger Gregory and North Carolina state
appellate Judge James Wynn _ to the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want justice to be blind,'' said Clinton. ``But we also
know that when we have diversity in our courts, as in all aspects
of society, it sharpens our vision and makes us a stronger
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   All presidential nominations for the federal bench are subject
to the review of the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   White House statistics show that Senate confirmations closely
mirror Clinton's nominations in terms of percentage of women and
minorities allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has nominated 104 candidates to the federal bench over
the past year and a half, 50 of whom _ 48 percent _ are either
women or minorities. The Senate has confirmed 64 of those nominees,
30 of whom _ 47 percent _ have been women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has highlighted a few high-profile cases that
have drawn sharp criticism from groups like the NAACP, including
the nominations of Gregory, Moreno and Missouri Supreme Court Judge
Ronnie White.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Senate voted, in a straight party-line vote,
to kill the nomination of White _ the first African American judge
to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court _ to the federal appeals
court, contending that he was not likely to be tough enough on
death-row cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lambasted the vote, which drew sharp criticism from the
African American community, but he stopped short of calling his
opponents racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president was being polite when he called it
partisanship,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP _ the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said Clinton's remarks would persuade many African
Americans to see the judicial nomination process as a key issue in
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as outraged as he was,'' said Bond. ``They're going to
go back to their homes and say to their senators, 'What about
it?'''

way of recording history. Alma Womack writes a column for her

   BROOKLYN _ BROOKLYN, N.Y. _ It wasn't until I plopped down in a
booth at Junior's _ the sprawling, orange-vinyl delicatessen run by
the Rosen family for more than 50 years at the corner of Flatbush
and DeKalb avenues _ that I began to realize what a melting pot New
York's most populous borough is. In Brooklyn, habitat of Hassids
and homeboys, matzah ball soup is served side by side with collard
greens and salmon croquettes. Over a recent long weekend, I didn't
have nearly enough time to eat my way around this ethnic-food
lover's paradise. But I did hopscotch around sufficiently to see
why it's New York's new ground zero of cool, why trendies from
``The City'' are subwaying over to check out the clubs and
restaurants, the museums and green spaces, the Gothic architecture
and Gotham views. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH

   GERGIEV-BALLET (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Every year, around the
summer solstice, this faded imperial city steps back into the
limelight. On those long white nights, when the sun dips out of
sight for only a few hours, crowds gather on the banks of the Neva
River, even shabby hotels fill up with tourists and at the
venerable Maryinsky (formerly Kirov) Theater, the seats at the
``Stars of the White nights'' festival are taken up by rich patrons
from all over the world. This is also the one time when Valeri
Gergiev, one of the world's most sought after conductors who also
happens to be theater's artistic director, bring a his star quality
home to this gritty city with a pretty face. By Celestine Bohlen.

<P>
   BOLSHOI-BALLET (New York) _ Power and passion: The Bolshoi
Ballet's dancing has been synonymous with these qualities, making
it a company unlike any other. Virtually sold out for its
appearances at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 this week, as was its
recent five-city U.S. tour, the fabled company from Moscow returns
to New York for the first time in 10 years, and with its potent
mystique intact. Nonetheless, as Aleksei Fadeyechev says, ``It is a
different company now. Time chooses dancers for its own time.'' By
Anna Kisselgoff.

   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHUCK&AMP;BUCK-FILM (Undated) _ Insinuating its way into a summer of
movies of negligible ambiguity comes one of the major chew bones of
this year's Sundance Film Festival, ``Chuck and Buck.'' The movie,
scheduled to open July 14, is about boyhood friends who
re-encounter one another after many years. It's a movie that
careens into one cringe-inducing circumstance after another: the
sexuality of children, the old relationship that will not die, the
overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the panicked, the
geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   COMMIE-COMEDY-FILM (Undated) _ The phrase ``Communist musical
comedy'' may sound like an oxymoron, but even the officially
achieved utopia of no-longer-extant East Germany required a few
measures of utopian song-and-dance. ``Hot Summer,'' the teenage
musical that was the DDR's second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is
not quite socialism a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact
nonetheless. By J. Hoberman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ZAKS-THEATER (New York) _ Sitting in the cool darkness of the
theater balcony where ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' was about to
start previews, Jerry Zaks did not come across as a burdened man.
Yet if his experiences of the last few years have not succeeded in
darkening the Broadway director, they have certainly left him more
defended. And no wonder. Zaks, 53, is coming off a bad run of
flops, including last season's ``Epic Proportions'' and the 1999
``Civil War.'' But one could also argue that Zaks has not so much
failed his more recent projects, as they have failed him. By Robin
Pogrebin.

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCHUBERT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Christopher Gibbs begins his brief
new book on Schubert (``The Life of Schubert,'' Cambridge
University Press) by avoiding any claim to the ``true'' man and
composer. He will, in his words, ``recount what can be reliably
documented and examine some of the persistent images.'' Knowing the
chronologies and the anecdotes from friends is a help, but they do
not tell us who Schubert was. Indeed, the truth of Schubert is that
he knows more about us than we about him. Some creative people are
this big. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   LEHRER-MUSIC (Santa Cruz, Calif.) _ His songs are the stuff of
your fondest adolescent imagination, subversive send-ups of the Boy
Scouts, religion, lynching, college cheerleading, pollution,
plagiarism, prudishness. They are twisted, erudite parodies of the
perverse. So it comes as a bit of a surprise on meeting Tom Lehrer,
the Harvard-trained mathematician-cum-musician that the disc jockey
Barry Hansen has called ``the most brilliant song satirist ever
recorded,'' to learn that he seems a lot more like the gently
whimsical voice behind his children's songs for the television
series ``The Electric Company,'' than the sick-genius author of
``Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.'' By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SWEENEY-TODD (Undated) _ There are nights in the
theater, the opera house, the symphony hall that earn the
designation legendary. We've all heard about them, or perhaps, with
luck, even caught a few. And that, of course, is the point. Beyond
their momentary transcendence, legendary nights linger largely
because of their evanescence. What becomes a legend most is the
very fact that you had to be there. But what about the Internet?

occasionally outpoints the popular ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' in the
same time slot here in New York. This ``daytime yakker'' has got

   &UR; ART/PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ Now for the bad news: good
news is on vacation. Permanently. In the news media, anyway, ``no
news is good news'' just might be read as ``there is no such thing
as good news,'' something local television has been trying to
convince viewers of for years. That goes double for news
photography: the news photographs you remember are likely to
compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the streets of
Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body through
the streets of Somalia. Pictures of those three events won Pulitzer
Prizes. A show called ``The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the
Moment,'' at the Newseum/NY in midtown Manhattan through Sept. 23,
reinforces the widespread impression that news tends to be violent

   HEJDUK-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Though John Hejduk was little

that of many of its most prominent figures. His death last week, at
71, leaves a profound emptiness _ a quality that, as it happens,
Hejduk often reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects,
he was a contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work
in a highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of
living out the contradiction. By Herbert Muschamp.

report in the seventh grade, he chose one of Abbie Hoffman's. He
cut his political teeth with Ralph Nader, organizing communities to
rise up around issues like the Superfund cleanups and telephone
rates, and even his birthday, July 14, coincides with a
revolutionary milestone, at least for the French. So when he filed
a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Co., representing four

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading abortion rights advocacy group on
Thursday attacked potential running mates for Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, giving all but two poor or failing grades on abortion rights
while awarding good or excellent marks to likely Democratic vice
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a
30-year-old Washington-based organization, rated 10 possible
nominees from each party on a scale from ``A'' (staunchly
pro-choice) to ``F'' (staunchly anti-choice).
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, NARAL gave New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman and New York Gov. George Pataki good marks for supporting
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Republicans received the organization's top score.
Whitman, considered one of the most pro-choice among her party's
leaders, received a ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   NARAL said in its assessment of Whitman that she ``demonstrates
leadership'' on pro-choices legislative matters, however, ``more
consistency is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said Whitman's record was tarnished because she signed
a bill last year requiring women under 18 to notify their parents
to obtain an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL gave Pataki a ``C,'' calling his efforts to support
abortion rights ``unfocused.'' While Pataki ``has urged the
Republican Party to moderate its anti-choice stance,'' the group
said in a statement, he also has supported restrictions on access
to abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   The group gave Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge a ``D,'' labeling his
record ``disappointing,'' and asserting that his state is one of
the most restrictive in the nation in terms of access to abortion
services.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible GOP vice presidential nominees assessed
received ``Fs.'' They are: former Red Cross chief Elizabeth Dole;
Michigan Gov. John Engler; Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel; Ohio Rep.
John Kasich; Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating; Tennessee Sen. Fred
Thompson; and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, NARAL said seven of the possible vice
presidential nominees earned ``As'' on abortion rights. They are:
Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin; California Sen. Dianne Feinstein;
Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry; Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman; former Maine Sen. George Mitchell; Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson; and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sen. Bob Graham received a ``B,'' while the lowest
grade, a ``C,'' went to Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Graham received his grade, the organization said, because he has
voted to trim public funds for abortions. While Gephardt's record
has become increasingly pro-choice, NARAL concluded that his
``votes that safeguard the tenets of Roe and access to reproductive
health care and abortion services for low-income women are
wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
hopeful, and Bush are keeping the names of potential running mates
closely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Referring the vice presidential candidates, NARAL executive vice
president Alice Germond said: ``These are the people who may one
day be president. Will they protect or jeopardize every women's
right to choose? For the millions of pro-choice Americans who take
their values with them to the voting booth, the answer could well
determine whether and how they vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the advancing age of Supreme Court members, some abortion
rights activists believe that Bush might seek to undo the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision to legalize abortion by naming anti-abortion
justices to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion except in the case of rape, incest or when
the life of the mother is in danger. Gore supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of a woman's right to choose may well determine the
outcome of this election, and this right may ultimately be
determined by its result,'' Germond told a news conference, calling
abortion rights a ``swing issue'' with voters that could resonate
in key battleground states in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL lobbies lawmakers and runs a political action committee
that gives money to pro-choice candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In its assessments of the officials, NARAL considered voting
records, overall commitment to upholding the Roe vs. Wade decision,
whether the individual supports access to family planning services,
and whether the prospective running mate promotes women's health
issues and supports human embryo research.

   WASHINGTON _ Can people who drink too much be taught to control
their alcohol consumption?
</P>
<P>
   Unthinkable, say mainstream treatment organizations like the
Betty Ford Center and Hazelden, which have long insisted on total
abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Now criticism of an approach that allows for some controlled
drinking has flared again. In Washington state last week, a leading
proponent of this option, Audrey Kishline, pled guilty to killing
two people while driving drunk. She is the founder of Moderation
Management, set up in 1993 as an alternative to the abstinence-only
Alcoholics Anonymous. Then Alex DeLuca, the director of the
respected Smithers Addiction Treatment and Research Center in New
York City, resigned after failing to persuade his clinic to offer
some alternative to total abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLuca is right. Some problem drinkers might be trained to
control their intake. The difficulty is in figuring out which ones.
</P>
<P>
   The working definition of heavy drinker, according the
government's National Household Survey, is consuming five or more
drinks on a single occasion, five or more times within a month.
This kind of consumption, heavy as it is, doesn't make someone an
alcoholic. A heavy drinker could be a college student who drinks to
the point of getting sick on Saturday nights, but keeps up with his
grades and football practice. Or a employee who drinks a bottle of
wine alone at night, but never misses a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Call these people ``problem drinkers'' _ but not alcoholics. It
is possible, but far from guaranteed, that they will become
full-blown alcoholics, drinking compulsively despite serious
consequences like deteriorating job performance and withdrawal
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between the problem drinker and the alcoholic,
while not razor sharp, exists _ but hard-core opponents of the
drinking in moderation policy don't want to acknowledge it. To
them, you are either an alcoholic or not. Virtually no treatment
program will accept a patient who rejects abstinence as a goal. And
counselors tend to engage in double-think: if the patient says he's
an alcoholic, he is; if he refuses to admit he has a problem, he's
an alcoholic ``in denial'' and headed toward the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   But there are data that contradict this view. The ``Handbook of
Alcoholism Treatment Approaches,'' a textbook for clinicians,
provides evidence that some problem drinkers can successfully
control their consumption. Admittedly, this approach only works
when the risks are relatively low. If an individual has crossed the
line, admittedly fuzzy, into alcoholism, then the risks of of
allowing someone to have an occasional drink or two become too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The warning signs that the line has been crossed are a history
of domestic violence, suicide attempts, missed work, neglected
children _ an ``unmanageable'' life in the words of Alcoholics
Anonymous. Kishline must have known that the risks for her were too
high because she had quit Moderation Management and joined
Alcoholics Anonymous earlier this year, several months before the
fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of controlled drinking are afraid that some people
will use Moderation Management as an excuse to drink. But the
majority of problem drinkers, let alone alcoholics, have already
rejected abstinence. Surveys from Alcoholics Anonymous indicate
that its annual dropout rates average somewhere around 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   True, some doctors worry that sober recovering alcoholics will
come to think that moderate drinking is OK and try it again. The
task for the therapist is to have the patient think hard about why
he wants to sabotage so much. Some drinkers will always hope that
they can one day enjoy alcohol minus the devastation, but the
chances for relapse are reduced if we are adamant that controlled
drinking is not an option for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, intolerance of moderate drinking also has a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some problem drinkers are told by treatment professionals
that their choice is abstinence or no treatment, they will take
nothing and the opportunity to help is lost,'' says Jon
Morgenstern, director of alcohol treatment research at the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   So, the choice is rather stark. Admit that some problem drinkers
aren't alcoholics, and help them learn how to drink moderately. Or
insist on abstinence for those with even mild drinking problems _
and drive millions of people who need help away from treatment.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING, ARMSTRONG, PANTANI AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONT VENTOUX, France _ The last mile and a half came down to a
battle between the man in pink and the man in yellow. Wheel against
wheel, pedal against pedal, desire against desire.
</P>
<P>
   And the two reached the summit of the 93-mile race in a virtual
photo-finish as they looked more like friends than rivals. Lance
Armstrong _ the man who wears the overall leader's yellow jersey
and the No. 1 as defending champion _ retained the lead, while
pink-jerseyed Italian Marco Pantani was given the stage win.
</P>
<P>
   Which was fine with Armstrong, since he holds more than a
10-minute lead over Pantani (and a lead of 4:55 over second-place
Jan Ullrich) after 12 stages of the 21-stage Tour de France that
ends in Paris a week July 23.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a couple of formidable playground bullies decided
to play nice when Armstrong said a few words to Pantani as the two
made their way to the finish, and Armstrong seemed to coast just
enough to let Pantani cross the line first and raise his arms in
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Both were given the time of 4 hours 15 minutes 11 seconds as
they rode in 30 seconds ahead of the next rider, but Pantani was
given the race's win. More important to Armstrong, he finished 48
seconds ahead of Ullich.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made clear that declaring victory at the end of the
race holds much more significance than declaring it at the end of a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important to win the stage, I think in the minds of
many Marco Pantani is the best climber in the world,'' Armstrong
said. ``So I'll forgive the stages for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who won in 1998, but didn't participate last year after
a drug expulsion in the Tour of Italy earlier in the spring, was
just as diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong was in exceptional form today; he proved he is a
champion,'' Pantani said. ``I had a great will to win. I wanted to
win at all costs, but was bothered by the wind and a cramp in my
left quadricep. I know I won a nice stage, but there's a lot of
road to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Livingston and Tyler Hamilton, of Marblehead, Mass.,
surrounded Armstrong, their team leader, for almost the entire race
as they shielded him from the wind that gusted to 40 miles per hour
and ensured that opposing riders didn't get an advantage. For
Hamilton, the ride was payback for his win on this mountain in a
stage race last month, when he was the one getting support from
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The team stayed together on the final ascent. Suddenly, Pantani,
who had been riding with the main group two minutes back, surged to
join the lead pack and then attacked to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending champion would not give in, and for the last
two miles, Armstrong caught up with Pantani as the two rode to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who seemed to encourage Pantani when he lowered his
left hand as if to usher on Pantani, acknowledged that he was
encouraging the Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see what a big effort he was making, so I wanted him
to ride with me and stay together in the wind,'' Armstrong said.
``Just some encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouragement that resulted in both cyclists being declared
winners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   To the French, Mont Ventoux means windy mountain; to cyclists,
it's known as the Giant of Provence. The race ends up at an
altitude of 6,000 feet as the final climb juts up at an almost
eight percent grade for 12 miles. Mont Ventoux has been on the Tour
map just 11 other times since the race's start in 1903, and in
1967, cyclist Tom Simpson collapsed and died on the mountain. But
the elements were not totally to blame _ Simpson was found to have
been taking amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wind and 40-degree temperature at the summit this
week, Tour organizers decided to abandon the press room that's
always at the finish of the race. So the horde of media that
follows the cyclists was told to stay at a press center at the
start of the race in Carpentras, in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Director of communications Philippe Sudres said that about 1,000
print jounalists are given credentials, and that amount doubles
when all the drivers and technicians are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour continues to take its toll. German racer Marcel Wust,
who won last week's fifth stage, did not start Thursday's race, and
American Chann McRae was among eight riders who were victims either
of crashes or the mountain. Another rider who had to ``abandon''
(as the Tour so harshly puts it) was Tom Steels, winner of the
second stage. The field is now down to 151 from the original 198.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Thurmont, Md.) _ During President Clinton's
seven years in office, no world leader has journeyed more often to
the White House than Yasser Arafat. The Palestinian leader has met
Clinton there a dozen times, and his image in Washington has become
almost commonplace. In turn, Clinton made the risky gesture of
being the first American president to visit Arafat on his home turf
in Gaza. In the coming days, as the Camp David summit rolls towards
a climax, the White House will see whether that investment can be
made to pay in a peace settlement. Clinton believes that
personalities and relationships can fundamentally alter history,
and according to his aides, he is banking on his affinity with
Arafat, and with the Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, to make a
critical difference at Camp David. By Jane Perlez.

VIETNAM: SYMBOL AND SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade accord with Vietnam that President Clinton announced
Thursday represents, for America, an overdue recognition that there
is no longer any reason to prohibit normal relations with the only
country to defeat the United States in a war.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the primary effect of the trade deal on Americans will be
psychological and symbolic. It is a way of acknowledging that, with
the passage of time, Vietnam has become a nation like any other in
the American psyche. Most Americans no longer feel an emotional or
political need to retain high tariffs on textiles from Vietnam or
to discourage US companies from investing there.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, however, the pact that Vietnamese Trade Minister Vu
Khoan negotiated with US trade representative Charlene Barshefsky
promises to have momentous economic and political effects.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Vietnam's commitment to open itself to investment
from American corporations signifies a surrender by Communist Party
hardliners who, until now, had clung tenaciously to the statist
structures of their foundering economic system.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, hardliners nixed a similar trade accord that had
been negotiated with Washington because of a well-founded fear that
the inefficient state-owned enterprises controlled by their
relatives and cronies could not survive competition with unfettered
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Two dramatic illustrations of the hardliners' blunder have
tilted Hanoi toward a change of attitude. Economic output in
Vietnam has plunged since 1995, and there has been a precipitous
falloff in foreign investment since 1996, when it reached an annual
peak of $8 billion on the erroneous assumption that Vietnam would
become the next Asian tiger.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Vietnam's change of heart follows hard
upon China's impending acquisition of permanent normal trade
relations with the United States. If America's leaders had
appreciated the deep-seated rivalry between Hanoi and Beijing, they
might never have made war on Vietnam in the first place.

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES RAISE IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO IRAS AND 401(K)
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Md.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee approved
legislation Thursday that would significantly raise maximum
allowable contributions to individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would gradually increase, over three years, the maximum
annual contribution to individual retirement accounts, to $5,000
from $2,000. The change would apply both to conventional retirement
accounts, under which contributions are tax deductible, and to Roth
IRAs, under which contributions are taxable but withdrawals are tax
free.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase, over five years, the maximum annual
employee contribution to 401(k) accounts, to $15,000 from $10,500.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 27-9, with five Democrats joining 22 Republicans on
the committee in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is expected
in the next week or two. It is unclear whether the Senate will
consider similar legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill before us responds to the fact that pension coverage
and retirement savings today is wholly inadequate at a time when it
is badly needed,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who wrote the
bill with Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to attract considerable support from
Democrats when it goes to the full House. But some Democrats in the
House, as well as officials in the Clinton administration, said
they were concerned about provisions of the bill intended to reduce
the regulatory burden on employers who offer pension plans. They
said the regulatory changes could lead some employers to cut back
on pensions for low- and moderate-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to create what we would consider adverse
effects,'' said Jon Talisman, an assistant secretary of the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also allow some people, under some
circumstances, to make additional contributions above the maximum
amounts to retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. People who are at
least 50 years old would be allowed to contribute to individual
retirement accounts as much as $5,000 a year starting next year,
instead of having to wait for the higher limits to be phased in
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the bill, people who are at least 50 would
also be permitted to make contributions to 401(k) plans of up to
$5,000 above the limits imposed on younger account holders. For
example, when the general contribution limit reaches $15,000 in
2005 under the bill's provisions, people 50 or older would be able
to contribute as much as $20,000 a year to a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would reduce federal revenue by an estimated $54
billion over 10 years.

 &HT;    A dark drama, `Sunshine' sheds light on brutality
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _Emmanuel Sonnenschein, patriarch of a
Hungarian Jewish family, raises his glass on the eve of 1900 and
predicts that the new century will be a time of ``love, justice and
tolerance.'' He may be a wise man, but he'll never make it as a
prognosticator.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine, the ironically named epic by Istvan Szabo (Oscar
winner for 1981's Mephisto), is both the translation of the family
name and what they call the alcoholic health elixir they produce
from a secret, blood-stained recipe. The film chronicles three
generations of abject hardship, brought on by the family's
impatience to assimilate in the face of anti-Semitism and
self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   At three hours, it is an exhausting, difficult viewing
experience but ultimately a tribute to human endurance in the face
of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is about one family's stubborn inability to learn,
repeating the same mistakes, generation after generation. So
similar are the choices and fates of the Sonnenschein men that, in
a stunning bit of stunt casting, grandfather, father and son are
all played by the intense Ralph Fiennes, with slight changes in
demeanor and more overt adjustments of facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   As sober, ambitious lawyer Ignatz, he is persuaded to change his
name to the more Hungarian-sounding Sors to be appointed judge and
rise in politics. With each move closer to the center of power, he
grows more corrupt, only to be ostracized as the Austro-Hungarian
Empire begins to crumble. His son Adam _ Fiennes again _ is intent
on fencing for Hungary in the 1936 Olympics, even if it requires
converting to Catholicism and allying with military officers who
openly disdain him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adam wins a gold medal, which affords him momentary
immunity as Hitler comes to power, he learns that no attempt to
deny his heritage can shield him. On a wintry day in a
concentration camp, Adam is singled out, stripped, hosed down and
left to freeze to death as his son silently looks on. That son,
Ivan, consumed by guilt, will later help punish Nazi sympathizers,
but as a pawn of the Communists. As regimes replace each other, as
the labels and ideologies change, intolerance remains a constant.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many historical novels, romantic involvements
parallel the politics. Foremost among the women of Sunshine is
Ignatz's cousin Valerie (the radiant Jennifer Ehle, this year's
Tony winner for The Real Thing), whom he marries over the protests
of his parents. A photographer and observer of life, Valerie breaks
from Ignatz as he climbs the political ladder but returns when he
lapses into ill health.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie is the film's spine, cursed with an ability to survive
through the ages. And, in another casting coup, Ehle is succeeded
in the role by her mother, the expressive, delicate Rosemary
Harris. Involved with latter-day Sors men are Rachel Weisz, who
seduces brother-in-law Adam, and Deborah Kara Unger as a Soviet
soldier attracted to Ivan. And late in the movie, William Hurt
gives his best performance in years as an Auschwitz survivor
brutalized by the Stalinists.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, Sunshine breaks neatly into one-hour segments, as
if it were intended to be a miniseries. Even at three hours,
though, this vast tale often feels rushed and truncated. Surely, it
is a quirk of film distribution that such a serious, thoughtful and
demanding work as this arrives in the summer amid the crowded field
of smirking comedies and mindless eye candy. For those willing to
devote the time and make the emotional commitment, Sunshine is a
rewarding walk through the dark history of
</P>
<P>
   the past century.

 &HT;    Appeals court lets verdict stand against Time Warner
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner may be feeling a bit queasy after another drop in
its rollercoaster ride tied to Six Flags Over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a 1998 jury
verdict requiring Time Warner and partners to pay $454 million to a
group of smaller partners who had invested in the Georgia amusement
park.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller investors claimed companies controlled by Time
Warner intentionally mismanaged the park to drive down its value
and make it cheaper for the Time Warner companies to acquire a
bigger stake.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest claims: The defendants delayed the
installation of one of the park's most popular rollercoasters,
Batman the Ride, put off $7 million in repairs and took secret
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Time Warner, which no longer has an ownership
interest in the park, called Thursday's decision ``unfortunate''
and announced they will appeal again. They contend the original
Gwinnett County jury trial was unfair, that there was insufficient
evidence for the verdict and that they were not allowed to present
some evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that because of the decision it will
take a one-time charge of $50 million against second quarter
profits. The remainder of the company's potential liability in the
case has already been put in reserves, Time Warner spokesman Ed
Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Butler, the lead attorney for the parties suing Time Warner
entities, said he wasn't surprised by the appeals decision. The
dollar amount of the verdict is believed to be one of the largest
in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the verdict was a function of the magnitude of
Time Warner's misconduct toward its partners and the magnitude of
actual, provable economic damages...,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, companies related to Time Warner sold their interests
in Six Flags theme parks to Premier Parks, an Oklahoma City-based
chain that recently changed its name to Six Flags Inc.

CABOT SELLING LNG ARM TO FRENCH COMPANY FOR $680 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cabot Corp. is selling its liquefied natural gas
business, including the landmark Distrigas storage tanks alongside
the Mystic River, to a French-owned energy company for $680 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the unit formally known as Cabot LNG LLC also
includes a 10 percent share of a liquefaction plant in Trinidad, a
ship to transport that gas to Boston, long-term contracts to supply
gas to two large electric generating plants and several utility
companies, and the right to build a $150 million, gas-fired power
generating plant at Island End in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is Tractebel Inc., the US subsidiary of Tractebel S.A.
of Belgium, which operates that country's largest electric utility
and has other gas and electric power interests around the world
that employ more than 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Tractabel Inc.'s operations in New England include a half
interest in a 330-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Bellingham;
full ownership of wood-fired electric generating stations in
Westminster, Tamworth, and Bethlehem, N.H., and East Ryegate, Vt.;
and a hydroelectric generating station in Winooski, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue to build our presence in the region, to be
an owner and operator of assets,'' William P. Utt, chief executive
of Tractabel Power Inc., said in a telephone interview from his
office in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   With several gas-fired power plants planned or being built in
New England, Utt said Tractabel foresees a need to eventually
expand the Distrigas terminal. The terminal is scheduled to receive
40 deliveries by ship this year, 10 more than in 1999, as demand
for natural gas grows.
</P>
<P>
   Tractabel S.A., based in Brussels, is a wholly owned unit of
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, a publicly traded conglomerate based in
Paris that also operates water systems and wastewater treatment
plants and has a worldwide construction division.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot Corp.'s primary business is specialty chemicals, but for
more than 130 years the company has also been a producer and
distributor of natural gas and, to a lesser degree, oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot's Distrigas unit began importing gas from Algeria in 1971.
Depending on weather conditions, Cabot LNG supplies about 10
percent of all gas burned in New England, mostly distributed by
pipeline to local utilities, including the Boston Gas Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot's chairman and chief executive, Samuel W. Bodman, said the
sale of Cabot LNG is expected to close by Sept. 1. Approval from
the Justice Department and the US Securities and Exchange
Commission is required, but federal and state energy officials said
the transaction appears to be exempt from their rules.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Gas said it expects the sale to have no impact on its
operations or ability to serve its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Utt said no personnel changes are planned among Cabot LNG's 86
employees, but added there could be some consolidation in the
future with Tractebel's LNG operations in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Bodman, in a telephone interview, said Cabot Corp. expects
proceeds from the sale after taxes to be about $500 million, to be
earmarked for repurchase of Cabot shares and to develop new
products based on its core chemical products. The Cabot Corp. board
is scheduled to meet Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This eliminates the last vestiges of our energy business,''
Bodman said. ``We are now truly a chemical company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodman said Cabot hopes that shedding its reputation as a
conglomerate will improve investor opinion about its shares, which
have lagged for the past three years during one of the strongest
bull stock markets in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Investors did, in fact, respond favorably to the LNG deal. Cabot
shares closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $31.7188,
up $1.5938.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston analyst John Cochran said while
Cabot's LNG division has been profitable in colder-than-normal
years, slack sales during warmer years cut deeply into the
company's overall financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their earnings were practically zero'' in 1998, he said,
because of LNG losses. Changes in gas purchasing were pointing to a
profit for LNG of about $20 million this year, Cochran said, but
chemicals still would account for 80 percent of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot's primary chemicals are carbon black, used in dyes and
manufacturing tires; fumed silica, a thickener for paints and
adhesives; tantalum metals for electronics; and cesium compounds
used in drilling oil wells to prevent pressure blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   With 4,400 employees and plants in 23 countries, Cabot Corp.
reported operating profits of $229 million on $1.7 billion in sales
during its 1999 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS INACTION ON JUDGES REFLECTS BIAS IN GOP
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts grafs 8-13 with Bush response.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In a broad attack on his Republican foes, President
Clinton said Thursday that Senate opposition to his judicial
nominations reflects a party bias against African Americans and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He took specific aim at Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, both Texas Republicans, for blocking his nomination of
El Paso attorney Enrique Moreno to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of those senators, who contend that Moreno was
nominated to help Clinton raise Democratic funds from the Hispanic
community, the nomination has been stalled in the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they want to give these people a hearing and a
vote?'' Clinton asked during remarks at the annual convention of
the NAACP. ``Because they don't want him on the court, but they
don't want you to know they don't want him on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint June 19 letter to Clinton, Gramm and Hutchison
chastised Clinton for ``trading on judicial nominations as a device
to generate money for Democratic political campaigns,'' and went on
to cite the Moreno nomination as part of a ``strategy of mixing
judicial nominations with partisan hectoring in order to extract
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that Moreno is a highly qualified nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Clinton said, ``the leader of
the Republican Party in Texas, who I think talked here a couple
days ago _ stone cold silence. Nobody says, 'Give this guy a
hearing.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said, ``The
recent attacks by President Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore
only confirm the fact that Governor Bush is a different kind of
Republican who is making inroads among African-Americans and
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush should be urging GOP senators to convene hearings
on the appointees,
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said, ``The Constitution gives that authority and
responsibility to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has a proven record in Texas of appointing
people from all walks of
</P>
<P>
   life, including many Hispanics, African-Americans and women. He
will do the same as
</P>
<P>
   president,'' said McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   SInce taking office in 1995, Bush has named 3,017 appointees to
state boards, commissions and vacant judgeships. Of those, 1,109
were female, 258 were African-American and 397 were Hispanic. Over
all, 2,329 were white.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the NAACP on Monday, Bush did not address the
topic of judicial nominations, but he acknowledged that the
Republican Party had not always been in tune with the NAACP's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is
a blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress,
still exists today,'' Bush said in his speech. ``For my party,
there is no escaping the reality that the party of Lincoln has not
always carried the mantle of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton singled out Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., by
name, accusing him of standing in the way of Clinton's efforts to
integrate the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms won't let these people get confirmed,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over seven years now, he has stopped my attempts to
integrate the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Republican
majority has made no move to change the tide,'' said Clinton.
``This is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Helms aide dismissed the criticism as ``election-year
politics,'' and said the senator stands by his contention that the
Fourth Circuit doesn't need any additional judges.
</P>
<P>
   When Helms was told of the president's remarks, ``he chuckled
and he said, 'the president just can't tell the straight (truth)
about anything, can he?' '' said Helms's aide, who declined to be
quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit _ comprising Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,
North Carolina and South Carolina _ has the largest black
population of any federal circuit in the country, and has never had
a black judge. There are 15 federal judgeships on the circuit; four
are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has opposed Clinton's nomination of two African Americans
_ Richmond, Va., attorney Roger Gregory and North Carolina state
appellate Judge James Wynn _ to the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want justice to be blind,'' said Clinton. ``But we also
know that when we have diversity in our courts, as in all aspects
of society, it sharpens our vision and makes us a stronger
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   All presidential nominations for the federal bench are subject
to the review of the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   White House statistics show that Senate confirmations closely
mirror Clinton's nominations in terms of percentage of women and
minorities allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has nominated 104 candidates to the federal bench over
the past year and a half, 50 of whom _ 48 percent _ are either
women or minorities. The Senate has confirmed 64 of those nominees,
30 of whom _ 47 percent _ have been women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has highlighted a few high-profile cases that
have drawn sharp criticism from groups like the NAACP, including
the nominations of Gregory, Moreno and Missouri Supreme Court Judge
Ronnie White.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Senate voted, in a straight party-line vote,
to kill the nomination of White _ the first African American judge
to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court _ to the federal appeals
court, contending that he was not likely to be tough enough on
death-row cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lambasted the vote, which drew sharp criticism from the
African American community, but he stopped short of calling his
opponents racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president was being polite when he called it
partisanship,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP _ the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said Clinton's remarks would persuade many African
Americans to see the judicial nomination process as a key issue in
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as outraged as he was,'' said Bond. ``They're going to
go back to their homes and say to their senators, 'What about
it?'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The academic world's biggest professional
plum officially went on the market Thursday, as Harvard University
kicked off its search for a new president, a process that is
already generating intense buzz despite being shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard wants to name a successor by spring for President Neil
L. Rudenstine, who has led the institution since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A short list of candidates is months away, university officials
said in announcing the team that will run the search. But
name-dropping of star candidates in higher education _ and even one
in the White House _ has already begun. And Harvard neighbors are
pressing agendas that they say did not get aggressive action from
Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as close to a unique search as you're going to
see,'' said John Kuhnle, head of the education practice at
Korn/Ferry International, an executive-recruitment firm. ``The bar
will be high _ for academic prestige and institutional affiliation,
especially.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the search will be Robert G. Stone, Jr., who was
national co-chair of Harvard's recently completed $2.6 billion
fund-raising campaign. D. Ronald Daniel, treasurer of the
university, and Hanna Gray, former president of the University of
Chicago, are also on the nine-member committee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to mail about 350,000 letters to alumni, donors,
students, and others, soliciting both views about the university's
direction and nominations for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have any limits on the type of person we're
looking for, or the specific categories of expertise,'' said Joe
Wrinn, a university spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The next president will focus on academic planning and
development issues. Harvard has nearly closed a deal to purchase 48
acres in Boston's Allston section from the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, and is considering putting academic buildings,
dormitories, or other facilities there. Rudenstine, while dealing
with these issues, dove into fundraising, recently completing a
$2.6 billion campaign. No new campaign is on the boards yet.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's business school dean, Kim B. Clark, and the provost,
Harvey V. Fineberg, are seen as strong managers and fundraisers,
making them insider favorites. Both are known quantities, with
Clark's ties dating to the 1970's, when he earned his undergraduate
and graduate degrees in economics at the university. Fineberg also
attended Harvard and previously led the school of public health.
</P>
<P>
   Several women have also been mentioned as contenders, according
to Harvard administrators and executive-search experts. Those
include Duke University's Nannerl O. Keohane, who previously led
Wellesley College, and Alison F. Richard, an anthropologist who has
been provost of Yale University since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With political figures revolving in and out of education posts,
some has speculated that President Clinton may also be Harvard
material. But one adviser to the president said a
White-House-to-Ivy-League scenario was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will be a player on the world stage, on a great
many issues, and that kind of role is inconsistent with the
institutional stewardship required of a university president,''
said Christopher Edley, Jr., a Harvard law professor who works on
race and education issues for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy R. Knowles, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, pooh-poohed the Clinton rumor. ``I suppose if you could
run the country, you could run Harvard,'' he said. ``But I think
the country may be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the prospects returned phone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard will advertise the position in only a few newspapers,
and may keep the ad to just a few sentences, according to one
university official. Many schools draft pages of detailed criteria
and aggressively court prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grogan, vice president for government, community and public
affairs at Harvard, said consultation with constituents would not
be lip service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be extensive communications with all of the
stakeholders, and that will include a very strong emphasis on local
issues and local stakeholders,'' Grogan said.

DRUG ADHERENCE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH HIV PATIENTS, AIDS CONFERENCE
TOLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Despite free drugs, refills by phone and
medication by mail, 80 percent of HIV-positive patients at two
Houston clinics did not stick to their medication schedules,
according to a study presented Thursday at the 13th International
AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Drug adherence, or the taking of medications as prescribed, has
emerged as one of the most serious obstacles to using the powerful
medicines that have given new life to people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making people sick, haphazard adherence to drug
regimens leads to viral resistance to the medicine, increasing the
danger that an untreatable form of the AIDS virus could begin
circulating within the community.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grimes, a professor of management and policy at the
University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health, said he
initiated the study in 1996, just after the introduction of
protease inhibitors, the successful drugs that have turned HIV
infection into a manageable disease in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was concerned that people with HIV, like people with
tuberculosis, would have difficulty taking their medication as
prescribed, leading to increasing ineffectiveness of the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The research confirmed Grimes' hunch, providing a sobering
snapshot: Among patients in three consecutive studies, the number
of patients who didn't stick to the regimen ranged from 73 percent
to 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably worse than this,'' Grimes said, since the study
looked only at prescription refills rather than pills swallowed or
taken at the appropriate times. ``It takes a really motivated
person to do it. Bottom line is, adherence sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1997, he recruited 310 patients into the study
at a Houston clinic. The patients were taking combination therapy
including a protease inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   He defined non-adherence as failing to renew their prescriptions
within 37 days of receiving a 30-day supply within any month for
six consecutive months. This allowed patients to miss up to 20
percent of their doses every month before they were considered
non-adherent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate was so poor, I thought it was too early in the
game,'' Grimes said, assuming that people still hadn't learned how
to use the drugs.'' So he and his colleagues launched another study
at the same clinic, recruiting 257 patients between 1997 and 1998,
``and got the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   He took his research to the Veterans Administration Hospital,
which has a ``user-friendly'' system, he said, and provides a
convenient way for patients to phone in prescription refills and
receive their drugs through the mail. He recruited 191 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were slightly better at the VA, but still dismal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the immune systems deteriorated among patients who
failed to take their drugs properly and their health declined.
</P>
<P>
   The research team tried to figure out why people didn't take
their medicine. They looked at such possible factors as race,
gender, stage of disease, drug abuse and language barriers. They
took into consideration age, daily pill counts and mental health.
They compared patients who saw multiple doctors with those who had
a single specialist overseeing their care.
</P>
<P>
   None of it mattered. Now Grimes is planning to investigate a new
theory.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with friends who are HIV-positive, Grimes asked
them how soon after their diagnosis they were ready to begin highly
active anti-retroviral therapy, or HAART, which consists of three
or more AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With the exceptions of two pregnant women, everyone said it took
at least a year before they were mentally prepared.
</P>
<P>
   While a physician is ready to prescribe medication as soon as
the amount of virus in the patient's blood warrants it, patients
may still be adjusting to the shock of an HIV diagnosis, Grimes
said. They may not be ready to commit to a lifetime of pills that
often have unpleasant side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend of Grimes' said: ``I had to have a period of not
being sick before I made myself sick taking those drugs.'' She
waited until three years after her diagnosis to begin taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes suspects doctors are putting people on anti-AIDS drugs
before they are ready. Through questionnaires and focus groups, he
hopes to ferret out the signs that a patient is prepared to start
therapy, and pass those guidelines along to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Just as misuse of antibiotics leads to stubborn strains of
bacteria, improper use of anti-retroviral drugs leads to strains of
HIV that no longer respond to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, a patient can switch to drugs in a different
family, but the results are not as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salvage therapy is about half as effective as first therapy.
Your first shot is your best shot,'' Grimes said. ``This is a
lifelong commitment. This is getting married to a pill bottle.''

BREAST-FEEDING BEST FOR HIV-POSITIVE BABIES, STUDY SUGGESTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ The unusual results of a new study
suggest a safer way for poor, HIV-positive women to breast-feed
their babies _ an important discovery for women in the developing
world who have no choice but to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The report was presented Thursday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Of infants who acquire HIV from their mothers, about one-third
get the virus through breast milk. Despite the risk, breast-feeding
is an economic and cultural necessity for most African women.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in KwaZulu Natal, the South African province where
one-third of pregnant women are infected with the AIDS virus,
compared exclusive breast-feeding, mixed feeding and formula
feeding among 551 HIV-positive women.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive breast-feeding was defined as mother's milk only _ no
water, tea or formula. Mixed feeding, which is common among African
women, includes breast-milk and other liquids or soft foods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the babies who were formula-fed, 19.4 percent were
HIV-positive at the end of six months. Among the babies who
received mixed feedings, 35 percent were infected after six months.
</P>
<P>
   The infection rate among babies in the group fed breast milk
exclusively was 24.7 percent _ a significant improvement over the
mixed-feeding group.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem that exclusive breast-feeding is inherently
more dangerous because it increases the amount of time the baby is
exposed to the virus through mother's milk, the research shows this
not to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at University of Natal in Durban, including Dr.
Hoosen Coovadia, chair of the AIDS conference, believe that mixed
feeding may cause inflammation, or create small breaks in the
lining of the digestive tract, creating portals through which HIV
can enter the body.
</P>
<P>
   A diet of mother's milk alone may prevent that. And, as an added
benefit, breast milk protects the baby from potentially fatal
diarrhea caused by formula mixed with unclean water.

US-VIETNAM TRADE DEAL HAILED   BY OFFICIALS, IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for the United States and Vietnam Thursday agreed to
normalize trade relations, marking the end of an era of bitter
animosity and deep distrust between the two countries dating back
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pact still must be approved by Congress _ not necessarily a
sure thing given the recent political slugfest over a similar trade
agreement with China. But the movement toward agreement was hailed
widely, both by political leaders and Vietnamese Americans, as a
boon for both nations.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits to Vietnam are largely economic, opening its small and
feeble economy to the world's largest market, said Thomas J.
Vallely, director of the Vietnam program at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government. The benefits to the United States, he
said, are largely diplomatic, stabilizing and strengthening a major
country in Southeast Asia at a time of instability in Indonesia,
long a principal US ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Boston's large and thriving Vietnamese community saw
the issues on a much more personal plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing for Vietnam because it will help the
people understand how bad the communists are,'' said An Le Dang, a
veteran of the South Vietnamese armed forces that were defeated and
disbanded when North Vietnam's communist rulers unified the country
25 years ago. ``For so long the communists closed our eyes to the
world. This will let people open their eyes and see. It will bring
more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeply Americanized Vietnamese, born long after the end of the
shooting war that cost the lives of millions of Vietnamese and
58,000 Americans, had very different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help people over there, but it will also help the
attitude of people here,'' said Vuong Nguyen, a 17-year-old senior
at Boston College High School, as he and his friends emerged with
their lunches from the Fields Corner McDonald's. ``I still feel the
tension, the prejudice here. . . . That all comes from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader, more normal contacts between the countries, he said,
``will help break the discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Vietnam have been at odds since the early
1960s, when the US gradually took over what had been French support
of the Western-allied South Vietnamese regime against the
communist-bloc-allied North. Despite massive American military and
economic aid, the south never was able to defend itself. It
collapsed in 1975, two years after US troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades, the United States banned trade,
investment, and most travel between the countries; the embargo was
lifted in 1994 and diplomatic relations were restored in 1995. By
the time that occurred, other nations _ in particular Japan,
Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea _ were far ahead of the
United States in trade and investment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, that is not very significant to the United States.
As Vallely pointed out, Vietnam exports $12 billion a year to the
entire world; the United States imports 100 times that sum.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said US Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), one of a
group of Vietnam War veterans in Congress who have spearheaded the
drive for normalization of relations, ``this is a place where the
United States has tremendous opportunities over the long haul.'' He
stressed that, with 77 million people, Vietnam is one of the more
populous countries in the world, with young, relatively
well-educated citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the tariff reductions that make up a major part of
the agreement take effect, products made by that work force will
become competitive on the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nike sporting goods company is already in effect the largest
private employer in Vietnam, with about 50,000 workers, but it
employs them through South Korean and Taiwanese subcontractors, and
the shoes they produce are sold on the European market. The work
force could quickly double as a result of tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That does not add up to an unmitigated good to all Vietnamese
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic relations is good, but not trade right now,'' said
Ton Huu, 73, the style of her white hair and blue suit more likely
to be seen in her former hometown of Saigon than in Boston. ``First
(the Vietnamese government) has to be more fair to citizens. They
should have the right to do business and not have the government
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, John Truong, a pharmacist who graduated from
Northeastern University, translated for Ton and added his own
skepticism. ``With this you empower the government, the high
officials. There's just a little benefit, some job creation, to
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is an election year and the China trade agreement
battle is already on the legislative calendar, Congressional
approval for the Vietnam pact may not be immediately forthcoming,
but several observers believe it will come more easily than
President Clinton's proposal for permanent normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the small size of Vietnam's economy means
that it does not pose an economic threat. Another is that there are
no complicating issues such as the American dispute with China over
missile proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Vietnam War veterans dominate discussion of the
issue also means Vietnam has much better congressional relations
than China. And, given the Sino-US tensions, many on Capitol Hill
appreciate the value of improving relations with a country that
borders China.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is now a large Vietnamese-American population
whose members want to be able to visit relatives without the fears
they now harbor. Unlike the Cuban American population, they favor
improving relations even though many loathe communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wish for better relations,'' said Kim Hall, 54, a
Vietnamese outreach worker at the Kit Clark Senior Center in
Boston's Dorchester section. ``We are still scared (when visiting)
because they don't have human rights. Trade will help a lot of
Vietnamese people feel more secure.''

 CLINTON BLAMES REPUBLICANS FOR LACK OF BLACK AND HISPANIC JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton strongly criticized Republicans on
Thursday for blocking his African-American and Hispanic judicial
nominees, and he urged delegates to the annual convention of the
NAACP to elect Vice President Al Gore to ensure that the courts
remain diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important responsibilities of the next
president is appointing judges,'' said Clinton, who predicted that
over the next four years there would be from two to four Supreme
Court vacancies, more than a score of Court of Appeals vacancies
and more than 100 openings on federal district courts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called it ``outrageous'' that the 4th Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals, which has the highest percentage of African-American
residents of any judicial area, is without a single black judge. He
singled out for criticism Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whom the
president blamed for blocking his nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, had remained silent when
Republicans in that state blocked a Hispanic nominee, Enrique
Moreno, to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of justice suffers when highly qualified women and
minority candidates, fully vetted, fully supported by the American
Bar Association, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan
political reasons,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took a break from the Middle East peace talks today to
make his final address as president to the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, which helped turn out black
voters for Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come to Baltimore today,'' Clinton said, likening
``the spirit of freedom and reconciliation'' of the NAACP with what
he is seeking in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the podium, Clinton quickly transformed from
peacemaker to politician.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Bush for not avoiding the NAACP convention, as the
Republican presidential nominee in 1996, Bob Dole, had done. But
Clinton said he thought Gore had delivered the better speech of the
two presidential contenders and would make the better president.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience clapped politely when Bush spoke on
Monday. They jumped to their feet after Gore's address on
Wednesday. But they saved a hero's welcome for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of vice presidents, a lot of vice presidents
made great presidents _ Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson,'' Clinton said. ``But we've never had a
vice president that did so much good as vice president as Al Gore _
never, not ever in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore had done in his speech on Wednesday, Clinton quoted from
the Bible in his remarks. Citing Ecclesiastes 11:25 _ ``In the day
of prosperity, there is forgetfulness of affliction'' _ the
president said this period of economic growth is the ideal time to
focus on the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of his first visit to an NAACP
convention, in 1992, when he was governor of Arkansas and Gore was
a senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledged then _ and I want to quote it exactly, I don't want
to miss a word _ I pledged you `an administration that looks like
America; one that knows the promise and the pain of this country;
one that will rebuild, reunite and renew the American spirit,' ''
Clinton said. ``I think together we have honored that pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is a nonpartisan organization, but the political
preferences of those in the audience were clear. They jumped to
their feet, applauded loudly and cried out as the president spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't endorse politicians,'' said Julian Bond, the chairman
of the NAACP. ``But we know how to recognize our friends, and this
president is our friend.''

BRADLEY OFFERS SUPPORT TO GORE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Bill Bradley came here Thursday to praise the
man who buried him in the Democratic primary, offering a polite
endorsement of Vice President Al Gore in the name of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a remarkable experience'' running for president, a
rested-looking Bradley told about 600 people gathered in the
sweltering heat of Bay Beach Park, a waterfront amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though someone once told me ... `experience' is what you get
when you don't get what you really wanted. Indeed, the Democratic
voters spoke and selected the vice president as our party's
nominee,'' the former senator from New Jersey added wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is strongest when we're unified, when we speak with
one voice, when we work together to guarantee a Democratic Congress
and a Democratic president,'' Bradley continued. ``Today, I want to
make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley withdrew from the Democratic primary, winless, four
months ago. While he said in March that he would support Gore as
the presumptive nominee, Bradley did not formally endorse Gore
until Thursday in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Gore _ who accused Bradley during the primaries of being a
quitter because he did not ``stay and fight'' for the party after
the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 _ called his
former foe ``a good Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with Bill Bradley in the years
ahead,'' Gore told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The two men raised their clasped hands in a victory salute, but
otherwise, there appeared to be little warmth between the former
primary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was well into his speech before even mentioning Gore by
name, and only did so after first mentioning the Democratic Party
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that under (Gore's) leadership, we will come closer
to solving the problems I mentioned earlier than under the
leadership of Governor George W. Bush,'' Bradley said, his words
nearly drowned out at times by anti-Gore demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has ``a deep understanding'' of technology that will
change America's future,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking, the 6-foot, 5-inch Bradley stepped aside and sat
on a barstool, so he no longer towered over Gore when the vice
president delivered his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was highly critical of Bradley during the primary
fight, was effusive about Bradley, describing him as an eloquent
advocate for racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more passionate voice for justice and equality in
all of America,'' Gore said. ``I look forward to working with Bill
Bradley in the years ahead, to break down the barriers of
intolerance and discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore quoted Bradley several times and added, ``I treasure Bill
Bradley's support. He is a good Democrat who speaks and stands for
principles we all believe in. And Bill Bradley will be an important
part of the campaign and an important part of our country's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how involved Bradley would be in the Gore
campaign. But Bradley will be in public eye when he launches a book
tour Sept. 26 that will take him to 15 cities through the end of
October. The book, titled ``The Journey from Here,'' is a
collection of eight essays.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met one-on-one for about 40 minutes at the airport
in Green Bay. It was the first time the former Senate colleagues
have been together since March 1, the last Democratic debate in Los
Angeles. Until Thursday, Gore and Bradley had spoken only twice
since then: first when Bradley withdrew, and second to set up the
joint appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who won no states during the contentious primary
season, doesn't bring much to the campaign table for Gore, said
political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a former
candidate for president, Bradley does not have a hard-core group of
supporters he can galvanize for the nominee, Rothenberg noted.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley's lack of success in the primaries isn't promising,
in terms of transferring votes for Gore, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a combatant in his own campaign,'' Rothenberg said.
``So how can he be a combatant in somebody else's campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore campaign officials played down the significance of
Bradley's endorsement. ``We're now in the pre-convention stage of
the campaign,'' so the two camps decided to arrange the joint
appearance, Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said.

   WASHINGTON _ Poignant new evidence that the U.S. Capitol and the
White House were built largely with slave labor has sparked a
bipartisan proposal to recognize the contributions of the unknown
workers and may intensify debate over a national apology and
reparations for the nation's long history of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have long known that African-American slaves helped
build both the Capitol and the White House, but Edward Hotaling, a
historian and television reporter, recently uncovered proof that
slaves constituted a majority of the 650 workers who built the
structures, two of the most recognizable symbols of the nation's
democratic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling found pay stubs dating from the 1790s that show
payments to slave owners but nothing to the laborers. One of the
stubs, dated October 1795, calls for the payment of $5 a month to
Joseph Farrah for ``hire of his Negro, Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Capitol was not completed until the 1860s
and the White House was finished in 1800. Slavery was outlawed in
Washington in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the Republican Conference
and the only African-American GOP House member, Wednesday called on
Congress to create a task force to examine the contributions of
these unpaid workers, and to recommend a permanent exhibition or
memorial to mark their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Watts also became the first member of the GOP leadership to
express support, albeit guarded, for a proposal by Rep. Tony Hall,
D-Ohio, for an official apology for slavery and a commission to
examine the legacy of slavery and possible redress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some have questioned the motivation, but I know that
the congressman from Ohio was motivated by his Christianity and the
belief that when you do something wrong you need to apologize,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the idea of a task force to recognize the work of the
slaves who built the Capitol and White House has significant
bipartisan support, Hall's proposal continues to face opposition
from those who say an apology goes too far and those who say it
isn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress share the views of Reps. David Vitter
and Billy Tauzin that an apology would be hollow given that, as
Vitter put it, ``No one issuing the apology had anything to do with
slavery in that historical period.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Louisiana Republicans are quick to call slavery brutal
and a permanent stain on the United States, but say an apology
isn't the answer. ``Far more meaningful'' than an apology would be
enforcing the civil rights laws and working to ``purge bigotry and
prejudice in our society,'' said Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall said Congress, which sits in a Capitol constructed by
slaves, has an obligation to express remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's an easy thing to do, but you know, we all
have trouble with it,'' Hall said. ``When we wrong each other,
whether it's our wives or our best friends or somebody, when you
hurt somebody, it's not an easy thing to say `I'm sorry.' But if
you don't say `I'm sorry,' if it's a deep wound, what happens is
that this hurt lingers and it never goes away unless you settle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is white and a born-again Christian, first proposed an
apology in 1997. It got scant support. This time, however, he has
the backing of most of the congressional Black Caucus. Caucus
members say they were drawn to the bill by Hall's expansion of the
measure to include an examination of possible areas of redress,
including some form of reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he has heard from colleagues who do not think an
apology would be enough, but he added that he has always looked at
it as a ``first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that there ought to be some kind of
restoration, some kind of restitution, whether it be scholarships,
alleviation of poverty, a slave museum, acceleration of civil
rights cases,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was surprised three years ago when researching the
matter that he could find no evidence that the United States ever
officially apologized for slavery. The closest it came was when
President Clinton, during his visit to Africa in 1998, said that,
``Going back to the time before we were even a nation,
European-Americans received the fruits of the slave trade, and we
were wrong in that.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Miller, information officer for the New Orleans chapter
of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America,
said she supports a bill introduced in every session since 1989 by
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. It acknowledges ``the fundamental
injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity'' of slavery between
1619 and 1865, and calls for creation of a commission to examine
the long-term impact on African-Americans and recommend possible
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that bill is succinctly written to develop a means
to provide reparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology means nothing unless you do something to prove you
are sorry,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said he cannot predict whether the Hall measure, or the
Conyers proposal, will ever be able to muster a majority vote. But
he said that at the very least, he hopes Congress will move quickly
to set up a task force to develop a permanent recognition for the
slaves who built the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, few have known of the extraordinary
contributions made by African-Americans in the building of our U.S.
Capitol,'' Watts said. ``It's time the role African-American slaves
played be fully realized, and they be given the honorable
recognition they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate by Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., and Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., making it the
Abraham-Lincoln bill. President Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in
1865.

 &HT;    WorldCom, Sprint end deal but new matches seen
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint on Thursday formally ended the deal that
would have led to a massive merger, bowing to objections of
regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But the move, accompanied by some bitter asides directed at the
U.S. government, hardly signals the death of big-ticket mergers.
Instead, it eliminates one matchup and slightly reshapes the rules.
It also makes it more likely that two Georgia-based companies _
BellSouth and Powertel _ will get into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sprint and WorldCom are through. In fact, the
announcement frees both to negotiate with other companies, while
mulling the lessons of a long, costly and ultimately doomed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive William Esrey said Sprint isn't for
sale, yet his comments were similar to those made before he agreed
to the WorldCom purchase. ``We're focused on building shareholder
value as we always have.'' As to Sprint buying other companies?
``Yes, if the deal would build size or scope.''
</P>
<P>
   A slew of telecom companies are rumored as hunter _ and nearly
all could be prey.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that could be on either side is BellSouth, which in
October launched a vain $100 billion bid for Sprint, but has also
been mentioned as a target for foreign firms seeking a U.S.
foothold. Since the fall, the $25 billion-a-year Atlanta-based
company has made some dramatic changes, but none that flat-out
overule renewed courtship with Sprint if BellSouth's management and
directors believe merging with Sprint is the best bet for survival.
And it would help if Sprint is willing.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth is expected first to wait for a decision from the
current Goliath in the rumor market, Deutsche Telekom. The company
has vowed to become a global player and has been reportedly
negotiating with a host of takeover targets, from Cable &AMP; Wireless
to Qwest Communications. While WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard
Ebbers suggested that the Germans should be talking to him, their
initial interest seemed to be in Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But after a fluttering of congressional concern about letting
Sprint be bought by a European carrier that is still more than
half-owned by its government, Deutsche Telekom has apparently
shifted its attentions to deals. The company has reportedly bid
more than $40 billion for wireless provider VoiceStream, while
considering a parallel bid for Qwest, which would provide a local
service presenceas well as Qwest's high-speed Internet lines. Those
acquisitions would presumably draw less regulatory fire than buying
Sprint. But for BellSouth to rekindle its romance with Sprint, it
would have to rewrite its deal to combine wireless units with SBC
Communications, presumably by selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Would that make sense? Together with SBC, BellSouth will have
the nation's second-largest wireless business, but not the national
reach or brand name of Sprint. Compared to a massive purchase of
Sprint, the SBC agreement will cost little to get started but would
need increasing investment to build a network or buy more licenses.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth too has pondered a purchase of Qwest, in which it
already has invested $3.5 billion, giving it less than 5 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against a play for either Qwest or Sprint is the
continuing ban on a BellSouth offering long-distance in its
nine-state region. Detours around that hurdle can be found, but
they do make an already costly deal a bit more complex.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's purchase of Sprint was valued between $115 billion
and $156 billion, depending on the fluctuating stock prices of the
companies. For months, the huge merger seemed bound for approval
while regulators gave the nod to a string of big-ticket mergers.
True, the Federal Communications Commission of late had started to
impose conditions _ as on AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne _ but the
government showed no signs of calling a halt to the march of
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But last month the Justice Department sued to block
WorldCom-Sprint. Coming after the department had won at least the
first round of its legal case against Microsoft, the rejection
signaled a readiness to do antitrust battle that any potential
partners must at least take into account.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ebbers slammed Attorney General Janet Reno and FCC
Chairman William Kennard as blocking innovation and hurting
competition for local service _ which WorldCom and Sprint had hoped
to offer using wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the heart of WorldCom's longing for Sprint was wireless.
That market is surging and, with the much hyped new technologies,
could explode as phones become common connections to the Internet
and tools of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom too would like to arrive by both air and land.
Its interest in VoiceStream is at least partly spurred by that
company's use of a technology known as GSM, which is also used
throughout Europe. Travelers on a Deutsche-VoiceStream network
could carry one phone and receive calls on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   And that could be why West Point-based Powertel has jumped this
week. Because, with coverage in parts of 11 states, Powertel with
VoiceStream would form a national GSM network. Powertel stock shot
from $74.75 to $89.43 in two days, before drifting down to $84.81 a
share Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The end of WorldCom-Sprint didn't slow industry jockeying for
position.
</P>
<P>
   Because local service is seen as growing too slowly,
Bermuda-based Global Crossing this week announced plans to sell the
local service business that came with its purchase of Frontier
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   And the interconnections grow even without full-fledged mergers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dutch-based KPN Telecom _ another company in which
BellSouth has an investment _ announced plans to bid for wireless
licenses in Europe with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa and NTT
DoCoMo of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And either Hutchison or NTT are cash-rich and ambitious enough
to be bidders for U.S. assets as well.

US-VIETNAM TRADE DEAL HAILED   BY OFFICIALS, IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for the United States and Vietnam Thursday agreed to
normalize trade relations, marking the end of an era of bitter
animosity and deep distrust between the two countries dating back
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pact still must be approved by Congress _ not necessarily a
sure thing given the recent political slugfest over a similar trade
agreement with China. But the movement toward agreement was hailed
widely, both by political leaders and Vietnamese Americans, as a
boon for both nations.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits to Vietnam are largely economic, opening its small and
feeble economy to the world's largest market, said Thomas J.
Vallely, director of the Vietnam program at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government. The benefits to the United States, he
said, are largely diplomatic, stabilizing and strengthening a major
country in Southeast Asia at a time of instability in Indonesia,
long a principal US ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Boston's large and thriving Vietnamese community saw
the issues on a much more personal plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing for Vietnam because it will help the
people understand how bad the communists are,'' said An Le Dang, a
veteran of the South Vietnamese armed forces that were defeated and
disbanded when North Vietnam's communist rulers unified the country
25 years ago. ``For so long the communists closed our eyes to the
world. This will let people open their eyes and see. It will bring
more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeply Americanized Vietnamese, born long after the end of the
shooting war that cost the lives of millions of Vietnamese and
58,000 Americans, had very different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help people over there, but it will also help the
attitude of people here,'' said Vuong Nguyen, a 17-year-old senior
at Boston College High School, as he and his friends emerged with
their lunches from the Fields Corner McDonald's. ``I still feel the
tension, the prejudice here. . . . That all comes from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader, more normal contacts between the countries, he said,
``will help break the discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Vietnam have been at odds since the early
1960s, when the US gradually took over what had been French support
of the Western-allied South Vietnamese regime against the
communist-bloc-allied North. Despite massive American military and
economic aid, the south never was able to defend itself. It
collapsed in 1975, two years after US troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades, the United States banned trade,
investment, and most travel between the countries; the embargo was
lifted in 1994 and diplomatic relations were restored in 1995. By
the time that occurred, other nations _ in particular Japan,
Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea _ were far ahead of the
United States in trade and investment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, that is not very significant to the United States.
As Vallely pointed out, Vietnam exports $12 billion a year to the
entire world; the United States imports 100 times that sum.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said US Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), one of a
group of Vietnam War veterans in Congress who have spearheaded the
drive for normalization of relations, ``this is a place where the
United States has tremendous opportunities over the long haul.'' He
stressed that, with 77 million people, Vietnam is one of the more
populous countries in the world, with young, relatively
well-educated citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the tariff reductions that make up a major part of
the agreement take effect, products made by that work force will
become competitive on the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nike sporting goods company is already in effect the largest
private employer in Vietnam, with about 50,000 workers, but it
employs them through South Korean and Taiwanese subcontractors, and
the shoes they produce are sold on the European market. The work
force could quickly double as a result of tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That does not add up to an unmitigated good to all Vietnamese
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic relations is good, but not trade right now,'' said
Ton Huu, 73, the style of her white hair and blue suit more likely
to be seen in her former hometown of Saigon than in Boston. ``First
(the Vietnamese government) has to be more fair to citizens. They
should have the right to do business and not have the government
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, John Truong, a pharmacist who graduated from
Northeastern University, translated for Ton and added his own
skepticism. ``With this you empower the government, the high
officials. There's just a little benefit, some job creation, to
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is an election year and the China trade agreement
battle is already on the legislative calendar, Congressional
approval for the Vietnam pact may not be immediately forthcoming,
but several observers believe it will come more easily than
President Clinton's proposal for permanent normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the small size of Vietnam's economy means
that it does not pose an economic threat. Another is that there are
no complicating issues such as the American dispute with China over
missile proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Vietnam War veterans dominate discussion of the
issue also means Vietnam has much better congressional relations
than China. And, given the Sino-US tensions, many on Capitol Hill
appreciate the value of improving relations with a country that
borders China.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is now a large Vietnamese-American population
whose members want to be able to visit relatives without the fears
they now harbor. Unlike the Cuban American population, they favor
improving relations even though many loathe communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wish for better relations,'' said Kim Hall, 54, a
Vietnamese outreach worker at the Kit Clark Senior Center in
Boston's Dorchester section. ``We are still scared (when visiting)
because they don't have human rights. Trade will help a lot of
Vietnamese people feel more secure.''

CHASING NABOKOV'S ENDANGERED TRUE LOVE, THE KARNER BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo, Wyo., N.Y.)  (EDS: A 155-word box appears at end of story with recommended books
and information about a butterfly walk Saturday.)  
(Margaret Mittelbach and Michael Crewdson are the authors of ``Wild
New York: A Guide to the Wildlife, Wild Places and Natural
Phenomena of New York City.'') By MARGARET MITTELBACH and MICHAEL
CREWDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The author of ``Lolita,'' ``Pale Fire,'' ``Pnin'' and '`Speak,
Memory,'' Vladimir Nabokov is considered one of the greatest
novelists of the 20th century. What is less well known is that he
was also a lepidopterist who named dozens of new species and
subspecies of butterflies. One of these, the Karner blue, is a
resident of New York state and a federally endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   While Nabakov was writing in the 1940s, he also studied the
anatomy of butterflies at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at
Harvard. Among the butterflies he examined were some old specimens
collected in the 19th century from Karner, N.Y., a bygone village
in an area known as the Albany Pine Bush. Although he identified
the Karner blue as a distinct subspecies (Lycaeides melissa
samuelis) in 1943, it wasn't until the late spring of 1950 that
Nabokov _ whose prose abounds in butterfly imagery _ took up his
net and went looking for Karner blues in the wild. Before leaving
he wrote to a friend, the literary critic Edmund Wilson, that he
planned to drive to ``a place called Karner, where in some pine
barrens, on lupines, a little blue butterfly I have described and
named ought to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1950, while driving from Boston to Ithaca, N.Y., he
visited the Pine Bush for the first time. Fifty years later _ to
the day _ we followed in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   When Nabokov visited the Pine Bush in 1950, he didn't have much
trouble finding Karner blues. The day after his visit, he wrote
Wilson again saying that he had driven ``to a certain place between
Albany and Schenectady where, on a pine-scrub waste, near
absolutely marvelous patches of lupines in bloom, I took a few
specimens of my samuelis.'' At that time, his samuelis was the most
abundant insect in the Pine Bush. A single swipe of the butterfly
net was said to have been enough to capture a dozen. These days
Karner blues are so scarce that netting one is a federal offense
for which one can be fined up to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nabokov first identified the Karner blue as a unique
creature, the butterfly's Pine Bush habitat has been reduced to
one-tenth its original size. In 1975, when the Karner blue became
the first insect on the New York state endangered-species list, it
also became the poster bug for the Pine Bush. Advocacy groups
fought development with protests and legal maneuvers, and as a
result, more than 2,500 acres of the Pine Bush have been turned
into a preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Karner blue has not fared well. Since the 1970s, the
estimate of the butterfly's local population has plummeted to less
than 5,000 from 50,000. Biologists say not enough pristine habitat
is left for the Karner blues to thrive. Across the butterfly's
entire range, a thin geographic band that originally stretched from
Minnesota to Massachusetts, Karner blue numbers are down 99
percent, which led to the Karner blue being placed on the U.S.
endangered-species list in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To help track down some of these rare beings, we enlisted Don
Rittner, a longtime advocate for the Karner blue and the founder of
the Pine Bush Historic Preservation Project, which was organized in
1972 to protect the region's flora and fauna. When we made our
rendezvous with Rittner _ in a diner parking lot off Route 155,
just 15 minutes from downtown Albany _ he was wearing a straw hat
to protect against the strong sun, and he seemed highly optimistic
about our chances of seeing Karner blues. ``Let's go look for the
insect that stopped millions of dollars of development,'' he said
cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   We drove for just five minutes down Route 155 before Rittner
pulled his Subaru Outback off the highway and into an inconspicuous
dirt turnout _ not the first place you would think to look for an
endangered species. From the road, the home of the Karner blue
doesn't look like much. The words stunted and scraggly come to
mind. But Rittner begged to differ. ``I fell in love with this
place the first time I saw it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Rittner down a narrow trail, we entered the world of
the Pine Bush. Instead of dirt beneath our feet there was sand, and
struggling to grow up from this barren substratum was the Pine
Bush's version of a forest. Miniature scrub oaks grew no higher
than 8 feet. Pitch pines with blackened trunks sprouted long
needles that looked like cactus spines.
</P>
<P>
   Sand slipped beneath our feet as we scanned the landscape for
hints of fluttering blue. As Rittner led us up a steep grade, he
explained that all this sand was deposited at the end of the Ice
Age. During a subsequent Sahara-like dry spell about 9,000 years
ago, the sand was blown around and shaped by the wind, meaning that
the long, low hill we were climbing was a dune.
</P>
<P>
   From the top we could still hear the cars on the highway. But we
were surrounded by a panoramic view of Pine Bush as far as we could
see. And from there it was easier to appreciate this weird
ecosystem's subtle charm _ varying shades of green layered upon
green over waving dunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the most pristine part of the Pine Bush, and we're
still standing in the city of Albany,'' Rittner said. ``I don't
know any other city in the country that has its original wilderness
still in its borders.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Pine Bush is a biological island surrounded by
urban sprawl. Once covering 40 square miles between Albany and
Schenectady, it has been steadily built over as these cities have
spread out. ``The Pine Bush is like butter to developers,'' Rittner
said. ``It's so easy to build on. They just come in and push the
sand around.'' Despite being the home of 300 vertebrate species,
1,500 plants and thousands of invertebrates, the Pine Bush is not
an obviously lovable habitat. According to Rittner, it's been
called every name in the book: bleak, blasted, desolate and a
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   It's also hot as Hades.
</P>
<P>
   As we continued our search for blue butterflies, there was
little shade, and we began to overheat. Sahara-like still seemed an
apt description. Rittner told us he once stuck a thermometer in the
sand in midsummer. It registered 140 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies apparently like the heat, though. From the moment we
left the highway and entered the Pine Bush, we were besieged with
them: American coppers, tiger swallowtails, spring azures, monarchs
and skippers. Even before Nabokov named the Karner blue,
entomologists were flitting around the Pine Bush with butterfly
nets and collecting jars. So many species were discovered in the
19th century near the vanished village of Karner that scientists
nicknamed the area Butterfly Station. ``There are 70 species of
butterflies out here, which is more than in all of Great Britain,''
Rittner said.
</P>
<P>
   But no Karner blues. ``This is really not too good,'' said our
butterfly guide after half an hour of canvassing the sweltering
bush.
</P>
<P>
   We remained hopeful, because we had carefully planned our
butterfly safari. Each year, Karner blues emerge from their
chrysalides and take to the air during two short ``flights''
(roughly May 20 to June 10 and July 15 to Aug. 5). Many a
naturalist has missed them because of poor planning. Nabokov,
however, had visited during the height of the first flight, and we
were following his lead.
</P>
<P>
   The missing ingredient in our search through the Pine Bush was
lupine, the lavender wildflower around which the entire life cycle
of the Karner blue revolves. Karner blue butterflies will lay their
eggs only on lupine stalks, and their caterpillars eat only lupine
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, when Nabokov first saw the Pine Bush, it was
blanketed in lupine. Periodic wildfires set by lightning cleared
away tall vegetation, making way for lupine plants, which require
direct sunlight. Since then, a combination of development and fire
suppression squeezed out this flower. ``No fire, no lupine, no
Karner blue,'' Rittner said. ``It's that simple.'' We were about to
give up and were almost back to where we started when we found a
small patch of lupine behind a parking lot along the highway. About
200 flowers, lavender spikes, created a small blue sea.
</P>
<P>
   We scanned this oasis, looking for signs of life. Then, right
next to the asphalt, we saw a speck, a bluish blur zigzagging above
the flowers. ``Yes!'' Rittner shouted. ``It's a KB!'' He then
addressed the butterfly directly. ``I see you,'' he said. ``We have
some visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To his delight, the KB was not shy at all. It flew over,
alighted on a spike of lupine at our feet and obligingly opened its
wings for inspection. ``Now, it's posing,'' said Rittner. ``I have
so many photographs of this very shot.''
</P>
<P>
   We bent down for a better look. The butterfly's wingspan was
only about an inch. The wings were slate blue and distinctly framed
by a border of white. Tiny orange dots decorated the edge of its
lower wings. ``Those dots mean she's a female,'' Rittner said. She
flitted over to a neighboring flower and began walking down its
stalk, now and then adjusting her wings for balance.
</P>
<P>
   She inspected other flowers and teetered down two more stalks.
Then, at the base of one plant, she began curling her body into a
U. ``I think she's trying to lay an egg,'' Rittner said excitedly.
He crouched all the way down to lupine level to get a close-up
view. When the KB fluttered off, there was a tiny white spot,
smaller than a poppy seed, where she had been. ``Look at that!'' he
said. ``I've been coming here for 30 years, and I've never seen
that before. In fact, I don't think anyone's ever seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's little samuelis had laid an egg.
</P>
<P>
   When Nabokov wrote his 1957 novel ``Pnin,'' he couldn't resist
working in a detailed description of the butterfly he had named.
Here's what he wrote: ``A score of small butterflies, all of one
kind, were settled on a damp patch of sand, their wings erect and
closed, showing their pale undersides with dark dots and tiny
orange-rimmed peacock spots along the hindwing margins; one of
Pnin's shed rubbers disturbed some of them and, revealing the
celestial hue of their upper surface, they fluttered around like
blue snowflakes before settling again.''
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing the egg laying, we crossed the highway to
another section of the Pine Bush, this one not as pristine but
overgrown with invasive shade trees. As we walked along the sandy
paths, Rittner told us that in the 1970s he and his friends had
written Nabokov a letter, hoping to get his support for preserving
the Pine Bush from development. Although Nabokov did not join the
fight to save the butterfly, he wrote back that he remembered the
Pine Bush as a ``sandy and flowery little paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Nabokov's original ambition in life was not to write
great literature but to make a scientific contribution and discover
new species. In his autobiography, ``Speak, Memory,'' Nabokov
devotes an entire chapter to his passion for butterflies, and he
writes, ``In Jackson Hole and in the Grand Canyon, on the mountain
slopes above Telluride, Colo., and on a celebrated pine barren near
Albany, N.Y., dwell and will dwell in generations more numerous
than editions, the butterflies I have described as new.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have known that the Karner blue would soon be
flirting with extinction. Although we searched for several hours
longer, we found only four more KBs, suggesting that, in the end,
Nabokov's words might be more enduring than his butterfly.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEATHERHEAD, England _ In his hands he has a wheel; in his ears,
rings; on his arms, tattoos; and in his heart, loathing for anyone
he sees through his windshield. He is known as White Van Man, and
he is identified in motorist surveys as the scourge of the
stressed-out British road.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the driver's seat, he considers red lights relative and
his own authority absolute. His vocabulary is the kind represented
in newspapers by asterisks, and the hand signals he uses to find
his way are the kind that tell everyone else to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the popular caricature of the men who pilot
the estimated 2.5 million commercial vans every day around Britain,
a country with the most congested roads in Europe and probably
higher road rage than any country on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford-based Social Issues Research Center found that white
van men are viewed with the hostility and opprobrium Britons
previously reserved for the soccer hooligans who almost got England
disqualified from the European soccer championship last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van drivers have taken on the mantle of what sociologists
refer to as `folk devils,' '' said Peter Marsh, the center's
director. ``Like other species of animal, he feels most confident
on his own turf, so a note of caution. When you obstruct the
passage of a white van, you are often preventing the driver
traveling freely on what he perceives to be his road.''
</P>
<P>
   White Van Man gets his name from his vehicle. Most vans in
Britain are white because that's the way they arrive from the
factory. Delivery services do not want the expense of painting
them, and their resale value is higher if they stay that color.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to White Van Man, the world he inhabits is given to
aggravation. A study of 10,000 drivers in 16 European countries by
Gallup International showed that British motorists suffered from
intense road rage and were the first to resort to obscene gestures
to relieve pent-up anger.
</P>
<P>
   The main factor behind the prevalence of aggressive driving is
congestion. At any time, there are up to 24 million cars on the
road, and there is an average of 108 vehicles per mile, twice that
of France.

   A study by Britain's Automobile Association said that British
drivers faced longer commuting times, higher costs and bigger risks
of car crime than any of their European counterparts. They are also
the least likely to have acceptable public transportation or
cycling options. Investment in public transportation and roads
relative to the size of the economy is a third lower in Britain
than typical European levels, and 9 in 10 journeys in Britain are
made by car, the highest proportion in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Road repair also seems to take inordinate amounts of time. One
set of ``temporary'' emergency traffic barriers still stands along
an infamous stretch of highway at Barking Creek in East London
where they were installed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marsh found in his study that the white van drivers
were victims of negative stereotyping, he also discovered that they
did operate under their own tribal rules.
</P>
<P>
   He uncovered, for instance, White Van Man's standards for
permitting someone to cut ahead: black taxis: never; buses: very
rarely; women drivers: depends what they look like; other white van
drivers: always.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists may think the London cabdriver the world's politest,
but to Andrew Hall, 30, a four-year white van man from Leatherhead
in the London suburbs, ``they drive like they own the world.'' Even
more irritating are bicyclists. ``You hit a bicycle, you get the
blame, right?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was relaxing in The Running Horse pub after a nine-hour day
of delivery runs that took him 200 miles around southeast England.
</P>
<P>
   He protested the criticism of his class but admitted he
understood how it got started. ``I don't go through red lights, for
instance, but if it's, well, just going into red, I might slip
through,'' he said. ``And,'' he warned, ``I never stop on amber.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he avoided road arguments himself but that he had
seen colleagues ``in a bit of a right row many times, especially at
the traffic lights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally at the lights,'' he said, ``that's where the verbals
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said he was not surprised to find that white van men think
they are good drivers because, he said, all men do. ``Previous SIRC
research has shown that for 75 percent of male drivers, to admit
that you are a bad driver is a bit like confessing that you are
lousy in bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New gasoline price increases that have taken the price of
filling up a van to $80 have become a big issue in Britain, and
what car you drive has become a defining point in British politics.
The two leading parties are fighting for the votes of the middle
Englander, an everyman character often identified in the press as
Mondeo man, after the midrange Ford model with that name. When
Conservative officials made their first moves last year to recover
the middle-class voters who deserted the party for Labor in the
1997 election, one of the first things they did was try to buy the
membership lists of the Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile
Association.
</P>
<P>
   With a national election widely considered to be less than a
year away, White Van Man may finally start getting some respect.
The ardently populist Sun, Britain's largest selling daily tabloid,
has created a question and answer column with a new driver each
week. In a typical submission, Jamie Valler, 32, of
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, said: ``In the past we've been stereotyped as
nutters on the road. But now the nation can see most of us have
sensible opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The column is promoted as ``the authentic voice of the street,
the real views of real people, the opinions of people who vote
rather than those who get elected, the views of people who pay
taxes and bills rather than just pontificate on them.''
</P>
<P>
   People claiming those credentials are going to get a lot of
attention from politicians. Shortly after the debut of the feature,
another contributor, Simon Todd, 43, of Gillingham, Kent, found
himself not only no longer maligned. He and his white van were
invited to have pictures taken with government officials in front
of 10 Downing Street.

EPISCOPAL CHURCH RECOGNIZES UNMARRIED AND SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Leaders of the Episcopal Church reached agreement
Thursday on an unusual resolution about human sexuality, in which
the church officially acknowledged that its parishioners include
unmarried couples living in long-term relationships and that those
relationships are worthy of pastoral care.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution makes no distinction between heterosexual and
homosexual relationships, but the discussion among church leaders
focused almost entirely on its use in acknowledging long-term
relationships among gay and lesbian Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, approved by the church's bishops in a lopsided
vote of 119-19, with four bishops abstaining, said that the church
``expects'' long-term relationships among unmarried couples to be
monogamous and characterized by ``mutual affection and respect.''
It condemns promiscuity and, in a clause cited by some bishops who
spoke warily of the broader resolution, notes the church's
traditional teaching on the sanctity of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the resolution was approved by clergy and lay
representatives at the denomination's General Convention, its top
policy-making body, whose meeting at the Denver Convention Center
ends Friday. The convention, which meets every three years, is
divided into two chambers, a House of Deputies, with clergy and lay
people, and a House of Bishops. For any measure to become church
law or policy, it must be approved by both houses.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the bishops approved the resolution on sexuality, a
new debate erupted among clergy and lay people concerning an older
issue, the ordination of women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   The topic specifically addressed the reluctance of two of the
church's 106 dioceses, its regional jurisdictions, to perform such
ordinations. Episcopalians began ordaining women in the 1970s, but
some dioceses did not do so for years. In the mid-1990s, impatient
with the slowness of a few hold-outs to change, the convention
approved a law that no diocese could refuse to ordain a candidate
for the priesthood on the basis of gender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dioceses of Fort Worth, Texas, and Quincy, Ill., have
not ordained women, prompting a majority of clergy and lay
representatives at the convention to pass a resolution this morning
that would set up a task force to ``assist'' the two dioceses _ as
well as the Diocese of San Joaquin in California, which only
recently began ordaining women _ in complying with the church law.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the vote totals were announced, about a dozen
members of the Fort Worth and Quincy dioceses rose from their seats
in the convention hall and joined hands for a moment of silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Rev. Charles Hough 3d, a Fort Worth priest, said
he objected to the resolution's intention, on the grounds that
opponents of women's ordination were ``being asked to deny what we
believe.'' Another Fort Worth priest, the Rev. Ryan Reed, said he
and others based their beliefs about restricting the priesthood to
only men on their understanding of Scripture and the example of
Jesus calling only men as disciples.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other priests from the Fort Worth and Quincy
dioceses noted that several churches of the Anglican Communion _
the global association of church bodies that trace their roots to
the Church of England and to which the Episcopal Church belongs _
do not ordain women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   But Katie Sherrod, a Fort Worth resident and member of the
Episcopal Women's Caucus, a group that supports women's ordination,
said that the diocese's stand was having a negative impact on some
Episcopalians there. The reluctance of the diocese to embrace woman
as priests, she said, had led some couples to be married in other
denominations and some families not to have their daughters
confirmed in the Episcopal Church. ``I do feel we need the ministry
of female priests in our diocese,'' she said.

 &HT;    Urban teacher exodus linked to housing costsBy Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The connection is clear to Velma Wilson,
principal of an East Austin school that has lost more than a tenth
of its teachers in four years to the city's high housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Austin vies for some of the same trophies as one of its tech
sisters, San Francisco _ ``Best City to Do Business'' or ``Most
Livable City.'' And it mimics nearby Silicon Valley _ down to a
skyrocketing cost of living that has made it even harder to find
teachers in an already scarce national market.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, several of the California school districts have gone
into the real estate business. They are building apartment
complexes for their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   If Austin mirrors their problem, Wilson reasons, then why not
also copy their attempt at a solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an idea worth exploring,'' she said _ along with other
strategies, like lobbying City Hall to offer tax abatements to
landlords who give discounts to teachers or directly negotiating
reduced rents with apartment complex owners.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wilson and the district's recruiters are just
brainstorming. While it is not clear how attainable some of their
plans are, it is clear that housing costs contribute to problems
recruiting and retaining teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wilson arrived at Barbara Jordan Elementary School in
1996, at least five of her 38 teachers have left, saying they could
not afford to live in the hub of Silicon Hills. Others moonlight or
live ``doubled-up'' in one-bedroom apartments.
</P>
<P>
   And as vice president of the Austin Area Alliance of Black
School Educators, an organization that recruits across the country,
Wilson discovered that the city is a tough sell to teachers just
out of college or trying to raise families. Applicants often choose
districts with a more accessible housing market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question for anybody who is moving is 'Where am I
going to live and how am I going to pay the rent?''' Wilson said.
``I'm sure that when Dell or Motorola fly people in, they get them
established. It's just part and parcel of big business. If we could
just pattern our recruiting efforts after them . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Independent School District agrees that affordable
housing is key.
</P>
<P>
   But financial hardships next year, such as the anticipated loss
of $35 million due to the state's share-the-wealth law and modest
pay raises to staff and teachers, make the prospects of a foray
into the landlord business look dim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our hands full right now just building enough
schools to accommodate the growth,'' said Andy Welch, a spokesman
for the district.
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone thinks that the smattering of districts
nationwide constructing housing _ San Jose, Santa Clara, San
Francisco and Aspen _ are following the best path to allay the
estimated shortage of about 200,000 teachers every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for anything done to attract teachers,'' said
John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers. ``But the
solution to the problem is not to build 'teacher-ages,' like
orphanages. It might attract some young people for a very short
time. But as a long-term strategy, it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to pay salaries that would allow teachers
to buy homes and raise families. That's especially important in
Texas _ with its demand of about 41,000 teachers and its average
wages ranked 37th in the country, according to a 1999 American
Federation of Teachers report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin was the place to teach in the 1980s,'' said Louis
Malfaro, co-president of the union. ``Austin schools had the luxury
of hiring people who had some experience. Now the opposite is
occurring. We've started to lose teachers to the other districts.''
Other districts are ``actively recruiting Austin teachers, and I
think Austin teachers are actively wanting to leave,'' said David
Buffington, a former Dobie Middle School instructor. Of 35 people
at an orientation for new Round Rock teachers this spring,
including Buffington, he estimated that about 80 percent were from
AISD.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contribute to the exodus to other districts.
</P>
<P>
   For some, once they have moved outside the city to escape high
housing costs, traffic makes commuting unappealing. Others, like
Buffington, leave because of the frustrations of working in an
urban school.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have to move when he starts his new job. Buffington and
his wife, also a former Austin teacher, live so far along the
northern periphery of the city that they pay Round Rock taxes.
Their two incomes just about sustain their $925 a month,
two-bedroom house in the Wells Branch area.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, rising real estate costs loom larger.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Austin Board of Realtors, the median price of a
house in the Austin area is $212,052 _ outside the range of a
family with no debt earning the city's median income of $23,770.
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce Hays, a special education teacher at Charles Akins
High School, that figure is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one reason he hasn't moved to a surrounding
district yet. Since he is legally blind, he can't drive and worries
about access to public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living outside city limits is not really an option for me,''
he said. ``It's becoming a concern, as property values are rising
out of control. I'm kind of losing the dream of being able to
afford a house within city limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays already gets a 5 percent, or $30, discount on his rent at
Tanglewood Forest Apartments, one of several complexes in the city
that offer slightly reduced rates to those who work for major
employers in their vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The complex offers the discount of its own initiative, but
school districts in other cities have formally negotiated housing
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, for example, the school district has brokered 3
percent to 5 percent discounts on rent and 50 percent to 100
percent breaks on security deposits. Its employees also get lower
mortgage rates through lending companies and rebates from real
estate companies when they buy or sell a home.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Veselka, an HISD deputy superintendent for human resources,
said the decade-old program gave the district a competitive edge as
cities across the country try to woo from the same applicant pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to do something for them to help (new teachers) get
established in the city,'' he said. ``Many just graduated from
college, never had a job before and are coming to city of Houston
from more rural parts of the country. For many, it's their first
time away from home.''

SUBARU OUTBACK: NEW ALL OVER AND DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By BOB KNOLL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched network television in the last few years
has seen Crocodile Dundee (i.e., Paul Hogan) tearing through desert
and swamp in the ``world's first sport utility wagon,'' the
all-wheel-drive Subaru Outback. But those with an interest in auto
history will recall a few other wagons that also offered all-wheel
drive and could have made a case for an SUV label: The 1988-91
Dodge Colt Vista, the 1992-94 Mitsubishi Expo LRV, the 1988 Nissan
Stanza and the 1990 Nissan Axxess.
</P>
<P>
   None of those are around today, perhaps because they failed to
capitalize on the rising trend, perhaps because they were not very
good. The auto industry is replete with successes and failures, of
cars that caught fads on the rise and others that arrived during
the descent.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Subaru had the timing right with its
Outback, which arrived as a trim package for the 1995 Legacy wagon.
Since then, the Outback gained higher ground clearance and a raised
roofline to set it apart, and it spawned a whole series of models,
including a fancy Outback Limited. Last year, Legacy Outbacks _
which are nearly identical, mechanically, to other, less expensive
models _ accounted for 39 percent of all Subaru sales and 69
percent of Legacy production. Subaru's full line of wagons has been
first in wagon sales in the United States for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Legacy/Outback wagon underwent few changes from 1996 to
1999, though an Outback sedan arrived for 1999. For the current
model year, Subaru performed a major redesign for the Legacy and
the Outback (which no longer carries the Legacy name).
</P>
<P>
   The new body is smoother, rounder and about 3 inches longer,
with a slightly longer wheelbase. But those familiar with the
previous model will have no trouble recognizing the Outback wagon,
since most of its visual cues have been kept, including the
slightly raised roof and large fog lamps. The engine remains a flat
four cylinder _ known as a ``boxer,'' for the way its pistons flail
outward, rather than move up and down _ but it has been redesigned
for more low-end torque and better fuel economy. Cars with
automatic transmissions have a slightly different all-wheel-drive
system than those with stick shifts, but drivers will not notice
any difference in their smooth function.
</P>
<P>
   The front suspension is largely unchanged, but the rear
suspension is a new multilink design that reduces the intrusion
into the cargo area. The result is not only better ride and
handling, but a cargo floor that is 5.2 inches wider and
significantly more useful. There are disk brakes on all four wheels
and an antilock system.
</P>
<P>
   Safety improvements include three-point seatbelts for all five
occupants and child-safety-seat anchors for all three rear-seat
positions. The Outback (except for the Limited, which comes with
leather upholstery) offers as a $200 option a folding, integrated
child seat in the center rear position.
</P>
<P>
   The front safety belts incorporate pretensioners to better
position the occupant during a crash and force limiters that work
in conjunction with the front airbags to limit loads on the chest.
The Outback Limited has front seat side-impact air bags in the
upper portion of the front seat backs. The body structure has been
designed to dissipate energy better in front, side and rear
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   This new design seems to have paid off. The Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety has given the Legacy wagon a good rating and
calls it a ``best pick'' for its performance in an offset-front
crash test at 40 miles an hour _ a severe test of the body
structure. Few automobiles in this class have received such a high
rating.
</P>
<P>
   In front- and side-impact tests by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, a Legacy sedan received four stars for the
driver and passenger in the front crash. In side-crash tests, the
Legacy got four stars for driver safety and five, the top rating,
for rear passengers. The tested car did not have side air bags,
which might have improved the driver rating.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of extreme popularity for truck-based sport
utilities, it is worth noting that the Outback is certified as a
passenger car. Other manufacturers are classifying car-based SUV's
as trucks to take advantage of less stringent regulations on the
safety and emissions of light trucks. This means that the Outback
has complied with the full set of Federal safety and emissions
regulations, in contrast to vehicles like the Lexus RX 300, the
Honda CR-V and the BMW X5, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with previous Outbacks I have driven, and a 1996 model
that my wife owns, the 2000 model is a step up in ride quality,
interior noise, and steering and handling. The wagon feels more
``European'' in its control over challenging roads and in its
precise, nicely weighted steering. Braking is smooth and sure,
although there is a bit more free play in the pedal than I would
like. The annoying throbbing sound of the 2.5-liter engine has been
all but eliminated, and wind noise is fairly low.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful engine response has never been a Subaru virtue. It
still is not, but the new engine has more low- and midrange torque
so that at less than full throttle it feels fairly strong. One
unfortunate result: The wagon moves out almost too abruptly on
takeoff from a stop.
</P>
<P>
   In October, there will be two additional 2001-model Outbacks:
The H6-VDC and the H6-3.0 L.L. Bean Edition. These cars will have
an all-new 3-liter six-cylinder engine _ the only six Subaru has
offered in this country since the sporty SVX coupe was discontinued
in 1996. The L.L. Bean model will wear the logo of the mail-order
company inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   As one who has driven many thousand miles in Subarus, I am
always impressed by the completely seamless action of their
all-wheel drive. Many manufacturers claim that their SUV's have
all-wheel drive that reacts instantly when a wheel loses grip, but
in reality they delay, stutter and bump as they compensate for this
loss of traction.
</P>
<P>
   Those drivers who intend to take their vehicles into challenging
four-wheel drive territory will find that the lack of special
low-range gearing and relatively soft suspension do not equip the
Outback for this kind of duty. Subaru says that the Outback is
capable of recreational off-roading, and with its generous
7.3-inches of ground clearance and large tires, that claim seems
fair. But the main advantage of a seamless all-wheel drive system
comes in the smooth response on dry pavement and the increased
security in foul weather, rain or moderate snow.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Outback, consumers looking for a user-friendly
instrument panel and control layout will like what they see. Owners
of previous Legacys who have cursed the awkward cup holder will
feel much better about the new one. Window and lock switches, wiper
and light stalks are simple and easy to use. The Limited model
includes heated front seats with leather seating surfaces. The
Limited also has two power moonroofs, one over the front seat and
one forward of the rear seat. Their operation is rather strange in
that the front one doesn't slide; it only tilts. And although the
rear one slides open, it won't move unless the front one is tilted.
One wonders what the advantage of this curious arrangement may be.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers looking for the safety and security of all-wheel drive,
and who would not be happy with a cruder, truck-based sport utility
have a number of very good station wagons to choose from. Subaru
has the lowest-priced wagon in this category, the $20,000 Outback
Sport _ based on the smaller Impreza, not on the Legacy. The Sport,
however, cannot match the size and comfort of wagons in the $25,000
to $30,000 group.
</P>
<P>
   There, the regular Legacy-based Outback, the Volkswagen Passat
4Motion and the Audi A4 Avant Quattro are attractive,
good-performing wagons. Once the price jumps above $30,000, it goes
quickly to $40,000, where the Audi A6 Avant and the Volvo Cross
Country compete. Another $10,000 puts you into Mercedes territory.

UPR, ANADARKO STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR MERGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Shareholders of Union Pacific Resources
Group Inc. on Thursday voted to sell their company to Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. of Houston for about $8.2 billion in stock and
debt, finalizing a deal that will move Fort Worth's biggest energy
company to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder vote ended the independent existence of a
company that moved to Fort Worth from Enid, Okla., in 1954, when it
was known as Champlin Oil Co. Just 40 shareholders turned up for
the meeting at the Fort Worth Club, and none asked Chairman George
Lindahl any questions during the 20-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl estimated that about 300 of UPR's 802 local employees
will transfer to Houston to work for Anadarko, starting this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally showed 78 percent of UPR's stock voting in favor
of the merger. In Houston, 93 percent of the stock represented at a
special Anadarko meeting voted in favor of buying UPR.
</P>
<P>
   UPR shareholders will receive 0.45 shares of Anadarko stock for
each of the 252 million common shares. The deal will solidify
Anadarko's position as the nation's top independent oil and gas
driller.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will end up a little richer for UPR shareholders
since when .MDBO/.MDNM/it was announced in early April. At that
time, the $35 per share trading price of Anadarko stock would have
given each UPR share a value of $16.
</P>
<P>
   But Anadarko's stock has moved up with other energy stocks,
boosted by $4 natural gas and $30 per barrel crude oil. With
Anadarko closing yesterday at $47.43 a share, the exchange will be
worth about $21.58 for each UPR share.
</P>
<P>
   The price will be set with today's closing price for Anadarko
stock. Anadarko will also assume $2.8 billion of UPR debt.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will create a company with drilling assets about
evenly divided between crude oil and natural gas. Anadarko's
reserves are concentrated in the Hugoton Embayment of Kansas and
Oklahoma, plus reserves in east and west Texas, Alaska and the Gulf
of Mexico as well as some projects in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   UPR drills in the Austin Chalk Field of South Texas, as well as
on old land grants from the Union Pacific Railroad in Colorado and
Wyoming, western Canada and South America. UPR spun off from its
railroading parent, Union Pacific Corp., in 1995. Its stock has
been listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl said that 535 of UPR's employees at the Fort Worth
headquarters were offered jobs in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all have accepted and the deadlines for acceptance haven't
passed, so I would guess that about 300 of the workers probably
will relocate,'' said Lindahl. He said transfers will include
workers from all disciplines, ranging from clerks to geophysicists,
geologists and information service workers.
</P>
<P>
   All UPR headquarters employees, including those transferring,
will receive severance of two months' pay plus three weeks pay for
each year served up to two years. Terminated employees will receive
their severance in a lump sum. The tranferees will receive half of
the severance this year and the remainder in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The transfers will begin later next month and be concluded by
the first quarter of next year, Lindahl said. Anadarko will take
over UPR's lease of the top 23 floors of UPR Plaza, covering
525,000 square feet. The glass skyscraper was one of several
downtown buildings damaged in the March tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anadarko will be responsible for the last eight years of our
lease, but there are already a couple of good local prospects who
have indicated interest in the space,'' said Lindahl.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Lindahl, who became chief executive of Union
Pacific Resources a year ago this month with the abrupt resignation
of former chairman Jack Messman, will be among those relocating to
Houston. He will become vice-chairman of Anadarko, serving under
.MDBO/C.MDNM/hairman Robert Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl said that he will be responsible for Canada, Latin
America and new acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, the vice-chairman isn't given anything to do,
but I have specific line responsibilities,'' said Lindahl, who
received a three-year employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl said that 30 UPR executives were offered positions with
Anadarko, but only nine opted to join the company. Of UPR's seven
senior executive vice presidents, only Lindahl and Donald Niemiec
will sign on with Anadarko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too surprised, given that our executives had stock
options and the severance, and also that with good crude oil and
natural gas prices right now, this is a pretty good time to go out
into other areas of the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anadarko's nine-member board will be enlarged to 15 to
accommodate five of UPR's 12 directors. Lindahl said the identities
of the other UPR directors who will be added to the Anadarko board
will be determined at an Anadarko board meeting July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl said that in addition to fulfilling its lease
obligations for the headquarters building that Anadarko will honor
UPR's civic commitments, which include financial contributions to
the Bass Performance Hall, the National Cowgirl Museum, the Fort
Worth Public Library, the Summerbridge reading program and the
Tarrant Area Food Bank.

 &HT;    Nine suits sparked by Atlanta massacre
 &HT;    By Jim Dyer and Stacy Shelton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the one-year anniversary of Mark O. Barton's
shooting rampage in Atlanta 15 days away, the number of lawsuits
stemming from the massacre has climbed to nine.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, which were consolidated by Fulton County State
Court Judge Susan B. Forsling, do not represent all of the victims
of the July 29 shooting spree, which left nine people dead and 13
wounded. But more parties likely will join in, said Jan Cohen, an
attorney at Weinstock &AMP; Scavo, which represents seven of the
plaintiffs. He expects at least one more of the victims to join the
lawsuit. Another Atlanta law firm, Kilpatrick &AMP; Stockton,
represents the other two plaintiffs. The statute of limitations on
such lawsuits expires two years after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Gulshan Harjee, hopes legal action
will prevent future tragedies. She says the brokerage firm where
her husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed could have done more.
``What makes me so frustrated is we could have prevented this whole
thing,'' said Harjee, an internist at DeKalb Medical Center. ``I
hope this increases the awareness of keeping our environments
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond better security in the offices, she said, day trading
needs to be better regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things between the lines, in the fine print,
that need to be clarified,'' she said. ``Legislation needs to come
in place for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the specifics of each lawsuit differ, each
maintains that the securities firms frequented by Barton could have
prevented the multiple killings if employees had more carefully
scrutinized their traders, especially Barton, who had suffered
major losses in the high-stakes trading.
</P>
<P>
   The suits claim that the two security firms _ All-Tech
Investment and Momentum Securities _ should have known the
``potentially dangerous conditions'' contained on the premises and
should have taken ``reasonable precautions'' to protect the people
in the office complex from reasonably foreseeable criminal acts by
a third person.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Houtkin, All-Tech's chief executive officer, said he was
not surprised when the first of the lawsuits was filed last August.
``This is a tragedy, but in today's litigious society, I expected
this to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants named in the suit are Barton Protective
Services, which supplied building security; Jones Lang LaSalle
Americas, which manages and leases one of the buildings where the
shootings occurred; and the Piedmont Office Center, a complex of 11
buildings where All-Tech's offices are located. All of the other
defendants have declined to comment. The plaintiffs, who are
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, also are
suing Barton's estate.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Leaders of the Episcopal Church reached agreement
Thursday on an unusual resolution about human sexuality, in which
the church officially acknowledged that its parishioners include
unmarried couples living in long-term relationships and that those
relationships are worthy of pastoral care.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution makes no distinction between heterosexual and
homosexual relationships, but the discussion among church leaders
focused almost entirely on its use in acknowledging long-term
relationships among gay and lesbian Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, approved by the church's bishops in a lopsided
vote of 119-19, with four bishops abstaining, said that the church
``expects'' long-term relationships among unmarried couples to be
monogamous and characterized by ``mutual affection and respect.''
It condemns promiscuity and, in a clause cited by some bishops who
spoke warily of the broader resolution, notes the church's
traditional teaching on the sanctity of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the resolution was approved by clergy and lay
representatives at the denomination's General Convention, its top
policy-making body, whose meeting at the Denver Convention Center
ends Friday. The convention, which meets every three years, is
divided into two chambers, a House of Deputies, with clergy and lay
people, and a House of Bishops. For any measure to become church
law or policy, it must be approved by both houses.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the bishops approved the resolution on sexuality, a
new debate erupted among clergy and lay people concerning an older
issue, the ordination of women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   The topic specifically addressed the reluctance of two of the
church's 106 dioceses, its regional jurisdictions, to perform such
ordinations. Episcopalians began ordaining women in the 1970s, but
some dioceses did not do so for years. In the mid-1990s, impatient
with the slowness of a few hold-outs to change, the convention
approved a law that no diocese could refuse to ordain a candidate
for the priesthood on the basis of gender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dioceses of Fort Worth, Texas, and Quincy, Ill., have
not ordained women, prompting a majority of clergy and lay
representatives at the convention to pass a resolution this morning
that would set up a task force to ``assist'' the two dioceses _ as
well as the Diocese of San Joaquin in California, which only
recently began ordaining women _ in complying with the church law.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the vote totals were announced, about a dozen
members of the Fort Worth and Quincy dioceses rose from their seats
in the convention hall and joined hands for a moment of silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Rev. Charles Hough 3d, a Fort Worth priest, said
he objected to the resolution's intention, on the grounds that
opponents of women's ordination were ``being asked to deny what we
believe.'' Another Fort Worth priest, the Rev. Ryan Reed, said he
and others based their beliefs about restricting the priesthood to
only men on their understanding of Scripture and the example of
Jesus calling only men as disciples.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other priests from the Fort Worth and Quincy
dioceses noted that several churches of the Anglican Communion _
the global association of church bodies that trace their roots to
the Church of England and to which the Episcopal Church belongs _
do not ordain women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   But Katie Sherrod, a Fort Worth resident and member of the
Episcopal Women's Caucus, a group that supports women's ordination,
said that the diocese's stand was having a negative impact on some
Episcopalians there. The reluctance of the diocese to embrace woman
as priests, she said, had led some couples to be married in other
denominations and some families not to have their daughters
confirmed in the Episcopal Church. ``I do feel we need the ministry
of female priests in our diocese,'' she said.

EARNING REPORTS PROMPT TECHNOLOGY BUYING SPREE, DRIVING NASDAQ
HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strong quarterly reports from several companies
touched off fresh buying in technology stocks Thursday, lifting the
Nasdaq composite index to a second consecutive solid gain as the
rest of the market mostly languished.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which climbed 75.27 points, or 1.8 percent, to
4,174.86, moved more solidly into positive territory for the year.
With a gain of 2.6 percent, it has now outperformed the broader
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is up 1.8 percent this
year. Nasdaq has surged 31.9 percent since May 23, when its
springtime plunge _ a drop of 37.3 percent from its March peak _
hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings announcements are giving people confidence'' that
Internet and other high-technology companies will sustain profit
growth, said Michael Jamison, managing director at Brandywine Asset
Management in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba, for example, jumped 27 11/16, to 131 3/16, after issuing
its quarterly report, and Applied Micro Circuits, which reported
late Wednesday, added 28 1/16, to 153 1/2. Motorola, a New York
Stock Exchange company that also posted results on Wednesday,
gained 3}, to 39\, as the second most actively traded stock of the
day, after Cisco Systems, which rose 1], to 65\.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little enthusiasm for other than technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The S &AMP; P 500 rose 2.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,495.84. The
biggest upward force was WorldCom, which rose 3 7/16, to 47 15/16,
after its merger with Sprint was officially ended. Pfizer was the
biggest drag, falling 1 7/8, to 46 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 5.30 points, or 0.05
percent, to 10,788.71, its fifth consecutive rise, but is still
down 6.16 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were battered again as Washington appeared to move
closer to adding prescriptions to Medicare coverage. Investors fear
that will bring price limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough and Merck each lost more than 4 points, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped more than 3.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also bracing for government reports Friday on
producer prices, retail sales and industrial output for June and
for the initial July reading on consumer sentiment by the
University of Michigan. Evidence that the pace of inflation has
become more than a creep or that the economy is not slowing
markedly would undermine a widely held assumption that the Federal
Reserve's yearlong raising of short-term interest is near an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion that most people have is that the Fed is
finished,'' said Robert Bloom, president of Friends, Ivory &AMP; Sime,
a money manager. But he said he disagreed, citing, among other
things, a still-taut job market in which job growth is slowing
because the pool of potential workers is drying up, not because
demand for them has slackened.

`BROTHERS AND SISTERS': A STORY THAT FLIES LIKE GOSSIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thick, wet aroma yanks at the nostrils, a scent
to warm the heart of any meat lover. At that point you have been
hearing rhapsodies about food from hungry people for so long that
you may well think you have imagined it. After all, plays don't
usually smell, except metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   But no, that seems to be real boiled beef being dished out in
the Maly Theater's robust two-part production of ``Brothers and
Sisters,'' which runs through this weekend at the John Jay College
Theater as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000. Your disbelief at
this sudden olfactory invasion is mirrored in the faces of the
actors onstage, whose expressions are those of people afraid to
wake up from a wonderful, improbable dream.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five senses feel safe from assault in ``Brothers and
Sisters,'' adapted from a trilogy known as ``The Prysalins,'' by
the Russian novelist Fyodor Abramov. The scene just described
portrays a rare celebratory feast in a postwar Soviet village, and
it has been arranged for a cow on the collective farm to have an
accident. Those gristly, gray hunks of meat may not be pretty, but
it's hard not to taste them vicariously or to be transported by
gratitude, even if you're a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of appetite looms large during the more than six
hours of this tale of hope and privation in the land of Stalin,
which has been staged by the Maly's fabled artistic director, Lev
Dodin, and was first seen in Moscow 15 years ago. Appetite is the
central word in a ribald joke told early in the play by one naked
young man to another in a sauna; it is also what keeps the play's
portrait of unending hardship from seeming arid or depressing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger of many varieties is painful and destructive here, but
the urge to satisfy it comes across as bracingly dynamic. It whets
the senses instead of numbing them, suggesting that the pleasures
of the flesh are never more appreciated than in their absence. The
image of a perfectly formed loaf of bread assumes, in this context,
a voluptuousness you would never have thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 Maly performers, most of whom have been with the
production since its inception and performed it in more than a
dozen other countries, have that second-skin connection with their
roles that is born of long association. More surprisingly, their
fervor is that of actors who have just discovered the hidden keys
to their parts.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a densely textured, overwhelmingly physical
production that has the hypnotic hold of a fat, fine historical
novel. Not that the literary merits of the text _ spoken in Russian
with projected English supertitles _ gleam on their own. Simply to
quote from the script, adapted from Abramov's novel by Dodin,
Sergei Bekhterev and Arkady Katsman, is not to do the play any
favors.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dialogue, to American ears, verges on a parody of
the dark gray Russian angst of Dostoyevsky and Chekhov. The
evening's early scenes feature characters remarking that spring
feels ``worn out,'' that even the birds sound weary. And here is a
typical lament wailed toward the drama's end: ``Why do we waste our
lives and constantly deprive ourselves of happiness?''
</P>
<P>
   You might also reasonably wonder just how much excitement can be
mined from heated discussions of party policy on the distribution
of grain, the subject of much of the play's second half.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is to ignore the purely theatrical engine that
gives the production its locomotive strength. Dodin has a sure and
powerful sense of both narrative momentum and the grand,
goose-bump-inspiring set piece. (Had the Maly company under Dodin
been responsible for Stalin's propaganda films, Soviet history
might read differently.)
</P>
<P>
   And playing characters who might seem like stick figures on the
page, the Maly actors provide compelling emotional detail. Every
face is stamped with a deeply individual response to a shared
history, and you are unlikely to mistake one of the work's 40-odd
characters for another.
</P>
<P>
   That this production has now assumed a legendary quality has
something to do with the timing of its birth. Its opening in March
1985, on the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's coming to power, made it a
talismanic work for many Russians, a preface to glasnost.
</P>
<P>
   That association has caused some critics (including a reviewer
for a Moscow paper who sat next to me the other night) to argue
that ``Brothers'' is dated now, a relic of the so-called Socialist
Realism to which the play would seem to subscribe even as it
subverts it.
</P>
<P>
   But that is to deny the work's fierce pull as a piece of
storytelling and its crafty manipulation of the appeal of being
involved with other lives that makes gossips of us all. Indeed, in
its compelling anatomies of alliances and betrayals in a tight-knit
community where everyone is closely watched, ``Brothers'' can be
savored as a sort of collective farm version of ``Peyton Place.''
You simply want to know what happens to everyone next.

 &HT;    Small minority not earger to surf the Net

   Go ahead, ask for their e-mail addresses. They'll just shrug
their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Start yakking about the oh-so-funky Website you just bookmarked,
and you'll get a blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering how fast their modems are? Don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   While a recent AJC poll showed that 70 percent of metro
Atlantans own a home computer, and 68 percent use the Internet,
some people aren't surfing the Net. They're swimming against the
tide.
</P>
<P>
   Some are technophobes who can't cope with modern gadgetry.
Others are stuck on the far side of the ``digital divide,'' people
who can't afford a computer and don't have access to one at school
or work.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another group who says their decision to stay
off-line is not technical or financial, it's strictly a personal
choice.
</P>
<P>
   They are the few. They are the proud. They are the not-coms.
</P>
<P>
   We asked several members of this shrinking subspecies to explain
why they have chosen to live outside the Net:

just want to go `blah, blah, blah.' I just have too much to do. At
night I'm working, and during the day I'm busy taking care of kids.
During the school year, I'm doing school stuff. I'm sure if I was
online I could find something that would interest me, but I like to
read books. And I'm afraid that if I started, I'd get sucked into
it. I'll admit it's weird sometimes. It seems like everybody is on
it except me. My friends are always on me, ragging me about not
having e-mail. I hang out with two other moms whose kids go to
preschool and they use the Internet to find places for our kids to
play. It's irritating sometimes, and I just roll my eyes. I guess
it's just who I am. I don't have the patience for it. I worry
sometime I'm going to wake up 15 years from know and realize all
the stuff I missed. But right now, I have other things to worry
about.

   Quote: I've thought about buying a computer and going on the
Internet. But most of the people I need to talk to, I can
communicate with them over the phone. All the information I
require, I can go to the library. I read a lot of newspapers and
magazines. For me, reading information out of a book or magazine is
better because you don't have to keep scrolling up and down to get
to the next page. Trying to read something like that is just
nonsense. I don't believe in e-mail either. If I want to say
something to somebody, I want to see them in person, or at least
hear their voice. That way I know the information gets across, and
it's not accessible to anyone else. Anybody can hack into a
computer and find out anything about you. I think the Internet
gives people too much access into our private lives. They can find
your medical records or anything they want about you. I don't have
a problem with technology; I'm an electrician. I have a beeper and
a cell phone. I know anybody can tap into those, but when I'm using
the cell phone I'm extremely careful about what I say. If I used
the Internet, it would be too much of an invasion of privacy. I may
break down and buy a computer, but I still don't think I'll ever go
on the Internet.

heard terrible stories about how people have surfed the Internet on
some of those sex sites, and it has ruined their marriages. And
I've heard those stories too. My greatest concerns, really, are the
kids. I have three kids who are 6, 9 and 12. They use the Internet
at school, but I'm afraid if they're at home they'll get on some
chat line they shouldn't be getting into. I don't feel like there's
a good safeguard against that happening. We find other things to do
as a family to occupy our time. Sure, the kids have TVs and video
games, but we also make sure they spend a lot of time outside with
other kids. I just think that's healthier for them. Just about
every night we sit down and cook together and eat at the table. The
kids bug us sometimes about getting a computer, because most of
their friends have one. I tell them we don't need to have what
everybody else has.

   Quote: I don't have the time to surf the Net. I read the paper
every night and watch sports on TV and have some recreational
things like hunting and going to ball games. If we had more swings
on front porches where people visited each other like we used to,
you'd have a lot fewer psychologists. People used to visit after
supper, and talk about their problems until it was time to go to
bed. Those were great psychiatric times. People need to interact
with each other, not a computer monitor. I'm afraid the computer
age is coming in and eliminating family and relationships. You
can't get religion off a computer. You need to go to church and
hear a good sermon. We're online with our 500 stores and every
night we know what happened in that store the day before, and
that's invaluable. But I don't think it will replace the human
touch. When I visit stores, that's a real boost to employees.
That's the only way you can shake a person's hand and look them in
the eye. You can hide behind it all on a computer. I'm not
anti-technology at all, but I just have better things to do. I'm
not typist, for one thing, and at my age I'm not going to learn to
type anytime soon.

 NEW YORK: everyone next.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The short and unsatisfactory answer to that question is
wholesale disillusionment. ``Brothers'' begins with the women of
Pekashino looking forward to the return of their men from World War
II and to an era in which, in a phrase repeated with increasing
dissonance, they will be able ``to eat their fill.'' Most of the
men never come back, however, and the postwar bureaucracy of
collective farming will keep the villagers hungry for many years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Within this framework, the drama focuses on two central
characters: Mikhail Pryaslin (Pytor Semak), who was a boy when the
war began and has stayed behind, assuming a grown man's
responsibilities, and Anfisa Petrovna Minina (Tatyana Shestakova),
who has headed the collective farm during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of these two are inescapably tied in with those of
the village. The play accordingly unfolds as a study in the
friction between public and private, between individual and
collective morality and responsibility. It is hard to think of a
director more expert, or successfully shameless, than Dodin in
manipulating these contrasts and in conveying the consuming pull of
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, the production seems like an animated version of
those famous propaganda posters of the Stalin era, as smiling women
in babushkas toss grain in synchronized movement while singing. The
implicit optimism of such scenes is given the lie by other group
tableaus in which the cast stands frozen in grim postures of sorely
tested patience.
</P>
<P>
   The set designer, Eduard Kochergin, has created a world that
looks to have been hewn in rough wood, with a suspended, mobile
central wall of logs and an immense gate that opens to swing out
over the audience. These two basic elements, splendidly enhanced by
Oleg Kozlov's lighting, define every shift of scene, conjuring both
hard realities and air-borne fantasies, both claustrophobic
confinement and tantalizing openness.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of a visceral reality in which the audience is meant
to share is insisted upon throughout. Actors are often found in the
theater's aisles, bustling through with sheafs of twigs or armloads
of hay. (The hay is as evocatively aromatic, in its own way, as the
boiled beef.) We are, in effect, the larger village beyond their
meeting places, and when the political gatherings are held, we feel
uncomfortably implicit in the ways the crowd turns on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The sexually segregated group scenes are marvelous, especially
those in which the women without men sexually bait and tease one
another, eventually falling into one wriggling mass of giddiness.
Equally rousing are the drunken party scenes, in which ecstasy is
only a hair's breadth from abysmal despair.
</P>
<P>
   The great strength of the cast, as of so many good Russian
actors, is in its ability to convey both extremes of emotion at
once. This sensibility is fine-tuned with exquisite variations in
the more intimate scenes.
</P>
<P>
   One thinks especially of two brilliant, largely wordless
sequences centered on the return of Anfisa's first husband, Grigory
(Vladimir Artyomov), from the war, when the distribution of luxury
gifts assumes tragicomic dimensions. There is also the hauntingly
erotic moment in which horseplay between the widow Varvara (the
luscious Natalya Fomenko) and the young Mikhail turns serious.
</P>
<P>
   Shestakova, who has the waif-ish gravity of Giulietta Masina,
and the open-faced Semak provide affecting maps of instinctive
integrity worn down by circumstance. I also particularly enjoyed
Sergey Vlasov as Mikhail's ambitious, self-glamorizing friend, who
becomes a tractor-driving advertisement for the Communist Youth
League. And the honey-and-butter-skinned Fomenko, who suggests a
Slavic answer to Sophia Loren, gives the work an essential
sexuality that pervades the entire production like a brisk perfume.
</P>
<P>
   You will surely long remember the extraordinary imagistic use
that is made of bread. There is the loaf that Mikhail, freshly
returned from a logging camp, solemnly unwraps before his
awe-struck family, and the golden, seemingly self-replenishing
bread that figures in the heartbreaking fantasy sequence that
concludes the first evening.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the sacks of grain, representing months of labor
by the villagers, that are raised into the air, like effigies on a
floating temple, before disappearing. It is perhaps the cruelest
moment of dashed hopes in an evening that specializes in such
disappointments, a harbinger of another long season of near
starvation. You share in the villagers' sensations here. This is
definitely not to say that you leave this production hungry.

THE RIGHT THING: LIES, DAMN LIES, AND SURVEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To read the news release announcing the results of the first
KPMG Organizational Integrity survey, you would think that the
American workplace had plunged into a deep ethical malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are observing widespread illegal and unethical
conduct in the workplace despite the presence of ethics programs,''
the release began. Five out of six respondents said their companies
had such programs; three out of four said they had observed
unethical or illegal conduct on the job in the past year. The clear
implication is that the programs are failing, right?
</P>
<P>
   Hold on. One could just as easily conclude the opposite _ that
all those ethics programs have taught employees to recognize
unethical behavior when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't quite looked at it that way,'' said Richard Girgenti,
KPMG's national director of investigative and integrity management
services. ``But yes, I would say that they may be more apt to know
that what they're seeing is unethical as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Either inference would be a stretch, really, because no data is
offered about the relationship between ethics programs and
unethical behavior in the workplace over time. About all we know
for certain from the KPMG survey and one released in June by the
Ethics Resource Center, a nonprofit educational and consulting
organization in Washington, is that ethics programs, effective or
otherwise, are nearly everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so clear can be said about the prevalence of misconduct.
In the study by the resource center, only 31 percent of employees
said they had observed misconduct over the past year. Whatever the
reason for the discrepancy _ varied definitions, survey methods and
sample characteristics could all be involved _ the gap is too large
for me to take either figure as definitive.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic would say that such surveys, whatever the results, are
just grist for a full-employment call for ethics-program
consultants: ``Your ethics policies aren't working? You need us.
Working all too well? You need us. Nobody in your industry has a
program? You need us. Everyone else has a program? You need us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But with some extrapolating and postulating, it is
still possible to glean an insight or two about the relationship
between ethics and a company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the KPMG survey, for example, 80 percent of employees who
felt that management would uphold company ethical standards also
believed that current customers would recommend the company to
others. The figure falls by half among employees who thought
management was not above giving the green light to a bit of
impropriety. Watch what happens to recruiting word of mouth: 81
percent of employees who see their management as arrow-straight
would recommend their company to potential recruits; only 21
percent with more, er, ethically flexible bosses would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, there's a link between how your employees
perceive the ethical climate in which they're working and a
company's key performance measures for profitability,'' said Laura
Hartman, an adviser for the resource center survey and a business
ethics professor at DePaul University.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, both surveys indicate that a written ethics
policy, in itself, is not enough to change behavior. Without a
commitment from management and a way for people to report ethical
lapses without fear of retribution, such policies may do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A written policy without anything else is worse than not
having a policy,'' Hartman said. ``It really says, `Here's certain
values, but we're going to allow you to break those values or
infringe upon those values.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like parents who have very strict rules, but they enforce
them based on whether they had a good day or not,'' she continued.
``For me, that's horrible. Not only does the kid never know if he's
going to be disciplined or not, but he also doesn't learn what the
real parameters are. In a company, that's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to know whether company ethics policies are
working, survey statistics may be just a distraction. ``Ultimately,
a successful program is not identified by whether misconduct is up
or down or whatever,'' said Kenneth Johnson, a senior consultant at
the Ethics Resource Center. ``It's more whether people look at it
and say, `Well, this is just the way we do things around here.'''

 &HT;    Service planned for nine killed last year in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Stacy Shelton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The worst part of the toughest year of her life has
been explaining to the children why their father was taken away so
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is a trying day,'' Dr. Gulshan Harjee said quietly
while holding her baby daughter, wrapped in a Tigger blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Shahla, 4, is losing some memories of her father. But she
remembers he called her ``Cookie,'' and doesn't want anyone else to
use the pet name. When her mother tries, she's told ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahla's father _ Harjee's husband _ was one of 9 people killed
when Mark Barton went on a shooting spree through two Atlanta
offices last July 29. At 52, Dean Delawalla was weeks away from
moving his family into his dream house.
</P>
<P>
   Harjee hasn't been able to explain the senselessness of
Delawalla's death to Shahla or the couple's son, 16-year-old
Faisal. She can't explain it to herself. ``He was taken away from
us at such a critical time in our life and there has to be a reason
for it,'' said Harjee, an internist at DeKalb Medical Center. ``I
just keep searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Her search led her six months ago to begin planning a memorial
service for those killed and wounded in the bloody rampage. Their
family and friends share a deep grief, victims of the same moment's
violence that cut short lives and forever changed others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for families to get together and see where we
are,'' Harjee said. ``I myself have had such a trying one year, and
I just don't know how other families are coping. We need to see how
we can help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also realizes the massacre jolted the entire city.
That's why she asked one of the largest churches in the region to
host the gathering. The Cathedral of the Holy Spirit can hold 8,000
people. The service is set for 3 p.m. on July 30, a day after the
one-year anniversary of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Harjee and the church leader, Bishop Earl Paulk, are planning a
non-denominational service with a reception to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone is welcome,'' the bishop said Thursday. ``We all
experienced it, didn't we? We all felt the uneasiness of going to
work in a world that is so explosive. I hope in that service we can
give some new perspective on life itself.'' The service has the
support of Mayor Bill Campbell.``This memorial service is a
poignant reminder of the healing process Atlanta is still going
through,'' he said in a statement. `` I encourage all citizens to
attend this significant and moving event so that the spirt of
`triumph over tragedy' will continue to empower us to remain strong
and committed to creating more peaceful tomorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Langford, the mayor's director of community affairs,
said memorial services serve as a reminder that violence should
never become part of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must know that that's not a part of the norm and
it's not acceptable,'' Langford said. ``It's not to glorify what
happened but to pause and. . . make sure that a tragedy of this
magnitude never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harjee thinks about the year since her attorney husband was
killed , she believes violence has become all too common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single day there is still shooting,'' she said. ``After
all this suffering our families have gone through we ask `Has
anything changed?' and nothing has changed. Things are just going
on out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   She can only hope the memorial service will make a difference.
Exactly how, she's not sure. Her goals are to connect grieving
families and raise awareness about gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, she has questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will anything change afterwards? Does coming together help?
Will prayer help? That's all I found to help me cope is to
literally get on my knees and pray. The world can be so cruel out
there. I've found that is my best support.''

FORD NEEDS A BETTER IDEA FOR GETTING CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. figures it has too much cash on its hands and
thinks its shares are undervalued. So it plans to distribute $10
billion to its owners.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. If Ford were a normal company, it would simply
declare a special dividend or buy back a lot of shares. Instead, it
is undertaking a bizarrely complicated transaction that calls for
Ford to be acquired by another company, known as the Ford Value
Corp. Shareholders will get stock in the new company plus their
choice of $20 a share in cash or additional shares. Those who take
cash will get smaller dividend checks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Why the machinations?
</P>
<P>
   They will allow the company to evade clauses in its certificate
of incorporation that would deprive the Ford family of its voting
control if family members sell too many shares. Right now, they
must own a bit over 5 percent of the company through Class B shares
to keep the right to have 40 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That certificate bars a number of tactics that might be used to
let the Fords keep their votes while reducing their economic stake
in the company. One maneuver that is specifically prohibited is
declaring a stock dividend in which all shareholders get Class A
shares _ the kind you and I can buy _ in addition to their existing
shares. Yet that is exactly what this recapitalization
accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settles, the Ford family members will have
received about 7 new shares of Class A stock and 10 new shares of
Class B in exchange for each 10 old Class B shares. (The exact
ratio will depend on the price of Ford stock in the days before the
recapitalization is completed.) They will then be able to sell
those Class A shares when they need cash, maintaining the 40
percent vote even if their economic stake in Ford falls to 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are changing the rules in the middle of the game,''
complains Ken Bertsch, the director of corporate governance at
TIAA-CREF, a large money management firm. ``The reason they can do
that is that they have so many votes to start with. They can do
this over and over again if they want to. They could go down to a
tenth of a percent if they want to. What is to stop them?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that nothing can. TIAA-CREF will announce Friday
that it will vote its 8.4 million shares against the plan at the
shareholder meeting on Aug. 2. But that is not likely to have much
of an effect, because the Ford family will be able to cast its 40
percent of the votes in favor, making it virtually impossible for
its side to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, seemed puzzled
Thursday as to why anyone would object. ``This was meant as a good
strategy for all our shareholders to put cash out there in a
tax-efficient way,'' he said in an interview. The certificate of
incorporation's bar on stock dividends is irrelevant, he said.
``This is a recapitalization. It fully meets and complies with the
letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it does. In all probability the public shareholders
understand why the Ford family will eventually need cash to pay
estate taxes and would approve letting the family sell some shares
without losing votes. But Ford is not offering them the chance to
make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late for Ford to change course. It could propose
an amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Alternatively,
William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman, could announce that the
family's shares will be voted in the same proportion as those of
public holders at the Aug. 2 meeting. Either way, Ford would do the
right thing by not evading the rules that public shareholders
relied upon.

FORSOOTH, SHAKESPEARE KNEW ALL ABOUT CORPORATE POWER PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the musical ``Kiss Me Kate'' Cole Porter offered up this
lyrical advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Brush up your Shakespeare
</P>
<P>
   ``Start quoting him now,
</P>
<P>
   ``Brush up your Shakespeare
</P>
<P>
   ``And the women you will wow.''
</P>
<P>
   John O. Whitney and Tina Packer, authors of ``Power Plays,''
agree wholeheartedly with Porter about the usefulness of a good
acquaintance with the wit and wisdom of William Shakespeare. But
they see more far-reaching benefits deriving from brushing up on
one's Shakespeare than that is suggested by the refrain of Cole
Porter's song.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``Shakespeare's Lessons in Leadership and
Management,'' ``Power Plays'' offers valuable advice to those
endeavoring to climb the corporate ladder or expand the scope and
profitability of their companies. But Whitney, a management
professor at Columbia Business School, and Packer, founder and
artistic director of Shakespeare &AMP; Co., eschew the typical model of
the how-to-succeed-in-business manual.
</P>
<P>
   By blending examples of how contemporary business leaders have
succeeded or failed with examples from Shakespeare's plays of
characters who soared or plummeted, Whitney and Packer succeed
magnificently in provide a guide to effective business leadership
that is relevant to today's rapidly changing economic realities and
highly readable and entertaining in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parallels they draw are the mistakes made by Henry IV
in the play of the same name and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner in
dealing with the problem of yielding power.
</P>
<P>
   After Disney President Frank Wells died in a helicopter
accident, Eisner brought in his old friend Hollywood power broker
Michael Ovitz as the potential successor. But Ovitz quickly
realized that he had no power in the company because Eisner, like
Henry IV, could not bring himself to share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within eighteen months, Ovitz was back on the street, albeit
with a severance package that cost Disney some $90 million,'' write
Whitney and Packer.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation of Iago, the villain in ``Othello,'' has invited
an abundance of varying scholarly interpretation. Whitney and
Packer pinpoint the reason for Iago's malice toward his boss, the
moor, the brave general and war hero. The guy had been passed over
for promotion. He had expected to become Othello's
second-in-command. But the general picked Michael Cassio because he
was a ``great arithmetician.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson there is that an executive who has been passed over
for promotion can be a danger to the organization. If that person
cannot be consoled with promises of consideration for the next
promotion, he or she has to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more important for the modern CEO, say Whitney and
Packer, than the ability to communicate well. Communication, they
note, must go beyond the standard office memorandum, which tells
the employees and stockholders what it is going to tell them, tells
them and then tells them that it has told them.
</P>
<P>
   In exhorting CEOs to be creative in their communications,
Whitney and Packer cite the examples of Henry V's exhortation of
his exhausted and badly outnumbered troops at the Battle of
Agincourt and Mark Anthony's oration to the Roman mob in ``Julius
Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   They point out that instead of harping on the weariness of his
troops and the odds against them, Henry V appealed to their vanity.
The theme of his speech was honor, and his message was that they
would be remembered forever for the valor they displayed on that
day of the feast of St. Crispin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the authors point out how craftily Mark Antony sized
up the mood of his audience and manipulated the crowd so that its
feelings of hostility toward him were changed to sympathy for
murdered Caesar and anger at his assassins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best parallel of the many drawn from scores of
Shakespeare's plays centers upon Hamlet and his inability to decide
upon a strategy of action and carry it out. Hamlet's
indecisiveness, the authors point out, is a problem that afflicts
many corporate leaders confronting such phenomena as ``e-commerce,
wild currency swings, and market values calculated as a multiple of
next year's revenues instead of last year's earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney and Packer pinpoint Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com as a
sterling corporate leader who has transcended the Hamlet syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not Amazon.com will eventually lose (under his
direction) is not the main issue,'' they write. ``He has built a
stupendous business, not by waiting to see what was going to
happen, but by making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Power Plays'' should be on the reading list of every corporate
leader, every person who aspires to be one and everyone who wants
to find his or her niche within a corporate pyramid and be an
effective member of the team. Not only are the business insights
valuable; it can also uplift the culture quotient of business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal of the book should extend beyond the business
community. It is an enjoyable read that in addition to providing
valuable business leadership insights also offers a good refresher
course to anyone who wants to brush up on his or her Shakespeare.
</P>

COMMENTARY: TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABATIYEH, Lebanon _ After the Israeli army withdrew from South
Lebanon on May 23, the big question was whether the Shiite
guerrillas who drove the Israelis out would march on to Jerusalem
or would stop at the border, turn inward and focus on their own
development.
</P>
<P>
   A tour through the hardscrabble hills of South Lebanon leaves
little doubt which way the Shiites are going. The overwhelming mood
here is: ``The war with Israel is over as far Lebanon is concerned.
Palestinians, you're on your own. Write often.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is everywhere. I started my tour at the Jaber
Social Center in Nabatiyeh, the biggest Shiite town in South
Lebanon. As soon as the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon was
over, the Jaber center itself was occupied _ by South Lebanese
youth signing up for its courses in English and Windows computing.
When the Jaber center first started offering the courses, it
received 1,500 applicants for 60 places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and English _ they're the keys to success now,''
explained Riyad Jaber, who runs the English program. ``If you don't
know computers and English that means you're nothing in this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   I briefly visited Ranya Murtada's Windows course, attended by 30
young Shiite women, all in veils. Nabatiyeh is a long way from
Silicon Valley, but these young women have gotten the message.
``They don't know anything about computers,'' explains Murtada,
``but they've heard about them, and they want to discover what
they're about. We now have a lot of people coming here from the
[former Israeli) occupied zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Once these women graduate they might become customers of Ali
Darwish, who owns Boudinet, one of five Internet cafes in
Nabatiyeh. While I connected to AOL from his shop, Darwish
explained: ``Before the Israeli withdrawal most people were keeping
their money in the bank ... Now that the Israelis are gone the mood
is `It's our land, that's it, leave us alone.' Investment is coming
back ... I'm thinking of expanding into selling computers.''
</P>
<P>
   From Nabatiyeh we drove to Beaufort Castle. I had a discussion
along the way with a Lebanese friend about Israeli policy, and to
reinforce a point he produced a computer printout of an analysis
from Israel's Haaretz newspaper. I have been stunned at how many of
Lebanon's elite are now reading Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post
online to track Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   At Beaufort Castle, we found South Lebanese tourists flocking to
see the former Israeli fortress. There we met a turbaned man and
his son, who was filming with his movie camera. The son said he was
a computer programmer living in Los Angeles. His dad is a prominent
Shiite sheik in Nabatiyeh. ``But my dad has a green card,'' the
young man added. ``We don't like American policy, but everyone here
wants to live in America.''
</P>
<P>
   From Beaufort we drove to the Israeli border, where Lebanese now
come to throw stones at the Israeli guards. Thursday an imaginative
Lebanese youth brought a mirror and spent his time reflecting the
sun into the eyes of the Israeli Army lookout at Fatima Gate.
That's a long way from lobbing Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkable how much of the barbed wire and wrecked cars
have already been removed from the region, but that's thanks to the
men of Hounine village, who removed the Israeli barbed wire on
their own to sell as scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   What's the message here? The message is that underneath the old,
encrusted olive-tree politics of this region is another politics
bursting to get out, to get connected and to tie into the world of
opportunities. The deep religious and political divide between
South Lebanese and Israelis doesn't go away because people get
online. Hezbollah hasn't renounced terrorism against Israel. But
the end of the Israeli occupation here has allowed these hatreds to
be balanced by other interests and aspirations for growth that are
just as real, human and important to people.
</P>
<P>
   If Israelis and Palestinians at Camp David ever agree on stable
borders, it will unlock the same energies. Then maybe West Bank
Palestinians can be like the Lebanese operators down here, who were
offering bus tours of the liberated border area, the Israeli prison
at Khiam and Beaufort for $30 _ lunch included.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah-logo baseball hat was $5 extra.

AGENCIES FACE THE MUSIC AND SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All singing! All dancing! All selling!
</P>
<P>
   Television commercials that feature elaborate musical production
numbers, long out of favor on Madison Avenue, are making a
comeback. Big advertisers like Amazon.com, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Gap, PepsiCo, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Visa are offering viewers
minimusicals with maxi-casts for products as disparate as books,
shampoo, apparel, soft drinks, cleaners and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials that resemble scenes from MGM musicals were popular
in the early days of television, when stars like Dinah Shore would
perform the sponsors' spiels alongside the dancers and singers from
their variety shows. The trend reached a peak three decades ago
with spectacular spots for Contac cold capsules and Heinz Great
American Soups, which emulated the extravagant productions Busby
Berkeley created for Warner Brothers musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The trend tripped over its feet as the 1970s brought recession,
inflation and a return to the no-nonsense, hard-sell school of
advertising, which frowned upon pitches meant primarily to
entertain consumers. The music of Broadway and Hollywood was
replaced with rock songs intended to catch the ears of baby boomers
as the dancers were sent back to the chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as agencies return to entertainment as a tactic to appeal
to consumers _ who must typically be cajoled into watching yet
another commercial _ peddling through production numbers is
enjoying a revival not unlike the second lives for the Volkswagen
Beetle, ``Mission: Impossible'' and TV game shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say musical commercials were out of favor is putting it
mildly,'' said Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative
officer at BBDO New York.``It was a discredited genre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But to go where no one else is going has a coolness all its
own,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For Visa, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group, created a paean to Broadway with Bebe Neuwirth,
wearing her slinky costume from ``Chicago,'' singing and dancing to
``I've Got Rhythm.'' She is joined by performers clad for ``Cats,''
``The Music Man,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Saturday
Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mountain Dew soft drink sold by the Pepsi-Cola division
of PepsiCo, BBDO New York produced a 60-second spot that updates
Berkeley's over-the-top antics: The chorus boys and girls are
recast with skateboarders and mountain-bike riders showing off
extreme stunts, who are seen from above in vintage overhead camera
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commercial is a page right out of that genre, and it's
definitely by design,'' said Tim Fuhriman, assistant brand manager
for the new Swiffer brand of household cleaner marketed by Procter
&AMP; Gamble, based in Cincinnati. His reference was to a spot in which
actors dressed as soldiers sing and dance in a 1940s style
production number; they form patterns with Swiffer mops that,
glimpsed from above, resemble stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had great response from consumers and the trade,''
Fuhriman said. ``People are calling our `800' number to ask for
copies of the lyrics so they can sing along.'' The commercial was
created by the New York office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles,
part of the B Com3 Group.
</P>
<P>
   One reason extravaganzas are welcome again is that ``they work
very fast to capture the audience,'' which is crucial when ``you
only have a few seconds'' before they change channels, said Alan
Johnson, who supervised the choreography for the commercials based
on the musical ``West Side Story'' that promoted the khakis and
jeans sold by Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an older generation that loves `West Side Story,'''
said Johnson, who was a member of the Broadway cast in 1960,
dancing to the choreography of Jerome Robbins that was recreated in
the spots. ``And there's a generation that has never experienced
the show live, so it's new to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sann, echoing Johnson's assessment of the reaction among younger
consumers, said: ``The kids are really responding. They're hearing
music they just don't know and are responding on a gut level.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs associated with staging elaborate musical spots with
large casts, which daunted advertisers a generation ago, are
becoming more manageable, Sann said, because of computer-generated
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a green screen and post-production,'' he added, ``it's
much easier to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is even traveling beyond TV. Web Attack, a conference
sponsored last month in New York by Iconocast Inc., featured a
musical, ``King.com,'' which borrowed heavily from Berkeley and
``King Kong'' to bring to life the effect of the Internet on
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective was to show that Internet conferences don't have
to be boring,'' said Michael Tchong, editor and chief executive at
Iconocast in San Francisco. ``About 75 percent of the people who
attended said they liked the musical elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would consider singing and dancing for
subsequent conferences, Tchong replied: ``Oh, yes, absolutely. For
2001, it's the circus.''
</P>
<P>
   So, to quote a lyric from the Heinz commercial _ created by Stan
Freberg for Ann Miller, who performed atop a giant replica of a
soup can _ ``Let's face the chicken gumbo and dance, dance,
dance!''

COMMENTARY: BLAST FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore received an endorsement Thursday from one Bill Bradley,
a former basketball player. Bradley is said to have served in the
U.S. Senate, but he seems to have spent most of this millennium in
seclusion, and much about him is unknown, including the identity of
his favorite book.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief joint appearance with Gore in Wisconsin, Bradley
revealed that he had once spent 15 months running for the
presidential nomination himself, in this very country. He then
treated the crowd to a brief recapitulation of his old stump
speech, followed by the tribute to Gore, whom he praised as a
member of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley provided a real test for Gore's reputation as a man who
can pander to anything, even an inanimate object. But the vice
president delivered the goods, describing Bradley as ``an important
part of America's future'' and, far more imaginatively, a
``friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It took four months for Bradley to work himself up to this
moment. Returning from his self-imposed exile from public life, he
seems like a ghost of campaigns past, somebody who once traded
shots with Jimmy Carter or Estes Kefauver. Now that he's back, sort
of, he'll automatically be mentioned as a potential
vice-presidential candidate. It's none too soon, since we've been
running through the pool rather quickly. People call this campaign
boring, but when you think about it, the carnage has been quite
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Bill Richardson was a favorite for the number two
slot? Back in February the secretary of energy was so omnipresent
in Gore's entourage you expected him to start handing out the box
lunches. But that was before gasoline passed $2 a gallon and our
national defense secrets turned up hidden behind an office copying
machine. Now the poor man is such political dog meat, he'll be
lucky if the Democrats let him watch the convention on television.
</P>
<P>
   And it was just a couple of months ago that Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida was a hot ticket, shepherding Gore around the state,
introducing him at rallies while the vice president stared at
Graham with rapt, Tipper-level attention. The senator had so much
influence he helped prod Gore into his save-Elian-Gonzalez moment,
an unprecedented triple-pander-with-splat that politicians will be
gasping about for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, apparently searching for a really dramatic coup to put
himself back in contention, recently opened his diaries to Time
magazine. It turns out that the senator writes down every single
thing he does, 24-7, and has an entry to prove that on the evening
in 1994 when his daughter gave birth to a son, he spent the moments
between 1:30-1:45 p.m. rewinding a video of ``Ace Ventura, Pet
Detective.'' He must have presumed that Gore would be particularly
attracted to a potential vice president who has every move recorded
in 4,000 notebooks, color-coded by season.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field is getting frayed, too. Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey crashed and burned this week, when a photo
surfaced showing her frisking a black man and grinning wildly.
Whitman had apparently been riding around with some state troopers
a few years back and jumped at an opportunity to play cop. This
raises questions not only about Whitman's racial sensitivity, but
also her IQ. Even the most dim-witted male politician in the
universe would know what to say if he was invited to pat down a
woman in the presence of a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question, at that time, of being hands-on,'' said the
governor defensively in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   When an elected official pretends to be hanging with the tough
guys you get Michael Dukakis driving that tank, or Rudy Giuliani
and Al D'Amato dressed as Hell's Angels. Bill Bradley, whose
example should definitely be followed in this matter, is so averse
to funny-costume campaigning he refused to put on shorts and
pretend to be a basketball player when he had a fund-raiser at
Madison Square Garden with his former Knicks teammates.
</P>
<P>
   That event, believe it or not, took place during the very same
presidential race we're having now. And when you think about it,
Bradley's refusal to come out in public since he lost might just be
an attempt to dodge the possible-vice-presidential-candidate curse.

MAYBE PIAZZA SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's up for debate whether Rogers Clemens of the Yankees
intentionally hit the Mets' Mike Piazza in the head last week. But
without question, he purposely mailed a fastball into the same zip
code as Piazza's noggin.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, major-leaguers called this ``pitching.''
Nobody questioned the intent of the guy who threw the ball.
Everybody knew why. The responsibility of moving his head out of
harm's way rested with the hitter. You got a problem with that?
</P>
<P>
   Watching all the gruesome replays of the Clemens-Piazza
incident, one thought came to mind. Or two, when you consider how
lucky Piazza was to have escaped with a mild concussion. But a
big-time hitter like the Mets catcher, who routinely feasts on
pitchers, Clemens included, was apparently caught by total surprise
that somebody might attempt to stick a fastball in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   And particularly when this ``somebody'' was Clemens, who carries
one of the few ``headhunter'' reputations remaining in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sandy Koufax, a true gentleman who was the best pitcher of
not only his era but maybe any era, described his craft as ``the
art of instilling fear ... making a man flinch by making him look
for the wrong pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to guess along with Piazza (and I'm 1,200 miles away from
Yankee Stadium seeing it repeatedly on TV replays), it appeared he
never suspected what might be coming. Being a bit scared in the
batter's box is not an unmanly act. The great Reggie Jackson said
of Nolan Ryan, when both were still playing against each other:
``Ryan is the only guy who puts fear in me. Not because he can get
you out, but because he can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   No hitter ever went to the plate against Ryan without being
ready for anything. Today, however, the fear factor is gone in
baseball, the main reason being that ``purpose'' pitches, or even
merely pitching a batter inside, have become a lost weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' explanation on drilling Piazza in the head was a firm,
``I was only trying to pitch him inside.'' If you could believe
that, then Clemens was doing what every pitcher in baseball should
be doing to the Piazzas of the batting orders. Move those bombers
off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, if a pitcher comes within a foot of a hitter with a
fastball, there is glaring at the mound, squawking with the
catcher, and the next thing you know, both benches have emptied.
It's believable that a Clemens' fastball to the head could freeze a
Piazza. It's extremely rare today to find a pitcher with that kind
of mean streak. Or even a pitcher who legitimately wants to work
inside. Piazza has had no practice at bailing on beanballs. What
hitter of today has?
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit at the ballpark every night watching games and
commenting about the lack of purpose pitches or intentional
pitches,'' said Reid Nichols, a former major-league outfielder and
now the Rangers' director of player development. ``Of all the games
I've seen this year, I can remember only one time saying that a
pitcher was throwing at a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nichols is an advocate of such a thing. Remember he's a
former major-league hitter, who was quick yesterday to point out
Bruce Kison, a Pirates' pitcher of the early '80s, as someone who
would repeatedly buzz you inside.
</P>
<P>
   But being in charge of the Rangers' minor-league system, Nichols
and his instructors are attempting to teach young pitchers to throw
the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the answer on why we don't see it anymore, but my
guess is it started with the shrinking of the strike zone by the
umpires,'' he said. ``The way the game is called now, if you come
inside on a hitter, it's ball one. If you miss again, it's ball
two, and now the hitter has you where he wants you. The pitcher
feels he can't waste a pitch. To me, all the offense we are
suddenly seeing in baseball goes back to the strike zone being a
postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minor leagues, charts are kept on how many times a
pitcher makes the hitter move his feet. ``The more, the better,''
Nichols said. ``It is teaching them to move hitters off the plate,
to take away the inside corner. Even the best hitter can only cover
about three-fourths of the plate. If you let the hitter have the
inside corner, he will also own the outside corner on you.''
</P>
<P>
   To pitch inside, however, means you will hit batters. It's
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach pitchers to throw at the hitter, but if that
happens accidentally, then how the hitter reacts is up to him, I
guess,'' Nichols said. ``All I know is the pitchers have to take
back the inside corner to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens appeared to go to the extreme edge of that philosophy
last week. And one great hitter of this era never knew it was
coming.

JUDGE ALLOWS BOSTON SUIT AGAINST GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston's $100 million lawsuit against the gun
manufacturers cleared a major hurdle Thursday as a state judge
refused the firearm industry's request to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision makes the city's case the only one in the nation to
survive challenges by gunmakers and legislatures. Similar lawsuits,
which contend manufacturers bear some responsibility for the toll
gun-related violence has taken on communities, have been dismissed
in Cincinnati, Bridgeport, Conn. and Miami. Many of the counts in a
suit by the city of Chicago were also dismissed. State lawmakers
have blocked suits in New Orleans, Atlanta and Detroit. More than
20 others are still pending but have not progressed beyond the
initial stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston case now moves into the discovery phase, where gun
executives can be questioned under oath and sensitive internal
documents subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a very broad inquiry. Because Boston is now out
front, we will be able to discover information that no one has seen
up to this point,'' said Eileen Roach, chief deputy general counsel
for the Boston Public Health Commission, which filed the suit on
behalf of the city with Mayor Thomas M. Menino's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said his lawyers would focus on the alleged willful
ignorance of safety issues by gun makers: ``We're going to show how
the gun manufacturers weren't interested in safety and were really
only interested in making sales,'' Menino said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit names 31 gunmakers including Smith &AMP; Wesson, Harrington
&AMP; Richardson Corp. and Savage Arms in Massachusetts, seven
companies in Connecticut and one in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, city lawyers are expected to request
documents from all of them regarding how guns are made, how they
are marketed and what gunmakers know about gun smuggling and
illegal sales. Discovery could last up to two years, and dozens of
the industry's most prominent executives are expected to be
deposed, said city lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic changes occurred in the tobacco industry after they
were forced to turn over internal documents. Most of them came from
a single case involving a lawsuit filed by the state of
Mississippi. The result was a massive financial settlement with
state governments and sweeping regulations of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was released late Thursday and gun manufacturers
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The city's allegations have six prongs: gunmakers produce a
product that is a public nuisance; they haven't taken reasonable
steps to prevent illegal sales; they failed to incorporate safety
devices on guns; they failed to warn gun buyers of risks; they have
unjustly profited at the expense of the public; they were negligent
in marketing, distributing and designing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed the marketing part of the last count but
upheld all the others.
</P>
<P>
   The city is asking for $100 million, though that figure could
climb as a trial approaches. The number is based on an estimate _
officials call it ``conservative'' _ of gun-related costs to local
police, emergency medical services, fire departments, schools and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   They are also asking that gun companies enact several internal
reforms of gun design and marketing, launch a public campaign on
the dangers of their product, and fund a city violence prevention
program.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases filed by other cities, judges weren't convinced
that gun companies were responsible for any of the pain or damage
caused by guns once they left the factory. The companies were too
far removed from shootings _ the so-called ``remoteness'' doctrine.
The individuals who fire guns are at fault, the judges typically
reasoned in throwing out the cases.
</P>
<P>
   But in Suffolk Superior Court Judge Margaret Hinkle's 41-page
decision, she wrote: ``In sum, (the city's) allegations are not, as
a matter of law, barred by `remoteness.' '' She reasoned that if
Boston as a whole is considered the victim, rather than a
collection of individuals, then the business of gun making might be
considered a public nuisance, like pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Recent dealings between the government and industry, in an
attempt to come to settle the lawsuits, have been rocky at best.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest
gunmaker, agreed to a pathbreaking code of conduct proposed by the
federal government. In return, it was dropped from several
lawsuits, although not Boston's. Other gun makers were outraged and
organized a boycott of Smith &AMP; Wesson. The company has since backed
away from the original deal.
</P>
<P>
   In April several gunmakers sued the federal Housing and Urban
Development agency and several local governments, claiming they
illegally force police to purchase guns that adhere to safety rules
opposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   And in May the entire industry walked away from talks intended
to resolve the legal assaults on it.
</P>
<P>
   Given this tumult and the spate of recent dismissals of gun
suits, the landscape looked quite bleak for anti-gun advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a long sturggle. People asked, `Why are you doing
it?' But we felt we were always on sound grounds,'' said Menino, of
his lawsuit.

GRASSROOTS BUSINESS: TULSA USES OIL LEGACY TO REBUILD ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By JOEL KOTKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ A decade ago, Tulsa was a played out oil-and-gas
town.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the town's boosters have recast it in the role of
telecommunications superpower. The area has more than 54,000
high-technology jobs, which account for roughly 8 percent of local
employment, a share that matches well-known technology centers like
Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Dallas; and Stamford, Conn. In the next three
years, a recent survey of area employers shows, the region is
expected to add as many as 6,000 positions in telecommunications
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's emergence as a high-technology center seems all the more
impressive, said Craig Knutson, chief Oklahoma economist for
Southwestern Bell, because it is occurring in a state not widely
known for its high-technology infrastructure or its educational
system. According to the American Electronics Association, Oklahoma
ranks 28th in high-technology jobs among the 50 states and has a
per capita income below the national average. The Tulsa area, with
roughly a quarter of the state's population, accounts for 60
percent to 70 percent of Oklahoma's high-technology employees and
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That such an unlikely place has become a new-economy hotbed is,
in fact, largely a result of the legacy of its previous boom,
Knutson said. For one thing, the explosive growth of the city in
the 1920s bequeathed it a magnificent legacy of impressive Art Deco
buildings, many of which are now attracting Internet and other
information-oriented companies, and elegant close-in urban
neighborhoods ideal for skilled professionals and managers.
Philanthropy fueled by oil and gas wealth has also provided Tulsa,
which has a metropolitan population of 800,000, with an attractive
civic infrastructure that includes a respectable ballet, an
orchestra and art museums that far outpace its larger, cross-state
rival, Oklahoma City, and other similarly sized Southwestern
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important, the energy legacy _ specifically its
management information systems component _ also bequeathed Tulsa a
large cadre of employees with high-technology skills, who now work
for the city's high-technology businesses. This labor pool, plus a
low cost of living, has attracted a host of large information
businesses, including the travel-reservation company Sabre Holdings
and the communications carrier WorldCom, as well as aerospace
companies like Aeromet.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor in Tulsa's resurgence has been the
makeover of the Williams Companies, which was founded in 1908 as an
oil pipeline business. Since the early 1990s the company, long an
anchor of the old energy economy, has been using the rights of way
from its extensive gas pipelines to create one of the nation's
primary fiber optic networks and become a leading provider of
broadband services for telecommunications companies like SBC
Communications. (Two of SBC's rivals, Sprint and Qwest
Communications, were spawned by the Southern Pacific Railroad,
which used its right of way to find a place in the new economy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Williams Communications unit, which had roughly 200
employees in Tulsa in 1996, now has more than 2,000. The number is
expected to double by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   This surge in employment, including thousands more temporary
jobs at Williams itself and others created by its subcontractors,
is helping to transform Tulsa's once sleepy downtown. The symbolic
center of this new activity is Williams' new 15-story,
45,000-square-foot stacked urban campus, which is being designed to
serve as the nerve center of the company's national fiber optic
network. Over all, downtown office vacancy rates, which stood in
the 20 to 30 percent range in the mid-1980s, have now fallen into
the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's emergence parallels the rise of several other ``second
tier'' cities _ places like Albuquerque; Boise, Idaho; and Cedar
Rapids, Iowa _ that are finding new niches in the information-age
economy. In many cases, these cities offer lower living costs,
equally good business climates and a more family-friendly
atmosphere than places like Silicon Valley, Boston's Route 128 or
Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of such cities also often parallels _ and is
spurred by _ the reinvention of many denizens.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, for example, Carol Mersch and Tony Bacher were
among the last to leave the sinking ship that was Tulsa's old
energy economy. Co-workers in the information systems division at
Reading and Bates, a local drilling firm, they hung around in order
to process the terminations of their fellow workers, before
ultimately issuing their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like half of Tulsa was being terminated,'' Mersch
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The two technologists decided to start their own firm,
Mersch-Bacher Associates, to develop business software products for
IBM's newly announced AS-400 computer platform. The company was a
big success. Seven years later, in 1996, the two began another
venture, an Internet service provider called Webzone, which by 1999
had more than 12,000 subscribers. The partners sold both companies
last year for more than $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started because we didn't have jobs and no prospect of
getting one,'' Mersch recalls. ``When the oil bust came, it forced
a lot of people to rethink their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's high-technology growth does have its limitations. Not
even the most extravagant boosters are not ready to sell downtown
Tulsa as a rival to such creative Internet centers as Boston's
Cyber District, Lower Manhattan, Santa Monica, Calif., or San
Francisco's South of Market. As a bible belt city with a modest
nightlife, lacking both a highly recognized research university and
convenient air connections, Knutson suggests, Tulsa's is unlikely
to emerge as a full-fledged information-age capital.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the growth, whether at giants like WorldCom and
Williams or smaller companies, continues to stick largely to the
telecommunications and enabling software side of the information
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, such infrastructure concerns _ those that
provide the roads or software for the information superhighway _
may prove stronger and more impervious to market fluctuations than
the so far largely unprofitable dot-coms that have sparked revivals
in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Tulsa's new arrivals are companies like
SecureAgent.com, which provides encryption software for major
corporations. The company's founder, Brent Johnson, spent much of
his life in the Bay Area before coming to Tulsa to work as a
consultant for American Airlines. In 1992, he founded SecureAgent,
not in Silicon Valley but here, in a place that offered an
expanding telecommunications network in a lower-cost business
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa is a little-known secret,'' says Johnson, whose firm
employs 24 people and plans to add 40 more in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   He sees costs for engineers, who are paid, on average, roughly
40 percent less than their Bay Area peers, as a major plus for his
company, and he likes the relatively low prices for housing and his
company's office space in a refurbished downtown structure. ``This
building has a lot of character,'' he says, ``and this building
costs me less than it would have cost me in California 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in a technical, as opposed to content-oriented, niche,
Johnson says, makes it easier to flourish in a city like Tulsa,
which lacks the fine restaurants, and other accouterments of
centers like New York or San Francisco. Unlike a media or content
firm, Johnson explains, a company like SecureAgent.com is not
dependent on regular face-to-face contact with prime customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are all over the world,'' he says. ``It doesn't
matter where we are. We are not going out to lunch with them. We
can do just fine where we are.''

RESHUFFLED CARDS RUNNING AWAY WITH NL CENTRAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim Bowden carefully
considered the ramifications of trading his best pitcher, Denny
Neagle, before even one game had been played in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   He considered the club's payroll, considered the fact that
Neagle can become a free agent after the season, and considered the
chances of re-signing the left-hander. He considered the potential
negative reaction from fans and the media, who might see a trade as
giving up prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Then he considered the standings. Despite winning six of 10
games before the All-Star break, and despite being in second place
in the National League Central, the Reds were a game under .500 and
eight games behind the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Bowden ran the white flag up the flagpole
and traded Neagle to the New York Yankees on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A business decision, he called it, but it was more than that. It
was a realistic one.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, a badly beaten fourth in the division last year,
aren't likely to be caught this season. They entered the break with
the second-best record in the NL (51-36), half a game behind the
Atlanta Braves, and had the biggest lead in any division.
</P>
<P>
   The team is winning thanks in part to general manager Walt
Jocketty, who rebuilt the club with a series of astute trades and
free-agent signings after last year's disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole new team; that's the difference,'' slugger
Mark McGwire said. ``We have new guys at a lot of positions. Walt
did a great job with free agents and some trades this winter, and
he deserves a lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won 158 games the past two seasons, only 23 more
victories than McGwire had home runs. McGwire thrilled baseball
fans everywhere with his record-breaking exploits, but, all too
often, the newspaper headlines read, ``McGwire goes deep in Cards'
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is again leading the majors in home runs with 30, but he
is less the center of attention, and he couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's better,'' he said. ``Who doesn't want to be on
a winner? It's pretty hard to accommodate the media when you're
talking about yourself all the time. Now the team wins, and the
media wants to talk about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocketty revamped the pitching staff by trading for starters
Darryl Kile and Pat Hentgen and closer Dave Veres, and by signing
free agent Andy Benes. With help from rookie Rick Ankiel and
Garrett Stephenson, the rotation is 43-23. That's a marked
improvement from last year, when starters went 50-45. Injuries
forced manager Tony La Russa to put together a patchwork staff and
wear out the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stability in the rotation,'' La Russa said. ``That's
been important because we haven't had to mess with the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The GM improved the offense by trading for center fielder Jim
Edmonds and second baseman Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   His new teammates didn't know what to expect out of Edmonds. He
suffered through an injury-plagued season in '99, and came from
Anaheim with a reputation as a divisive force in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmonds has fit in off the field, and played like an
All-Star on it. With 25 home runs, he has teamed with McGwire to
give the Cards the best one-two power punch in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing an unbelievable job, I think better than anybody
expected,'' outfielder J.D. Drew said. ``He's definitely one of the
key parts of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup is more than the Mark-and-Jim show, however. The
supporting cast is good enough that the Cardinals entered yesterday
on pace for 277 homers, which would break the major-league record
of 264 set by the Seattle Mariners in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes our lineup tough is it goes all the way down to the
eight hole,'' Kile said. ``We've got a good mix of guys who drive
the ball into the gaps or out of the ballpark. If you pitch around
McGwire, the next guy can hit one out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potent offense, the improved pitching and their big
lead, the Cardinals don't have the champagne on ice.
</P>
<P>
   They open the second half with a four-city, 11-game road trip,
and McGwire is hurt. He missed the All-Star Game because of
tendinitis below his right knee, which kept him out of action last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing we talk about now is don't get carried
away,'' La Russa said. ``I like the way everybody's approaching
things like that. They're confident, but not comfortable at all.''
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, they have every reason to be confident.
Their closest pursuers acknowledged that by trading away their best
pitcher.

ANALYSIS: DIFFERENT GAINS FOR MEDIAONE STOCKHOLDERS RELATES TO
AT&AMP;T'S VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you want to avoid paying taxes? If you're a
MediaOne shareholder, that tax aversion could prove very costly.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's takeover of MediaOne has already taken effect, but only
now are shareholders of the cable television company having to
decide what they will be paid for the company. Those who decide to
minimize the tax hit will do so, but at a considerable cost.
</P>
<P>
   That is because AT&AMP;T is offering MediaOne shareholders three
choices of compensation, varying in the amount of AT&AMP;T stock and
cash that will be received. The deadline for shareholders to make
their choice is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest immediate tax hit will come for shareholders who
choose to take as much of their compensation as possible in AT&AMP;T
stock. Those shareholders will receive 1.4912 shares of AT&AMP;T plus
$8.50 in cash for each share of MediaOne they tender. Because the
shares are not taxable now _ in tax jargon, the cost of the
MediaOne shares carries over to the cost of the AT&AMP;T shares _ those
holders would pay tax only on $8.50 in cash, or perhaps on less,
depending on the profit recorded on the MediaOne shares, which is
based on what the investor paid for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that offer is not worth nearly as much as the other
offers available. At close of trading Thursday with AT&AMP;T's stock
price at $33.75 that offer is worth only $58.83 for each MediaOne
share.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best alternative for shareholders would be an
all-cash offer of $85 a share, which will not actually bring that
much cash but will provide more cash than either of the other
offers. The other alternative is an offer of 0.95 share of AT&AMP;T,
plus $36.27 in cash, for each MediaOne share. That has a value of
$68.33 at current prices and is close to what investors will
actually receive if they choose the cash version.
</P>
<P>
   That is true because AT&AMP;T has fixed what it will pay _ about $23
billion in cash and 606 million shares _ and the shareholder
elections will simply decide how the cash and stock are divided up.
If everyone chose the same option, all would end up with the
blended deal, which AT&AMP;T calls the standard election.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the number of shares tendered for stock could be
unusually high is MediaOne's history. It was spun off in 1995 from
U S West, which itself was spun off from AT&AMP;T when the phone
company was broken up in 1984. Like all the companies that were
spun off from AT&AMP;T, it has a lot of individual holders, many of
whom own small positions.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will not give details on the results thus far, but Connie
Weaver, AT&AMP;T's vice president for investor relations, says,
``People are taking all three of the options.'' She said MediaOne
had about 800,000 investors.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone choose the clearly inferior offer that contains
mostly stock? One reason may be that brokerage firms are not
offering much advice. PaineWebber put out a report saying the cash
option was clearly the most valuable, but other firms seem not to
have done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not advising, because it depends on the individual's tax
situation,'' said Megan Kulick, a telecommunications analyst for
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is hard to imagine any investor who would be better
off to take the stock deal. Someone who took the blended deal and
had a low enough cost of MediaOne stock to owe taxes on all the
cash received _ meaning that investor paid less than $30.40 each
for their shares in MediaOne _ and who owed combined federal and
state capital gains taxes of 25 percent, would still have an
after-tax value of $59.27 a share, compared with $56.70 for the
investor who took the primarily stock package.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who did want to own more AT&AMP;T could take the cash
and buy more AT&AMP;T shares than the stock offering would provide. And
that investor would owe less taxes later when the AT&AMP;T shares were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The two packages are so disparate in large part because AT&AMP;T
stock has been a poor performer since the deal was announced on May
6, 1999. Its shares are trading for just over half the $61.9375
they were worth then, the result of a series of corporate
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the lure of simplicity and tax savings is likely to
make at least some shareholders choose the stock alternative. When
they do, the beneficiaries of that decision will be the other
owners of MediaOne stock, who will get more cash and less AT&AMP;T
stock than they otherwise would have received. Those owners will
include institutional investors and the risk arbitrage departments
of some of the very firms that seem hesitant to offer advice to
their customers.

BUSH REMARK ON STATE BUDGET PROBLEMS LIGHTS UP CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's dismissive response to the
state's fiscal woes jumpstarted critics on Thursday, including Vice
President Al Gore who warned that such an approach could lead to
federal deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference Tuesday if he was worried about cash
shortfalls emerging in some state programs _ just as he's touting
tax cuts on the presidential campaign trail _ Bush said he hopes he
won't have to deal with such things anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to project the amount of money the
Legislature will be dealing with, and as you know I hope I'm not
here to deal with it,'' Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, told reporters. ``I'm seeking another office.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and interest groups seized on Bush's comments,
describing them as both callous and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I looked, he's still the governor of Texas,''
said state Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston. ``To say that he doesn't
want to deal with it because he's looking for another job, I think
that's wrong ... especially if he wants to be dealing with Social
Security and the federal budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a spokeswoman for the Gray Panthers, an Austin-based
senior citizens group that hasn't been friendly to Bush, blasted
Bush's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows his insensitivity to the peole of Texas who
are in need,'' said Charlotte Flynn, state coordinator for the
group. ``My feeling is he does not understand in Texas what our
basic needs are. I think what he's focused on is getting in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush presidential campaign,
called the attacks disappointing, and stressed that the state will
have ample resources to meet needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to see Texas Democrats get into the
political mud with Al Gore since virtually every single one of them
voted for the 2000-2001 state budget, and the tax cuts approved by
the legislature and Gov. Bush,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush's likely Democratic opponent, said those tax cuts are
the reason budget strains have developed and warned that Bush would
do the same thing to the federal budget if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Gov. Bush says he wants to do for America what he's done
for Texas _ go to Washington to spend our surplus and then more for
budget-busting tax cuts,'' Gore said on Thursday during a campaign
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush fired back, saying: ``If Al Gore suggests a state with a
surplus shouldn't cut taxes, how can the American people count on
Al Gore to cut taxes when our nation is in surplus?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides and legislative leaders point out that the state is
not in the midst of a fiscal crisis, but instead has encountered
higher-than-anticipated expenses.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is the state will, in the best-case scenario,
have a smaller surplus than originally expected. Under the
worst-case scenario, offered up by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, there will
be no surplus at all but basic needs will still be met.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, the political implications of the budget flap and
Bush's handling of it are potentially negative for Bush, said Prof.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a media expert at the University of
Pennsylvania and author of the recent book, ``Everything You Think
You Know About Politics and Why You're Wrong''.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be less of a problem if he weren't running so heavily
on his record as governor,'' she said, comparing his plight to that
of 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, criticized
for his shortcomings as governor of Massachusetts. ``The tax cut is
the center of the Bush presidential run, and his success as a tax
cutter is, as a result, something you look to.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that if Bush tells voters he can't accurately
predict state finances, it undermines his argument that there will
be a huge federal surplus to direct toward tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the Bush campaign spokesman, said the governor was
relying on ``the best estimates'' available from the agencies
lawmakers use when divvying up government money _ both on the state
and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody found Bush's comments offensive.
</P>
<P>
   John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers _ the
state chapter of a national group that already has endorsed Gore _
said he took the hope-I'm-gone line from Bush as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing candor,'' said Cole. ``We, for our part, hope
he is here for three more years.''

OUTSIDERS FLOCK TO VERMONT FOR CIVIL-UNION WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUTNEY, Vt. _ Three hours after landing at Logan International
Airport Thursday morning, John Ferrari and Henry Lloyd of Atlanta
clasped hands on a stranger's back lawn in this bucolic town,
looked each other in the eye, and pledged to remain united for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a few pleasantries with a justice of the peace
they'd met five minutes earlier, the two men, wearing tennis shirts
and jeans, got into their rented SUV and whooshed back to the
Boston airport.
</P>
<P>
   Like the typical Las Vegas wedding, it was just a couple of
out-of-staters getting hitched, with no cake, caterers or weeping
in-laws looking on. But unlike the newlyweds in Nevada, when
Ferrari and Lloyd's four-minute ceremony ended Thursday, they knew
their bond in the eyes of the law of their distant home.
</P>
<P>
   So go civil unions in Vermont these days, two weeks after the
state implemented its landmark, controversial legislation allowing
gay and lesbian couples to live in a state of near-matrimony.
According to town clerks, justices of the peace, and those watching
the novel process unfold, the ``CU'' of Ferrari and Lloyd was the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flatlanders,'' as outsiders are called here, constitute the
vast majority of couples who have so far entered into civil unions
_ even though Vermont is the only state that recognizes them as
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the ceremonies tend to be minutes long, bare-bones
affairs, nearly all of which lack the now cliched images Americans
have come to expect when two people come together for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a societal model for this,'' said Ferrari, 39.
``We have to think through every little step and talk about whether
we want to do things the straight way or something totally
different. The only thing we knew was that we wanted to do this as
soon as possible. If a state comes along and says, `We're going to
legally acknowledge you,' you don't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, when civil unions became law, town clerks have
notified the Vermont Department of Health that they have issued 19
civil union licenses, 11 of which went to out-of-state couples,
said Linda Davis, who manages the department's vital records
division. who It's believed that perhaps three or four times more
civil unions have actually taken place, since small towns are
required to notify the state only once a month. But most of those
have been to out-of-staters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks from across Vermont are saying the same thing: It may be
Vermont's law, but those taking quick advantage tend to come from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the nationwide population of gay and
lesbian people, and you think about the fact that Vermont is the
only place it's available, I can see why out-of-state people would
be the majority,'' said Dorothy Mammen, coordinator of the Vermont
Freedom to Marry Task Force, which has campaigned strongly for
civil unions. ``A lot of them who are doing it quickly may well
have done a commitment ceremony at home and yet whenever they do
one of those, there's no official recognition, so they're coming
here to finish what they have started.''
</P>
<P>
   If out-of-staters are making up the majority of couples entering
into civil unions, that does not necessarily mean Vermont's gay and
lesbian couples are uninterested, many here say. Some speculate
that many of Vermont's committed lesbian and gay partners are busy
planning more involved ceremonies, deciding what caterer to hire,
what band will play, who will be invted and when it it will be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think the law is in any jeopardy and I
think a lot of Vermonters know that,'' said Marc Awodey, a
Burlington justice of the peace who will have performed 11 civil
unions by the end of this weekend, most to out-of-staters. But the
fear that the law will be revoked is ``something that prompted some
(out-of-state couples) to go ahead more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if some couples hope to get hitched while the hitching's
good, others hope to use their civil unions like a seed that they
will plant in their home states. Ferrari and Lloyd, who plan to
move to southern California in the next few weeks, say they are
quite serious about using their union as a ``test case'' in their
new state, or joining other California couples already doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Westing, the Putney justice of the peace who performed
their ceremony, said other couples have told her the same thing.
``I don't get the sense that a lot of these couples are content to
accept that their civil union is only good in a state where they
don't even live.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such high-minded arguments, some observers here believe
much of what they're seeing is a reflection of plain old
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vacation time, and let's face it, this is a really
popular state for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered couples
anyway,'' said Barbara Dozetos, editor of Out in the Mountains, a
monthly newspaper that caters to the state's gay and lesbian
community. ``Don't think some couples aren't just saying, `Let's do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari, a retired cabaret dancer and sales executive, and
Lloyd, a corporate executive, say they began discussing the
ceremony months ago, when it looked as though Vermont would succeed
in legalizing them. When July 1 finally arrived, Ferrari said, they
decided their time had come. ``If Vermont was brave enough to
accept us, we had to show support for Vermont as soon as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the two men spent countless hours contemplating
whether to enter into civil union, their simple ceremony Thursday
seemed to pack more emotional power than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize, of course, that this means you can't get rid of
me now,'' Lloyd, 45, said moments after the men were CU'd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what this means?'' Ferrari said, laughing. ``Gee,
maybe this was a bad idea after all.''

GE STOCK EARNINGS TOP ESTIMATES, RISING 20 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The General Electric Co., benefiting from a robust
economy and its aggressive push into selling products online, said
Thursday that its second-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, beating
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $3.38 billion,
or 34 cents a share. That compares with $2.82 billion, or 28 cents
a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1
stock split in April. Revenue surged 20 percent, to $32.9 billion
from $27.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 33 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong quarter is business as usual for GE, but this quarter
was even better than normal,'' said Charles Hill, director of
research at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed unimpressed as shares of GE, based in
Fairfield, Conn., fell $1, to $52.50. Analysts, in contrast, were
practically adulatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most industrial companies are experiencing no more than 5
percent organic growth, so GE's results are just phenomenal,'' said
Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said:
``You'd need a jeweler's glass to find a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers did little to help handicap the race to succeed Jack
Welch, the GE chairman, who will retire next year. Analysts expect
the heir to be one of three executives: Robert Nardelli, head of GE
Power Systems; Jeffrey Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; or W.
James McNerney Jr., head of GE Aircraft Engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession wouldn't swing on one quarter anyway, but all of
the contenders had good results,'' said Russell Leavitt, an analyst
at Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems had a particularly robust quarter, with sales
up 60 percent. All makers of turbines had growth spurts as
utilities continued their buying spree, but analysts say that GE
grabbed share away from competitors like ABB and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power systems knocked the cover off the ball,'' said Richard
Nelson, an analyst with ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   GE Medical nearly doubled its sales of X-ray machines, while
sales of CAT scanners and ultrasound machines were up more than 35
percent. Thanks to robust sales of high-margin services, GE
Aircraft Engines saw its profit rise 20 percent on a revenue
increase of just 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even without new reality or game shows, GE's television network,
NBC, held onto a high share of viewers aged 18 to 49 _ the ones
advertisers pay most to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at GE Capital, meanwhile, were up 17 percent on a
revenue rise of 23 percent. Analysts expect those earnings to rise
even higher as GE Capital continues to de-emphasize businesses like
the leasing of rail cars in favor of those featuring financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all over the Internet, capturing customers for
services rather than for leases of depreciable assets,'' Heymann
said.
</P>
<P>
   GE, never short of cash, will soon have even more. On Tuesday,
UBS said it would buy PaineWebber for $12.4 billion. GE owns part
of PaineWebber and should reap $1.4 billion from the deal. Gary
Sheffer, a GE spokesman, insists that GE was not consulted on the
merger and has not yet made plans for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Buying back stock is one option. GE, in fact, bought back $523
million in stock during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But not all analysts like that idea. ``Theirs isn't a cheap
stock,'' said Nelson of ING Barings. ``They should invest in
Internet companies whose stories they believe.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the three artists from Bologna named Carracci _ Annibale
(1560-1609), his brother Agostino (1557-1602) and their cousin
Ludovico (1555-1619) _ did not exactly invent Baroque art, they
gave their all to it. In the 1580s, unhappy with the Mannerist
preciosity that dominated the art of their time, they started an
academy that pushed for a return to nature and the classical
heritage of the great Italian masters who preceded them, in
particular Correggio, Veronese and Titian.
</P>
<P>
   A significant institution in the history of Western art,
essentially developed by Ludovico, the academy insisted that art
can be taught on academic principles, along with more practical
apprenticeships, and that pupils must study the antique and
Renaissance traditions as well as anatomy and drawing from life. It
produced a generation of artists, among them Guido Reni,
Domenichino and Annibale Carracci himself.
</P>
<P>
   Later the three Carraccis went on to their own pursuits.
Annibale, considered one of the greatest draftsmen of the age,
moved to Rome in 1595 to work for the powerful Farnese family. With
the help of Agostino, he created a highly influential fresco cycle
for the ceiling of the Farnese Palace that was lauded as the equal
of Raphael's work in the Vatican. Done in a vigorously sensuous
style, it brought back the Renaissance love of human drama and
emotion. Natural forms, modified by the classicism of the masters,
replaced what the Carraccis perceived as the distortions of
Mannerism. In short they were significant figures in the
development of the dynamic art known as Baroque.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, the Metropolitan Museum has assembled a
splendid collection of work by the Carraccis: four paintings _
three acquired in the last six years _ 17 drawings and a slew of
prints. A selection from these holdings is on display in ``The
Birth of Baroque: The Carracci at the Metropolitan'' through Sept.
17.
</P>
<P>
   Among the oils, Ludovico's innovative ``The Lamentation''
(1582), said to be a landmark in European painting, is the most
shockingly ``real.'' The very dead figure of Jesus, based on a
posed model, lies contortedly across the matronly Virgin's lap as
she slumps back in a faint. Light falls brightly on the two figures
and the faces of St. John and Mary Magdalene, illuminating the
contrast between live and dead flesh. The corpse's attendants,
including the Virgin, are stylized compared with the figure of
Jesus, but they avoid the idealization that was a given of
Renaissance art.
</P>
<P>
   Less of a shocker, but of equal weight, is Annibale's
``Coronation of the Virgin'' (about 1596), done after his arrival
in Rome for the private chapel of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini. The
symmetrical composition shows the Virgin crowned Queen of Heaven by
Jesus and God the Father as she is seated on a bank of clouds. She
is attended below by a band of music-making cherubs seen close up
and above by a ghostly cast of thousands in the infinity of
Paradise. Scholars say that the compositional symmetry and the
apselike view of Paradise reflect the classicism of Annibale's
influential Roman style as well as his response to Raphael's
Vatican frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   But brilliant as they are, these paintings can only offer a
glimpse of the Carraccis' achievements, which ran mostly to complex
fresco cycles and monumental altarpieces. Their painstaking
observation and their ability to handle complicated narratives is
better seen in their drawings and prints. The drawings, which
served largely as a way to explore ideas, were fundamental to the
making of the Carracci pictorial language. They range from
Annibale's charmingly intimate ink with wash, ``A Domestic Scene''
(probably early 1580s), in which a mother warms her child's
nightgown before a fire, to Ludovico's ambitious ``The Last
Communion of St. Jerome'' (no date), a tightly composed altarpiece
proposal for a Bolognese church in which the saint undergoes the
sacramental rite as he lies supported by Mary, among a bustle of
other figures.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are powerful figure studies, like Annibale's ``Triton
Sounding a Conch Shell'' (probably around 1597), one of the many
preparatory drawings for the Farnese Palace project. It depicts a
hugely muscled sea god blowing strenuously on a conch shell, the
finished version of which appears in the ceiling fresco ``Thetis
Carried to the Bridal Chamber of Peleus.'' Most of the energetic
figures for the gigantic fresco cycle were invented by Annibale
(although some were done by Agostino) using poses by live models.
At least 90 drawings for the project are extant.
</P>
<P>
   Annibale's drawings include biblical themes as well. One of the
loveliest is the ink and wash ``Landscape With Jacob Sleeping''
(probably 1590-1595), relating to the story in Genesis. During a
journey, Jacob, the future patriarch, falls asleep on a heap of
stones. He dreams of a ladder rising to Heaven, with people
climbing and descending and God speaking from the top about the
Promised Land. In Annibale's version, the huddled figure of Jacob
lies under a sheltering tree, while in the middle distance a
faintly sketched ladder is seen. The pastoral landscape is airy and
luminous, with a glowingly expansive rendering of space.
</P>
<P>
   Agostino was the only Carracci trained as a professional
printmaker, although his brother and cousin did not lack for skills
in the medium. The more than 200 engravings by Agostino include
many that reproduced the endeavors of earlier masters like Titian
and Tintoretto, helping to spread knowledge of their work.
Annibale, taught by Agostino, made only 21 prints over a 25-year
period, starting in 1581 with engraving but going on to the
livelier challenge of etching. Only four prints by Ludovico are
known.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of Annibale's most dramatic prints, combining etching and
engraving, deals with the biblical tale ``Susanna and the Elders''
(circa 1590-92), in which a fleshy Susanna is spied on at her bath
by two dirty old men. She hastily pulls her clothes around her in a
beautifully delineated milieu of sun, lush vegetation, drapery,
water and the stone of the bathing pool. The menace of the two men
is heightened by frowning stone masks at the edge of the pool. The
action in a much smaller ``Susanna'' engraving by Agostino, done
around the same time, is more lascivious; it drew a rebuke from
Pope Clement VIII. In this print one of the elders actually gropes
her.
</P>
<P>
   Two strong renditions of saints by Agostino also stand out among
the prints. ``The Stigmatization of St. Francis'' (published 1586)
is an arresting engraving of the saint in the wilderness, kneeling
in ecstasy, hands outstretched to receive the stigmata conveyed by
rays from above. The work of several other artists influenced this
print, but Agostino's intense, theatrical depiction of the saint's
ecstatic expression shows how he embraced the Baroque style.
</P>
<P>
   His last engraving, done shortly before his death and finished
by another artist, is ``Saint Jerome'' (1602). The saint, attended
by a sleeping lion, kneels on a rock, holding a cross and gazing
rapturously upward. In this print Agostino looks more to Mannerism,
expressed in the saint's well-muscled body. This small but
illustrious show is another example of the Met's commendable
practice of building exhibitions from its own collection with
little or no call on outside sources. Admittedly not every museum
can muster the material owned by this treasure house, but the Met
has become adept at proving that there are more ways than
blockbusters to get people looking at art.

 &QL; 
``The signing of the check at  &UR; Alain Ducasse  &LR; is a special
moment,'' writes New York Times restaurant critic  &UR; William Grimes &LR; 
in a description forwarded by  &UR; David Schwoegler &LR; . ``With exquisite
timing, a waiter appears and holds up a velvet display board
containing a dozen finely made pens. It's hard not to feel that you
are about to sign a document imposing humiliating terms of
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   A fixed-price dinner at the restaurant, which opened recently,
is $160; customers calling for reservations must leave a credit
card deposit of $150 a person. The restaurant has one sitting a
night, is open for lunch only twice a week and is closed on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing New Yorkers like better than a challenge. Grimes
writes that within days of its phone being hooked up, 2,700
reservation requests were wait-listed. Right now, Ducasse has
stopped taking reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the amenities: a stainless-steel six-pack of various
kinds of mineral water; a wine list with a wax seal that needs to
be broken; herbal tea, offered at the end of the meal, is created
after the waiter arrives with a cart of herbs growing in pots,
grasps the plant, cuts a few leaves off and brews it.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes' bill, for four people, came to nearly $1,500, excluding
tip. ``In one Olympic clean-and-jerk motion,'' he writes, ``I had
broken all previous records by several hundred dollars. I felt the
kind of mad exhilaration that criminals must feel when they've done
something terribly, irrevocably wrong.''

 PERSONALS: The Most Expensive Food in New York

``The signing of the check at  &UR; Alain Ducasse  &LR; is a special
moment,'' writes New York Times restaurant critic  &UR; William Grimes &LR; 
in a description forwarded by  &UR; David Schwoegler &LR; . ``With exquisite
timing, a waiter appears and holds up a velvet display board
containing a dozen finely made pens. It's hard not to feel that you
are about to sign a document imposing humiliating terms of
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   A fixed-price dinner at the restaurant, which opened recently,
is $160; customers calling for reservations must leave a credit
card deposit of $150 a person. The restaurant has one sitting a
night, is open for lunch only twice a week and is closed on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing New Yorkers like better than a challenge. Grimes
writes that within days of its phone being hooked up, 2,700
reservation requests were wait-listed. Right now, Ducasse has
stopped taking reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the amenities: a stainless-steel six-pack of various
kinds of mineral water; a wine list with a wax seal that needs to
be broken; herbal tea, offered at the end of the meal, is created
after the waiter arrives with a cart of herbs growing in pots,
grasps the plant, cuts a few leaves off and brews it.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes' bill, for four people, came to nearly $1,500, excluding
tip. ``In one Olympic clean-and-jerk motion,'' he writes, ``I had
broken all previous records by several hundred dollars. I felt the
kind of mad exhilaration that criminals must feel when they've done
something terribly, irrevocably wrong.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ As Gov. George W. Bush mulls over potential
running mates, here is an appealing choice: He is a popular young
governor from the fourth largest state, one where Democrats hope to
compete ferociously. He is something of a policy wonk, a nice
balance to Bush's celebrated aversion to minutiae. He is beloved
among many Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc. He is Roman
Catholic, a big plus since Bush faced accusations in the primaries
that he was anti-Catholic. And he has star appeal as a scion of one
of the most famous political families.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, his last name is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an odd twist of fate, or, more precisely, electoral
fortune, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who had long been seen in the
family as the one with the greatest political promise, has been
crowded off the national stage by his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than capitalize on his brother's fame, Jeb Bush has
receded into the shadows far more than is typical for a new
governor of a big state. Resisting entreaties from other governors
and Republican officials, Bush rarely ventures beyond Florida to
take part in party functions. He shuns opportunities to speak out
about his brother's campaign, except when asked about its prospects
in Florida. And he will not have a high-profile speaking slot at
the party's national convention in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been almost reclusive,'' Bush said in the first
extensive interview he has given about his brother's campaign and
how he fits in _ or does not. Explaining his deliberate attempts at
low visibility, he cited the Bush name. ``Maybe I'm overly
sensitive to it about the legacy and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a driving force behind Bush's low profile, besides his
priority of tending to Florida business, is what he said is the
tangled, and often hurtful predicament of constantly being compared
to his father, the former president, and his brother, the would-be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any good things that are said about anything I'm doing have
been historically posted up against George in a negative way,'' he
said. ``Any bad things that might be said about me would be used
negatively against George. I don't see how I help George by having
a high profile nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inescapable reality for Jeb Bush is that as much as he
and his brother love each other, friends and associates say their
relationship has never been like that of another famous set of
political siblings, John and Robert Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was
President Kennedy's closest adviser in the White House and was
known as the enforcer who would make things happen for his brother
_ and take on his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jeb Bush, who is 47, said he chatted with his
54-year-old brother only about once a week. He does not appear to
be steeped in the presidential campaign, or at least is not eager
to show that he is.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is his brother. Asked recently if he would appoint Jeb Bush
to a cabinet position, as President Kennedy did with his brother,
George Bush offered a resounding, ``Uhhhhhh, no!''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by his computer (e-mail messages popped up continuously)
in his small anteroom next to his larger ceremonial office in the
Capitol here, Jeb Bush talked about how he resented the contrasts
with his brother and father. Jeb Bush is often portrayed in the
press as more cerebral than his brother, while George W. Bush is
depicted as more of a natural politician. They are both frequently
described as more agile campaigners than their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurtful to see George being criticized,'' he said. ``It's
painful to see the comparisons used in a way that are hurtful. The
most painful thing for me, and I know it is for George, is to see
comparisons about my dad where a compliment is given to George or
in some cases maybe to me, saying, `Well, he's better.' As far as
I'm concerned, my dad is as close to perfection as a human being
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was particularly pained by how his brother was
sometimes typecast as a lightweight. ``I don't understand why
people would say it,'' he said. ``Perhaps because he's a guy's guy.
He's easygoing. He has interests outside of politics and all this
wonky stuff. People that really bother me are intellectuals that
think they've got it all figured out, that he doesn't have the
gravitas to serve. The only comfort I get is they get it wrong all
the time. There's actually a political advantage to being
underestimated in George's case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb Bush would much rather talk about Florida than about his
brother's intellectual prowess. He is so averse to the limelight
that he said he consented to this interview not because he finally
relented after requests stretching back to last year, but because
he was told that the reporter planned to write an article anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb has been in hot demand,'' said Gov. John Engler of
Michigan. ``We're tried to have Jeb come to Michigan _ and many
other have tried. Jeb just doesn't. His focus is in Tallahassee.
He's very careful.''

BRADLEY, GORE BURY THE PRIMARY HATCHET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Bill Bradley, who once suggested that Al Gore
twisted the truth, endorsed the vice president Thursday in their
first meeting since Gore won a bitter Democratic presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky ex-professional basketball player and New Jersey
senator introduced his former rival at an outdoor rally in Green
Bay and said he will work to see the Democrats keep the White House
and regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for
president of the United States,'' he said. Although Bradley had
said in March that he would support the Democratic presidential
candidate, he had not previously used the word ``endorse''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore would do better than Republican candidate
George W. Bush in solving such problems as racial divisions, health
care costs and the influence of special interest money on political
campaigns. ``It's not even close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who during the primaries accused Bradley of proposing a
budget-busting health plan, lavished praise on his former rival,
saying that that the two men had a number of goals in common
including moving toward universal health care and adopting campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treasure Bill Bradley's support. He is a good Democrat who
speaks and stands for principles we believe in,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite past tensions the two appeared comfortable together
during the event, held at a park on the shores of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tanned and relaxed, Bradley shook Gore's hand and patted
him briefly on the back after introducing the vice president, who
was dressed casually in a polo shirt and slacks.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore why they decided to put past acrimony behind them,
both men cited the folk wisdom of the football legend who put Green
Bay on the map, the late Packers Coach Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in Green Bay today because I believe what Vince
Lombardi once said is true. `Winning is a team sport!''' said
Bradley. To which Gore offered another Lombardi maxim, ``People who
work together win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still lagging in the polls behind Bush, Gore needed this
official display of peace with Bradley to energize Democratic
voters and avoid more divisiveness in the party before its
convention in Los Angeles next month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of lengthy negotiations between the two camps,
Bradley appears to have been assured a speaking role at the
convention, said his spokesman, Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not yet agreed to release several hundred delegates
committed to him from the primaries. But it appears likely that
Gore will secure the support of most of them by the time the
convention rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley vowed to work for Gore and Democrats in the fall
election, it is not clear just how much time he will spend on the
campaign trail. He appeared with Gore at only one event Thursday,
flying on his own to and from Green Bay. Later in the day Gore flew
to serve as host of a town hall meeting in Saginaw, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   As he departed, Gore told supporters at the Green Bay Airport
that Thursday was one of the most important days in the election
campaign because of Bradley's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has ``a big following and an even larger number that
respect his judgment,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Before their joint public appearance, the two men met privately
for about 40 minutes, their first encounter since the last primary
debate in Los Angeles on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley clearly had been angry at Gore during the heated
primary, particularly after the vice president ripped into his plan
to provide health insurance for all Americans. The vice president
charged that the plan would increase the deficit and drain funding
from other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was resentful that Bradley challenged the
sitting vice president, who spent the past seven years dutifully
serving in the No. 2 spot and positioning himself for the
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have enthusiastically seized on Bradley's most
biting criticism: that Gore does not tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked in a Jan. 26 debate in new Hampshire. The quote now appears
as a heading on Republican contender George W. Bush's campaign
releases challenging Gore's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Bradley, stressing a populist platform, appeared to
be making a credible challenge against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But by early winter the Bradley effort fizzled as Gore
intensified his campaign and consolidated the support of key
Democratic groups such as minorities and labor. Meanwhile,
Republican candidate John McCain was siphoning off independent
voters drawn to the outsiders' message.
</P>
<P>
   In his address Thursday, Gore quoted Bradley numerous times as
he sought to convey that he championed many of the same causes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is right when he says, `It's not right that kings
and dictators can come to this country to get the best medical care
in the world while children and families two blocks away may not be
able to afford to afford any care at all,''' Gore said. Bradley,
sitting behind Gore on the platform, did not clap at the mention of
his health care priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not mention Gore's proposals on health care or
campaign finance reform. The one area in which he singled out Gore
for praise was his grasp of the technological changes taking place
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing Gore, though, Bradley gave a hint of the lingering
disappointment at his primary defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a remarkable experience _ though someone once told me,
when one uses the term `experience' in this context, `experience'
is what you get when you don't get what you really wanted,'' he
said. ``Indeed the Democratic voters spoke and selected the vice
president as our party's nominee.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Unser Jr: IRL here to stay
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Al Unser Jr. says he knows why the Indy Racing
League's Northern Lights Series can win the war between factions of
open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   Dictators always beat committees, and CART is run by a
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tony George runs the IRL with a firm hand, and Unser said he
likes the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill France is the perfect example,'' Unser said. ``France had
a vision and implemented it through NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Like France, George chases his vision without discussion or
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Unser, the two-time Indy 500 winner who will be racing in
Saturday night's Midas 500 Classic at Atlanta Motor Speedway, has
seen both sides of the fray. He moved to IRL during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is definitely here to stay,'' Unser said, citing the
expansion of the series schedule from nine races this year to 12
and counting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent change in CART leadership, Bobby Rahal
replacing Andrew Craig, Unser doesn't see any big changes. ``A
committee runs CART,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL and CART cars don't have many differences, except CART
cars have more power, Unser said. But he said speed can outrun the
technology and create unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Both series are very competitive, but IRL drivers give each
other more respect on the track, Unser said. Indy 500 winner Juan
Montoya has said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, NASCAR is setting the standard for Americans to view
races, Unser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 500 miles, you have five to seven cars door to door at
the end of the race,'' Unser said. ``In NASCAR, we don't know who
is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what George wants for the IRL, and he got it at Texas
Motor Speedway with packs of 15 cars drafting in a race nearly free
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of racing helped Unser make up his mind to choose CART
when the IRL was first formed. ``We didn't know about these G-Force
and Dallara cars,'' he said. ``I was very hesitant.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he likes the way the IRL keeps control of the speeds; it
promotes safety and competition. This year, six different drivers
have won the six races held.
</P>
<P>
   But even with competitive cars and strong leadership, the IRL
still has trouble moving into the South. The CART series had the
same problem when Unser first raced here in 1983, starting 21st and
finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta Motor Speedway is a vastly different track now than it
was then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars have changed every bit as much. I invite Southern
race fans out to see what we can do.''

 TALLAHASSEE, Fla.: very careful. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was never supposed to be this complicated. When his brother,
George, was still settling on a career in his late 30s, Jeb Bush
was well on his way to building one in politics. He was a real
estate developer in Miami and for two years served as the Florida
Secretary of Commerce, an appointed post.
</P>
<P>
   After he declared his candidacy for governor in 1994, Bush was
jolted when his brother unexpectedly jumped into the race for
governor of Texas. Jeb Bush, unable to hide his consternation,
groused that it would trivialize his campaign by turning it into a
``cute People magazine story.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even their mother, thought George Bush had a chance
to topple Ann Richards, fiery incumbent in Texas, and his triumph
stunned the political establishment. But Jeb Bush was the loser:
Gov. Lawton Chiles beat him by fewer than 2 percentage points. Four
years after that initial run as a self described ``head-banging
conservative,'' Bush softened his oratory and easily beat Buddy
MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not lost the first time, Jeb Bush might well be the
Republican presidential hopeful, or, at least, a hot prospect for
the second slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly would have been on a short list,'' said Gov.
Christie Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, if his brother is elected, Bush will find himself
precluded from fulfilling any aspirations for national office for
four, or perhaps even eight years. In fact, win or lose, the public
may have had enough of the Bush family to endure a second son
running for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly doesn't see himself as stuck,'' Whitman said. ``I
don't think he has regrets _ but he might if his brother isn't
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush puts it this way: ``George is the right person at the
right time.'' But he said his brother's success was more than
``plankton responding to heat and light.'' He said his brother
benefited from his ``good naturedness'' and his aggressive
campaigning after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejects the what-if? speculation. He gushes so much about
how he is ``blessed'' to be governor (he said he ``loved'' his job
at least six times in the interview) that he is either quite happy
or overcompensating for the political dead-end his brother has
inadvertently created for him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his wisecracking, often charming brother, Jeb Bush is
earnest, quiet and often sticks to himself at gatherings with other
governors. ``Shy would be an appropriate way to describe Jeb
personally,'' said Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Jeb Bush's tenure has been enthusiastically received by
Republicans and even many Democrats. His first year went
particularly well, and he got on swimmingly with the
Republican-controlled legislature. He presided over a major
overhaul of the public education system and the two largest tax
cuts in state history.
</P>
<P>
   By last November, things turned rocky after Bush sought to head
off a controversial ballot measure with his own proposal, the One
Florida initiative, to end racial preferences in university
admissions and some public contracts. The reaction was swift and
largely negative. In January, two black lawmakers staged a sit-in
in Bush's offices, drawing a clutch of cameras.That prompted the
governor, in rather graphic language, to bark to an aide to have
the reporters removed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation worsened two weeks later at a forum in Miami on
Bush's proposal. The governor sat in the front row for hours as
speaker after speaker savaged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low point probably was the hearing in Miami; 2,000 people
shouting ugly things about me,'' Bush recalled. ``What I concluded
was that the things that were being said were not particularly
rational. It was raw emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is haunted by that period, he did not betray that in the
interview. In fact, he took a reporter on a tour of where the
sit-in occurred. ``I regret losing my temper,'' he said. But he
said he stood by the One Florida initiative because it had already
resulted in more minorities' attending public universities in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a `D' by my name,'' he said, ``all the partisans
would say, `fantastic.' The fact that I'm a Republican is possibly
threatening to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The firestorm seems to have subsided. While Democrats vow to
invoke the initiative to mobilize black voters in November to back
Vice President Al Gore, polls show that the governor remains quite
popular. A survey of likely Florida voters conducted June 23-26 by
Mason-Dixon Polling and Research found that the governor's approval
rating stood at 63 percent, the highest of any Florida governor
since Bob Graham's final summer as governor in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush is so focused on Florida that the one hint of his
brother's campaign is displayed on the bottom shelf of one cabinet:
a commemorative Texas license plate that proclaims, ``G.W. Bush,
for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intense focus on Florida, Bush does offer his
brother counsel now and then. Most recently, he said he urged him
``to address elder issues and he'll do more of that.'' He added,
``They easily fall prey to scare tactics and I'm convinced that
Gore, when confronted with the realities of where he is, will
resort to fear.''

 TALLAHASSEE, Fla.: to fear. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like any successful siblings, there is a competition edge
between the two. Yet if Jeb Bush harbors any jealousy, he does his
best to suppress it. Playfully, he lets it be known that his more
famous brother is not above appropriating his ideas. In the 1994
campaign, one of Jeb Bush's favorite lines was that he was running
not because he was George and Barbara's son, but because of his own
children's futures. ``He stole it lock, stock and barrel,'' said
Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he said George Bush picked up his idea of
offering school vouchers, or state scholarships, to students in
schools where high percentages are not performing well.
</P>
<P>
   And when the two appeared at a news conference in Plant City,
Fla., in March, George Bush said he might consider reducing the gas
tax. Then Jeb Bush piped in with an eloquent explanation for why he
did not think that was wise because it would take away much needed
money for highways. George Bush later relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said one of the problems with reducing the gas tax in
Washington is states like Texas and Florida have to make
adjustments in their road construction programs because in our
state we have real congested roads,'' he said. ``I should have kept
my mouth shut. But he acknowledged it was a good point.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, Jeb Bush said he had learned from his brother, to the
point that he emulated him. ``I've tried to steal the very formula
that made him successful,'' he said. ``To have a clear agenda. To
let the world know what it is. And then do what you said you were
going to do. It's so easy to do the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jeb Bush is shunning the national stage, George P., the
eldest son of the governor, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba, are
filling the void in his own way. At 24, he has a poise and good
looks that have made him something of a sensation on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his visitor had not seen George P.'s television
commercials for his uncle in which he appeals to Latinos and
Generation X-ers, Jeb Bush grabbed a videotape, bounded into his
chief of staff's office, and seemed on the verge of tears as he
proudly showed off his son.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not even disapproving of his son posing in bed for
photographers at People magazine, where he made the list of 100 (he
ranked 4th) most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush is well aware that there could be ``missed
opportunities,'' but seems resigned to leaving the big stage to his
brother and son. Asked why he had is retreating to the sidelines at
the convention, Jeb Bush said, ``I'll yield my time to George P.''

TAKING THE KIDS

<P>
   Disney's `The Kid'
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin, Jean
Smart &QL; 
Directed by Jon Turteltaub
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 101 minutes
</P>
<P>
   As an ``image consultant,'' Russ Duritz (Willis) makes a lot of
money telling entrepreneurs to lose the beard if they want to make
the front page of The Wall Street Journal. As a person, he prides
himself on arrogant aloofness and is called a jerk four times a
day. That bothers the chubby little boy (Spencer Breslin) who
suddenly materializes inside Duritz's Hollywood compound.
</P>
<P>
   On first sight of him Russ orders the security turned up to
electrocution level. Shortly afterward, however, he finds Kid, as
Duritz dubs him, munching popcorn in front of his television set.
After the consternation subsides, both make a discovery. Kid is
really Russ Duritz when he was about to turn 8, and he is there to
find out what has gone so wrong in Russ' life that he's about to
turn 40 loveless, childless and (here's the crusher) dogless.
</P>
<P>
   More or less the same question plagues Amy (Mortimer), Russ'
attractive assistant. She and Kid make friends; in fact, Kid,
realizing the opportunity his older self is wasting, actually
proposes to Amy.
</P>
<P>
   But Russ goes on spurning everybody, especially Kid. In boyhood
Rusty, as he was called, was a bit of a klutz, with social troubles
in school and a father who relentlessly applied pressure. Regarding
his childhood self as a loser, Russ doesn't want any part of the
little boy in him now. ``Russ, we have to change,'' says Kid.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 _ Kid gets some pretty rough emotional treatment at
times, and this could distress young children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9 AND UP _ Willis has already had one spectacularly
successful collaboration with a child character in ``The Sixth
Sense.'' Here the boy's relation to the man is cuter and more
manipulative, and the film, while exploring childhood stress and
exhorting family values, lacks the same kind of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Storm
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, William Fichtner, Karen Allen, Allen Payne, Bob
Gunton, John C. Reilly
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Wolfgang Petersen
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 150 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be a triple-header,'' says Linda Greenlaw (Mastrantonio)
over the radio to the sword-boat skipper Billy Tyne (Clooney). With
the swordfish scarce and scrawny on the Grand Banks, Billy has
headed the 90-foot Andrea Gail east toward a dangerous but more
fish-filled area called the Flemish Cap. Heading toward Billy are a
combination of weather conditions ranked in the ``oh, my God''
category.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Hurricane Grace out in the Atlantic. Descending
from Canada is a cold front, and off Nova Scotia another
disturbance is waiting to merge with the other two. ``A disaster of
epic proportions,'' says an excited weatherman, practically
climbing into his computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Digital effects churn the seas into black cliffs. A huge
container ship staggers in mountainous swells, spraying tons of
cargo from its decks. A sailboat with three people aboard rolls
completely over and rights itself, the crew sputtering and yelling
mayday. A rescue helicopter falls into the maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   On the Andrea Gail, still north of major trouble, the crewman
Bobby Shatford (Wahlberg) is starting to get a bad feeling. A shark
washes on deck and chomps his leg. A rogue wave nearly flips the
boat. Fishermen are tossed overboard. When the ice compressor
breaks, Billy swings around and heads back for Gloucester, their
Massachusetts port.
</P>
<P>
   By then they are in the teeth of a once-in-100-years storm.
Billy turns again and tries to run before a following sea. But the
ocean, whipped several ways at once, is back-watering, so to speak,
and the waves are coming from everywhere. The Andrea Gail is
seaworthy, but it can't go vertical.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ There are some nasty accidents, and everybody gets
mugged by the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Back in Gloucester, where the women wait, there are
suggestive situations.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ The talk is salty.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 _ It gets scary on the water. Parents have been sighted
fleeing theaters with very small children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 _ Put on the life vests, but most viewers should ride
it out. The not exactly scintillating preliminaries setting up the
story will claim more victims than the storm.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP _ Beyond big waves this isn't a film with much
appeal for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle
</P>
<P>
   Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Robert De Niro, Randy Quaid,
Janeane Garofalo, Piper Perabo and the voices of June Foray and
Keith Scott
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Des McAnuff
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Lyndon Johnson won in a walk, and ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' cartoons spread their goofy charm on the tube. Now,
though, residual checks for the squirrel and the moose have shrunk
to 3 and a half cents, and their hometown, Frostbite Falls, Minn.,
is a melting ruin. A trip to Washington seems to be in order _ for
what neither of them is sure _ and off they go at about the same
time their old Cold War foes from Pottsylvania, Fearless Leader,
Boris and Natasha, are springing themselves from cartoonland
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Having tricked a television executive (Garofalo), the three jump
out of a television set and become human. Fearless Leader (De Niro
with dueling scars and a greased-down skull-cap hairdo) plans to
take over the United States by turning the populace into zombies
with very bad television. (What else is new?)
</P>
<P>
   A cherubic FBI agent, Karen Sympathy (Perabo), is sent to
squelch the scheme. Hooked on ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' reruns
during her formative years, she enlists them for the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Fearless Leader counters by assigning Boris (Alexander) and
Natasha (Russo) to get rid of all opposition. After a cross-country
chase they fetch up in New York, where a 6-foot-7-inch talking
moose wouldn't get a glance anyway, let alone with the whole city
zombified.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ The live-action figures try some cartoon-style
mayhem, but to little lasting effect. For Rocky and Bullwinkle the
problem is that as their old cartoon selves in a live-action world,
they really do go splat falling from heights. Don't worry: they
recover as ever.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ A modicum.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 _ With cameo appearances by John Goodman, Billy
Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Winters, the film seems as
geared to baby boomers who doted on Rocky and Bullwinkle in the
'60s as it is to current little ones. Still, there's nothing more
cartoonish than an upright moose and a flying squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10 AND UP _ The film is neither here nor there for older
children. Many of the live characters are too old and far removed,
and much of the dialogue falls flat.

SENATE REJECTS EFFORT TO SUSPEND FEDERAL GASOLINE TAX

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly against
suspending the federal gasoline tax through the November election,
calling the measure a calibrated attempt to cozy up to voters at
the expense of the nation's roads and highways.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment required that 60 senators vote to bypass the law
governing the nation's budget. But it was defeated when only 40
senators agreed to waive the law. An additional 59 voted against
waiving the budget law, including 15 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cries from voters for relief from record-high gasoline
prices, opponents denounced the measure on Thursday, saying it
would conveniently suspend 18.3-cents-a-gallon of the federal gas
tax for 150 days, or until after the November elections, and then
re-institute it. What's more, the measure, attached to a bill that
would reduce inheritance taxes, could imperil favorite road,
highway, bridge and safety projects, opponents asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really in some sense a disingenuous amendment,'' said
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ``It would make Tammany Hall blush. It
purports to lower taxes before an election and then increase taxes
right after the election. I tell you. Is that what the American
public wants us to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was put forward by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
who is in a close re-election race, and several other senators from
the Midwest, the region that has been hardest hit by increasing
gasoline prices. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from
oil-rich Texas, also co-sponsored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks motorists have expressed outrage over high prices at
the pump, turning the increases into a touchy political issue.
Lawmakers have scrambled to appease motorists and assign blame, and
several states went so far as to suspend their own gasoline taxes
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential
nominee, tried to capitalize on the issue by painting his likely
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as a lackey for the oil
industry, which has profited from high gas prices. Bush, in turn,
has accused Gore and the Clinton administration of failing to
devise a coherent domestic energy policy and relying too much on
foreign oil. Last month, Gore laid out a plan to reduce dependence
on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation, at
President Clinton's behest, to determine why gas prices climbed so
high and whether oil companies were engaged in price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say gas prices have spiked for a number of reasons:
Past decreases in oil production from oil-producing countries,
pipeline disruptions, shortages at refineries and new rules on
clean-burning fuel have all contributed to the increase.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking several weeks ago, the price of gas is now
falling. Regular gasoline averages $1.59 a gallon both nationally
and in the Midwest, down from average highs of $1.68 nationally and
$1.87 in the Midwest. When prices spiked to that $1.68 figure, they
were nearly 44 percent higher than last summer's average.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producing countries remain reluctant to support Saudi
Arabia's proposal to increase output to send oil prices back to $25
a barrel from the current level of around $30. OPEC nations did
raise output quotas on July 1, but the additional production goals
proposed by Saudi Arabia were criticized by other OPEC members, who
describe current prices as reasonable and supply as sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   While gas prices in the Midwest have eased in the past two
weeks, Abraham said they are still much higher than they were last
year. Mothers with mini-vans, farmers and truckers, some of whom
have lost jobs because they could not afford the gas, deserve
immediate relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one thing we can do in the Congress to bring down the
price of gas and bring it down immediately,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the opponents of the amendment said a suspension of the
federal gasoline tax would mean an estimated $12 billion loss for
the Highway Trust Fund, which provides vital chunks of money to
build highways, fix roads and maintain safety. Many state and local
leaders also opposed the measure, fearing an interruption in their
own transportation planning. There are also some who make an
economic argument against cutting the price of gasoline, saying it
would only encourage consumers to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and others sought to allay those concerns, saying the
$12 billion would be replenished by money from the budget surplus
that is not reserved for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the highway trust fund were going to be affected at all, I
would not be a sponsor of this amendment,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators disagreed with her assessment. ``It would, over
the long run, put at risk billions of dollars of necessary
investment in our nation's highway infrastructure, while providing
absolutely no guarantee that the consumer will see even one penny
of this tax reduction at the gas pump,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, the
ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, who called the
measure ``nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering conventional wisdom, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
said that gasoline prices were not high. In fact, taking inflation
into account, motorists are paying one-third less today than they
were in 1981. ``We are not paying more for gasoline,'' he said.
``We are paying less for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal gasoline tax is actually 18.4 cents per gallon, but
Abraham's amendment protected the .1 cent earmarked for underground
fuel storage.

THE GETTY'S NEWEST OLD MASTER; SALE OF THE CONTENTS OF MERCER HOUSE
IN SAVANNAH; APPOINTMENTS AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART AND THE
HIRSHHORN MUSEUM;   A RESIGNATION AT SOTHEBY'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Ga., Ill., England)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles had its eye on several
paintings at the old master auctions in London last week. It ended
up buying an El Greco.
</P>
<P>
   Four bidders at Sotheby's on July 6 fought over ``Christ on the
Cross,'' a haunting image of Jesus set against a dark background of
swirling clouds. The Getty ended up buying it for $5.8 million, a
record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts thought the museum paid too much, Scott
Schaefer, the Getty's curator of paintings, said he believed the
work was ``the best version of that composition and entirely by the
artist.'' The painting is also ``the first important El Greco to
enter the collection of a Los Angeles museum,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Few paintings can be attributed to El Greco with certainty, and
when Sotheby's had the painting cleaned before it went up for sale,
his signature became clearly visible at the foot of the cross. The
painting also relates closely to others by him, especially in the
manner in which he painted Jesus' attenuated body hanging from the
cross with his head and his eyes looking toward heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer bid by telephone to George Wachter, director of old
master paintings for Sotheby's worldwide. For a museum to bid
through an auction house executive is rare. Most museums ask a
dealer to bid for them and try to keep their interest secret,
fearing that if word gets out, collectors will be even more eager
to buy the work, increasing not only the competition but also the
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We choose to bid in different ways,'' said Schaefer, who
worked for Wachter at Sotheby's in New York before joining the
Getty. His museum also bid on de Troy's ``Retour de Bal,'' which
was up for sale at Phillips on July 4. The painting ended up
selling to Konrad O. Bernheimer, a London dealer, for $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Getty did not bid higher for the de Troy, Schaefer
said, ``The problem when a museum buys at auction is that we have
to get approval on the price in advance.'' In this case, he added,
he did not think the painting was worth the selling price.
</P>
<P>
   SALE IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD ...
</P>
<P>
   Those who read ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' or
saw the movie will remember Mercer House, the 19th-century
Italianate mansion in the heart of Savannah, Ga. The house, which
fills a city block, was built for Hugh Mercer, a Civil War general
who settled in Savannah in 1835 and was a great-grandfather of the
songwriter Johnny Mercer. It was also the scene of the 1981
shooting of 21-year-old Danny Hansford, the young lover of Jim
Williams, who owned the house then. Williams, who died in 1990, was
an antiques dealer known for his unusual collection.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20 Sotheby's is to auction the contents of Mercer House
in a sale that will range from English furniture and export
porcelain to a marble bust of King Edward VII and a sword said to
have been owned by Napoleon II. Sotheby's estimates the sale will
total more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is low, in part because of the objets' decorative
nature and in part because the auction house tends to undervalue
objects in house sales purposely. But that isn't stopping Sotheby's
from treating this as a celebrity sale. As the auction house did
for the four-day sale of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate in
1996 or the 1998 auction of the contents of the Paris villa that
once belonged to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, it will recreate
the rooms in Mercer House in its York Avenue galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Southern gentleman's view of the Grand Tour,'' said
Ronald D. Varney, a senior vice president in Sotheby's trusts and
estates department. The Southern gentleman was Williams, who was
tried four times in Hansford's murder and ultimately acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``His taste was showy, but he had a good eye,'' said John
Berendt, author of ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''
``He went for objects with a noble if not royal provenance.''

   Williams left the house and its contents to his mother, who left
it to her daughter, Dorothy Williams Kingery. (All Williams had
left his sister in his will was $10, his papers and the rights to
``Psycho Dice,'' a game he invented.) But now that Kingery owns the
house and its contents, she has decided to keep some things for
herself, including an oil sketch by John Singer Sargent that was
estimated at $125,000 to $175,000 when it was was originally listed
with the objects Sotheby's was planning to sell. (People in
Savannah familiar with the work say they believe it was withdrawn
from the sale over a question of authenticity.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are still many curiosities left for Sotheby's to
auction. Among the highlights is the 19th-century Yusupov Dagger,
mounted in silver gilt and turquoise, thought to have been worn and
used in the assassination of the Russian monk Rasputin. Williams
bought the dagger at auction at Sotheby's in 1987 for $15,400,
nearly twice its high estimate of $8,000. This time Sotheby's
experts have not decided on an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale is a leather desk folio, mounted on silver gilt
and enamel, with the monogram ``N II,'' made for Czar Nicholas II.
Williams bought the folio at Sotheby's in 1979 for $16,500. Today
it is estimated at $20,000 to $30,000. An ormolu armorial coach
fitting dating from 1810, used for Napoleon's coronation in 1804,
will also be auctioned. One of a pair (the other is in the
Philadelphia Atheneum), it is expected to fetch $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year Mercer House has been on the market through
Sotheby's International Realty and Cora Bett Thomas Realty. The
price was $8.95 million, but it has been reduced to about $7
million, Varney said.

   ADD TWO IN WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Two Washington museums announced appointments this week.
Elizabeth Cropper will become dean of the Center for Advanced Study
in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art. Cropper,
professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University, is replacing
Henry A. Millon, who will retire in December.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Brougher, director of the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford,
England, has been named chief curator of the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian Institution. He succeeds Neal
Benezra, who left the Hirshhorn in January to become deputy
director and curator of modern and contemporary art at the Art
Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   SUBTRACT ONE AT SOTHEBY'S
</P>
<P>
   The number of veterans leaving Sotheby's keeps growing. The
latest is Katherine Ross, who has been at the auction house for 16
years, most recently as a senior vice president and director of
museum services in New York. She has been named senior vice
president for public relations and communications at Prada, the
fashion company, where she will oversee publicity and special
events.

BUSH IS MUM ON CHOOSING RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that his
campaign had begun ``serious vetting'' of the financial and medical
records of the top candidates to be his running mate, and he said
he did not intend to run the finalists through a public interview
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something I can do to bring some order and privacy to
the process,'' Bush told reporters on his campaign plane. ``It
doesn't suit my style to say, `Hey, so and so's coming in,' and
have the person have to walk through a bunch of reporters to have
the discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said only his wife and Dick Cheney, the former congressman
at the head of his search process, knew his thinking on the issue.
He said he had learned the dangers of being too public from
watching his father select Dan Quayle. He said that since
``everybody knew'' who was on George Bush's short list, it was easy
for Quayle's selection to leak out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican National Convention little more than two
weeks away, speculation has been mounting and Bush received a
barrage of questions at a news conference here on whether he would
select Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who was at his side. ``I'm
not telling you,'' he replied. Many Republicans believe Ridge's
choice is unlikely because his support for abortion rights would
create a storm among conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had some rare praise for his opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, naming him, along with Walter Mondale, Quayle and his own
father as recent vice presidents who had all served their
presidents well.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them have been very good vice presidents,'' he said.
``All of them were assigned specific tasks. All of them gave
counsel to their presidents and all of them did a very good job at
keeping their counsel private.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also said that Gore was a forceful debater.
But Bush was soon back to jabbing at Gore over his campaign style
and fighting with him over the state of the Texas budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also unveiled a proposal for a $75 million five-year
program of grants to community groups to use veterans as mentors
and role models in programs for children.

ART REVIEW: THE SOUL OF A CULTURE GLEAMS FROM COUNTLESS BEADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A diaspora is a many-leveled thing, for the simple
reason that people never travel light. No matter how meager their
physical possessions, they carry beliefs, traditions,
sensibilities, ways of talking, thinking, seeing and doing, all in
their heads. Wherever they arrive, things are never the same:
Sooner or later there are modulations, great or small, in local
habits of clothing, religion, diet and art and much else. Something
new has been added.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, one of the world's great beneficiaries of
diasporas, this process is everywhere visible. We move through it
daily in a diffuse, taken-for-granted, way. In a subway ride, a
change of blocks or boroughs, even a walk around a corner, it is
possible to dip into another culture, a different way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it never hurts to see the rhythms of this process in
isolation, especially when they are traced through the migration of
an entrancing, universally loved artistic form and presented in
visually dazzling terms. This is the achievement of ``Beads, Body
and Soul: Art and Light in the Yoruba Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, as opulent as it is edifying, follows the migration of
one people's beading tradition, and the religious beliefs it
reflects, from Africa to various parts of the Americas. Originally
organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at UCLA, this
effort is now split between two of New York's smaller, more
innovative arts institutions: The Museum for African Art in SoHo
and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba people are not alone in attributing spiritual power
and religious meaning to beads or in grasping their visual and
decorative potential. But they may be somewhat unusual in doing
both at the same time. And this double intensity helps explain why
their use of beads, and the immense faith they have in them,
survived the devastations and dispersals of the slave trade to
flourish in the Americas, especially in Brazil and Cuba, where
Yoruba descendants are most plentiful, and in New York, which has
sizable populations of Afro-Cubans and Afro-Brazilians as well as
African-Americans of Yoruba descent.
</P>
<P>
   Yoruba beading, its sources, techniques, meanings and
permutations in this hemisphere, form a rich, complex subject, as
this show's lavishly illustrated, multischolar catalog suggests. It
is an implicitly hybrid art. An indigenous bead language using
oil-palm seeds and kernels, carved wood beads and especially cowrie
shells (still the aristocrat of Yoruba beads) was irrevocably
expanded when Europeans began taking tiny pierced bits of glass and
ceramic to Africa as early as the 15th century.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a pervasive art: Yorubans have made necklaces,
bracelets and bead-covered objects central to both religious and
daily life, to expressions of faith and social rank. The beads'
pure colors heightened the chromatic symbolism of the Yoruba
religious cosmos with its hierarchies of spirits, ancestors and
gods, or orisa, each distinguished by specific hues. Beads adorn
the ritual objects and regalia of those gods' earthly
representatives: Kings and queens, priests, diviners and healers.
The one-by-one equality of stringed beads is seen as a reflecting
the consensus-oriented Yoruba social structure. The word for bead
reoccurs in their language, in metaphors for riches of all kinds:
Children, wealth, solidarity and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The journey plotted by this exhibition begins at the Museum for
African Art, with displays of necklaces and objects using
indigenous beads: Necklaces of palm-oil seeds, a small shrine
dangling heavy strands of cowrie shells. Especially notable are
three small wood figures of Esu-Elegba, the god who mediates the
threshold between the mortal and the spirit worlds, festooned with
strands of lustrous kernels, cowries and carved wood amulets.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition first proceeds by deity. There are beaded sword
sheaths associated with Ogun, god of iron and warfare; a staff for
Orisa Oko, the god of agriculture, its tall beaded sheath decorated
with sculptures of women; a wonderful fat puppet for Sanyin, the
god of healing.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the introduction of brighter color made
possible what might be called portable mosaics, objects whose
colored images and rich patterns radiate joy, order and reverence
as surely as anything at Ravenna. It also seems to have made
possible the development of a pictorial, two-dimensional language
equal to but different from the sculptural tradition already in
place. Among the exhibition's most engaging objects are several
pairs of Ibeji, or sacred twins, small carved wood figures whose
little beaded tunics gleam with geometric patterns and images.
These are grouped near an extraordinary full-sized tunic, whose
surfaces, worked and reworked with beads and cowries, resembles a
lovingly tended shrine.
</P>
<P>
   One sees the mingling of cultures on all sides. A king's regalia
include a beaded chair whose floral patterns might be English and a
gown beaded in gold, white and blue whose spiraling forms can also
be found on Islamic tiles. (The surface includes the date of
coronation date, 1934). Across the way, some beaded crowns and
coronets borrow the forms of a bishop's miter and an British
barrister's wig. Others, more indigenous, are dramatically
sculptural conical crowns whose beaded surfaces are decorated with
schematic faces and topped with beaded birds and other animals. A
group of ``House of the Head'' shrines, containing the small beaded
personal pyramids, or ``inner heads,'' which Yoruba people receive
at birth, bristle majestically with cowrie shells.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at the Museum for African Art ends with a display
of the diviner's regalia: beaded tapers, chains, bags and
necklaces, as well as two stunning examples of the elaborate
head-to-toe ensembles worn during Egungun ceremonies, which honor
ancestors. Suggesting a cross between a Muslim chador and something
suitable for a Venetian masked ball, they combine layers of dark
rich fabric with glittering panels and veils of beads.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem, which is
relatively sparse, examines the Yoruba beading and religious
practices in the Americas, where orisa permutated into Santeria in
Cuba and Candomble in Brazil while retaining the same gods. The
show is arranged in a series of altars containing objects made by
contemporary artists, many of whom are also priests.
</P>
<P>
   The altars seem a bit flimsy, partly because, once again, the
objects themselves exude such concentrated power. Nonetheless, Jose
Rodriguez's crown for Oblata, a god of ancient wisdom, which is
rendered in white, silver and blue beading and topped with a bird
riding an elephant, has the radiant perfection of anything in the
downtown show. And one sees new variations on older themes and
forms. In Shona Sloan-Shango Ni Ohun's paintinglike ``Beaded
Portrait Portrait of a Devotee of Orisa Shango,'' includes
depictions of a rattle and conical crown like those displayed
downtown; they belong to a figure who resembles the bead-garbed
twins at the SoHo museum.
</P>
<P>
   Works like these suggest that the beading tradition the Yoruba
people set forth is alive, well and in good hands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Beads, Body and Soul: Art and Light in the Yoruba Universe''
is at the Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston
Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313, through Aug. 27, and at the Studio
Museum in Harlem, 145 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through
Sept. 17.

BUSH SAYS VP PICK MUST BE WILLING TO PLAY 2ND FIDDLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A vice president must be qualified to assume the
nation's top job if necessary, but Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush indicated Thursday that his running mate
also must be a loyal confidant willing to live in the chief
executive's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make certain the person I pick is somebody with whom
I can get along and don't have to be looking over my shoulder or
worrying about my back if I become the president,'' Bush said
Thursday at a news conference in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking earlier in the day with reporters on his campaign
airplane, Bush praised the past four vice presidents _ including
his Democratic rival, Al Gore _ as men who had fulfilled that role.
He said Democrats Walter Mondale and Gore as well as fellow
Republicans Dan Quayle and Bush's own father, former Vice President
and President George Bush, had served loyally.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them were assigned specific tasks, all of them gave
their counsel to the president and all of them did a very good job
of keeping their counsel private,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a vice president who brings a lot of added
value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied a published report that he had narrowed his list to
New York Gov. George Patatki, former GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. But he told
reporters in Pennsylvania that Ridge is still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Others known still to be in the running include U.S. Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio and Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he feels sorry for political reporters who are under
pressure from their editors to break the story on his running mate
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to be in your position where your job
performance is somehow measured on your ability to be first to
figure out what's on my mind,'' said Bush, who said he wants to
announce his choice to the news media and the nation at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned in Pennsylvania and New Jersey on Thursday,
laying out a $75 million proposed program to help pay for military
veterans to serve as mentors and tutors for youth. The money would
be distributed as federal grants to community programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Democratic Party used the visit as an
opportunity to renew questions about whether Bush received
favorable treatment when he was on temporary duty with the Alabama
Air National Guard in 1972 and 1973 while working on a U.S. Senate
campaign. There is no record of Bush actually pulling duty while in
the Alabama guard on a transfer from his Texas guard unit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his service, saying the proof is in the fact that
he was discharged honorably after serving as an F-102 pilot in
Texas. Bush said he served with the Alabama guard but did not fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done what I said I did,'' Bush said. ``I fulfilled my
obligation. I proudly served.''

THE POWER OF PERSONAL POLITICS AT THE SUMMIT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ During President Clinton's seven years in
office, no world leader has journeyed more often to the White House
than Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader has met Clinton there a dozen times, and
his image in Washington _ sitting in a high-backed chair in the
Oval Office, speaking in Arabic on the White House driveway _ has
become almost commonplace. In turn, Clinton took the risky gesture
of being the first American president to visit Arafat on his home
turf in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, as the Camp David summit meeting proceeds,
the White House will see whether that investment can be made to pay
in a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes that personalities and relationships can
fundamentally alter history. According to his aides, he is banking
on his affinity with Arafat, and with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel, to make a crucial difference at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the summit meeting could well depend, they say,
on whether the president's personal chemistry can help overcome
obstacles of history and the calculus of political survival
embedded in these high-stake negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his aides like to point out, has come wholly prepared
on substance _ so much so that he joked the other night that he
could draw a map of the West Bank in his sleep. He has prepped
himself with new briefing books that give the latest positions of
both sides, and pored over historical records from President
Carter's Camp David on the art of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   That Camp David meeting in 1978 set a tone of informality, which
this one is trying to emulate, but so far neither Mr. Barak nor Mr.
Arafat has yet been spotted riding a golf cart, the favored mode of
transport there, with the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton greeted Arafat warmly on their first morning
together, and asked whether his accommodation was to his liking.
``I hope you are comfortable,'' Clinton was reported by one of his
aides to have said of Birch cabin assigned to the Palestinian
leader. ``You are staying in the cabin where my mother used to
stay,''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantries aside, the relationship between Arafat and Clinton
took on a new significance as the summit meeting got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an Israeli prime minister who was likely to argue
that he needed concessions because of his political fragility at
home, Arafat was viewed as sure to stiffen his resolve not to cave
to Israeli demands, a senior Clinton administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect it raises his level of concern that he will be the
one asked to produce,'' the official said in describing Arafat's
reaction to Barak's narrow victory of a no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would underscore that Barak was ``taking the political
heat because of the positions he was prepared to take,'' and
therefore was the best Israeli leader Arafat could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between Clinton and Arafat has grown over time,
to the point where there is considerable warmth, trust and candor
though hardly chumminess, say those who have watched it. ``Arafat
is not an easy guy to understand because of who he is and where he
has been,'' said one of Clinton's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, their relationship has solidified. The turning point
was the peace conference at Wye, Md., in 1997 where Clinton stood
up for Arafat against the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, according to several participants.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion at Wye, Netanyahu said something that was heard
as insulting to Arafat. Clinton got up from his chair, walked away
and then returned, saying, in effect, to the Israeli: ``I'm not
going to tolerate this,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wye conference, Clinton agreed to go to Gaza, where he
spoke to the Palestinian leadership about removing the idea of
Israel's destruction from their charter. That trip cemented the
link, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Arafat, `Did you believe the American president
would visit the Middle East and the only one he would see was the
leader of the Palestinians?' '' said another senior administration
official. ``The look on Arafat's face meant how far he had come in
his relations with an American president.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton's relationship with Barak is freshly
minted.
</P>
<P>
   They first met nearly a year ago, when the newly elected prime
minister came to Washington for a get-to-know-you session. They
knew each other from mutual colleagues: some of Clinton's political
advisers and pollsters advised Barak on his successful campaign to
convert himself from soldier to prime minister. The president
showed the prime minister an unusual courtesy _ a night at Camp
David. According to an account by Clinton, they hit it off, talking
about politics and war and their mutual respect for Yitzak Rabin,
the Israeli prime pinister who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will probably use this relationship with Barak in a
different way from his dealings with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation about the need for a strong American
role in striking an agreement with the Palestinians, Barak has
swung the other way. At a meeting in Madrid last month with
Clinton, followed by frequent phone contact, the Israeli prime
minister lobbied hard for this summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, according to his aides, has come to the conclusion that
despite Clinton's lameduck status, this was the moment to shoot for
an accord with the Palestinians, an accord that Barak says he was
elected to make. Barak did not want to wait for another
administration and, therefore, another year of waiting before new
officials in Washington were up-to-speed on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this is one of the few areas in which Clinton's few
remaining months in office creates no particular disadvantage. His
power as a mediator starts with the United States' unique position
as the only nation that could possibly convene this talks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's chores will be to convince Barak that even in a
weakened political situation, ``an extremely painful deal is better
than no deal,'' an experienced Middle East negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   By some calculations, Barak, having put his political life on
the line over a peace deal with Arafat, cannot go home without one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might add to his argument by pointing out that he had
faced extraordinary personal and political crises during his second
term, and had survived by staying the course, the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the personal relationships that Clinton has
established may be important but not enough to seal a deal. ``If,
at the core, the political will is not there, it's difficult to
come up with the kind of creative fixes needed,'' one of Clinton's
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Samuel W. Lewis, who urged
Clinton to call the summit meeting, noted personal chemistry did
not count for a lot at President Carter's Camp David.
</P>

GORE GETS LONG-AWAITED ENDORSEMENT FROM BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Bill Bradley, once a bitter rival of Al Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination, enthusiastically
endorsed the vice president Thursday, providing a shot of momentum
that Gore believes will pay rich dividends in tossup states like
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second public appearance since dropping out of the
Democratic race in March and his first with Gore, Bradley gave Gore
his biggest wish _ a strong, unequivocal endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect his judgement and have an interest in his thoughts
and recommendations,'' Gore said in an interview after the rally at
an amusement park on the shore of Green Bay. ``This is a very big
endorsement that will help quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore touched on a variety of issues in the interview, ranging
from patients' bill of rights legislation to the fate of Northwest
salmon. Among his comments:
</P>
<P>
   _On salmon and the possible breaching of Snake River dams: He
believes it is possible to bring various factions together to work
out a solution based on the best science available. ``Extinction is
not an option, nor is economic dislocation.''
</P>
<P>
   _On patients' bill of rights: ``You deserve the best health
care, not just the cheapest,'' he said, repeating a theme made
earlier in his speech. ``I am tired of life and death decisions
being made by HMO accountants and insurance company clerks _ people
at the other end of a telephone line who have no license to
practice medicine, and no right to play God.''
</P>
<P>
   _On entitlement programs: Gore said he would not privatize
Social Security. ``Let's put both Social Security and Medicare in
an off-budget, iron-clad lockbox where politicians can't touch
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he believes his campaign is finally hitting its stride
after months of spotty performances. The turnaround began more than
a month ago, he said, ``but I think it's been especially noticeable
the past three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, he said can be found in changing public attitudes
as well as in a change in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are beginning to look at the importance of
prosperity and progress and why it makes sense to continue it,'' he
said. ``I think I'm doing a little bit better job of communicating
personally. And I think there's a groundswell in the country for
the kind of continued positive change that I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was obviously pleased by Bradley's comments
and his vigorous defense of Gore's policies, even though long
delayed. Bradley's support is important to Gore because it could
keep voters from defecting to Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
Gore aides have become increasingly worried that Nader's appeal
could be particularly strong in states like Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, in his comments, left nothing to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in Green Bay ... because I believe what Vince
Lombardi once said is true. `Winning is a team sport,'''said
Bradley, standing with Gore at the same amusement park pavilion
that Franklin Roosevelt visited in 1934 to promote the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president
of the United States,'' Bradley said to rising applause. ``I
believe that under his leadership we will come closer to solving
the problems I mentioned earlier than under the leadership of Gov.
George Bush. And it's not even a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Bradley's endorsement, Gore effusively praised the
former senator from New Jersey, a stark contrast to the lacerating
attacks he launched during the primaries. The lingering anger over
that treatment is one reason Bradley did not come out sooner for
Gore, Bradley aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treasure Bill Bradley's support,'' Gore told a crowd of
several hundred supporters on a sunny, hot day. ``He is a good
Democrat who speaks and stands for principles we all believe in.
And Bill Bradley will be an important part of this campaign _ and
an important part of America's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, called Gore's appearance with Bradley an
act of desperation that underscored how wobbly his campaign is.
Like Washington state, Wisconsin has been a reliable state for
Democrats in recent elections but is up for grabs this year. Like
Washington state, Wisconsin has five Democrats in the U.S. House
and four Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a lot of good to say about Al Gore,'' Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ``Al Gore still struggles to bring his
party together.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts in the Northwest, however, said Bradley's
support will help Gore. ``Being seen with Bradley is the most
dramatic move he could make,'' said Don Balmer, who teaches
political science at Lewis &AMP; Clark College in Portland. ``There is
no other dominant personality out there. Clinton carried the area,
the economy is good. It's more or less his to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who supported Bradley during the
primaries, agreed. ``I don't think there will be any question but
it will be helpful to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint appearance, McDermott said, draws attention to Gore at
a time when the campaigns ``are in the doldrums. There's not much
happening anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from acknowledging Bradley's support, Gore stuck to the
same themes he's been focusing on for the past two weeks,
attempting to link Bush to special interests such as the gun lobby
and ``big oil'' while touting the economic boom that has occurred
under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore also pointed out budget problems now afflicting
Bush's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials reported Wednesday that the state's budget is
$610 million out of balance. Democrats blamed the shortfall on $1.7
billion in tax cuts pushed by Bush. Bush, however, said the deficit
was caused by unexpected high costs in programs such as Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The news about Texas' budget woes capped one of the Gore
campaign's best weeks in months.
</P>
<P>
   The event in Green Bay marked the next step in a weeklong effort
to link Bush to a Congress controlled by Republicans and beholden
to special interests. In a standard speech delivered throughout the
week, Gore targeted the issues that polls say voters find most
important: education, health care, Social Security and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   And in an indication of how rocky Gore's campaign has been, his
aides were openly pleased that they were able to go an entire week
without being sidetracked by problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore said he is unfazed by many recent polls,
including one in Washington state, that show him trailing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly focus on polls, whether they go up down
or sideways,'' he said. ``The level of real support for the choices
the country has to make will, I think, be affected by Senator
Bradley, by his endorsement, by his presence. I think it will have
an effect on the election. The polls, I don't know.''

A CAST LIST FOR EMPLOYEE PLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By ELAINE S. SILVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rajiv Muradia was ready for a new gig. At 36, with 13 years'
experience as a telecommunications software engineer at Nortel
Networks, he knew he could get another job easily. But he wanted
more than that. He wanted THE job.
</P>
<P>
   He called Erika MacPhee, told her what he had in mind _ a
start-up in a related field with strong management and fewer than
50 employees, where he could make a big difference _ and set her to
work sifting through dozens of potential employers to find him a
good fit.
</P>
<P>
   She did the legwork, set up interviews and guided Muradia
through salary negotiations. In May, he became vice president for
research and development at Coventus, which develops online aids
for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   So she is a talent agent and he is her client, right? Not
exactly.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhee works for Talentlabs, an executive recruiting firm in
Ottawa, and her client is technically Coventus, which pays it a
retainer. But at a time when job offers fall like ripe summer
peaches into the laps of the technologically savvy, who works for
whom in the recruiting and hiring landscape is getting hazy.
</P>
<P>
   An employee with coveted skills may have no trouble finding a
better deal, a better fit or just a fresh challenge. But few have
much time to scope out their next moves. So intermediaries are
plunging in to help _ traditional-style talent agents in some
cases, but also Web sites, career counselors and recruiters like
MacPhee, whose most assiduously cultivated relationships are not
with her corporate clients but with her ``players,''like Muradia,
on whom she lavishes agentlike services.
</P>
<P>
   In fields where agents have long been common, like sports,
entertainment and the arts, the agent-client relationship is
simple: The athlete or singer or author pays the agent's fee, and
the agent's sole duty is to the client. But for untraditional
intermediaries like MacPhee, it gets complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hornby, also 36, was happy in a vice-president post at
Ubiquity Software, which makes Internet-telephony software, when
MacPhee approached him about an opening at Sedona Networks, whose
products manage high-speed links between local networks and the
Internet. ``I talked to Erika about how, if I left, I would be
letting people down,'' he said. ``I was working with a great
team.'' They discussed the Sedona opening, he said, and she agreed
that he would be better off staying put, even though it was in her
client's interest to pry him away.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona asked MacPhee to approach Hornby a second and then a
third time with ever-better offers, and he finally bit on one that
he said would get him close to being set for life. ``Erika was
almost like a counselor to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second vital difference between a traditional agent
and a someone like MacPhee: Recruiters usually don't have exclusive
relationships with their players.
</P>
<P>
   David Robertson, a scientist working on drugs for neurological
diseases, checks in regularly with several recruiters. ``They are
the glue in the industry,'' Robertson said. He is happy as a vice
president for research in central nervous system medicine at
Pharmacia, in Kalamazoo, Mich., he said, but it is important to
stay plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason that recruiting firms want to cement
relationships with sought-after workers by acting more like agents,
said Peter Uber, a specialist in human resources management for
Towers Perrin, the management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional agents are also moving into fields where skilled
people work on project assignments rather than permanent jobs.
Aguent Inc. in Boston represents graphic designers, Webmasters, art
directors and project managers much the way the William Morris
Agency handles movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   After Tom Grace, 23, passed Aguent's vetting process and became
a client, the agency placed him at a pharmaceutical company doing
personal computer support and troubleshooting. He soon switched to
graphic design, and after two years was eager for Web design work.
The agency had him attend a seven-day training program in exchange
for his agreeing to accept assignments only through Aguent for six
months. If he does well, said Betsy Swan, an agent at Aguent, the
agency will place him in progressively more challenging
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Employees on the nonsuperstar rungs of many industries can ask a
less personal kind of intermediary for career-management help:
Employment Web sites like freeagent.com, guru.com and monster.com.
Their main attractions are job listings, but they also offer
services like worker-employer matchmaking and, for freelancers,
help with billing, collection and health insurance, at a monthly
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the new career advisers place people in jobs. When Alma
Derricks' management job was eliminated in a reorganization at The
Los Angeles Times, she called Neal Lenarsky of Strategic
Transitions. ``My job is to figure out a person's passion, so they
can catapult into the next several levels,'' Lenarsky said. A
personal inventory helped Derricks consider new possibilities, and
she found an e-commerce job at the Scient Corp. ``Neal helped me
evaluate the job and helped me see it had breadth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the table, personnel executives at major
technology companies said that on the whole, the trend toward
employees using career advisers is positive for employers, because
employees are more likely to be satisfied in a new job afterward.
But one human resources executive expressed worry that some people
jumping into the field lacked appropriate qualifications. ``I have
to trust that the candidate did that homework,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a world where fewer and fewer people expect to stick
around for the gold watch, and where opportunity doesn't knock, but
just briefly honks the horn, many people feel a need for guidance
and support, whether from an agent, lawyer, career coach or
recruiter. Rajiv Muradia is quite pleased in the fast-paced
start-up Erika MacPhee helped him find _ but he still keeps in
touch with her, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S WHO
</P>
<P>
   TALENT AGENTS _ Although formerly common only in sports,
entertainment and the arts, a few agents now represent people in
other in-demand professions, lining up assignments, planning career
strategy and sometimes handling negotiations. Agents are hired and
paid by the represented employee (by flat fee or a percentage of
earnings)
</P>
<P>
   CAREER COACHES _ These are consultants who help their clients
plan career goals and polish job-seeking and networking skills with
recruiters. They are generally hired by the employee and paid by
the hour.
</P>
<P>
   OUTPLACEMENT CONSULTANTS _ Offering services like those of
career coaches, these consultants are hired by companies to help
laid-off employees find work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE RECRUITERS _ Generally paid by companies to fill
openings, many now try to build long-term relationships with people
they recruit by providing agentlike services. They may be paid a
flat fee or a contingency fee based on the salary of the position.
</P>
<P>
   STAFFING AGENCIES _ These firms advertise openings and screen
candidates on employers' behalf for permanent or temporary jobs.
They are generally paid a fee by the employer. Some specialize in
technical fields or short-term executive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   JOB WEB SITES _ These databases of job openings and resumes also
offer services like matching of workers and assignments.

SORTING OUT THE SEALS OF APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By AMY ZUCKERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Rice, a psychiatrist in Northampton, Mass., knows a lot
about healing but not much about electronic components. So when he
went shopping for a CD player recently, he was swayed by a salesman
stressing that one model was ``ISO 9000 certified.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean, exactly? Rice said he didn't know, but it
sounded impressive. The salesman, he said, vaguely intimated that
it was an international seal of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Rice didn't get a lemon _ the store sold him a reputable brand
with a solid warranty. But ISO 9000 had nothing to do with it. And
it is just one of a flock of symbols, squiggles, seals and
certifications popping up on consumer products that leave many
shoppers baffled.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer might find ISO 9000 mentioned on most anything from a
transistor radio to extra-virgin olive oil. But it refers to an
international standard that has nothing directly to do with the
product's quality, only with how well the company monitors its
manufacturing process to ensure consistency. Critics of the
standard's use in marketing say that someone could turn out
cast-iron life preservers and still qualify, as long as they were
all made exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of ``ISO 9000'' on labels is just one way that
arcane international standards for product testing and
certification are seeping sideways into retail marketing. With
goods from all corners of the globe, often bearing unfamiliar brand
names, confronting consumers, manufacturers turn to test marks and
certifications to help consumers evaluate the safety and quality of
what they buy. And anything that smacks of quality, however
indirectly, is bound to be used for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test marks exist for two basic purposes: to satisfy government
regulations on the local, state, or national levels, or provide
additional consumer product assurance,'' said John Donaldson, a
vice president of the American National Standards Institute, the
umbrella group that represents American industry in global
standard-setting forums. Industry leaders and standards experts
concur that many standards, including ISO 9000, are meaningful to
manufacturers and purchasing agents but of little use to shoppers
like Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast such marks with the familiar UL label. Underwriters
Laboratories, an independent testing organization based in Chicago,
awards it when electrical products submitted by manufacturers pass
safety tests. According to his institute's surveys, Donaldson said,
UL is among the most widely recognized safety seals in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as ubiquitous, but far less understood, is the CE mark.
It represents a declaration by a manufacturer that its products
satisfy the European Union's health, safety and environmental
standards. Without it, a product cannot readily be imported or sold
in much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   American manufacturers have complained that the CE mark is a
trade barrier, intended mainly to make competing in Europe more
expensive and cumbersome for outsiders. European consumer
organizations doubt that the mark delivers the protection it
implies. There is not even a consensus over which French phrase it
was derived from, Conformite Europeenne or Communaute Europeen;
some officials joke that it really stands for Confusion Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CE mark isn't a product certification mark,'' Donaldson
said, because no independent tests are required to get it; a
manufacturer need only assert that the product meets applicable
standards and take legal responsibility for saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelis Brekelmans, a European Union standards official, said
that the CE mark criteria were established to harmonize regulations
among the union's 15 member nations, not validate products for
consumers, and that meeting them can be just as trying for European
as for foreign manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone regards the trend toward more testing and
certification as a good idea, especially when consumers are the
target. Guido Guertler, director of standardization and regulation
for Siemens, is co-leader of an international industry committee
working to purge the global market of what he says are redundant
test marks (though he would spare some safety labels, like UL and a
German equivalent, VDE). Guertler said consumers should put their
faith in reputable brand names, warranties and service contracts,
not dubious certification.
</P>
<P>
   Similar views are heard from some American experts. ``Consumers,
as long as they operate within the traditional commercial
marketplace in the U.S., do not really need to be concerned with
certification,'' Donaldson said. Other experts say the voluntary
standards promulgated by some industry groups are set low enough
for all members' products to pass, and that endorsements handed out
by specialty publications can simply be a quid pro quo for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, critics say, and the proliferation of logos,
letters, seals and symbols can make for much unhelpful noise.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill King, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's chief
engineer for electrical and fire safety, warned that the absence of
a recognized test symbol on an electrical product is a bad sign. He
cited substandard power strips and cords without UL labels that
entered the country in the late 1990s and were found to pose
serious fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   King said other examples of marks that conveyed important safety
information to consumers internationally include the ETL mark from
Intertek, another independent laboratory, and the FM Approved mark
from Factory Mutual Research, seen on fire alarms and
extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   But what about nonelectric toys, a category of products on which
the CE mark is often prominently displayed? It is not a
``meaningful'' safety indicator, King said; consumers should look
instead for the safety and appropriate-age labels required by
American law.

   WorldCom and Sprint End Their Agreement to Merge
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint officially abandoned their $115 billion
merger, bowing to pressure from regulators, who were concerned that
the creation of such a large telecommunications company would
stifle competition. Far from dampening the outlook for ever-larger
communications concerns, the dissolution of the agreement fueled
speculation about consolidation among large telecommunications
companies, with both WorldCom and Sprint being mentioned as
potential takeover targets for foreign companies. Shares in
WorldCom rose $3.4375, to $47.9375, while shares of Sprint
increased 68.75 cents, to $48.

A PAX IN YOUR HOUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' it'll be Marion Jones,
Olympic maven.
</P>
<P>
   The climatic moment of ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'' will have to
yield to Michael Johnson and Maurice Green.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect Dick Van Dyke on ``Diagnosis Murder'' to have
figured out who the heir to Carl Lewis will be in the men's long
jump.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems a bit of a strange fit having the opening blasts of
the U.S. Olympic Track and Field trials tonight on the Pax Network,
it's understandable. This is the family-friendly, wholesome-values
channel that causes some viewers to almost use a naughty word as
they try to find its location on the cable box (it's channel 30 on
most), even though it reaches about 80 percent of American TV
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the reason is simple. Late last year, NBC bought a
one-third share of the West Palm Beach, Fla.-based start-up
network. And NBC's coverage of the U.S. Olympic Trials, leading up
to its taped-delayed extravaganza of the Sydney Games in September,
goes along with the co-op.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will do Saturday and Sunday events _ on tape, of course
(live only on the East Coast).
</P>
<P>
   As ESPN does with coverage of the first two rounds of an ABC
golf tournament, Pax has been a constant NBC fallback in Olympic
Trials coverage, starting in early June and continuing with 14
straight Saturday-night packaged shows covering 38 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with the telecast tonight as well as coverage
Monday, Thursday and Friday next week is that Pax goes live from
Cal State Sacramento at 8 p.m., using NBC broadcasters like Tom
Hammond, Carol Lewis, Dwight Stones, Marty Liquori and Jim Gray.
</P>
<P>
   So far, viewer reaction to the unique sports-event coverage on
the otherwise ``Touched by an Angel'' network has been heaven-sent,
drawing ratings similar to that of its usual shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be more wholesome, upbeat and positive than the
U.S. Olympic Trials?'' asked Bill Scott, Pax's president of
programming. ``(Adding this) was an easy decision. It works with
the context of our network philosophy. It's the whole essence of
family-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is basically how NBC is selling the network version of the
Olympic Games _ meaning, even if it's on 24-hour delay, people will
watch what others might stupidly consider a results-driven sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   Live competition is the real coup for Pax, which takes the
production of the show from St. Louis-based Bud Sports in
association with the U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee. But that
also brings up live problems: What if an athlete tests positive for
steroids?
</P>
<P>
   That's not part of the Pax philosophy, but it doesn't mean it's
going to sugarcoat that kind of situation, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family network doesn't mean we don't look at real life,''
Scott said. ``Steroid use is unfortunate and something we don't
dwell on, but if you look at our shows, it's about issues in life,
how they're met and how they're overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Adamle hosts the track shows, but Chris Marlowe and Paul
Sunderland have also hosted Pax Olympic Saturday shows. Marlowe and
Sunderland, the former Olympic volleyball players who built their
careers on beach volleyball telecasts and will do the sport for NBC
from Sydney, call the relationship between Pax and NBC natural and
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked out pretty well,'' said Marlowe, who has been
exposed to track cycling, marathons, white-water canoeing and
kayaking and water polo during the Pax shows. Also for Pax, he and
Sunderland will do the men's U.S.-Brazil volleyball match a week
from Saturday, then the women's U.S.-Germany volleyball match Aug.
5 before heading to Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pax's sports programming won't end with the Trials (which can
also be followed online at www.paxtv.com/olympics or this weekend's
events at www.usatf.org and www.sacsports.com/trails). Pax already
has a deal to carry some opening rounds on the U.S. Senior golf
tour next season and is looking into other NBC-related sports
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Like the XFL? Sure, just as soon as Goldberg resolves a Father
Dowling mystery.
</P>
<P>
   __ They've got more ``Game'': You might have seen St. Louis' Jim
Edmonds recording home video during Tuesday's All-Star Game in
Atlanta, which had NBC broadcasters Bob Costas and Joe Morgan
reminiscing about the brilliant ``When It Was A Game''
documentaries that HBO produced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Costas, who'll have his own HBO sports show this fall, was also
really giving the premium cable channel a well-deserved plug. A
third hour-long installment that covers the major leagues during
the 1960s begins airing Monday night (10 p.m.), completing the
trilogy in outstanding goose-bump fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Rare color home movies of players as far back as the '40s were
the astounding framework of the first two ``When It Was A Game''
productions (which began airing in 1991 and jump-started the TV
sports documentary genre), so to see Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax and
Don Drysdale in all their Technicolor glory this time might not be
as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us tail-end Baby Boomers who grew up loving the
game in that fragile time period, it's as if our memory banks have
been scanned and somehow transferred to the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually more amazin' than the '69 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Liev Schreiber narrates, and master thespian Kevin Costner
is among those voicing over baseball prose. But the comments from
Costas, another one of the contributors, seem to fit best into this
episode, especially his remembrances of baseball cards (an Eli Grba
in the pack next to the stick of gum !ital!does smell the same
today) and how this was the last era when players were so easily
identified with their teams and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The best clips for L.A. fans: Former Angels owner Gene Autry
leading the group of bicycle riders in Palm Springs, high overhead
shots (must have been from the Dodger Stadium reserved level) of
Maury Wills stealing bases, and the recoiling windup of Koufax,
who, as catcher Jeff Torborg says, threw every pitch like it was
his last.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and as for that Edmonds video. Maybe HBO can use it in a
future documentary, a series that will no doubt go with the title
``When It Was A Business.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN re-enters the game-show genre with a new trivia show
developed by Michael Davis, the exec behind ABC's ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire?'' and Andrew Golder, a creator of ``Win Ben Stein's
Money.'' This one, called ``ESPN's 2-Minute Drill,'' won't be
giving away $1 million _ more like sports-related stuff _ when it
launches Monday, Sept. 11. Also, and unfortunately, ESPN
commentators are supposed to be part of the question-asking process
for the show taped before a studio audience in New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Will we see a much hipper Jim Lampley on the HBO broadcast

HOUSE REPUBLICANS STRIKE DEAL ON BILL TO BAN INTERNET GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tentative deal has been reached in the House of
Representatives on a bitterly fought bill to ban most forms of
gambling on the Internet, clearing the way for a floor vote as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill attempts to curb one of the fastest-growing activities
on the Internet, wagering on casino-style games and sporting
events. Industry analysts say there are more than 700 unregulated
wagering sites on the Web, generating more than $1.2 billion
annually in bets, with more sites appearing every day and the
amount wagered doubling annually.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has created a number of odd alliances and has
fattened the bank accounts of some of the most powerful lobbying
and law firms in Washington. Evangelical Christian groups have
lined up with horse track operators and liquor store owners to
support the bill. Republican governors have joined with online
sports bookies and operators of cyber casinos based in Antigua and
Belize to try to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, strongly backed by major sports leagues and the
Nevada gambling industry, is an attempt to halt the rapid growth of
online betting on casino-style games and professional and college
sports by anyone with access to a personal computer, modem and
credit card. The big Nevada casinos have put their money and
considerable lobbying clout behind the bill to try to crush a
competitive threat to their billion-dollar desert palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., engineered the
compromise with fellow Republicans to move the bill, which had
stalled in a fight over the treatment of horse racing and state
lotteries. The measure, similar to one passed by the Senate late
last year, is scheduled to be debated on the House floor next week.
The bill's sponsors says the chance for passage in the House
appears good.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, chairman of Interactive Gaming Council, said that
should the bill become law, it would be virtually unenforceable
because technology is moving so rapidly and operators of Internet
betting sites are more resourceful than would-be cybercops. The
answer is not an ill-conceived ban, Schneider said, but
legalization and regulation, as in 50 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the bill disagree. The measure would require
Internet service providers, like American Online, to block access
to gambling sites. But service providers would not be liable for
failure to do so. Compliance would be monitored by the Justice
Department and state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by horse-racing interests, who
successfully lobbied for an exemption from the bill's prohibition
on computerized gambling. It would allow them to continue to build
nationwide closed-circuit betting networks to compensate for
declining attendance at racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill are well financed and aggressively
represented as well. The opposition is led by the Interactive
Gaming Council, an association of dozens of online betting
parlors.The bill is also opposed by many governors, who see the
Internet as an ideal way to increase lottery ticket sales. They are
supported by technology firms, which lobbied unsuccessfully for the
bill to allow computerized-in-home lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups oppose the bill because of the
horse-racing exemption; libertarians object to government
regulation of what they consider a private vice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not taken a formal position on the
legislation, although the Justice Department objects to the horse
racing exemption. Vice President Al Gore opposes the bill, citing
the horse racing exemption and what he considers the unwarranted
federal intrusion on freedom of commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has no position on the bill, an
aide said, although many of his colleagues have opposed it not only
because of diminished lottery sales but also because they say it is
as an infringement of states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte's bill, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1999,
closely resembles the Senate bill sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz. Kyl's bill was passed by the Senate last November on a
voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte struck his deal on the bill with Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La. In addition to the exemption to betting on horses, the bill
also exempts betting on greyhounds and jai-alai. The horse racing
exemption, he said, will not expand computerized betting because
some types of computer-linked parimutuel betting are already legal
under horse-racing and interstate gambling laws passed in 1961 and
1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does not legitimize any unlawful activity or expand
the scope of otherwise lawful activity,'' Goodlatte said. ``It
simply bans a great many forms of gambling on the Internet: sports
betting, more than 700 cybercasinos and the sale of lottery tickets
in people's homes.''

STALLED SUMMIT COULD TAKE LONGER THAN PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton returned to Camp David
Thursday night as Israeli and Palestinian envoys ended their third
day of negotiations, rejoining a summit that has not yet reported
progress and could continue longer than initially planned.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials refused to describe the substance of
the talks, but said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held their first face-to-face
meeting without Clinton the night before. Flanked by aides, the two
leaders met for about an hour in Arafat's lodging, then joined
Clinton at a Mediterranean barbecue dinner that lasted late into
Wednesday night, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left Thursday morning to give a speech in Baltimore
and attend a White House news conference, a senior Israeli official
described the mood at the summit as ``carefully optimistic.'' Rabbi
Michael Melchior, a member of Barak's Cabinet who serves as
minister of diaspora affairs, flew to Washington with Barak earlier
in the week and had spoken to members of the delegation three or
four times since the talks began, said he was left with the
impression the talks were going reasonably well. But he suggested
the most critical discussions were still ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certain limitations,'' Melchior said of coming weekend
and the Jewish Sabbath, during which observant Jews are not
permitted to engage in any work. ``But these will be very crucial
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Melchior, along with other Israeli officials, did not rule out
the possibility that the talks might continue well into next week,
perhaps even after Clinton's scheduled departure next Wednesday for
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to remain as long as necessary. We could
continue while the president is away,'' said Barak spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky.
</P>
<P>
   But a State Department official indicated that Clinton would
stick to his original schedule, which calls for the talks to end by
Wednesday. ``We remain on the same schedule that we started with,''
spokesman Richard Boucher said. Boucher said that both Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright other plans after Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, an Israeli official who is not participating
in the talks indicated that Barak might take the difficult step of
agreeing to swap tracts of land with the Palestinian Authority in
order to reach an agreement during this negotiating session _ an
idea that has been debated since 1995 but was injected into the
debate anew Thursday on Israeli radio. The notion was that Israel
might give up areas of undeveloped land bordering the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip in return for keeping areas on
the West Bank where Israeli settlements have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, the Israeli justice minister who is considered a
chief architect of the Oslo Accords that paved the way for the
current talks, said Barak and Arafat ``will talk about swapping
land.'' Other analysts said they believed a swap would be a
necessity for a peace deal, allowing Arafat to return home with an
agreement under which Israel makes concessions, not just the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Melchior, who did not attend the negotiations but met with
reporters about 15 miles away from Camp David, said a land swap,
like many other options, remained a possibility. ``I'm sure
everything is being discussed,'' Melchior said.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's
executive committee arrived in Washington Thursday and indicated
they hoped to meet with Clinton and the negotiators at Camp David.
US officials, after first claiming not to have known about their
intentions, seemed to soften their opposition to allowing them at
the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The three PLO members _ identified as Tayseer Khaled of the
radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Suleiman
al-Najab of the Marxist Palestinian People's Party, and Sameer
Ghosheh of the Popular Struggle Front _ had opposed the Oslo
accord. But their support would be necessary now for Arafat to cut
a workable deal that would be acceptable to most Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a request, it will be for the US, by agreement of
the parties, to make a judgment about where these people should
come to the camp,'' one US official said. A decision, the official
said, would be based ``on their overall value to the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department continued its blanket of secrecy on the
substance of the talks. Boucher, beginning his daily press
briefing, welcomed reporters to the ``daily press blackout.'' And
Clinton, before returning to Camp David after spending the day at
an NAACP convention and meetings at the White House, told reporters
a peace agreement could well be predicated on silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less I say, the greater our chances of success,'' Clinton
said.

<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ Another white elephant like the Concorde? An
extravagance like the English Channel tunnel? Or a bet-the-company
gamble that will prove just as successful as the Boeing 747 it
hopes to succeed?
</P>
<P>
   Europe has a couple of gigantic transportation debacles to its
credit. The supersonic Concorde jetliner sounded promising, yet
never got beyond a production run of about 20 airplanes, and has
been confined for the past quarter of a century to a single
trans-Atlantic route connecting New York with London and Paris. The
Channel tunnel, though an operating success since it opened in
1994, cost $15 billion to build, double the original estimate, and
accumulated a $14 billion mountain of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the European Airbus Industrie group is close to
introducing another transportation behemoth, a gigantic
double-decker jumbo jet, known for now as the A3XX, for use on long
distance routes like those between Asia and Europe or the United
States. With a capacity of between 555 and 800 passengers, it would
carry at least 140 passengers more than the largest Boeing 747. And
its development cost is expected to exceed $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a market for this kind of aircraft, but a
very, very limited market,'' said John Dern, a Boeing spokesman in
Seattle. Boeing calculates that demand over the next 20 years for
jetliners in the 400 passenger and up category will amount to
``fewer than 400,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing itself is ``actively discussing'' with potential
customers its own alternative _ a stretched version of the 747 _
but a final decision on whether to build it has not been reached,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Airbus remains adamant that Europe's experience will be
different this time. Unlike the Concorde, its proposed A3XX is
encountering strong interest among airlines, Airbus officials say.
Unlike the channel tunnel, they insist, it would be financed in a
way that would avoid a financial debacle.
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for the project, Airbus _ a loose consortium of
four big European aerospace companies, Aerospatiale of France;
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany; BAE Systems of Britain,
formerly known as British Aerospace; and Construcciones
Aeronauticas of Spain _ is recasting its corporate structure. Its
French, German and Spanish partners are in the process of merging
to form the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Co.
</P>
<P>
   EADS, as the company is known, will be the world's third-largest
aerospace group after Boeing and Lockheed Martin, both U.S.
companies, and its shares _ a 30 percent stake _ began trading on
European stock exchanges on Monday. Originally, the company had
hoped to raise $3.5 billion offering shares for 22-24 euros each,
but underwriters lowered that price to 19 euros to bring in about
$3 billion before public trading began. In the first day of
trading, the stock dropped about 10 percent in Frankfurt, Germany;
Madrid, Spain, and Paris to about 17 euros. Since then, shares have
climbed back to close Thursday on the German Bourse in Frankfurt at
18.10 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus itself will become a unified, more easily manageable
corporation owned 80 percent by EADS and 20 percent by BAE Systems.
In return, European governments have pledged development aid for
the A3XX in the form of refundable loans.
</P>
<P>
   From the European perspective, the motivation for the A3XX is
clear. By all estimates, civilian air travel will continue to grow
into the new century at a rate of about 5 percent a year. Yet
Boeing, with its 747, has a monopoly on the largest aircraft, those
with more than 400 seats, which are expected to account for about
one-quarter of all civilian aircraft sales. The A3XX is in fact
only part of a broader effort by Airbus to challenge Boeing in
every sector above the 100-seat jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   For Boeing, the consequences are potentially devastating. For
years the 747, the uncontested queen of the skies and the flagship
of most of the world's major airlines, has been Boeing's cash cow,
accounting in good years for roughly half of Boeing's profits.
``It's a huge, huge item for Boeing,'' said Joseph Campbell Jr., an
analyst who follows Boeing at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new Airbus jumbo jet threatens Boeing's dominance
in Japan, where the 747 is king, and where Boeing enjoys cozy
relations with both carriers and industrial suppliers of parts for
its planes. To respond, Boeing is studying the possibility of
investing $3 billion to $4 billion in a stretch version of the 747,
for 500 passengers, that would compete head-to-head with the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   For Airbus, the stakes are perhaps even greater. Airbus
jetliners account for 70 percent of the revenue of EADS, its
biggest shareholder, and failure of the A3XX would be a serious
burden as the new aerospace giant seeks to lift off the ground.
Moreover, as the first project in which Airbus is relying
principally on capital markets rather than government aid, a
debacle would sour relations with investors.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, Airbus will have to decide whether
sufficient demand for the new aircraft exists to justify starting
construction. Assuming it decides to go ahead, as most experts
expect it will, the first test flights will be in mid-2004, and the
first aircraft will be delivered in the fall of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big obstacles remain. For one thing, Washington is eyeing
suspiciously the intention of European governments to help finance
the A3XX, and the project affords the potential for a major
trans-Atlantic trade war. Since Airbus got started in the early
1970s, successive White Houses have objected to its financing
through government loans. The Europeans counter that Pentagon
spending is tantamount to a hidden subsidy to big U.S. aerospace
contractors, including Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a compromise agreement was reached regulating aid to
the industry, but both Boeing and the next president face tough
decisions on whether to challenge, or perhaps even discard, the
1992 agreement if the A3XX project proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest question is whether Airbus can get enough orders
to make the project ultimately profitable. Airbus executives have
told analysts that they must sell about 240 of the planes before
turning a profit, though they will not say within what time frame.
Campbell of Lehman Brothers calculates Airbus will have to sell at
least 150 A3XX jetliners by 2010 for it to succeed. With Boeing
offering a less expensive alternative, that is a tall order to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, many say the project makes sense. Nine key customers have
said they are interested, six publicly, including Emirates
Airlines, Air France, Singapore Airlines, the International Lease
Finance Corp., Qantas, and Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic. And the
A3XX, while more expensive initially, would be cheaper to operate
on a per-seat basis than a 747, Airbus officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Boeing dreads the prospect, airline companies, like
car buyers entering a showroom, relish the idea of having more
bargaining clout. When airlines go to Boeing headquarters, said
Daniel Solon, managing director of Avmark International Ltd., a
London airline consultant, ``at every other category you can say,
`The other guy has such and such. What can you do for us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Airbus, as much as it looks forward to making itself
Boeing's equal up and down the line, cannot make the decision
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of betting the company,'' said Chris Partridge, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in London. ``But then, isn't
that what Boeing did with the 747?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such a huge project seems almost a natural to a
Continent that brought forth the Concorde and the channel tunnel.
But at a time when governments in Europe are constrained by the
fiscal requirements for the euro, the single currency introduced
last year, and companies like Airbus and its shareholders rely
increasingly on capital markets, it will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Forgeard, the Airbus chief executive, insists the A3XX is
not the huge gamble it has been portrayed. ``It's a figurehead, but
it's certainly not the only project we have,'' he said in an
interview at Airbus headquarters outside this southern French city.
Indeed, he added, relative to the size of the company, which last
year generated sales of 15.7 billion euros, or $15 billion, it is
not even as ambitious as the 1990s project to develop the A320
family of wide-bodied jets.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble or not, the A3XX is daunting. At 239 feet, it is not much
longer than the biggest 747s, but it would boast two full passenger
decks, one above the other, plus a windowless third deck below that
could be used for cargo or passenger services. Since the plane
would be flown mostly on long-haul routes, like London to Australia
or Hong Kong to Los Angeles, Airbus officials fancifully describe
the possibility of installing fitness rooms, a duty free shop, even
a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   They describe first-class amenities that could include sleeping
berths, roomy lounges and cocktail bars _ evoking a cruise liner
more than a jetliner. Some experts are skeptical, believing the
temptation to squeeze in large numbers of passengers will prevail.
``In the end, it could be more steerage,'' said Avmark's Solon,
``than Queen Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its size, Airbus boasts that the A3XX will not tax
airports more than a 747. Though weighing 590 metric tons, 150 tons
more than the biggest 747, an innovative design for the wheel
carriage would spread the weight over the tarmac. Most airports
will disembark passengers from one level, though newer airports
like Hong Kong will be able to link passenger gangways at both
upper and lower levels. At any rate, Airbus has assured airlines
that the turnaround of the A3XX _ the time needed to unload
passengers, cargo and baggage, and be refitted for flight _ would
be no longer than the scheduled 90 minutes for the 747.
</P>
<P>
   For financial planners, of course, the monster is the aircraft's
costs. Forgeard estimates total development costs of 10.7 billion
euros, about $10.2 billion, though some experts believe they could
run as much as $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said about 4 billion euros will be raised by
risk-sharing partners who will supply parts in exchange for
providing financing. Another 2 billion euros will be raised with
government loans, and the rest through the bond market and by
selling stock.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade airlines of its cost effectiveness, Airbus argues
that to break even, the A3XX must fill just 323 of its 555 seats,
or only 33 more than the 747 must fill to be profitable, yet offers
232 more seats for additional ticket sales, against the 747's 123.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration or its successor may
be tempted to bring Airbus before the World Trade Organization if
American officials believe they can make the case that European
governements are providing improper subsidies. But Boeing, worrying
about a backlash among its airline customers and suppliers who
build for both airline makers, could be reluctant to encourage such
an action. And if Washington presses the case, Airbus pledges to
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   American companies stand to profit by supplying parts like
engine supports, landing gear, evacuation systems and much of the
electronics for the A3XX. If airlines choose engines from a
consortium of General Electric and United Technologies' Pratt &AMP;
Whitney, one of two engine suppliers, American-made equipment could
account for roughly one-third the value.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year the EADS board plans to decide whether
to begin construction. Forgeard, a board member, said the decision
would hinge as much on the quality of the orders as on their
quantity. Some airlines, he said, because of their sway within the
industry, `'will have more influence in terms of a domino effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard, clearly hinting he favors a go-ahead, says the biggest
risk for Airbus would be not to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be a real bet,'' he said, ``would be to neglect an
important part of the market, or address it with programs not
compatible with our resources.''

CLINTON HOPES TO REINVIGORATE MIDEAST SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>

By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Buoyed by a new U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement,
President Clinton returned to Camp David late Thursday saying he
intends to bring fresh energy to peace talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took an eight-hour break from the negotiations _ which
today enter their fourth day _ to address the NAACP convention in
Baltimore and appear at a Capitol Hill awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   During his absence, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
with Barak and members of the Israeli delegation, but a similar
session with Arafat was put off. Officials declined to say who
postponed the meeting or why.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Barak and Arafat held their first meeting without
U.S. officials present. Except to say the two leaders seriously
discussed the core issues that must be resolved as part of the
peace terms, officials declined to say whether there was any
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   These include the status of Jerusalem, the nature and borders of
a Palestinian state, the future of Jewish settlers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and whether more than 2 million Palestinian
refugees will be allowed to return to their homes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying back to Camp David on Thursday afternoon, Clinton
praised the U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement, saying it will provide an
example for Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is one more reminder that former adversaries
can come together to find common ground in a way that benefits all
their people, to let go of the past and embrace the future, to
forgive and reconcile,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the energy I feel here from all these people back to
Camp David and make the argument that they should follow suit,''
Clinton said. Standing with him in the White House Rose Garden were
representatives of the Vietnamese government and former Vietnamese
prisoners of war now serving in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out for the remote presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, Clinton declined to answer questions
about the peace talks, which are being carried out under a rigid
secrecy rule imposed by the U.S. hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should say nothing about what's going on at Camp
David,'' the president said. ``The less I say, the greater our
chances of success.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials tried to keep a lid on details of the
negotiations, some purported details emerged, mostly from Middle
East sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, a Barak confidant, said
a proposed land swap _ unpopulated land inside Israel's borders in
exchange for West Bank land currently occupied by Jewish settlers _
was on the table. It was the first time an Israeli official had
publicly acknowledged willingness to consider such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arab legislator Ahmed Tibi, a former adviser to
Arafat, said the two sides had agreed that Jewish settlements in
the Gaza Strip would be abandoned as part of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher declined comment.
``We're going to hear a lot of stories _ some of them could turn
out to be true, some of them may not be true,'' he said.
``Statements that are made halfway around the world, we can't spend
all our time dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are working against a self-imposed deadline of
Sept. 13 to try to strike a final peace agreement settling the most
intractable issues in their nations' 52-year conflict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some officials have speculated privately that, if progress is
made on the core issues, the Camp David talks could be adjourned,
then reopened sometime in August.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Barak indicated talks might continue
uninterrupted until a final deal is reached, even if Clinton is
away. The president and Albright are scheduled to leave Wednesday
for Okinawa, site of the annual meeting of leaders of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to remain as long as necessary. We could
continue while the president is away,'' said Gadi Baltiansky,
Israeli government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the Clinton's agenda still includes next week's
meeting in Okinawa, Boucher left open the possibility that Albright
might remain behind to keep the Arafat-Barak talks on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, she does have things on her schedule'' other
than the Camp David negotiations, Boucher said.

 &HT;    Dash for Sydney starts
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials
come down to basic math: Finish in the top three in your event or
go home and watch the Sydney Games on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Trials give no special passes for world-record holders, no
exemptions for past Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days starting today, the Trials will have a 200-meter
showdown between the world's fastest men, the outspoken Maurice
Greene and the all-business Michael Johnson. They will feature
Marion Jones as she finallybegins her bid for five Olympic gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   But those stars and everyone else _ from old favorites Jackie
Joyner-Kersee and Gail Devers to the sport's rising stars, pole
vaulter Stacy Dragila and hurdler Angelo Taylor _ must play the
survival game at Hornet Stadium on the campus of California State
University-Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get one of those top three places is what's important now
for every American track-and-field athlete,'' Jones said. ``Once
that is done, you can relax a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The trials hold no guarantees even for Jones, star of Nike's
``Me &AMP; Mrs. Jones'' summer ad campaign. If she comes down with an
injury, as she did before the Atlanta trials, tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok learned a painful lesson in 1992, when decathlon favorite
and pitchman Dan O'Brien failed to clear a pole-vault height in the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   It is what makes the trials special. The participants book their
tickets knowing the chance of heartbreak, knowing that athletes who
have run like champions since the Atlanta Games may never see
Sydney, because of a tweaked hamstring muscle or a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most pressure any athlete is ever going to
feel,''Johnson said. ``People have been training for this, and you
got one shot. And for some reason, the trials are always in a hot
place, too, and that adds to the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsons, who opens with a first-round race tonight in the 400
in his bid to double Down Under later this summer, at least has his
Olympic fame. Others, including Greene and Jones don't.
</P>
<P>
   Since Atlanta, the 25-year-old Greene has been burning up the
track, smashing the 100-meter world record and challenging
Johnson's supremacy in the 200. But Greene knows he needs to make a
statement here and then to follow it up in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a catastrophe, Greene is a cinch for the U.S. team
selected by the close of the meet. At these trials, ultimately, it
doesn't matter if you win, as long as you don't come home a dreaded
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get an Olympic gold medal, my career would be
nothing,'' he said. ``I need to get the gold medal to feel
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this is the biggest meet of my life,'' Greene said. ``I've
put my body through a whole lot the last few weeks, and I'm sure
it'll pay off.''

POLICE BEATING TAINTS BURNISHED IMAGE FOR GOP CONVENTION HOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ All decked out in bunting and civic pride for the
forthcoming Republican National Convention, this city Thursday
suffered the ignominy of seeing its police on national television
beating and kicking a suspect who had allegedly stolen a police car
and shot at an officer in a running gun battle through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, America!'' the Philadelphia Daily News proclaimed to
the approaching conventioneers on its front page, above a
photograph of the fugitive being pummeled by a group of eight or
nine police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for city leaders who have been preparing a
showcase venue for GOP delegates arriving at the end of the month,
the arrest and beating were recorded by a hovering TV news
helicopter. The tape was replayed endlessly across America as an
image of this city that threatened to be more definitive than any
red, white and blue balloon drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the videotape doesn't look good, any fool will admit
that,'' said Police Commissioner John F. Timoney who resented as
``inflammatory'' any comparison with the videotaped 1991 clubbing
of Rodney King that traumatized the nation and scandalized the Los
Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney, a former deputy commissioner in the New York Police
Department, warned against a ``rush to judgment,'' noting that the
fugitive had allegedly stolen a police officer's gun and shot at
him and repeatedly resisted being brought to ground in a mile-long
chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced that it would review the tape
for evidence of excessive police force. The image on the tape
dampened civic pride in a city that has been hailing its own
renaissance, and revived old images of a tough city where police
behavior had to be federally monitored.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's vibrant renewal as a convention city has been
widely acclaimed as a triumph over some dark history where a past
mayor, Frank Rizzo, personally packed a club in his law-and-order
photo ops and another, Wilson Goode, ordered the police bombing of
barricaded protesters, with fatal results and disastrous notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately this incident may be used by some elements of
the protest movement to look at our police department as much more
brutal than it actually is,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director
of the state American Civil Liberties Union, referring to the
anticipated thousands of protesters who plan to demonstrate here
during the convention, which runs from July 31 through Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the situation in Seattle where people with legal
protest permits had their march hijacked by others intent on
violence, and that's where there's a certain edginess growing right
now,'' said Presser, who in the past decade engaged in various
legal challenges to the police and said he found their behavior
clearly improving.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders, noting that white and black police were taped in
the beating, contended that the case was one of brutality more than
racism toward the suspect, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes out of a history of violence and brutality in this
department for 30 years,'' said J. Whyatt Mondesire, president of
the Philadelphia National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief comment while campaigning in Pittsburgh, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, who is to be formally nominated at the
Philadelphia convention, said, ``Obviously we've got to take these
incidents very seriously.'' But he reserved further comment, as did
Republican convention officials who had eagerly selected this
overwhelmingly Democratic city after seeing firsthand the evidence
of its downtown renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who had urged his fellow
Republicans to ``go into nontraditional constituencies'' for the
Philadelphia convention, said that while the 20-second tape was ``a
pretty horrible sight,'' it was important to study all of the
earlier parts of the chase for a full understanding of the police
officers' intensity.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Cohen, the co-chairman of the city's convention host
committee, said a full investigation would show that the police
were dealing with a shifting, dangerous situation and that the
city's chief officials would tolerate ``no whitewash'' of any
excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this something we think is going to put a stain on
Philadelphia? No,'' Cohen said. ``It's not a blight on the city at
the dawn of the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of preconvention edginess was discernible even before the
beating. The City Council, prompted by the violent street
demonstrations during sessions of the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle in December, recently passed an ordinance making
it illegal for protesters to wear masks and bandanas with the
intent of intimidating the public. And, amid media speculation
about the potential for mass arrests, police said that, if
necessary for processing detainees, they would consider reopening
the notorious Holmesburg prison, a century-old bastion that was
closed five years ago as unusable.
</P>
<P>
   The edginess grew as planners of protest demonstrations
complained that law enforcement surveillance agents had been
snooping about routine meetings and photographing them on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so silly,'' said Jody Dodd, an organizer with the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom, who said the group's
plans for strictly nonviolent street protest were already public
knowledge on the Internet. Dodd said the tape of the police beating
``can't help but have a lingering effect in the back of people's
minds,'' quite possibly for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves the police now to act with great restraint and
conduct themselves in the best light,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street emphasized there was much more to the chase
than the final scene. ``As inflammatory as this tape might be, we
have to keep in mind that the police were in the process of
apprehending a criminal suspect who had resisted a number of
attempts to arrest him and who had shot a police officer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Thomas Jones, 30, sped off through north
Philadelphia after being stopped for driving a stolen car. He then
crashed his car and fled on foot, according to witnesses, before
being tackled by police. In a scuffle, the 6-foot-tall, 240-pound
suspect grabbed an officer's gun and began shooting, according to
witnesses and police. Then, they said, he jumped into a nearby
empty patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Michael Livewell was shot in the hand, police said, in
trying to stop the suspect, who was wounded but managed to flee in
the patrol car. Dozens of shots were fired in the ensuing chase
before the suspect was finally cornered at 26th and Oxford streets.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the tape shows the car down below, its windows
blown out, as police warily approach with drawn guns then finally
seize Jones as he emerges and is instantly surrounded and wrestled
down in a flurry of kicks and punches. Jones was in fair condition
Thursday, handcuffed to a hospital bed after being treated for five
bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Police said records showed that Jones had earlier convictions
include robbery, assault and an attempt to run over a police
officer while fleeing arrest. Unofficially, police contended
through local media sources that the group beating occurred as the
suspect, whose behavior is not entirely clear on the tape,
continued to resist, biting one officer's finger and gripping a
cell phone that could have been mistaken as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point did the resistance cease and was unnecessary
force used?'' asked Police Commissioner Timoney. ``That's the
critical question here.''

   EL SALADO, Colombia _ The armed men, more than 300 of them,
marched into this tiny village early on a Friday. They went
straight to the basketball court that doubles as the main square
here, announced themselves as members of Colombia's most feared
paramilitary group and with a list of names began summoning
residents for judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A table and chairs were seized from a house, and after the death
squad leader had made himself comfortable, the basketball court was
turned into a court of execution. The paramilitary troops ordered
up liquor and music, and then embarked on a calculated rampage of
torture, rape and killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, it was like a big party,'' said one of a dozen
survivors who described the scene in interviews earlier this month.
``They drank and danced and cheered as they butchered us like
hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time they left late Sunday afternoon, they had killed at
least 36 people whom they accused of collaborating with the enemy,
left-wing guerrillas who have long been a presence in the area. The
victims ranged from a six-year-old girl to an elderly woman. As
music blared, some of the victims were shot after being tortured;
others were stabbed or beaten to death, and several more were
strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during the three days of killing, military and police units
just a few miles away made no effort to stop the slaughter. At one
point the paramilitaries had a helicopter flown in to rescue a
fighter who had been injured trying to drag some victims from their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting back, the armed forces set up a roadblock on
the road to the village shortly after the rampage began and
prevented human rights and relief groups from entering and rescuing
residents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Colombian military has opened three investigations
into what happened here and made some paramilitary arrests, top
officials insist that fighting was underway in the village between
guerrillas and paramilitary forces _ not a series of executions.
They also insist that the colonel in charge of the region has been
persecuted by prosecutors and human rights groups. Last month he
was promoted to general, despite the fact that examinations of the
incidents are pending.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in El Salado in February _ at the very moment when
President Clinton was pushing an aid package to step up antidrug
efforts here _strikes at the heart of the debate over the growing
U.S. backing of the Colombian military. For years the U.S.
government and human rights groups have had reservations about the
Colombian military leadership, its human rights record and its
collaboration with paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian armed forces and police are the principal
beneficiaries of a $1.3 billion aid package that Clinton signed
Thursday. The Colombian government says it has been working hard to
sever the remnants of ties between the armed forces and the
paramilitaries and has been training its soldiers to observe
international human rights conventions even in the heat of combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramilitaries are some of the worst of the terrorists who
profit from drugs in Colombia, and in no way can anyone justify
their human rights violations,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
White House drug czar. But he added that ``the Colombian military
is making dramatic improvements in its human rights record,'' and
noted that the aid package includes ``significant money, $46
million for human rights training and implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups, pointing to incidents like the massacre
here, say these links still exist and that mechanisms to monitor
and punish commanders and units have had limited success at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Salado was the worst recorded massacre yet this year,''
said Andrew Miller, a Latin American specialist for Amnesty
International USA, who spent the past year as an observer near
where this massacre occurred. ``The Colombian armed forces,
specifically the marines, were at best criminally negligent by not
responding sooner to the attack. At worst, they were knowledgeable
and complicit.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary attack on El Salado indeed killed more people
and lasted longer than any other in Colombia so far this year. But
in most other respects it was an operation so typical of the
5,500-member right-wing death squad that goes by the name of the
Peasant Self-Defense of Colombia, that the Colombian press treated
it as just another atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 18 months, more than 2,500 people, most of them
unarmed peasants in rural areas like this village in northern
Colombia, have died in more than 500 attacks by what the Colombian
government calls ``illegal armed groups,'' involved in the
country's 35-year-old civil conflict. And according to the tally of
the government ombudsman's office, right-wing paramilitary groups
are responsible for most of those killings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the El Salado massacre, nearly 3,000 residents of the area
fled to nearby towns, including Carmen de Bolivar and Ovejas, as
well as the provincial capital, Cartagena. Early this month, more
than a dozen of the survivors were interviewed under the protection
of human rights groups or the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to protect them, however, some have recently
been killed in individual attacks or have disappeared, actions they
blame on the same paramilitary group that attacked their village.
As a result, all of the survivors interviewed for this story spoke
on condition that their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Their accounts, however, coincide with investigations conducted
by the Colombian government prosecutor's office and by the Colombia
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   A paramilitary unit had attacked this village in 1997, killing
five people and warning that they would eventually come back. Many
residents fled then, but returned after a few months believing that
they were safe until the death squad suddenly reappeared on the
morning of Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up at the hills, and could see armed men everywhere,
blocking every possible exit,'' a farmer recalled. ``They had
surrounded the town, and almost as soon as they came down, they
began firing their guns and shouting ``death to the guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The death squad troops, almost all dressed in military-style
uniforms with a blue patch, made their way to the basketball court
at the center of the village. They took tables and chairs from a
nearby building, pulled out a list of names and then began the
search for victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were shot, but a lot of them were beaten with
clubs and then stabbed with knives or sliced up with machetes,''
said one eyewitness. ``A few people were beheaded, or strangled
with metal wires, while others had their throats cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of those to be executed was supplied by two men, one of
whom was wearing a ski mask. Paramilitary leaders, who have
acknowledged the attack on El Salado but describe it as ``combat''
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, later
said that the two men were FARC deserters who had dealt with local
people and knew who had been guerrilla sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all done very methodically,'' said one eyewitness.
``Some people were brought to the basketball court, but were saved
because someone would say `not that one,' and they would be allowed
to leave. But I saw a woman neighbor of mine, who I know had
nothing at all to do with the guerrillas, knocked down with clubs
and then stabbed to death.''
</P>
<P>
   While some paramilitaries searched for people to kill, others
were breaking into shops and stealing beer, rum and whiskey. Before
long, a macabre party atmosphere prevailed, with the paramilitaries
setting up radios with dance music and ordering a local guitarist
and accordionist to play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a young waitress from a cantina adjoining the
basketball court was ordered to keep a steady supply of liquor
flowing. As the armed men grew drunk and rowdy, they began to
fondle her, and she ended up being repeatedly raped, along with
several other women from the town, according to residents and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, some residents fled to the wooded hills above
town. Others stayed in their homes, afraid of being caught if they
tried to escape, unable to move because they had small children or
convinced that they would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was more of the same. ``All day long we could hear
occasional bursts of gunfire, along with the screams and cries of
those who were being tortured and killed,'' said a woman who had
taken refuge in the hills with her small children.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 people who were killed in town, 16 people were
executed at the basketball court. An additional 18 people were
killed in the countryside, residents and human rights workers said,
and 17 more are still missing, making for a death toll that could
be as high as 71.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, news of the slaughter had spread to Carmen
de Bolivar, the county seat, about 15 miles away. Alarmed,
relatives of the residents rushed to local police and military
posts, but were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a scandal and nearly caused a riot, we were so
insistent,'' said a 40-year-old-man who had left El Salado early on
Friday because he had business in town. ``But they did nothing to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the armed forces and police not come to the aid of
the villagers here, but the roadblock they set up prevented
humanitarian aid from entering the village. Anyone seeking to enter
the area was turned back, told the road was unsafe because it had
been mined and that combat was going on between guerrilla and
paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, three Colombian navy admirals said
that residents of El Salado were accusing the military of
complicity in the massacre because they ``have been coerced by
guerrillas,'' into doing so. The roadblock was set up, they said,
``for the security of the people themselves, because we did not
want to see more deaths or injuries to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no point was there collaboration on our part, nor would we
have permitted their passage'' through the area, Adm. William
Porras, the second in command of the Colombian navy, said of the
death squad unit that attacked this village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never at any point were covering up for them or helping
them, as all the subsequent investigations have shown.''
</P>
<P>
   But local residents, Colombian prosecutors investigating the
massacre and human rights groups say there was no combat of any
kind. In fact, villagers report that the armed forces had not been
in the center of El Salado recently, and that they had left the
outlying areas a day before. Residents also say they had passed
over the dirt road as recently as Friday morning and there were no
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army was on patrol for two or three days before the
massacre took place, and then suddenly they disappeared,'' recalled
a 43-year old tobacco farmer. ``It can't be explained, and it seems
very curious to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What has been established, however, is that the villagers were
simple peasants, and not the guerrillas the paramilitary leader
says his troops were fighting. ``It is quite clear that these were
defenseless people and that what they were subjected to was not
combat, but abuse and torture,'' said a foreign diplomat who has
been investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to residents, the paramilitaries felt so certain that
government security forces would stay away that late on Friday they
had a helicopter flown in. It landed in front of a church and
picked up a death squad fighter who had been injured when a family
he was trying to drag out of their house to be taken to the
basketball court resisted.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, Human Rights Watch found ``detailed, abundant and
compelling evidence of continuing close ties between the Colombian
army and paramilitary groups responsible for gross human rights
violations.'' All told, ``half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level
units have documented links to paramilitary activity,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from moving decisively to sever ties to paramilitaries,
Human Rights Watch's evidence strongly suggests that Colombia's
military high command has yet to take the necessary steps to
accomplish this goal,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the El Salado incident, the senior military
officer in this region was Col. Rodrigo Quinones Cardenas,
commander of the 1st Navy Brigade, who has since been promoted to
general. As director of Naval Intelligence in the early 1990s, he
was named by Colombian prosecutors as the organizer of a
paramilitary network responsible for the killings of 57 trade
unionists, human rights workers and members of a left-wing
political party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Quinones and seven other soldiers were charged with
``conspiring to form or collaborate with armed groups.'' But after
the main witness against him was murdered in a maximum security
prison and the case was transferred from a civilian court to a
military tribunal, he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the same investigation by Colombian prosecutors,
one of Quinones' closest associates in that paramilitary network
was Harold Mantilla, a colonel in the Colombian marines.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mantilla is commander of the 5th Marine Battalion, which
operates in the area around El Salado and is one of the units said
by residents and human rights workers to have failed to respond to
appeals for help.
</P>
<P>
   After the paramilitary unit left El Salado, police captured 11
paramilitaries northeast of here on the ranch of a drug trafficker
who is in prison in Bogota. Along with four others who were
arrested separately, they are now facing murder charges, but their
leaders and most of the others who carried out the killings remain
free.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months after the massacre, El Salado is virtually
deserted. Only one of the town's 1,330 original residents was
present when a reporter and human rights workers visited early this
month, and he said the village remains as it was the day the death
squad left, except for the two mass graves on a rise near the
basketball court where the bodies of the dead were buried and later
exhumed for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At the basketball court, the table and chairs used by the
paramilitary ``judges,'' smashed or overturned as they left, are
still strewn across the playing area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the people are ever going to want to come back
again,'' he said. ``What happened here was just too terrible to
bear, and we didn't deserve it.''

GENERAL MILLS IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE PILLSBURY FROM DIAGEO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could mean the corporate union of Betty Crocker
and the Pillsbury Doughboy, General Mills Inc. said Thursday that
it was in talks to acquire Diageo PLC's Pillsbury division.
</P>
<P>
   While confirming the talks, neither side would give details on a
proposed price for Pillsbury. Analysts said it could end up at
between $9 billion and $11 billion, with Diageo retaining a
minority stake. They said the deal could be completed by early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills is attracted to Pillsbury's refrigerated-dough
business, which includes ready-to-bake cookies and biscuits.
Together with General Mills' yogurt business, which consists of
Yoplait and Colombo yogurt, it would create a behemoth with $1.7
billion in sales in that key corner of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have a refrigerated division that is second only to
Kraft, and maybe the leader in terms of growth potential,'' said
John McMillin, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, another analyst said that while there would be immediate
cost savings by combining the two companies, both of which are
based in Minneapolis, it was not clear that the merger would
increase General Mills' sales in the long run. ``The biggest hurdle
for General Mills would be convincing investors that it could
accelerate top-line growth,'' said Andrew Lazar of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the latest in a series of pairings between
food companies, all designed to increase the size and alter the
balance of power between the companies and grocery retailers. In
recent years, consolidation among supermarket chains has left the
industry with a handful of large multinational players, leaving
food makers scrambling for position. The prevailing thinking, that
larger food companies make better global suppliers, has led to
mergers like the $20.3 billion proposed acquisition by Unilever of
Bestfoods, which was announced last month, and the $14.9 billion
proposed purchase of Nabisco by Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   It also signals further revision of the Diageo corporate
structure. Last month, the company said it would spin off 20
percent of its Burger King holdings, with the goal of eventually
spinning off the whole enterprise. Paul Walsh, Diageo's chief
operating officer who formerly headed Pillsbury, has said he wants
to focus the company on its Guinness beer brand and liquor
business.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo was formed in 1997 when Grand Metropolitan PLC merged
with Guinness; the company changed its name the same year. Diageo
is the largest global player in liquor, with about 9 percent of the
market; without Burger King and Pillsbury, its holdings would
consist solely of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of Pillsbury ``would open up other options,'' said a
Diageo spokeswoman, Kathryn Partridge, adding that the company was
likely to purchase brands ``within the beverage-alcohol category.''
With the sale of Seagram to Vivendi last month, several well-known
brands are up for sale, including Chivas Regal and Martell cognac.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills makes and markets breakfast cereals, including
Lucky Charms, Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs. It also makes Yoplait and
Colombo yogurt, and recently scored a major hit with Go-gurt, a
yogurt aimed at children that is packaged in a slender, portable
tube that requires no spoon. So successful is Go-Gurt, in fact,
that an adult version is planned as well.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Betty Crocker line includes cake mixes as well as
Hamburger Helper and Suddenly Salad. General Mills also makes Gold
Medal flour and Lloyd's packaged barbecue, as well as snacks like
Gushers and Fruit by the Foot.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury's lineup, which includes the Old El Paso line of
Mexican food and Green Giant frozen vegetables, overlaps in several
areas, particular flour and cake mixes.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday whether combining with General Mills
would raise antitrust issues. A spokesman for the Federal Trade
Commission would not comment on the proposed deal. The talks were
reported in Thursday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, General Mills has won praise from Wall Street
as the company steadily gained market share for its cereals at the
expense of Kellogg. Other General Mills products also succeeded, in
large part because of strong marketing and close identification
with consumer desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could bring to bear their innovation and consumer
research to bring out very focused products that consumers like,''
said Erika Gritman Long, an analyst for J.P. Morgan. ``They could
improve the operating margins of the existing businesses, just by
running them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury, on the other hand, has been perceived as something of
an underachiever by the profit-hungry investment community.
``Pillsbury is not as efficient,'' said Jaine Mehring, an analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would likely mean job cuts in Minneapolis, where both
companies are based. ``As with any merger, there will be some
consolidation of jobs and things like that, and I assume some
executive-level jobs will be lost,'' said Thomas Stinson, the
Minnesota state economist. But he predicted that the packaged-food
sector would grow as a result. ``In general, it will be beneficial
for this state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also said they expected General Mills to sell some
Pillsbury businesses, including Green Giant frozen vegetables and
Progresso soups, that do not fit neatly into the existing lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if it goes through, may set up one more. The
combination of General Mills and Pillsbury may make General Mills a
more enticing target for another company, Long said. ``It would
reduce their exposure in cereal from 45 percent to about 25
percent,'' she said, noting that cereal is a difficult market
lately. ``And Haagen Dazs would make General Mills even more
attractive to Nestle than it already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that are considered likely merger candidates
include Heinz, the Campbell Soup Co. and the Kellogg Co.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of General Mills rose 25 cents, to $37, while Diageo fell
12.5 pence at 599 pence in London. Diageo's American depository
receipts fell 56.25 cents, to $36.3125.

LOCKHEED SETS $1.67 BILLION DEFENSE DEAL WITH BAE SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. said it will sell its Sanders electronic
warfare division in New Hampshire and other units to BAE Systems
for $1.67 billion in cash, in a deal that would give the British
company control of Sanders and its roughly 4,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   BAE's interest had raised concerns about foreign access to the
advanced weaponry made by Sanders. Thursday, the Pentagon said it
has only begun to review the transaction's security implications,
in what could become a key test of its efforts to encourage closer
ties between American and European defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing BAE, Lockheed Martin seemed to be betting it would
prevail over whatever objections might be raised that could benefit
the runner-up in the bidding contest, Northrop Grumman Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the sale supports US Department of Defense
objectives and trans-Atlatic cooperation,'' said Lockheed Martin
chief executive Vance D. Coffman.
</P>
<P>
   BAE's top North America executive, Mark Ronald, said the deal
poses no risk to US security, adding BAE is ``proud of our security
record, which I believe is among the best in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If BAE completes the purchase by the end of the year, as it
hopes, it will gain access to whiz-bang Sanders products. Among
them are ``countermeasure'' devices used to fool enemy missiles,
either by jamming radio frequencies or by firing flares.
</P>
<P>
   BAE will also acquire an infrared-sensors unit in Lexington,
Mass., with about 400 employees, and other parts of Lockheed
Martin's Aerospace Electronics Systems division. Altogether, the
deal would add 5,300 Lockheed Martin employees to BAE's current
North American work force of 18,300.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders president Walter P. Havenstein Thursday said he hopes to
remain as head of the company, which would retain its autonomy with
BAE.
</P>
<P>
   People close to BAE said the firm doesn't plan layoffs after the
purchase. That message may bring support for the deal from New
Hampshire's congressional delegation, including Senator Bob Smith,
a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee. But their
opinions are still unclear: Smith has declined to discuss the deal.
A staff member said he couldn't be reached to comment Thursday.
Havenstein said he doesn't expect layoffs following the deal but
hasn't been told for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin said last fall it would auction off Sanders and
other units to raise cash and pay down debt. Like Raytheon Co.,
Lockheed Martin has struggled after a wave of consolidation in the
defense industry. Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has tried
to encourage closer ties between American and European defense
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But those efforts were dealt a blow in May when BAE and other
contractors beat out Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., for a
much-contested $1.2 billion British missile order.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had given BAE permission to bid on Sanders, but
hasn't indicated whether it would grant BAE final approval for the
sale or when the companies can expect a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capabilities included in this transaction represent
important areas of modern technology,'' Pentagon spokeswoman Cheryl
Irwin said Thursday. The review is ``focused on ensuring that our
industrial partners are responsive to, and capable of meeting,
current and emerging (Defense Department) requirements,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, who was deputy secretary of Defense until March,
said he expects the BAE purchase would eventually be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre, now president of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent e-mail that
``I suspect that there will be concerns, but that they can be
worked out.'' He added ``there are security procedures in place or
adaptable to cover any problem that might emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   BAE was formed last November through the merger of British
Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems, and has annual revenue of
about $20 billion. Based in Farnborough, England, BAE has become
one of the largest US defense contractors through service
agreements with the Pentagon and units like Tracor Inc. in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders represents the bulk of the assets Lockheed said it would
sell Thursday, which altogether include about 5,300 employees and
1999 revenue of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The units are valued on Lockheed Martin's books at around $2.6
billion. The seller said it would take a third-quarter charge of
about $1 billion, or $2.50 cents per share, to account for the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after the close of trading. In New York
Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Lockheed Martin shares fell 6.25
cents to close at $25.

 &HT;    Flu vaccine expected to be late, in short supply
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The arrival of the influenza vaccine will be
significantly delayed for next winter's flu season, and a shortage
is possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the possibility of lower-than-expected
influenza vaccine supplies surfaced in an advisory panel meeting in
Atlanta, the agency said all four manufacturers of flu vaccine have
experienced problems growing one of the three strains of virus that
make up the flu shot.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers, who produced 85 million doses of vaccine last
year, have told the CDC a strain newly added to the vaccine this
year has reproduced more slowly than strains used in years past,
frustrating attempts to accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Food and Drug Administration has said two
manufacturers have additional production problems, though it has
not disclosed what those problems are.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be at least a month's delay in the start of mass
flu-shot campaigns, which usually run from October to mid-November
to allow recipients to develop immunity before the height of flu
season in late December and early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is clear is that there is going to be a
delay,'' said Dr. Keiji Fukuda chief of the epidemiology section in
CDC's influenza branch. ``It is clearly possible there may be a
shortage, and also possible there may not be one, which makes
planning difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall, which first became public in a June 23 meeting of
the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, comes in a
year when more people than ever have been asked to get flu shots.
Last April, the advisory panel published new guidelines urging
routine flu vaccination begin at age 50. Previously, shots were
recommended primarily for people older than 64.
</P>
<P>
   That change added a potential 4 million new recipients to the 76
million for whom the shot was already recommended, including 35
million Americans 65 and older, 2 million pregnant women, and 39
million people younger than 65 who have underlying health problems
that put them at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   In an average year, influenza causes approximately 20,000 deaths
and 110,000 hospitalizations in the United States. The past five
flu seasons have had above-average rates of illness and death; last
winter's was the worst of the five.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, flu accounts for more than 7 percent of
deaths per week during the flu season; at the peak of last year's
flu season, the proportion was more than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flu vaccinations are mostly distributed through health care
providers, businesses and churches. In Georgia, county and local
health departments buy and administer about 20 percent of the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The vaccine) is going to be late and there is very likely to
be a shortage,'' said Mike Chaney, immunization program manager
with the Georgia Division of Public Health, which advises the local
departments but does not buy or distribute flu vaccine. ``It's not
going to be an easy task trying to have folks understand that,
because they are used to just lining up in September and getting
that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC issued guidelines Thursday for managing the delay and
the potential shortage:
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that sponsor vaccination campaigns should delay
them until November. ``We have a pretty good chance then that
people will receive the vaccine in time to be prepared for the
upcoming flu season,'' Fukuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Health care workers, many of whom are offered flu vaccinations
by their employers, should seek to get the shot on their usual
schedule. ``They work most closely with lots of high-risk people,
when those people are particularly vulnerable,'' Fukuda said. ``We
want to make sure they aren't inadvertently transmitting the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are at potentially high risk of serious illness
from the flu, many of whom routinely receive flu shots from their
health care providers or when discharged from hospitals, should
also seek to have the shot on the usual schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Those considered at risk include people 65 and older; those with
underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart and lung
conditions, diabetes, kidney failure and suppressed immune systems
as a result of infection or medication; children younger than 18
who are on long-term aspirin therapy; and women who will be in the
second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season.
</P>
<P>
   The new recommendation to give shots to all adults 50 and older,
Fukuda said, was mostly aimed at capturing additional high-risk
patients: One-third of those over 50 have an underlying condition
that might put them at additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have a clearer idea of what is going on by the end
of the summer,'' he said. ``We expect some vaccine will be moving
out from the manufacturers by the end of July, but we won't have a
good handle on what to ultimately expect for another couple of
months.''

 &HT;    SENATE MOVES TOWARD VOTE TO REPEAL ESTATE TAX
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican-sponsored measure to phase out the
federal estate tax over the next decade appears headed for Senate
approval, despite veto threats from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senators spent much of Thursday debating and voting on competing
partisan plans to eliminate or modify the tax on assets left by the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans offered the same bill which overwhelmingly passed
the House last month. It would lower the estate tax rate, which
tops out at 55 percent, gradually and eliminate it after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death tax ... is unfair, it's un-American and it's
immoral,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, claiming repeal would
help preserve small businesses and family farms.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the Republican bill would mainly help the
richest people in America first and would offer little help to
small businesses and family farms for a decade. They offered a bill
that would increase the threshold on estates subject to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the first $675,000 of a person's estate _ $1.35
million per couple _ is exempt from tax. In most cases, small
businesses and family farms valued at less than $1.3 million _ $2.6
million for a couple _ also are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative would have raised the personal
exemption to $2 million per couple next year and $4 million by
2010. It would have raised the exemption for family-owned
businesses and farms to $4 million per couple next year and $8
million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative was rejected, 53-46, on a largely
party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of votes, senators:
</P>
<P>
   _ Approved elimination of the 3 percent telephone excise tax,
which dates from the Spanish-American War, and agreed to make the
business research and development tax credit permanent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agreed to roll back, from 85 percent to 50 percent, the amount
of Social Security benefits subject to federal income taxes. That
was the level of benefits subject to taxation prior to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rejected an amendment that would have suspended the 18.3-cent
federal gasoline tax for 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rejected an amendment to double, from $40 billion to $80
billion, the amount budgeted for a Medicare prescription drug
benefit.

NAACP MEMBERS HOPE MFUME'S SUCCESS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WILL
TRICKLE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BECHETTA JACKSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mention the name Kweisi Mfume and most
African-Americans will praise the former Maryland congressman for
the strong national image of the NAACP, the country's oldest and
largest civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, whose name means ``conquering son of kings,'' brought the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from a
$4 million deficit to a $2 million surplus, led an economic boycott
of South Carolina over the state's flying of the Confederate battle
flag and persuaded networks to increase the number of blacks on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the NAACP has gained a renewed sense of
energy and purpose. Now, as thousands of delegates return home from
the 91st annual convention, many face the daunting task of
breathing new life into the 1,700 branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening the effectiveness of sluggish chapters is vital if
the venerable organization is to be a powerful force in the 21st
Century, national leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, some branches have been criticized for lacking
visibility in the community and failing to take on issues of
importance to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Area chapters also struggle to attract new members _
particularly young people _ and too often rely on a core group to
carry out the work, members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our branches are like any other volunteer group,'' said Julian
Bond, the NAACP's chairman, who helped Mfume rejuvenate the
organization. ``We have various levels of engagement and activity.
Certainly, some of them are not as effective as others.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, Texas, membership has declined by about half
since the annual fee to join jumped from $10 to $30 about a year
ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing membership remains the biggest challenge facing the
chapter, said Fort Worth City Councilman Frank Moss, the branch
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of visibility is another obstacle for Fort Worth members.
Earlier this year, a group of ministers urged members to boost
their presence in the community. Fort Worth residents too often
fail to see how their lives are enhanced by the work of the local
branch, the ministers said at a round-table discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Moss agreed with the ministers. ``That's one of our problems,''
he said. ``We have not done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss described the Fort Worth branch as a stable organization
whose members have been involved for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need younger people to come in and help out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The branch in nearby Arlington, Texas, faces similar hurdles.
The organization has several dormant committees because there are
too few members to steer them, leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a shot in the arm just like a number of other
branches,'' said Arlington NAACP Branch President Rick L. Harris,
who started the organization in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said his chapter is struggling with membership at a time
of unprecedented prosperity because ``we have a lot of black folk
who think they have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something hurts them, or they are hit financially,''
Harris said, ``they don't seem to be motivated to join.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, turmoil has plagued the chapter during the past
decade. Chapter president Lee Alcorn has been suspended by the
national office three times for rule violations. Alcorn says most
people assume that local chapters are not doing anything
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas branch has held numerous protests without approval of
the national office, causing Alcorn's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take a laid-back approach to social change,'' he
said. ``We have to be out there on the front lines so people can
see what we're doing. That's the only way we can attract new
members.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mfume took over the organization, he urged local affiliates
to agitate for social change, not to just be another social club.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State NAACP Branch won a small victory recently when
Gov. George W. Bush removed a controversial plaque of the
Confederate flag from state Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this week the branch in Dallas suburb Grand Prairie
was recognized by the national office for doubling its youth
membership, president Ollie Dailey said. The Grand Prairie NAACP
has about 150 members on its youth council, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The branch also mounted a petition drive to get a police officer
fired after the officer fatally shot a mentally ill man in the city
a few years ago, and has fought against housing discrimination,
Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be visible in the community,'' he said. ``But people
have to understand that any organization is only as strong as its
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson B. Rivers III, national field director of the NAACP, said
the organization has never had as many members as it should, but
continues to make significant progress.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 140 college chapters at universities such as
Harvard, Princeton and Stanford, he said. Approximately 68,000 of
the organization's members are college and high school students.
And there are 450 youth councils around the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume urged branch leaders during the convention to implement a
bold plan in a few key areas and pursue them publicly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle in every community is different,'' he said.
``Whether it's voter registration, political education or job
discrimination, we have to be out there fighting for the betterment
of people of color. If all of our branches are addressing these and
other very vital issues, we can only grow stronger and more
powerful.''

AUNT EMILY, A VINTAGE LIMOUSINE, STILL DAZZLES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Idaho, Minn., Wash. Mass.)   By PAUL DUCHENE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ When people ask Michael Whitesel about his Aunt
Emily at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance next month, he'll
have all the answers. She has been part of his family for four
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Emily'' is a concours judge's term to describe huge,
stately conveyances that are sensible rather than sexy. Whitesel's
imposing aunt is a 1919 Cunningham limousine that his
great-grandfather bought new in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunningham certainly was sensible, in an imposing way. The
black-and-maroon giant is nearly 7 feet tall and 20 feet long. It
has survived more than 100,000 miles on mountainous gravel roads in
the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But it is especially noteworthy for having been in the same
family for nearly 81 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this car such an interesting story,'' said
Glenn Mounger, co-chairman of the Pebble Beach concours, an annual
event in California that is widely considered the most important
collector-car show in the world. ``We get one-family cars presented
from the 1950s and occasionally the '40s, but to get a car out of
the teens from the same family is very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounger brought the car to the attention of the Pebble Beach
selection committee, which invited Whitesel to this year's
50th-anniversary concours, set for Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The opulent oceanfront Lodge at Pebble Beach is far removed from
the Cunningham's rough-and-tumble domain in Wallace, Idaho, a
mining town that was the backdrop for the film ``Dante's Peak.''
</P>
<P>
   When Model T Fords sold for $525, Whitesel's great-grandfather,
Harry L. Day, paid cash for a car that cost 14 times as much: a
Cunningham Model 64 limousine with a separate, covered driver's
compartment. Whitesel still has the canceled check for $7,468.75,
dated Jan. 26, 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Day could afford it. His family owned the Hercules and Tamarack
silver mines, Idaho's biggest. From 1901 to 1925, the Hercules
alone yielded dividends estimated at nearly $20 million and at one
point produced 6 percent of the nation's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Day Mines reported wartime dividends of $2.9 million in 1916 and
$3.6 million in 1917, and although they dipped to $500,000 at the
war's end, the future must have seemed bright _ bright enough that
when he decided to buy a new automobile, he chose one of the most
handsome and expensive brands in America.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1907, Cunningham, of Rochester, N.Y., assembled
vehicles with Buffalo or Continental engines and then, in 1911, its
own four-cylinder units. But the company vaulted into the luxury
class with its V-8 of 1916, the same year it ceased making
horse-drawn carriages. Initially rated at 45 horsepower, the
442-cubic-inch flathead engine (twice the displacement of Ford's
famous V-8 of 1932) was tweaked by the late 1920s to produce 110
horsepower. Customers could choose two sizes of cars, with
wheelbases of either 132 or, like Whitesel's car, 142 inches.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Cunningham made cars from 1907 to 1936 (though the last
few years involved supplying custom bodies for Ford chassis).
Production ran as high as 200 cars a year, and at least 38 are
known to have survived. Cunningham did not bother with a dealer
network. If you wanted a car, you ordered it from the factory.
Harry Day, who had joined the exclusive Bohemian Club in San
Francisco, ordered his through the company's agent in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Cunninghams changed little from year to year, which suited their
conservative customers. If the buyers were finicky, the company was
more so, urging owners not to allow local garages to work on the
cars. If necessary, the factory would send a mechanic by train to
make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   When silver and lead prices plummeted with the Depression and
mining was halted, the car's 1932 license plates were not renewed.
The car was parked in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Henry L. Day, Harry's son, took over Day Mines Inc., and
capitalized on his analysis of the family empire, the subject of
his thesis for a degree at Harvard. He consolidated the company
holdings, buying less successful competitors, and by the end of
World War II owned 719 mining claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunningham was forgotten until the early 1970s, when a local
newspaper article led to a stream of interested buyers. Henry, by
then 71, decided to have the car restored. He contacted Bob
Larrabee in Clarkston, Wash., and a lively correspondence followed.
The work began in 1974 at Larrabee's shop rate of $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee, 65, recently recalled the job. ``It had been sitting
in a damp building since 1932,'' he said. ``Everything was rusted
and gummed up. The wheels wouldn't turn; the motor wouldn't turn.
The tires were flat and falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The project turned into a total ``frame off'' restoration. The
shop replaced woodwork and completely rebuilt the engine,
transmission and rear axle. The interior was usable after minor
repairs were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no parts for Cunninghams,'' Larrabee said.
``Everything was a challenge. We recast door handles, machined
everything ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   His original estimate for the job was $5,300; Day's records show
that the final figure was $20,027.69. But the men's relations
remained cordial even as the bill soared, and Larrabee kept a
detailed record book with photographs of each stage of the work.
Day wrote to tell the restorer how proud he was of the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry approved everything,'' Larrabee recalled. ``He came down
three or four times that year and sometimes brought relatives with
him. When the car was completed, he had me deliver it to Spokane,
and I rode with him to Coeur d'Alene.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Cunningham was finished, Whitesel, who is
Henry Day's grandson, fell in love with the huge old car _ proving
the adage that a collectible car can be defined as something you
rode in between the ages of 5 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 8 or 9 years old,'' said Whitesel, who is now 32 and
lives here. ``I remember he took us all for rides. Then, in 1983, I
rode with him in the Wallace centennial parade.'' Henry Day died in
1985 and Whitesel's mother had the car appraised, planning to sell
it. Its value was estimated at $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 17,'' Whitesel recalled. ``I begged her not to sell it.
I said, `I'll do anything!' Mom agreed that if I arranged insurance
and storage, she wouldn't sell the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it in a parking garage for a year, then in a museum in
Coeur d'Alene, then in an airplane hangar, then two and a half
years ago I shipped it to Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to keep the car and share it with the public when
possible, at events like Pebble Beach. ``I'm not much of a
knuckle-basher, but I have a fascination with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his wedding, in April 1997, he hired a chauffeur. He and his
bride left the church in the back of the maroon-and-black
Cunningham.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the national crisis over the burning of Black churches
has abated
</P>
<P>
   and the attention of the media is no longer focused on it, the
retreat of this
</P>
<P>
   news story from the spotlight may be a blessing. For the truth
is, an analysis
</P>
<P>
   of the nationwide phenomenon shows that newspapers did a
disturbingly poor job
</P>
<P>
   of explaining the church-burning ``conspiracy,'' reporting it
opaquely and
</P>
<P>
   strewing the issue with highly volatile implications,
particularly when it
</P>
<P>
   came to race.
</P>
<P>
   In short, news coverage of the idea of a conspiracy was unclear,
undefined,
</P>
<P>
   unenlightening, and it may have helped to escalate racial
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the story shows how easy it was for the
conspiracy idea to
</P>
<P>
   be picked up by the press. From January 1995 to December 1997,
at least 142
</P>
<P>
   largely Southern Black churches were set on fire by arsonists.
Federal law
</P>
<P>
   enforcement officials and the U.S. national media began to focus
on these
</P>
<P>
   arson-caused fires in the spring 1996, after their swelling
numbers became too
</P>
<P>
   difficult (and too regional) to ignore. Pressure on federal
officials to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the church burnings came from community leaders,
politicians and
</P>
<P>
   ministers, both Black and White, across the country. The
torching of almost 40
</P>
<P>
   Black churches in 11 Southern states over this 18-month period
signaled a
</P>
<P>
   crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The series of Black church burnings in the south has special
historical
</P>
<P>
   resonance. Many Americans saw the fires not only as racially
driven, but also
</P>
<P>
   as a stark reminder of America's dark era of racial strife in
the 1950s and
</P>
<P>
   1960s, when church burnings were a major form of White terrorism
against Black
</P>
<P>
   Americans. During the civil rights movement, scores of Black
churches that
</P>
<P>
   were rallying points for civil rights demonstrations were bombed
or set on
</P>
<P>
   fire. Black Americans tended to see church burnings as a symbol
and reminder
</P>
<P>
   of racist America as well as a sign of deteriorating race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights,
</P>
<P>
   labeled the Black church fires ``a wake-up call'' for Americans
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   the nation's race-relations issue. Berry reported that federal
investigations
</P>
<P>
   revealed 70 percent of the Southern Black church fires were
racially
</P>
<P>
   motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to growing outrage over the church fires, President
Clinton in
</P>
<P>
   June 1996 created the National Church Arson Task Force,
including 200 members
</P>
<P>
   from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI and
the U.S. Justice
</P>
<P>
   Department. It was the largest federal task force in history. A
major question
</P>
<P>
   federal officials explored was whether the Black church arsons
were set by
</P>
<P>
   racists, conspirators, copycats or others.
</P>
<P>
   Deval Patrick, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights,
who headed
</P>
<P>
   the church task force, said investigations revealed that race
was only one of
</P>
<P>
   several causes. He said some fires had been set by church
members trying
</P>
<P>
   fraudulently to collect insurance money, others by burglars and
some by
</P>
<P>
   pyromaniacs. In a handful of cases, he said, the arsonists
involved were in
</P>
<P>
   hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said investigation over a 15-month period found nothing
to show
</P>
<P>
   there was a national conspiracy targeting Black churches. Arsons
at White
</P>
<P>
   churches, he said, approached the number at Black churches, with
both taking
</P>
<P>
   place at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patrick said although no organized conspiracy was
found, ``an
</P>
<P>
   intense climate of racism behind the church fires'' did exist.
Profiles of
</P>
<P>
   those arrested, Patrick said, revealed they were generally
White, male and
</P>
<P>
   young, low-income, poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on
drugs, rarely
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism.
In other

tended to take

</P>
<P>
   even misled for a while, but given time, are able to right

UNDERSEA ROCK OFF EAST COAST MAY COLLAPSE AND CAUSE TIDAL WAVE,
STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geologists have long viewed the West Coast as the dynamic side
of North America, the shore where earthquakes, tidal waves and
other potentially dangerous geological forces are most likely to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   But there are increasing signs that the outer sloping edge of
the continental shelf along the East Coast has the potential to
cave in, possibly abruptly enough to send destructive tidal waves,
or tsunamis, speeding toward shore.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence comes in a study being published Friday in
the journal Science, which found that rock buried nearly 2,000 feet
under the seabed off New Jersey is so porous that it is actually
mostly water.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, and similar recent findings, do not suggest
that strollers on the Atlantic City boardwalk are in imminent
danger of being swept away by a tidal wave. But the findings do
suggest that the East Coast is far more geologically active than
had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   Just as stepping on a water-filled balloon can cause its sides
to bulge and burst, so too could the weight of rock over the soggy
sediments cause the water to blow out the side of the continental
slope, potentially causing an underwater landslide and subsequent
giant waves, the authors say.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the area studied, about 100 miles east of
Atlantic City, is particularly waterlogged, and thus particularly
unstable, because the deep layers of the shelf were formed in the
last Ice Age, when the Hudson River was a turbid torrent, laying
down enormous amounts of silt that trapped water as successive
layers accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system that's in a critical state because of those
fluid pressures,'' said Peter Flemings, a geologist at Pennsylvania
State University who wrote the paper with Brandon Dugan, a doctoral
candidate at the university. What is not yet known, Flemings said,
is if this condition will result in a succession of small crumbling
failures or in occasional canyon-carving, wave-spawning collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer models, the scientists calculated that the
pressure built up in deeply buried layers of porous rock is more
than sufficient to drive the water sideways until it breaks out the
side of the slope where the continent descends toward the deep
ocean bed. The pressure could explain muddy underwater geysers
found in some places along the deepest parts of the continental
slope, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings mesh with other research, including past surveys
from submarines of other parts of the Eastern continental slope
that found large ``slump scars,'' areas where the bottom slid away,
leaving gaping concavities like those left by an ice-cream scoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it generates a tsunami or tidal wave, we're not able
to say,'' said Peter Rona, a Rutgers University geologist who first
reported this condition when he explored the depths off the East
Coast in a research submarine 30 years ago. He said the new
analysis of fluid-filled rock layers off New Jersey provides a
possible explanation, but more work needs to be done to determine
the level of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is there is evidence that this has happened in
the past,'' Rona said, ``and some of these scars look fairly
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, another research team found cracks in the
continental slope off Virginia that also signaled the potential for
large submarine landslides, which are thought to spawn waves as the
water above suddenly sinks to fill a gap in the sea floor, sending
a pulse of energy shoreward.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings come on the heels of other work showing that
the threat from tsunamis comes not just from earthquakes, as has
long been thought, but also from underwater landslides that can
occur quite close to shore and can either be triggered by a small
quake or happen spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The last large destructive tidal wave, which killed more then
2,200 people along the northern coast of Papua New Guinea two years
ago, was apparently the result of a large underwater landslide that
was triggered by a moderate earthquake, scientists now say. The
earthquake alone was calculated to have only one-fifth the power
needed to spawn the 50-foot-high waves that swept the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the new study and others involved in similar work
stressed that there is not nearly enough evidence to predict that
something like the New Guinea tsunami could someday sweep the
boardwalk of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   But the Penn State team and other marine geologists said the
East Coast should no longer be considered a static place where the
only potential oceanic disasters are storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The literature of geology has called this area a passive
margin,'' Flemings said. ``There are no plates colliding or
anything like that. But the reality is that the rapid sedimentation
here created an environment where dynamic things are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was done on a core of rock taken by an
international oceanographic drilling ship in 1997. In successively
deeper, and older, layers of compressed clay and sand, the rock
becomes denser, but then _ nearly 2,000 feet down and 1 million
years back in time _ the rock becomes a soggy sediment that
contains up to 65 percent water.
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation for the sponginess at such depths is that
water, which cannot be compressed, is filling the pores and
supporting the rock above, Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   Costas Synolakis, an engineering professor and tsunami expert at
the University of Southern California who studied the New Guinea
disaster, said that the lesson being learned in all this research
is that tsunamis are not nearly as well understood as scientists
had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the discovery of soggy rock near New Jersey, he
said: ``I concur that this is kind of a textbook scenario. The only
thing is, we haven't written the textbooks yet.''

 &HT;    MEDIA IGNORED, THEN OVERSIMPLIFIED, BLACK CHURCH ARSONS (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``A'' and ``K'' categories)

 &HT;    By Sharon Bramlett-Solomon (a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the national crisis over the burning of Black churches
has abated
</P>
<P>
   and the attention of the media is no longer focused on it, the
retreat of this
</P>
<P>
   news story from the spotlight may be a blessing. For the truth
is, an analysis
</P>
<P>
   of the nationwide phenomenon shows that newspapers did a
disturbingly poor job
</P>
<P>
   of explaining the church-burning ``conspiracy,'' reporting it
opaquely and
</P>
<P>
   strewing the issue with highly volatile implications,
particularly when it
</P>
<P>
   came to race.
</P>
<P>
   In short, news coverage of the idea of a conspiracy was unclear,
undefined,
</P>
<P>
   unenlightening, and it may have helped to escalate racial
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the story shows how easy it was for the
conspiracy idea to
</P>
<P>
   be picked up by the press. From January 1995 to December 1997,
at least 142
</P>
<P>
   largely Southern Black churches were set on fire by arsonists.
Federal law
</P>
<P>
   enforcement officials and the U.S. national media began to focus
on these
</P>
<P>
   arson-caused fires in the spring 1996, after their swelling
numbers became too
</P>
<P>
   difficult (and too regional) to ignore. Pressure on federal
officials to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the church burnings came from community leaders,
politicians and
</P>
<P>
   ministers, both Black and White, across the country. The
torching of almost 40
</P>
<P>
   Black churches in 11 Southern states over this 18-month period
signaled a
</P>
<P>
   crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The series of Black church burnings in the south has special
historical
</P>
<P>
   resonance. Many Americans saw the fires not only as racially
driven, but also
</P>
<P>
   as a stark reminder of America's dark era of racial strife in
the 1950s and
</P>
<P>
   1960s, when church burnings were a major form of White terrorism
against Black
</P>
<P>
   Americans. During the civil rights movement, scores of Black
churches that
</P>
<P>
   were rallying points for civil rights demonstrations were bombed
or set on
</P>
<P>
   fire. Black Americans tended to see church burnings as a symbol
and reminder
</P>
<P>
   of racist America as well as a sign of deteriorating race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights,
</P>
<P>
   labeled the Black church fires ``a wake-up call'' for Americans
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   the nation's race-relations issue. Berry reported that federal
investigations
</P>
<P>
   revealed 70 percent of the Southern Black church fires were
racially
</P>
<P>
   motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to growing outrage over the church fires, President
Clinton in
</P>
<P>
   June 1996 created the National Church Arson Task Force,
including 200 members
</P>
<P>
   from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI and
the U.S. Justice
</P>
<P>
   Department. It was the largest federal task force in history. A
major question
</P>
<P>
   federal officials explored was whether the Black church arsons
were set by
</P>
<P>
   racists, conspirators, copycats or others.
</P>
<P>
   Deval Patrick, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights,
who headed
</P>
<P>
   the church task force, said investigations revealed that race
was only one of
</P>
<P>
   several causes. He said some fires had been set by church
members trying
</P>
<P>
   fraudulently to collect insurance money, others by burglars and
some by
</P>
<P>
   pyromaniacs. In a handful of cases, he said, the arsonists
involved were in
</P>
<P>
   hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said investigation over a 15-month period found nothing
to show
</P>
<P>
   there was a national conspiracy targeting Black churches. Arsons
at White
</P>
<P>
   churches, he said, approached the number at Black churches, with
both taking
</P>
<P>
   place at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patrick said although no organized conspiracy was
found, ``an
</P>
<P>
   intense climate of racism behind the church fires'' did exist.
Profiles of
</P>
<P>
   those arrested, Patrick said, revealed they were generally
White, male and
</P>
<P>
   young, low-income, poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on
drugs, rarely
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism.
In other
</P>
<P>
   words, although conspiracy theories were largely debunked by the
task force,
</P>
<P>
   racist motives were not.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent figures increased national press coverage. Clinton
drew media
</P>
<P>
   attention with a speech given at the site of a burned church in
June 1996 in
</P>
<P>
   Greelyville, S.C. He vowed that the church burnings would not be
tolerated and
</P>
<P>
   would be intensely investigated by federal officials.

 &HT;    Decision time for track and field athletesBy John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The first thing you notice as you dip down
out of a cloudless sky to land in Sacramento are the fields of
emerald near the city, their lush green a stark contrast to the
brown and crisp landscape of a Texas summer.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is mostly illusion. Just some irrigated rice
fields. Anything that isn't watered here is just so much refried
straw.
</P>
<P>
   It's hot here. Not Texas-style,
sear-your-hands-on-the-steering-wheel hot, but hot for California.
And that's just the 90-degree weather. Tickets for the U.S. Olympic
Track and Field Trials at the jazzed-up Sacramento State field are
hotter than that. And the competition, particularly between Michael
Johnson and Maurice Greene, could be downright scorching.
</P>
<P>
   Only once every four years do American sports fans pay the
attention they should to track and field, and that time is now.
With the Olympics a scant two months away, these trials will decide
who gets a chance to shine in Sydney and who's consigned to four
more years of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a virtual mini-series of Olympic drama. The most
anticipated event figures to be the showdown between world
record-holder and former Baylor star Michael Johnson and ``world's
fastest human'' Maurice Greene in the 200 meters. That should be
the showstopper a week from Sunday, but there's going to be a lot
of other compelling dramas along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest theme for the competition comes on the women's side,
where Marion Jones is trying to set herself up to win five gold
medals and make some serious Olympic history. In the long jump
competition, which begins today, one of her opponents is scheduled
to be the legendary Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who suddenly popped out
of retirement. The present vs. the past. And don't forget about the
future. Ychlindria Spears was also on the list of entrants. She's
not ready to beat the top names, but if you look at her high school
marks and theirs . . . well, UT, which figures to have the inside
track on Spears, could have quite a catch.
</P>
<P>
   The the high schooler who is drawing the most attention is
400-meter runner Monique Henderson, who clocked a 50.74 to torch
the California high school record. She's got a shot at being the
first high schooler to make the U.S. Olympic track team since 1976,
when Johnny ``Lam'' Jones of Lampasas ended up getting a gold in
the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 100 meters, contested this weekend, Jones' main
competition figures to be Inger Miller. But there's also a strong
Texas contingent headed by Carlette Guidry, whose been battling
another Texan, Chryste Gaines, since their high school showdown in
Memorial Stadium some 15 years ago. UT connections in the field
include Nanceen Perry and LaKeisha Backus.
</P>
<P>
   In all there's some three dozen athletes in the field who either
attended UT, went to high school in Austin or who at least train
part time in Austin. There's a lot more, including Johnson, with
connections to the state. They'll like it hot and that's exactly
what it is here for the U.S. Olympic Trials. In all, there are more
than 1,000 athletes battling for 117 potential slots on the U.S.
team.

BARAK AND ARAFAT HOLD IMPROMPTU MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-CLINTON) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ It appears that not everything happens as
scripted at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to their American hosts, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, held an impromptu
meeting at Arafat's cabin on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was not present, nor was Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, or any other American negotiator. The two
leaders, who have met each other on a number of occasions back
home, talked for about an hour before dinner, accompanied by some
of their negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of what was said was not described in the brief
account given by the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher,
who was scrambling on Thursday morning to find out details of what
went on.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that such an encounter took place was taken as a
sign that a serious effort was being made by the two sides to deal
with the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was also in contrast to the first Middle East
summit meeting at Camp David 22 years ago, when President Jimmy
Carter negotiated between the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, and
the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin. Then, Begin and Sadat
met in Carter's presence only, and after the third day refused to
even do that until the final treaty was signed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Clinton was confident enough to leave Camp
David for some previously scheduled events. He left the conference
in the hands of Albright until his return Thursday night in time
for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual conference of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore, Clinton asked for
prayers for a ``full, final and fair peace.'' He cited Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. as saying peace was more than the absence of war
but also the presence of justice and brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, apparently trying to broaden his seven-member delegation,
was joined in negotiations by Dan Meridor, the chairman of the
foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Meridor, a former member of the Likud party, lent more
conservative credentials to the Israeli team at a time when Barak
faces opposition at home from conservative and religious political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Camp David, three Palestinian leaders from the radical
wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization said they wanted to
meet with Arafat during the summit talks. Such an encounter would
break the rules of seclusion set down by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Their request appeared to be an attempt to warn Arafat that his
domestic constituency was not unified behind the goal of a peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department did not rule out such a meeting, saying
``provisions can be made to bring a limited group of people for a
brief time'' to the summit meeting. But so far, Boucher said, no
request had been received from the three Palestinians, who
represent the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the
Marxist Palestinian People's Party and the Popular Struggle Front.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was away, Albright met for an hour with Barak on
Thursday afternoon and then with the delegations of both sides.
Boucher studiously avoided any reference to what they talked about,
relying on the familiar vocabulary of the delegates ``grappling''
with the ``tough issues'' that need to be resolved for a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The actual content of those issues _ the borders of a
Palestinian state, the number of Israeli settlers on the West Bank,
the status of Palestinian refugees and the future status of
Jerusalem _ have not been mentioned at any of the briefings in the
last three days.

 &HT;    It's all down hill for Johnson
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Double gold, twice as nice as any other
sprinter's fastest fantasy, belonged to Michael Johnson in 1996. As
the U.S. Track and Field Trials begin today in Sacramento, the
question is whether the five-ring Olympic circus has lost any of
its magic for him.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, Johnson already gave the answer to that in May
to a group of reporters who were peppering him for information on
his newborn son, Sebastian. Are you getting enough sleep, Michael,
between running the track by day and walking the floors by night?
Yes. Has your life changed greatly, Michael, now that you and your
wife Kerry are parents? Yes, but only for the better. Will you make
a gift to the baby of your two Olympic gold medals from Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   Only here did Johnson stop and give genuine thought to his
response. Only here did he seek out the eyes of the questioner in
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can go get his own medals,'' Johnson said flatly, eliciting
great gales of laughter with a perfectly serious answer.
</P>
<P>
   Serious. Perfect. These are words that fit a man who gets more
done with seemingly less anxiety or fuss than any superstar athlete
in any sport at any time on any planet. Superman, that's what
people were calling him four years ago, when Johnson won the
Olympic 400-meter race with ease and followed that up with a
stunning world-record of 19.32 seconds in the 200. Easy to forget
how this legend began, though, with a shy teenager coming out for
his high school track team in Texas in a pair of black horn-rimmed
glasses better suited to Clark Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 33, has earned global admiration one stride at a time,
slowly at first, certainly at last.
</P>
<P>
   For all the disappointments of previous Olympic cycles _ he
broke a leg prior to the 1988 Trials and was floored by food
poisoning at the 1992 Barcelona Games _ the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
were a celebration of what can happen with a gifted athlete finally
hits his stride. Tonight Johnson helps open the Trials with an easy
cruise though the 400-meter heats. On July 23, the final day of the
meet, he'll close things down with a spark and a crackle in the
200-meter showcase. A top-three finish in the Sacramento races is
all Johnson needs to advance to September's Sydney Olympics and a
defense of his double gold. Ridiculous, though, to imagine that he
won't keep right on winning, no matter the setting, no matter the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta four years ago, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia ran 200
meters in 19.68 seconds, bettering the previous Olympic record.
With Johnson out front, however, raising both arms at the finish
line in salute to his own world-record effort, the spectacular
silver medalist could have stopped short of the tape and still gone
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Johnson said recently of his immediate
reaction to running a 19.32, a full four-tenths of a second faster
than a world record that had stood for 17 years. ``I also was
elated. There was a lot of emotion. I thought, 'OK, I've completed
the double. I've made history.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And now, four summers later, there are two unimaginable concepts
to consider. First, that Johnson is favored to pull a
double-double, winning the 200 and the 400 for a second consecutive
Olympics when no other man has won both events in a lifetime.
Second, that there are people who wish he wouldn't make it look so
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they're looking for somebody to beat me,'' said
Johnson, who once went eight years without losing at 400 meters.
``They're looking for great competition. They want to see a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Johnson get one at Sacramento? Well, anything is possible
in the pressurized environment of the U.S. Trials, but Johnson is
supremely confident. He set the world record in the 400 at the 1999
World Championships in Spain with a run of 43.18 and is talking now
about dropping it into the 42's. What's more, Johnson ran a 19.71
in his first 200 of the season, a March meet in South Africa. From
1979 until 1996, Pietro Mennea's 19.72 was the world record.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene, who earned the title of world's fastest man last
summer with a world record 100-meter run of 9.79 seconds, expects
to give Johnson a challenge in the 200 at the Trials. Greene won
the 200 at the 1999 World Championships, a race that Johnson
skipped while concentrating on the 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't really have to do anything extra,''
Johnson said in a preview of the Trials. ``With my experience, I
know exactly what to do, just go out and don't make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   You might even say it's all downhill from here for Johnson, who
described for reporters the sensation of charging around the final
curve to win the 200 at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid,'' he said, ``my dad made me a go-cart and I
could make it go really fast. There was a hill by my house and I
knew if I went downhill on the go-cart, I could go faster. So go
put a go-cart on top of a hill if you want to know how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like you've got a gear no one else has discovered, one would
think, and all that matters is keeping things steered in the right
direction.

 &HT;    Guidry running well, but a long shot to win medal
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Her resume includes two Olympic gold medals, a
World Championship gold medal, two U.S. Championship golds, an
American indoor record in the 200-meter dash and more NCAA titles
and All-America honors than anyone in the proud history of the
University of Texas women's track program.
</P>
<P>
   But does sprinter Carlette Guidry truly think her career has
been an unqualified success?
</P>
<P>
   Guidry says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Kearney isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney, the Texas women's track coach, has been Guidry's
personal coach since 1994. How much longer Guidry will compete is
uncertain, because the powerfully built Houstonian _ she was known
as ``Turbo'' when she arrived at UT in 1988 _ will turn 32 on Sept.
4, just 17 days before the start of the track competition at the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   If this is, indeed, Guidry's ``last big hurrah,'' in Kearney's
words, then Guidry seems determined to make it memorable. Kearney
believes the veteran sprinter is motivated to finish strong to make
up for a career that hasn't quite met her expectations, although
that's an opinion not necessarily shared by Guidry _ ``I've had a
great career. I'm really pleased with what I've done so far,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe Carlette feels she hasn't achieved all her
goals in athletics and is trying to redeem herself,'' she said.
``She's really disappointed with the outcome of things in 1996, but
it's also her whole career overall.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's been lacking?
</P>
<P>
   According to Kearney, individual Olympic gold medals. The two
Guidry has earned, in 1992 and 1996, came for her role on the U.S.
400-meter relay teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Games in '96 were especially bittersweet. Guidry won
the U.S. trials in the 200 in a career-best 22.14 seconds and was a
favorite in the Games, but was injured at a relay camp before the
Olympics. She finished eighth in the 200 finals in Atlanta, and ran
only in the prelims of the relay. That got her a medal when the
U.S. quartet crossed first in the finals, but she wasn't on the
awards stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really bothered her, watching them on the podium and
thinking it could have been her,'' Kearney said. ``She got a medal,
but it wasn't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an encouraging early summer, Guidry seems a long shot to
finally grab an Olympic individual gold. In her best event, the
100, her season-best time of 11.13 ranks 18th in the world and is
tied for eighth on the list of entries for the trials. In the 200,
she recorded a 22.90 indoors that ranks 13th among the trial
entries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Track &AMP; Field News has predicted Guidry will finish second
in the 100 at the trials. That would get her to Sydney because the
top three finishers in each event advance, providing they meet the
Olympic qualifying standard.
</P>
<P>
   The trials open today in Sacramento, Calif. The first round of
the 100 prelims are on tap, with the semifinals and finals on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Guidry wins an individual Olympic gold, it would represent a
tremendous upset. American Marion Jones, the world leader in both
short sprints, is the overwhelming favorite in the sprints in her
bid for five golds (100, 200, both relays and long jump). Also
expected to challenge for the gold is American Inger Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But Guidry is running with confidence, and it's been reflected
in her last two outings. She ran her 11.13 in winning the Oregon
Classic in Portland, then blazed to a wind-aided 11.06 winning time
at a meet in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real confident,'' she said ``This year I was able to
let a lot of stuff go and be receptive to Bev's teaching. I'm so
much better now than I was when I was young and just running on
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson Kearney has taught Guidry is to break down her
races into phases. Guidry doesn't have a hair-trigger start, but
Kearney has taught her not to panic if she gets behind early in a
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not a great starter, but I'm OK,'' Guidry said.
``I've learned I can get back in a race real fast if I don't panic.
In the past, I'd panic when I got behind early, and lose
everything. Staying composed is something Bev has really drilled
into my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted Kearney: ``I've built in safeguards for her all along her
race. When you have only one strategy and it doesn't go as planned,
it creates more opportunities for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry also has toned up physically through better eating
habits. Her weight, about 145 pounds on a 5-foot-7-inch frame, is
not substantially lower than the 152 pounds she maxed out at during
her college career (1988-92) at UT. But she's much more fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year I've had Carlette with no weight
problems,'' Kearney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know how big I was until I looked at pictures
from when I ran for UT,'' Guidry added. ``Weight-wise, it's not all
that much different than now, but it wasn't all muscle back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much has changed for Guidry since she came out of
Houston as one of the nation's top young prospects 12 years ago.
She doesn't want to contemplate her future in track until after the
Olympics, but she admits the possible finality of her career is
always lurking in her subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think about it a little bit,'' she said. ``I don't feel
old, though. I just feel I've matured a lot, and I know what to do
now, finally, to take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough for Guidry to supply the missing
ingredient of her career. Kearney, for one, isn't betting against
her despite the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes in herself more than she's worried about anyone
else,'' Kearney said. ``She's at her best physically, and she's a
lot more intense and focused than I've ever seen her. That can make
someone like Carlette Guidry very, very dangerous.''

AIDS STUDIES ON INFANTS APPEAR TO CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ A simple drug regimen may help protect
babies from infection by the AIDS virus, research reported Thursday
at the international AIDS conference found. In tests, the regimen
was given to women during labor and to their newborns in the first
three days of life.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears to be in conflict with a report of last week
that questioned the usefulness of another drug regimen, because it
found that the rates of infection from breast-feeding offset the
benefits of the treatment. In that study, about as many babies were
infected after 18 months as were saved from infection in the first
weeks of life.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies used different ways of analyzing data, and
leaders of the studies said they now need to resolve the apparent
conflict. ``There may also be more subtle reasons'' other than
methods for the differences in findings, said Dr. Joseph Perriens.
He led the study for UNAIDS, a joint U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said it would be September before they could meet
with virologists, epidemiologists, obstetricians, pediatricians and
other experts to determine what recommendations should be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is therefore premature to make policy decisions based on
this data,'' Perriens said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, health officials in Africa are in a quandry.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution of the conflict is critical because health officials
have looked to simple drug regimens to prevent infections from HIV,
the AIDS virus, in Africa where such rates are the highest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas of southern Africa, 30 percent of pregnant women
are infected; in South Africa itself, the rate exceeds 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If simple drug regimens work and could be widely used in Africa,
hundreds of thousands of babies could possibly be saved from
infection each year, proponents said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But if similar numbers of babies get HIV through breast-feeding,
such treatment would not be worth the cost and effort.
</P>
<P>
   Even if further analysis shows that the drug regimens work,
experts said it was imperative for researchers to find safer ways
for African women to breast-feed, which many do for two years or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The study that dimmed hopes of an overall benefit for Africa was
sponsored by the United Nations and involved a short course of two
drugs, AZT and 3TC (lamivudine). The drugs were given to the mother
for four weeks before her expected delivery and again during labor.
Then both mother and infant took the two drugs for one week after
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that after 18 months, the rate at which infants
acquired HIV through breast-feeding completely offset the benefits
of treating the mother and newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the study said that finding was a blow to the effort
to protect babies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After that paper was delivered at the AIDS conference, the
session moderator, Dr. Lynne Mofenson, of the National Institutes
of Health, called the findings of the study ``bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate report confused the picture by showing a clear
benefit. It was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., and conducted in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   It called for giving a single dose of the drug, nevirapine, to
women during labor and another dose to the newborn within three
days of birth.
</P>
<P>
   The more hopeful report extended findings from last year that
the therapy is nearly twice as effective in reducing transmission
of HIV from mothers to their newborns than a short course of the
drug AZT.
</P>
<P>
   After six to eight weeks, according to this study, mothers and
infants who received nevirapine had a much lower risk of HIV
transmission _ 42 percent less _ than those who took AZT.
</P>
<P>
   The new data on the same infants showed that after 12 months,
the reduction was 39 percent, and preliminary results showed after
18 months the reduction was 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But mothers continued to infect their babies through
breast-feeding during the follow-up period.
</P>
<P>
   In the nevirapine group, transmission rates were 11.8 percent at
six to eight weeks, and 15.7 percent at 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   For comparable periods, the figures were 20 percent and 24.1
percent in the group that received AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Women and infants tolerated both regimens well and will be
followed for five years, said the study's leaders, Dr. Brooks
Jackson of Johns Hopkins University and Prof. Francis Mmiro of
Mulago Hospital and Makerere University in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   More than 21,000 women give birth at the hospital each year, and
nearly 16 percent of them are HIV infected.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsoring National Institutes of Health said in a statement
that ``these findings further indicate that a short nevirapine
regimen is an effective, simple, and extremely low cost-method for
preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child in developing
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said South Africa should approve nevirapine for
prevention of mother-to-child transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Nevirapine is not approved for the prevention of HIV
transmission from mother to child. If approved, it will offer
practical advantages for use in Africa because it can be stored at
room temperature and a pediatric formulation was recently
introduced by its manufacturer, the German drug company, Boehringer
Ingelheim, which sells it as Viramune.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company said it would offer nevirapine free for
five years for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of
HIV in developing countries.

INSURERS DEFENDING SUITS CHARGING DISCRIMINATION IN PRICING
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ MetLife and Prudential Insurance have been accused in
two class action lawsuits of charging their black customers higher
premiums for life insurance coverage than they charged white
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed recently in federal District Courts in
New York and Newark, where the companies have their headquarters.
The companies said they stopped using race as a factor in life
insurance sales about 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said some of the discriminatory policies remained
in effect, but that they had stopped collecting premiums on them in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in no way reflective of MetLife's business today,''
said Kevin Foley, a spokesman for the New York company.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential said through a spokesman, Robert DeFillippo, that
while race had once been a factor in his company's sales, it was
now ``completely unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks ago, American General, the fourth-largest
life insurer, agreed to pay restitution of $206 million to settle a
class action lawsuit and claims from insurance regulators that for
decades the company charged black customers higher premiums than
whites, and that it often collected premiums from customers of all
races that exceeded the value of their insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is investigating four other companies for similar
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the lawsuits and investigation has been on policies
sold to poor people and designed to cover burial expenses. Premiums
of as little as a few cents or a few dollars were paid weekly or
monthly and death benefits were in the range of a few hundred or a
few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators around the country believe that more than 30
companies sold these policies and they suspect that many of them
discriminated against black customers. For years, actuarial tables
used by insurance companies were based on the assumption that
blacks had shorter life spans than whites. Now actuaries and
sociologists say that poverty rather than race led to shorter lives
for many of those against whom the companies discriminated.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential said that over several decades it had been increasing
the death benefits on policies for black customers who had paid
higher premiums or refunding the higher premiums. MetLife insisted
that it never had separate rates for blacks and whites, but that
being black was regarded as an additional risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were rated a high risk, white or black, you paid the
same price and got the same benefits,'' Foley, the MetLife
spokesman, said. He said he did not know whether the high risk
category was made up of more blacks than whites.
</P>
<P>
   John Stoia, a partner in the firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes
&AMP; Lerach, who has been working on both lawsuits with lawyers at
several other firms, said he hoped to get refunds or increased
death benefits for customers who paid higher rates for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Foley of MetLife said his company would ``defend itself against
the idea that MetLife was deceitful, that it defrauded
African-American policyholders or hid from them any facts necessary
for them to make their purchases.'' He added: ``There was no
economic loss on the part of any African-American policyholder who
bought a policy from us.''

DEFENSE RESTS IN BRANCH DAVIDIAN CIVIL TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: In 6th graf, ``this morning'' refers to Friday.) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO _ The government rested its case Thursday with the poignant
account of an FBI agent who tried but failed to save a woman from
the burning Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Agent James McGee took several pauses to compose himself as he
recounted how he tried to save Ruth Ottman Riddle. Riddle jumped
from the burning Mount Carmel compound the afternoon of April 19,
1993, but then went back into the flames rather than surrender to
federal authorities, McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   McGee said he repeatedly asked Riddle where the children were.
``She turned her head away from me,'' refusing to answer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had told me, I would have gone after them or died
trying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five children were among the 80 Davidians who died that
day with the sect's leader, David Koresh. Twenty of the victims had
been shot to death, one child was fatally stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Davidians and relatives filed a wrongful death
lawsuit against the U.S. government seeking $675 million. The jury
of three women and two men who are acting as advisers to U.S.
District Judge Walter Smith will hear closing arguments in the case
this morning. Smith limited the arguments to 90 minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   It may be several weeks before Smith renders a final verdict in
the case, which began June 20. The judge said he intends to wait
until he hears evidence on whether the FBI fired at the compound as
it burned.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will ask the jury to fill out a verdict form and advise
him on five questions:
</P>
<P>
   Did the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms use
excessive force on Feb. 23, 1993, by firing on the compound without
provocation or by firing indiscriminately?
</P>
<P>
   That was the day that four agents and six sect members were
killed in the initial shootout, which began when agents arrived to
search for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Was the FBI negligent in its use of tanks at the end of the
standoff to penetrate the buildings in order to insert tear gas?
</P>
<P>
   Was it negligent by starting or contributing to the spread of
the fire, or negligent by deciding to have no plan to fight a fire?
</P>
<P>
   Were the Branch Davidians negligent in resisting arrest when the
siege began or in setting fire to the compound?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if there was negligence, what percentage should be
assigned to either the FBI or the Davidians?
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Michael Caddell, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs, said Thursday that the questions posed by the judge
signal that his mind is already made up against the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said Smith's verdict form lumps the Davidians into one
group so the conduct of individuals, including Koresh or others who
may have promoted violence during the siege, can't be singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the jury sides with the Davidians, their verdict may
have no impact on Smith's final ruling, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unfortunate that after . . . having a jury sit through
four weeks of testimony that we're not going to ask the jury for
their opinions concerning the individuals within Mount Carmel.
That's something that most people would like to know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that the government agents may have
caused some of the fires, or that they caused so much structural
damage to the compound that they hindered escape and caused the
buildings to collapse on sect members _ most of whom were
nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that any children, and only one woman,
fired on federal agents, and none was involved in deliberately
setting fires when agents used armored vehicles to begin inserting
tear gas, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also argued that the government's plan to end the
siege was flawed because it didn't arrange for firefighting
equipment to be on hand when the tear gas was inserted.
</P>
<P>
   But special assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford called the
April 19 showdown a ``suicidal event'' brought on by the Davidians'
criminal acts and negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the agents were ``just doing their jobs.'' Despite
being shot at, they made saving the children their top priority, as
ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno, he said.

RETURNING FROM SECLUSION, BRADLEY ENDORSES GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., N.Y., N.J., Texas, Pa.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Bill Bradley emerged from months of political
seclusion Thursday to endorse Vice President Al Gore, his erstwhile
primary foe, and to help Gore appeal to independent voters here in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose bitter primary battle with Gore ended without his
winning a single state, used the words of Vince Lombardi, the
former coach of the Green Bay Packers, to say that he would work
for a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. ``Winning is
a team sport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for
president of the United States,'' Bradley told a crowd at an
old-fashioned amusement park on the shore of Lake Michigan. He
cited the vice president's leadership and his understanding of
technology, saying that that understanding would allow Gore to keep
the nation steady in an era of rapid change.
</P>
<P>
   Gore effusively praised Bradley for his ``high ideals,'' adding:
``There is no more passionate voice for justice and equality in all
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two Democrats were making up on stage, Gore's campaign
was engaged in the kind of political pounding of Gov. George W.
Bush's policies that Gore had employed so effectively against
Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign seized on news of a $750 million state budget
shortfall in Texas as evidence that Bush's proposal for a
$1.3-trillion tax cut for the nation over 10 years would derail the
roaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush wants to do for America what he's done for Texas _
go to Washington and spend our surplus and then more for
budget-busting tax cuts, and hope then that somehow it will all add
up,'' Gore declared. ``The last thing this country needs is an era
of Bush economics that brings us back to deficits, high interest
rates and high unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a sharp attack on Gore, saying that the vice
president did not understand the budget process in Texas and that
his state's budget shortfall would be covered by surplus tax
revenues. ``If Al Gore suggests a state with a surplus shouldn't
cut taxes then how can the American people count on Al Gore to cut
taxes when our nation has a surplus?'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But the main task of the day, at least for Gore, was to present
Bradley as an ally and win over the independent voters that
Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, appealed to in his own
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the first time that Bradley and Gore had met since
debating in Los Angeles on March 1. Bradley, who last fall
surprised the Gore campaign by gaining strong support in New
Hampshire and other critical states, was ultimately trounced by
Gore in every state in which they competed. Bradley dropped out of
the race on March 9, retaining his handful of delegates and not
issuing an explicit endorsement of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign has had trouble attracting the kind of
voters to whom Bradley appealed, particularly white men and
independents. And as the mid-August Democratic convention
approaches, officials said, the Gore camp has been ever more eager
to knit up the raveled Bradley relationship and aggressively court
the swing voters who are up for grabs in the Midwest battleground
states. ``I really appreciated Sen. Bradley's support,'' Gore told
supporters at the airport here after the event. ``This is one of
the most important days in the election.'' He added: ``He has a big
following and an even larger number that respect his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign chose this quaint set piece of Americana for
the long-awaited reunion for its picturesqueness and the chance to
reach swing voters. The crowd, which local police officials
estimated at about 3,500 people, was bolstered by Gore supporters
from organized labor, including the National Education Association
and the International Association of Fire Fighters. They have been
among Gore's most ardent supporters, and their presence reflected a
concern in the Gore camp that the event, given the animosity that
characterized their primary battle, could have gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the event appeared to go smoothly, even if there
was little warmth between the candidates and their staffs. None of
the Bradley aides is joining the Gore campaign, and the two
candidates did not make themselves available to reporters for
questioning after their speeches. Democratic officials said that
Bradley could not be available because he had to catch a plane
Thursday night to Italy, but there also was some grumbling among
Bradley backers that Gore had held the event in Wisconsin instead
of a state like New Jersey or New York, where Bradley is better
known and more popular.
</P>
<P>
   The two met privately at the airport here for 40 minutes, with
no aides present, before they appeared together and clasped hands
for the cameras. Gore aides said that Bradley would have a
prime-time speaking slot on the second night of the four-day
nominating convention and they expected Bradley to campaign on
behalf of Gore, but nothing had been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley alluded to the ``big'' issues he had
raised in the campaign _ racial strife, poverty, globalization _
and said that under Gore's leadership, ``we will come closer to
solving the problems I mentioned earlier than under the leadership
of Gov. George W. Bush. And it's not even a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was endorsing Gore because the vice president
understood technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of our future will depend on forces and
scientific breakthroughs that many Americans don't fully
understand,'' Bradley said. Putting in his own words an idea that
the Gore staff often asks its supporters to say in public, Bradley
added: ``It takes leadership to see the future as it could be and
then to set a direction and move our country toward it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Vice President Gore has a deep understanding of
those technological forces changing America. I know he will strive
to keep America ahead of those forces so that they maximize our
future for the greatest number of Americans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bradley was quite ready to step out seemed arguable.
Famously contemplative and reluctant to follow the traditional
norms of politics, he acknowledged somewhat wistfully in his speech
that his loss to Gore had been a deep disappointment, one that he
was chalking up to experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is what you get when you don't get what you really
wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their effort to present the Bradley endorsement
in the best possible light, the Gore team went to great lengths to
focus attention on the Texas budget, delivering reams of documents
and flying a policy aide from Washington and a state legislator
from Texas to Green Bay to brief reporters on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that his own proposals for balancing the budget and
paying down the debt, would maintain the current economic boom. He
added: ``Gov. Bush has a different priority _ massive tax breaks
for those who don't need them. Let's give Gov. Bush credit. He
practices what he preaches, in that his top priority for Texas'
budget surpluses was a big tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Pittsburgh, Bush responded to the
criticism by pointing out that President Clinton was planning to
sign a $15 billion supplemental appropriation for extra expenses in
the current budget year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Vice President Al Gore has got no credibility on an
issue like this,'' he said. ``On one hand he wants to launch an
attack. On the other hand President Clinton is doing the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that the shortfall resulted from unanticipated
Medicaid expenses and criminal justice costs, but he said the state
had plenty of money to cover those expenses. ``We still have a
surplus and we're going to have a surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later asked why Bush had made such a point of aggressively
rebutting Gore, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the governor,
pointed to the man who lost so badly to Gore in the primaries.
``Bush is not Bradley,'' Fleischer said. ``Bush will
counterpunch.''

TIME WARNER WINS BIDDING WAR FOR JACK WELCH BOOK WITH $7.1 MILLION
ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Trade Publishing Thursday acquired the
right to publish a book by Jack Welch, the widely-admired chairman
of General Electric Co., for a record advance of $7.1 million, more
than advances previously paid for books by Gen. Colin Powell or the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers involved in the bidding war for the proposal said the
extraordinarily high level of interest in the book reflected the
country's growing obsession with business and the stock market.
American are working more hours and, in an overheated job market,
seeking more rewarding work, said Carolyn Reidy, president of the
trade division at Simon &AMP; Schuster. Meanwhile the baby boom's
interest in saving for retirement has spread a new fascination with
the investing. The eye-popping sum also testified, they said, to a
masterful sales job by Welch himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a book that many of us have wanted to publish for
years _ a one of a kind book, by the kind of person who comes along
once in a century,'' said Maureen Egen, president of Time Warner
Trade Publishing, a unit of Time Warner Inc., who met with Welch
and bought the book. ``He is an amazing teacher _ just in the time
we spent with him we learned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the price _ believed to be a record for a one-time
work of nonfiction _ immediately drew skepticism from the people in
the book business. An executive at the Tattered Cover, a large
bookstore in Denver, and other editors in New York said they had
never heard of Welch. Others questioned the magnitude of the
advance. The contract includes only rights to sell the book in
North America, leaving Welch and his agent the right to sell
foreign rights and first-excerpt rights to others. Foreign rights
are expected to be very lucrative because Welch has attracted a
cult following among businessmen in some other countries, notably
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To pay off a $7.1 million advance on royalties would require
sales in North America of about 1.6 million hardcover books. Only
one or two titles a year sell more than one million copies. A
recent bestseller by Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
recently sold about half million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the first book to trade on Welch's reputation as a
business savant. A half dozen books have already tapped that
market, including ``Jack Welch and the GE Way'' and three other
books written by the author Mark Slater with Welch's extensive
cooperation. Their editor, Jeffrey Krames at McGraw Hill Companies,
said the titles of the Jack Welch library are among the company's
best sellers, with a total of about half a million copies in print
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The long shelf of Welch books has even drawn an anti-Welch
backlash _ ``At Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric,'' and ``The
Pursuit of Profit'' by Thomas F. Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Welch wanted to leave posterity his own account of his business
philosophy. At 64 years old, he will retire next year after a 20-
year stint at the helm of General Electric, after lifting the
company from a motley conglomerate with a market value of about $12
billion to one of the world's largest and most widely admired
companies with a market value of over $280 billion. As Welch
reminded prospective publishers in meetings last week, the company
has delivered shareholders a stunning average annual return over 20
percent during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Welch has teamed up to write the book with John A. Byrne, a
writer for Business Week magazine and the author of a critical book
about another hard-charging executive, Al Dunlop. Byrne two years
ago spent six months researching a profile of Welch for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   To sell the project, Welch tapped Mark Reiter, 48, a literary
agent with the predominantly sports marketing firm International
Management Group. Reiter is not a big name agent in the literary
world world but whose boss, Mark McCormack, IMG's founder, is a
friend of Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter wasted no time in closing a deal, in part to keep the
pressure on the bidders. He sent out a brief proposal for the book
along with Byrne's profile of his subject shortly before the fourth
of July. Immediately several publishers called in to try to make
pre-emptive bids. ``I didn't even need to read the proposal to know
I wanted to buy the book,'' said Stephen Ruben, who heads the
Doubleday-Currency business book imprint at Bertelsmann Group.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, Reiter called the long list of publishers to set a
minimum bid of $4 million. Four publishers made the cut and each
met for an hour Friday morning with Welch, his agent and writer at
the GE executive's New York office in Rockefeller Center office _
beginning with Warner, followed by HarperCollins, Doubleday and
finally Simon &AMP; Schuster. Welch's secretary concealed the list of
appointments so that none of the publishers knew the names of their
rivals. Each sent teams of about a half a dozen top executives.
Executives of Doubleday prepared a complete book jacket and
marketing plan to pitch to Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his shirt sleeves at a conference table, Welch, who
has bright blue eyes and speaks with a slight stutter, preferred
talking about his ideas about management over marketing details,
publishers said. Executives said Welch interrupted prepared
presentations. He caught them off guard by candidly challenging
them to top the other publishers' ideas. He took out a notepad to
draw diagrams illustrating such subjects as the challenges facing
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the one point, the conversation turned to Lee Iacocca, the
legendary chairman of Chrysler Motors whose autobiography sold 2.6
million copies in hardcover and 3.5 million in paperback in North
America. Welch told them that he would consider a book like
Iacocca's a failure, because it was about a personality rather than
ideas. Welch said he preferred the model of Alfred P. Sloan's ``My
Years With General Motors,'' which lives on as a business school
perennial.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding started Monday morning in flurry of phone calls to
Reiter's office. Bids rose through the day from $4.1 million to
$4.5 million, and from $4.5 million to $5.5 million. When the
bidding reached $6.5 _ the level of Colin Powell's advance for
worldwide rights _ - Doubleday and Simon &AMP; Schuster dropped out. At
$7.1 million, Welch and Reiter halted bidding to evaluate the two
finalists' marketing plans and get acquainted with their
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Welch will give his share of the advance to educational
charities. At a typical agent's commission of 15 percent, Reiter
will net about $1 million. But, of course, that does include the
foreign rights.

OUTSIDERS FLOCK TO VERMONT FOR CIVIL-UNION WEDDINGS

<P>
   PUTNEY, Vt. _ Three hours after landing at Logan International
Airport Thursday morning, John Ferrari and Henry Lloyd of Atlanta
clasped hands on a stranger's back lawn in this bucolic town,
looked each other in the eye, and pledged to remain united for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a few pleasantries with a justice of the peace they
had met five minutes earlier, the two men, wearing tennis shirts
and jeans, got into their rented SUV and whooshed back to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Like the typical Las Vegas wedding, it was just a couple of
out-of-staters getting hitched, with no cake, caterers or weeping
in-laws looking on. But unlike heterosexual newlyweds in Nevada,
when Ferrari and Lloyd's four-minute ceremony ended Thursday, they
knew their bond would not be legally recognized in their distant
home.
</P>
<P>
   So go civil unions in Vermont these days, two weeks after the
state implemented its landmark, controversial law allowing gay and
lesbian couples to live in a state of near-matrimony. According to
town clerks, justices of the peace, and those watching the novel
process unfold, the ``CU'' of Ferrari and Lloyd is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flatlanders,'' as outsiders are called here, constitute the
vast majority of couples who have so far entered into civil unions.
Vermont is the only state that recognizes them as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the ceremonies tend to be minutes-long, bare-bones
affairs, nearly all of which lack the now cliched images Americans
have come to expect when two people come together for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a societal model for this,'' said Ferrari, 39.
``We have to think through every little step and talk about whether
we want to do things the straight way or something totally
different. The only thing we knew was that we wanted to do this as
soon as possible. If a state comes along and says, `We're going to
legally acknowledge you,' you don't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, when civil unions became law, town clerks have
notified the Vermont Department of Health that they have issued 19
civil union licenses, 11 of which went to out-of-state couples,
said Linda Davis, who manages the department's vital records
division. Since small towns are required to notify the state only
once a month, some here believe that perhaps three or four times
more civil unions have actually taken place. Most of those have
been to out-of-staters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks from across Vermont are saying the same thing: It may be
Vermont's law, but those taking quick advantage tend to come from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the nationwide population of gay and
lesbian people, and you think about the fact that Vermont is the
only place it's available, I can see why out-of-state people would
be the majority,'' said Dorothy Mammen, coordinator of the Vermont
Freedom to Marry Task Force, which campaigned strongly for civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them who are doing it quickly may well have done a
commitment ceremony at home and yet whenever they do one of those,
there's no official recognition, so they're coming here to finish
what they have started.''
</P>
<P>
   If out-of-staters are making up the majority of couples entering
into civil unions, that does not necessarily mean Vermont's gay and
lesbian couples are uninterested, many here say. Some speculate
that many of Vermont's committed lesbian and gay partners are busy
planning more involved ceremonies, deciding which caterer to hire,
which band will play, and who will be invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think the law is in any jeopardy and I
think a lot of Vermonters know that,'' said Marc Awodey, a
Burlington justice of the peace who will have performed 11 civil
unions by the end of this weekend. But the fear that the law will
someday be revoked is ``something that prompted some (out-of-state
couples) to go ahead more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if some couples hope to get hitched while the hitching's
good, others hope to use their civil unions like a seed that they
will plant in their home states. Ferrari and Lloyd, who plan to
move to Southern California in the next few weeks, say they are
quite serious about using their union as a ``test case'' in their
new state, or joining other California couples already doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Westing, the Putney justice of the peace who performed
their ceremony, said other couples have told her the same thing.
``I don't get the sense that a lot of these couples are content to
accept that their civil union is only good in a state where they
don't even live.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such high-minded arguments, some observers here believe
much of what they're seeing is plain old spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vacation time, and let's face it, this is a really
popular state for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered couples
anyway,'' said Barbara Dozetos, editor of Out in the Mountains, a
monthly newspaper that caters to the state's gay and lesbian
community. ``Don't think some couples aren't just saying, `Let's do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari, a retired cabaret dancer and sales executive, and
Lloyd, a corporate executive, say they began discussing the
ceremony months ago, when it looked as though Vermont would succeed
in legalizing such unions. When July 1 finally arrived, Ferrari
said, they decided their time had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vermont was brave enough to accept us, we had to show
support for Vermont as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the couple spent countless hours contemplating
whether to enter into civil union, their simple ceremony Thursday
seemed to pack more emotional power than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize, of course, that this means you can't get rid of
me now,'' Lloyd, 45, said moments after the men were CU'd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what this means?'' Ferrari said, laughing. ``Gee,
maybe this was a bad idea after all.''

CONFEREES KEEP GUN-CONTROL BILL HOLSTERED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months after moms marched in Washington and
across the nation for stricter gun laws, legislation that would
curb access to weapons is stalled on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It has been over a year since the Columbine High School shooting
prompted Congress to enact measures to tighten federal gun laws.
Since then, additional legislation, which is attached to a juvenile
justice spending bill, has stagnated in a judiciary conference
committee charged with resolving differences between bills passed
in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee has met only once, last August, without
breakthroughs, despite recent congressional resolutions instructing
the committee to move quickly to iron out differences in the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe that that conference committee is
going to meet for the rest of the session,'' said a House
Democratic staff member. ``My impression is that the Republicans
are just trying to run out the clock for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates suggest frustration over the inaction will
show up in the voting booth in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bitterly disappointed by the inaction of Congress,''
said Nina Butts, an organizer of the Million Mom March in Austin
and lobbyist for Texans Against Gun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change the faces at the Texas capitol and in
Congress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Butts and other gun-control advocates think the issue could
prove decisive in voting decisions this fall among the thousands of
largely professional, suburban women who joined rallies in
Washington and 67 other cities in May.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, those voices and continued pressure from the Clinton
administration have failed to break the congressional deadlock.
Both the House and Senate have urged the committee to address
discrepancies in the two bills in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is waiting for Congress to act to close the
gun-show loophole that lets criminals and young people buy guns at
gun shows, no questions asked,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno
at an event held this past week &UR;  &LR; to encourage college students to
rally against gun violence on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Co., in April 1999, Vice President Al Gore placed a
tie-breaking vote to pass a Senate measure that would require
gun-show background checks, child safety locks on firearms and ban
the importation of large capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a scaled-down version of the legislation that
also would require background checks to be conducted at gun shows _
closing a loophole that allowed unregulated firearms purchases at
gun shows _ but shortened the deadline for completing background
checks at gun shows from the Senate's deadline of three business
days to 24 hours. Additionally, the House measure more narrowly
defined gun shows as events where guns alone are sold, which
critics claimed would allow unregulated gun purchases at smaller
venues.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican strategists say the gun issue
could determine who wins the elections in such battleground states
as Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom is that this cuts in the suburbs and that
it cuts with women and so on. The reality is that it cuts beyond
just the suburbs, and it cuts with men too, '' said Democratic
pollster Mark Mellman, who thinks the issue could play a decisive
role in the battle for control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans contend the polls show that only those who
want greater enforcement of existing gun laws, not new
restrictions, will actually base their voting decisions on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that when it comes to actual voting
behavior, the people who support gun rights always out-vote the
people who support more gun control,'' said Bill Pascoe, press
secretary at Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Pascoe said anti-control voters will bring their message to the
polls in November, which he anticipates will help Republicans in
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Republicans agree with the leadership view.
Congresswoman Constance Morella, R-Md., said the issue will draw
attention in the election, especially among suburban voters in the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking that guns be taken away from people. They can
still use them for hunting,'' she said, referring to the gun
lobby's concern that the legislation would restrict the
constitutional right of citizens to own a gun. ``We're asking for
appropriate restrictions that everyone can believe in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocacy groups hope to redirect the momentum from
the Million Mom March into voters education drives and other
grass-roots activities centered on the fall election. The
Washington-based Handgun Control political action committee also
plans to spend $2 million on the 2000 elections, and Texans Against
Gun Violence is seeking to raise $30,000 to spend on campaigns this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they're putting their eggs in the electoral
basket, and they're going to say voters don't care about this,''
said David Bernstein, a spokesperson for Handgun Control. ``We
think that's a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of more gun control also are mobilizing in local and
national campaigns. National Rifle Association Spokeman Bill Powers
said the 3.8 million members of the gun owners' rights organization
are sending record amounts of money to the group's political action
committee and signing up to get involved in campaign activities.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said it is still to early to discuss what actions the NRA
will take this fall, but ``members are very aware that this is a
very critical election year, and we're looking forward to
November.''

women in their late 20s and early 30s, Talbots began flirting with
trendier styles and shorter hemlines. The result was a marketing
flop. Not only did new styles fail to win over younger customers, but
they also alienated women who had been intensely loyal to Talbots for
years. Since 1997, Talbot's has returned to its classic roots and

COLOMBIA-MILITARY -- Armed men, more than 300 of them, marched into
the tiny village of El Salado, Colombia early on a Friday, went
straight to the basketball court that doubles as the main square,
announced themselves as members of Colombia's most feared
paramilitary group and with a list of names began summoning residents
for judgment. By the time they left late Sunday afternoon, they had
killed at least 36 people whom they accused of collaborating with the
enemy, left-wing guerrillas who have long been a presence in the
area. With most villagers having fled to nearby towns, a lone
resident remained in El Salado. (Larry Rohter/The New York Times)

-- Since 1947, Talbots Inc. has provided sensible wardrobes for women
between 35 and 55. In 1997, looking to broaden its appeal to include
women in their late 20s and early 30s, Talbots began flirting with
trendier styles and shorter hemlines. The result was a marketing
flop. Not only did new styles fail to win over younger customers, but
they also alienated women who had been intensely loyal to Talbots for
years. Since 1997, Talbot's has returned to its classic roots and
have become one of the hottest apparel retailers in the business
according to Wall Street analysts. Talbot's, chief executive officer,

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- July 13, 2000 -- CARRACCI-BAROQUE-2 -- In
the 1580s, Annibale Carracci, unhappy with the Mannerist preciosity
that dominated the art of his time, helped start an art academy that
pushed for a return to nature and the classical heritage of the great
Italian masters who preceded him, in particular Correggio, Veronese
and Titian. Carracci was considered one of the greatest draftsmen of
his age. He created a highly influential fresco cycle for the ceiling
of the Farnese Palace in Rome, that was lauded as the equal of
Raphael's work in the Vatican. "A Domestic Scene," probably from the
early 1580's by Carracci is featured in the exhibit, "The Birth of
Baroque: The Carracci at the Metropolitan," at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art/The New York Times)

pushed for a return to nature and the classical heritage of the great
Italian masters who preceded him, in particular Correggio, Veronese
and Titian. The academy developed a style which eventually became
known as Baroque. "The Lamentation," circa1582, by Carracci is

JOYNER-KERSEE TRIES TO MAKE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM A 5TH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Calif., Ga., N.C.)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The lasting image is of Jackie
Joyner-Kersee standing on the runway at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,
mired in sixth place in the long jump, one attempt remaining, her
right upper leg heavily bandaged from a hamstring injury. At one
point, she had even whacked the leg with the small mallet used to
set her mark on the runway, as if hammering the dent out of a
fender, trying to will the strained muscle into explosive
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is more there,'' she told herself on the infield
of the filled Olympic Stadium. ``Forget about the leg. This is it,
Jackie. You either attack the board or don't jump at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Attack she did, sailing from sixth place to third on what was to
be her farewell jump in the Summer Games, her valedictory
performance as the greatest athlete of her generation. Later,
Joyner-Kersee said the bronze medal was special, nearly as
rewarding as the two gold medals she had previously won in the
heptathlon and the gold she had won in 1988 in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had to work for this one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Joyner-Kersee retired, giving
professional basketball a short try, becoming a sports marketing
agent and running a foundation dedicated to providing sports
opportunities for youngsters in her hometown of East St. Louis,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But she could not stay away from track and field. Joyner-Kersee
will come out of retirement at age 38 to jump again at the Olympic
trials Friday night. She is seeking to make her fifth Olympic team.
Her presence could also throw up an impediment to Marion Jones'
attempt to win five gold medals at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a Jackie-Marion duel,'' said Bob Kersee, who is
Joyner-Kersee's coach and husband. ``Competing against Marion,
frankly even going after the gold medal, we've been there, done
that. What we haven't done is been on five Olympic teams. That's
the challenge. That's what we're excited about. The first thing is
to make the team, then you start worrying about trying to win a
medal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what to make of this comeback. The
qualifying round is Friday night; the final is Sunday.
Joyner-Kersee still holds the American record at 24 feet 7 inches.
In fact, she has delivered the top seven jumps by an American
woman. Yet, she has not jumped in two years, and her last attempt
was a mediocre 20-11}. She has been training seriously since late
March, Kersee said, but has not taken any full jumps, working
instead on the speed to her approach and her technique.
</P>
<P>
   One of two things will most likely happen. Either retirement has
healed her injuries and fresh legs will carry her sufficiently to
gain one of three spots on the Olympic team, or she will jump
poorly and pay for a moment of hubris. In either case, nothing has
happened this season to discourage Joyner-Kersee from believing
that she can make the American team and win another Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona May of Italy, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, has the
world's top jump at 23-3\. Jones is fifth on the world list with a
seasonal best of 22-10{, assured now that her unmatched sprinter's
speed can overcome the many inadequacies in her form. Her personal
best is 23-11}, and on any given attempt Jones is capable of
jumping breathtakingly far or frustratingly short.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I see in the long jump, between 22 and 23 feet is
capable of making the team,'' Kersee said. ``I feel a Jackie who is
healthy and on the mark still has that ability. I think we couldn't
sit home wondering whether we had a chance to make five Olympic
teams. As usual, we've got to go out and accept the challenge. From
what I see in terms of trajectory, I still think Jackie is a
23-foot jumper. I don't know that for sure. This is a new
experience for me as well. But Jackie has always set all the
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   She has jumped once against Jones at the national championships,
three years ago in Indianapolis, where Jones prevailed with a leap
of 22-9. Jones is the type of athlete who seems to thrive in the
cauldron of competition. Friday night, in addition to the long-jump
qualifying, she must run her first round of the 100 meters. While
Joyner-Kersee's presence could unnerve Jones, it could just as
easily propel her. The two are friends, and Jones has consulted
Joyner-Kersee for suggestions about smoothing the kinks in her own
awkward technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be wonderful if Jackie's going to be in the mix,''
Jones said recently. ``Jackie's going to be ready. She's not going
to come out here and jump 18 feet. I think one of the highlights of
my career was competing against her in '97. When the competition
starts, it'll be a free-for-all. I'm OK with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Joyner-Kersee, whose grandmother named her after Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis in hopes that she would grow up ``to be the first
lady of something,'' returns to the event that helped make her the
first lady of track and field. She first learned to long jump on
her front porch back in East St. Louis. She and her two sisters
would leap into a pit fashioned from sand carried from a nearby
park in discarded bags of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to see if I could do it,'' Joyner-Kersee
said. ``I've always admired Willye White, knowing that she was able
to do it. It would be an honor and would put me in a pretty
exclusive class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not consider herself to be a rival of Jones'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider her a friend. I'll be out there critiquing her,
seeing if there's anyway I can help her out, but she's the best we
have.''

TEN EVENTS, ONE PASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ If cynicism has replaced track and field as your
favorite sport, if your heart hardens a little more every time a
prominent name fails a drug test, have we got the athlete for you.
Avery Anderson is the antidote to the greed and immodesty and
performance-enhancing drug-taking that has poisoned so many people
on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a receiver at UCLA in the mid-1990s, is using money he
tucked away during a dalliance in the NFL to bankroll his life's
passion. That would be the decathlon, track and field's version of
``Survivor,'' a 10-event test of stamina and sanity that thins the
field of contenders over two days like some Darwinian selection
process until one disheveled winner emerges.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Anderson competed in a decathlon, a few weeks ago
during a meet on the Cal State Northridge field where he trains, he
surpassed the Olympic Trials qualifying standard. Other athletes
who have gathered here for the U.S. Olympic selection meet might
have higher profiles and lower odds of qualifying to compete in
Sydney. But arguably nobody who will grace Cal State Sacramento's
Hornet Field over the next 10 days has purer intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at UCLA, the decathlon was something as foreign to
me as the steeplechase,'' Anderson said the other day. An
accomplished high hurdler and high jumper as a collegian, ``I had
it in my mind even then that I wanted to do the decathlon some day.
I just looked at it as the ultimate challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 27, was holed up in the Indianapolis Colts' training
camp in Anderson, Ind., in the summer of 1996 when decathlete Dan
O'Brien struck Olympic gold in Atlanta. Anderson was an undrafted
rookie trying to make a mighty impression on the Colts, and yet he
couldn't ignore the impact O'Brien's performance was having on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on the track (in Atlanta) really bad,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Right then and there he drew up a master play for himself. It
was an end-around run. Eventually, Anderson was going to cut
against the grain and leave himself terribly exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he was going to choose the decathlon over football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself I only wanted to play football a few years,
make some money and then come back to the decathlon,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately arrived sooner than he had planned. Later in his
rookie training camp, he caught a pass and fell awkwardly to the
ground and his back compressed like a crushed aluminum can.
</P>
<P>
   It would be three months before Anderson could stand up straight
without pain rocketing up to his temples. He would spend the 1996
season on the sidelines. The Colts, who had signed him to an NFL
minimum contract his first week in training camp, would continue
paying him, but he never played a down for them.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson invested his money well, and, at length, he took stock
in his future. He devoted his days to working himself back into
shape, not for another shot at the NFL but so he could put the shot
and throw the javelin and the discus and jump long and high and run
the hurdles, the 400 meters, the 100 and the 1,500 and (pole) vault
into national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   His friends in football thought he had gone stark-raving mad. If
you're fit enough to train for the decathlon, they counseled him,
surely you're fit enough to play football somewhere, in Canada or
in Europe if not in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   His friends obviously didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Home Depot manager who interviewed Anderson for
a part-time job. He was happy to hire him, even if he couldn't, for
the life of him, understand why a guy who once made the NFL minimum
was willing to work for little more than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question myself every time I have to buy a javelin or $100
specialty shoes,'' Anderson said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   What can he say? He's hooked. ``I love what I'm doing. As hard
as it has been to learn all these new events, I wouldn't go back to
football for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson amassed 7,952 points in his decathlon debut, the
10th-best mark among the Trials entrants. While not as impressive
as Jim Thorpe's first effort (he won the gold medal at the 1912
Olympics and set a world record), Anderson's performance put the
decathlon world on notice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new kid on the track and for all his inexperience,
Anderson can say he has competed in as many decathlons since the
1996 Olympics as O'Brien, who is back after being beset by injuries
and ennui.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson realizes he is a long shot to earn one of the three
Olympic berths. He figures 8,500 points will do it. Where he'll
find those extra 548 points, he's not sure. But, hey, stranger
things have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been training for the decathlon longer than
two-time Olympic gold medalist Bob Mathias, who qualified for the
1948 U.S. Olympic team three months after taking up the event. And
Anderson's background isn't all that different from Jim Bausch's.
Bausch was a football star at Kansas who took up the decathlon and
struck gold at the 1932 Olympics in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson makes the Olympic team, fantastic. And if he
doesn't? ``If it doesn't happen for me, if I bomb, I won't feel
like I failed,'' Anderson said. ``I'll just happily go back to
training and go back to work at Home Depot. Whatever happens, I
have peace of mind. I'm doing something I love.''

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Episcopalians put more pressure on Thursday on the conservative
Diocese of Fort Worth and two other dioceses nationwide to accept
women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth delegation walked out in protest at the national
convention in
Denver after the House of Deputies overwhelmingly approved a
resolution for an action plan by Sept. 1, 2002, to make sure that
Fort Worth and dioceses in Illinois and California comply with
church law making it mandatory to accept female priests.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution will be voted on Friday by the House of Bishops,
who must concur for it to go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nearly 30-year-old church law on acceptance of
female priests, Fort Worth and the diocese of Quincy, Ill., still
have none. San Joaquin in northern California recently began
accepting women.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of clergy and lay representatives at the convention
passed a resolution that would set up a task force to ``assist''
the three dioceses in complying with the church law. If a diocese
is ruled to be out of compliance, congregants may seek to oust the
bishop _ a long and complicated process.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was heartily opposed by the Rev. Canon Charles
Hough, clergy leader of the Fort Worth House of Deputies
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Hough, who led Fort Worth's walkout, said at a news conference,
``We are disappointed by what has transpired here today. We are not
surprised. We've been fighting this battle for as long as this
diocese has been in existence _ 17 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the walkout, Hough declared: ``We weren't walking out
of the church. ... We're not leaving the Episcopal Church. ... We
went back to pray because that's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hough said that some Episcopalians in Fort Worth and other
dioceses believe that appointing female priests is contrary to the
Bible and against church tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being singled out, and now we're being persecuted for
matters of conscience,'' he said. ``What we are pleading for in
this convention is tolerance and toleration.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rehill, a delegate from Newark, N.J., was among those
urging the House of Deputies to force compliance of laws on
acceptance of female priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall that three years ago there were four dioceses who
would not accept the ordination of women,'' Rehill said. ``Now
there are three. Progress has been made. There should be none.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Episcopal Bishop Jack Iker, one of the church's last
holdouts in accepting female priests, is expected to strongly
oppose the resolution when it is brought up in the House of Bishops
on Friday. He oversees a 23-county diocese with about 19,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be one more step to enforce the canon requiring
women's ordination,'' church spokesman Jim Solheim said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution noted the ``lack of progress'' in acceptance of
female priests in the Fort Worth diocese, as well as in Quincy,
Ill., where the bishop is Keith Ackerman, a former Arlington
priest.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of San Joaquin is making ``progress,'' the
resolution acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Iker contends that the Fort Worth diocese is in reasonable
compliance with church laws on female priests under an unusual
cooperative agreement with the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman in the Fort Worth diocese feels called to the
priesthood, she is put under the direction of Dallas Episcopal
Bishop Jack Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Iker's plan also allows any church in the Fort Worth diocese to
accept a female priest. To do so, however, that church would have
to become a part of the Dallas Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Female deacons who are preparing to become full-fledged priests
have been allowed to work in churches in the Fort Worth diocese,
Hough noted.
</P>
<P>
   But Katie Sherrod, a Fort Worth resident and member of the
Episcopal Women's Caucus, a group that supports women's ordination,
said that the diocese's stand has led some couples to be married in
other denominations and some families to refuse to have their
daughters confirmed in the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel we need the ministry of female priests in our
diocese,'' said Sherrod, a former Star-Telegram columnist.

NEW YORK TESTS CREDIT CARDS IN CABS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cash transactions could soon become optional at of
one of their few remaining strongholds: yellow cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission
said Thursday that 50 yellow cabs have been cruising the city for
the last three weeks with devices that allow riders to pay their
fares with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program is likely to introduce hundreds more
credit-card-friendly cabs to the streets in the next six months,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something we've been thinking about for a while,'' the
Taxi and Limousine commissioner, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, said at a
news conference. ``The technology is available and we're able to do
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology, developed by a company in Queens, links a
credit-card reader to a modified taximeter. Riders can slide their
Visa, Mastercard or American Express cards through a reader near
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The card reader is also connected to a modem that operates on a
cell phone frequency. The apparatus can get an approval of the
passenger's card during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ride, the meter prints a receipt with the fare
amount and blank lines for tolls and tip. Riders fill those out and
hand the receipt back to the driver, who enters the total into the
meter.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who work for fleets can get cash for their credit-card
fares whenever they return to their garages. Nevertheless, some
cabbies seemed hesitant about the new system.
</P>
<P>
   One, Zahoor Ahmed, said he goes into his Brooklyn garage only
once a week, and he could not wait that long to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents more than
2,000 drivers, is also opposed to the credit system. It fears that
the cost of the technology will be passed along to the drivers
through higher cab-leasing fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no benefit in this for the drivers, said Bhairavi
Desai, a leader of the drivers' group.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the technology say fleet drivers do not incur
any costs by accepting credit cards. Instead, taxi owners and
owner-drivers who choose to adopt the system have to pay $550 to
$950 per cab for installation. The cab owner also pays a monthly
fee for the modem's cellular connection and a fee for each
transaction _ 25 cents plus 1.53 percent of the amount charged on
Visa and Mastercard. A spokesman for American Express declined to
disclose that company's fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win all around,'' said Bruce Schaller, an
independent taxi industry consultant based in Brooklyn. ``It's good
for the customer, it's good for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 50 yellow cabs in New York that now take credit
cards are owned by Ronart Leasing Corp. in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Levine, vice president of Ronart, said he believes that
many people going to and from airports are using radio-dispatched
limousines instead of yellow cabs because they want to pay with
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But Levine, whose fleet has 246 cabs, said reaction to the
technology is mixed among fleet owners. Smaller fleets probably
cannot afford the devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities, including San Diego and Los Angeles, have used
similar credit card systems in many cabs for years, Schaller said.

COLOMBIA-MILITARY -- Armed men, more than 300 of them, marched into
the tiny village of El Salado, Colombia early on a Friday, went
straight to the basketball court that doubles as the main square,
announced themselves as members of Colombia's most feared
paramilitary group and with a list of names began summoning residents
for judgment. By the time they left late Sunday afternoon, they had
killed at least 36 people whom they accused of collaborating with the
enemy, left-wing guerrillas who have long been a presence in the
area. With most villagers having fled to nearby towns, a lone
resident remained in El Salado. (Larry Rohter/The New York Times)

-- Since 1947, Talbots Inc. has provided sensible wardrobes for women
between 35 and 55. In 1997, looking to broaden its appeal to include
women in their late 20s and early 30s, Talbots began flirting with
trendier styles and shorter hemlines. The result was a marketing
flop. Not only did new styles fail to win over younger customers, but
they also alienated women who had been intensely loyal to Talbots for
years. Since 1997, Talbot's has returned to its classic roots and
have become one of the hottest apparel retailers in the business
according to Wall Street analysts. Talbot's, chief executive officer,

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- July 13, 2000 -- CARRACCI-BAROQUE-2 -- In
the 1580s, Annibale Carracci, unhappy with the Mannerist preciosity
that dominated the art of his time, helped start an art academy that
pushed for a return to nature and the classical heritage of the great
Italian masters who preceded him, in particular Correggio, Veronese
and Titian. Carracci was considered one of the greatest draftsmen of
his age. He created a highly influential fresco cycle for the ceiling
of the Farnese Palace in Rome, that was lauded as the equal of
Raphael's work in the Vatican. "A Domestic Scene," probably from the
early 1580's by Carracci is featured in the exhibit, "The Birth of
Baroque: The Carracci at the Metropolitan," at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art/The New York Times)

pushed for a return to nature and the classical heritage of the great
Italian masters who preceded him, in particular Correggio, Veronese
and Titian. The academy developed a style which eventually became
known as Baroque. "The Lamentation," circa1582, by Carracci is

production of "Das Rheingold," produced by Valery Gergiev. For a

VIETNAM AND THE U.S. SIGN `HISTORIC' TRADE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what President Clinton described Thursday as a
``historic step in normalization, reconciliation and healing,'' the
United States and Vietnam signed a lengthy trade agreement that, if
put into effect fully, would transform America's onetime enemy from
a quasi-socialist redoubt into Asia's newest capitalist recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-page accord covers bank branches, customs fees,
publication of laws and regulations, and tariffs on onions, garlic,
potatoes and cheese among many other goods, services and investment
protections _ a prescription for economic overhaul that
substantially curtails the power of Vietnam's Communist Party over
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, with its small, troubled and highly protected economy,
risks much more than the United States. But the agreement requires
the United States to reduce its tariffs on Vietnamese imports
substantially, a concession that has often proved a tough sell in
Congress. It is unlikely that Congress will vote on the measure
during Clinton's term, however.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and
Vietnam's trade minister, Vu Khoan, signed the agreement Thursday
afternoon. At a Rose Garden ceremony shortly after the signing,
Clinton, flanked by several Vietnam War veterans who now serve in
Congress, hailed the trade deal as a vital step in resuming full
ties. Clinton normalized diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bitter past, we plant the seeds of a better future,''
Clinton said. ``This agreement is one more reminder that former
adversaries can come together to find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Hanoi have been trying to seal their first
postwar trade accord for nearly five years, about as much time as
it took them to sign the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973, which led
to the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Hanoi balked at
American demands several times and walked away from a completed
agreement last year, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnamese officials became far more flexible in June, just
after the House voted to grant China, Vietnam's neighbor, rival and
fellow communist reformer, coveted trading rights in the American
market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that China's pending
accession to the World Trade Organization and signs that Vietnam's
economy had stagnated convinced Vietnamese leaders that the time
had come to inject some capitalist energy into the economy akin to
the initial wave of reforms that began in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a confluence of factors, and China was clearly an
important one,'' Barshefsky said Thursday. ``This will deepen and
accelerate economic reforms, strengthen the rule of law, and help
Vietnam integrate itself into the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement shows that Vietnam insisted on a comfortable grace
period to allow its companies to adjust to foreign competition.
Though American retailers can enter the market there for the first
time, they will be limited to a single retail store indefinitely.
Vietnam would allow American financial companies to issue credit
cards, but only eight years after the agreement takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   In businesses that might affect Vietnam's ability to exercise
political control, including phone and Internet services, foreign
companies will have to wait at least three years before they can
begin to enter joint-venture agreements with local partners, and
then they will be allowed to take only minority equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The changes Vietnam has agreed to undertake are similar to those
China pledged to make, but the pace is often slower. There are a
few exceptions: Vietnam has agreed to allow foreign banks to take
deposits and make loans in local currency, the dong, relatively
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle A. Thayer, an expert on Vietnam at the Asia-Pacific
Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, said top leaders clearly
decided to mimic Chinese-style market-openings, gambling that they
can maintain party control just as their northern counterparts
have. But he said the agreement takes away much of the flexibility
the leaders have to dictate the scope and the speed of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they drag their feet this time, they are going to be facing
legal guerrilla warfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will not take effect at all unless Congress
approves the measure and awards Vietnam so-called normal trade
relations, subject to annual review. Though Clinton administration
officials predicted that Congress would embrace the idea of
normalizing economic ties, labor unions quickly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have long demanded that developing countries accept
international labor standards as part of market-opening trade
agreements. This accord, like others negotiated by the Clinton
administration, does not contain language to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed that they did not even attempt to
address worker rights,'' said Thea Lee, a top official at the
AFL-CIO. ``This is just another agreement that encourages American
companies to move their jobs overseas.''

STUDY CORRELATES HUMAN ACTIVITIES WITH GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new analysis of the climate of the last 1,000 years suggests
that human activity is the dominant force behind the sharp global
warming trend seen in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Thomas Crowley, a geologist at Texas A&AMP;M
University, found that natural factors, like fluctuations in
sunshine or volcanic activity, were powerful influences on
temperatures in past centuries. But he found that they account for
only 25 percent of the warming since 1900. The lion's share, he
said, can be attributed to human influences, particularly to rising
levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping ``greenhouse
gases'' that come from the burning of fuels and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``These twin lines of evidence provide further support for the
idea that the greenhouse effect is already here,'' Crowley wrote in
describing the work in Friday's issue of the journal Science.
Several climate experts said his findings offer the most direct
link yet between people and the 1.1 degree rise in average global
temperature over the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study has already sparked debate among camps of scientists
who dispute the climate records used in Crowley's analysis, and
others who say the oceans play an underappreciated role in
controlling warming and cooling of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But many climatologists said it marked a substantial move
forward in understanding forces that have warmed the earth and are
likely to continue warming it.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving this puzzle _ the balance between human and natural
influences _ has been something of a holy grail in atmospheric
science, particularly because the answer could determine whether
countries enact plans in coming years to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, many scientists said that Crowley's work, while not
definitive, was helping build a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to reinforce the notion that we're into a new mode
beyond simple natural forcing, that something else is taking
place,'' said Raymond Bradley, the director of the Climate System
Research Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logical conclusion is there is some role played'' by human
affairs, added Bradley, whose studies of past climates were one of
the yardsticks used to measure the reliability of the new work.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a slow shift toward this conclusion in the last
few years. In April, for example, the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international group
whose work has largely shaped the debate on the issue for a decade,
circulated a draft of its next report on global warming, saying
``there has been a discernable human influence on global climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the main value Crowley's study was his specific
description of the limited role of natural forces in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate commentary, also published in Science, Michael
Mann, a climate expert at the University of Virginia and a research
partner with Bradley, said the new work also indirectly confirms
that computer models that predict a continuation of the warming in
coming decades are reasonably reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The news cheered environmental officials at the White House who
have backed action to control greenhouse emissions, particularly
because diplomats will meet again this fall to debate ways to put
into practice the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997
agreement outlining a plan to cut greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Lane, a physicist who is the presidential science adviser,
said in an interview that it was important not to overplay the
study, which relied on a fairly simple computer model and estimated
variations in the sun's power that were, at best, rough
approximations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study largely correlates with work by Mann and
others that used different methods but reached similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists will debate whether this is the smoking gun,'' Lane
said. ``But it's clear that the changes we've seen in this century
are unprecedented in the last thousand years. This argues for
prudent action to stem the growth of greenhouse gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the global warming theory quickly took note of the
work, but mainly to poke at its weaknesses. For example, S. Fred
Singer, the president of Science &AMP; Environmental Policy Project, a
private consulting group in Virginia, said Crowley had drawn
precise conclusions from imprecise calculations.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists defended Crowley's approach.
</P>
<P>
   The initial goal in the work, Crowley said, was to gain a better
understanding of how natural influences were shaping past global
temperatures, which have included a variety of shifts ranging from
a medieval warming to a prolonged cooling from the 1600s to the
1800s that is called the Little Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most important factors are changes in the radiation
flowing from the sun, which is thought to follow many complex
cycles, and volcanoes, which temporarily cool the earth by lofting
a veil of fine sulfate droplets that reflect sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley found that past variations in the radiance of the sun or
bursts of volcanic activity, when fed into a computer model
simulating the flow of energy to and from the earth, produced
temperatures that match most of the ups and downs of the actual
climate from the year 1000 to the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   But that neat relationship among sunlight, eruptions and
temperature broke down completely in the 20th century, he reported.
The only ``forcing'' that remotely matched the jump in temperatures
seen in the latter half of the century was the rise in emissions of
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley himself noted that his model was rough: For example, he
said, past solar variation is only indirectly recorded, partly in
traces of elements found in old glacial ice that were made as
radiation from the sun and other stars bombarded the atmosphere,
and partly in observations by Galileo and subsequent astronomers
who charted sunspot activity from 1610 on.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the good correlation between his work and other recent
reconstructions of past climates prompted a variety of climate
experts to say the study was valid. a big step forward.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study, to be published Saturday in Geophysical
Research Letters, an influential journal, largely echoes Crowley's
assertion that human actions are dominating current climate shifts.
But the second study cautions that other, natural factors could
stall further warming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the authors of that report, Michael Schlesinger, a
climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
said it was particularly important for policy makers and the public
not to assume that temperature trends will follow a smooth course.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the relationship between the oceans and the
atmosphere is so complex that alterations in it could easily cause
temporary cool periods or other unpredictable _ and possibly abrupt
_ changes that could create confusion and paralyze work to attack
global warming.

WORLDCOM AND SPRINT END THEIR $115 BILLION MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for a complete rewrite. Note new byline.) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldCom Inc. and the Sprint Corp. officially abandoned their
$115 billion merger Thursday, bowing to pressure from regulators,
who were concerned that the creation of such a large
telecommunications company would stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Far from dampening the outlook for ever-larger communications
concerns, the dissolution of the agreement, which had been expected
for several days, fueled speculation about consolidation among
large telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both WorldCom and Sprint were mentioned as potential takeover
targets, with British Telecommunications and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone reported to be in talks with WorldCom. Sprint, meanwhile,
was said to be considering an overture made by Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in WorldCom rose to their highest level in more than four
months, adding $3.4375, to $47.9375, while Sprint rose 68.75 cents,
to $48.
</P>
<P>
   While the companies mentioned in the reports played down
speculation that they were negotiating or declined to comment,
analysts were quickly redrawing the possible map of the U.S.
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, acquisition intensity is sure to grow,'' said
Sajai Krishnan, a partner in the San Francisco office of Booz Allen
&AMP; Hamilton, a consulting firm. ``It's clear that in today's world
you need to have control of the entire network.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom would have moved closer to that vision had it succeeded
in acquiring Sprint, which is coveted for its fast-growing wireless
unit and its capability of handling large amounts of data over its
Internet network. WorldCom grew through more than 70 takeovers
during the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in both the United States and Europe, though, opposed
the Sprint deal as they became wary of the effect the merged
enterprises might have on the market for long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why regulators were pushed out of their comfort zone on this
particular deal will probably seem strange a year or two from
now,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, having WorldCom, the No. 2 long-distance phone
company behind AT&AMP;T, acquire the No. 3 long-distance company,
Sprint, was a hard pill for regulators to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   But their views could change as more phone companies start
offering long-distance services nationwide, as Verizon has done in
New York and SBC Communications has done in Texas. These moves are
expected to increase competition and lower long-distance charges
for consumers in many markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, much of the consolidation in the
telecommunications industry is expected to be concentrated not on
long distance, which is becoming stagnant, but in faster-growing
areas like wireless and data or broadband transmission services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many chances for WorldCom to come out of this
unstymied in its strategy of growing-by-acquiring,'' said Andrew
Hamerling, a telecommunications analyst with Banc of America
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Qwest Communications International or Williams
Communications could be seen as targets for WorldCom because of the
potential they have for increasing the capacity for high-speed data
transmission or wireless services, Hamerling said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is for some of these same reasons that WorldCom
and Sprint, once their deal dissolved, were so quickly mentioned as
takeover targets. The companies thought to have the means to
acquire them are not American, however, but foreign ones like
Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, British Telecommunications and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have been allowed
to acquire minority stakes in companies like Sprint, the
acquisition of control of a large American phone company might
encounter resistance from regulators, especially if the suitor is
controlled by a foreign government, as is Deutsche Telekom (the
German government owns a 57 percent stake).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, U.S. lawmakers have made it clear that Deutsche
Telekom, would face an uphill battle if it tried to buy Sprint.
Perhaps that is why Deutsche Telekom, which is Europe's largest
phone company, has shifted its sights in recent days to include
smaller companies like VoiceStream Wireless and Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.S. can have it both ways,'' William T.
Esrey, Sprint's chairman, said in a telephone interview. ``We're
moving to open markets abroad, but when we have resistance here
that sends mixed signals.''

HOUSE VOTE SETS UP A BATTLE ON FAMILY PLANNING ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives has set the stage for
a reprise of last year's battle over the financing of international
family planning, narrowly voting Thursday to maintain restrictions
on private organizations that receive federal money to use their
own money to provide abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 221-206, the House rejected an amendment to a $13.3
billion foreign aid bill that would have removed the restrictions.
The limitations had been attached to the foreign aid measure last
year as part of a one-year compromise worked out by the White House
and congressional Republicans to end a stalemate over the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill for the next fiscal year was approved
Thursday by the House. With the failure of the amendment, which was
co-sponsored by Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and James Greenwood, R-Pa. ,
the spotlight returns to the White House. President Clinton's
advisers have said that they will recommend that he veto the
measure, in part because it maintains the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say that, like last year, the issue will loom large
in the budget negotiations. And both sides agree that the only
question is whether Clinton will hold firm on a veto or whether, as
he did last year, he will allow the restrictions to become law
despite his aides' vows that he will not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the groups are nervous about, making sure that the
White House doesn't cave in the final hours of the budget deal,''
said one abortion rights advocate who has been involved in the
fight over the restrictions and who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from Manhattan who supports
abortion rights, sighed when asked whether she was confident that
Clinton would adhere to his veto pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in measured tones she said: ``I know the president doesn't
want his legacy to be that this administration turned its back on
the young women of the world. I believe the president will stand
firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions affect groups that provide abortions in foreign
countries, or lobby foreign governments on the issue, even if they
use their own funds for these activities. Current law prohibits the
federal government from directly financing abortions in foreign
countries. The rules were first enacted by President Ronald Reagan
in an executive order in 1984. One of Clinton's first acts as
president in 1993 was to issue his own executive order rescinding
the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during the crush of negotiations about spending
bills, the Clinton administration permitted the restrictions,
dubbed the ``gag rule'' by abortion rights advocates, to become law
for one year. In return, congressional Republicans agreed to
legislation that began paying down the United States' debt to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise permitted Clinton to waive the restrictions,
which he did. In doing so, however, he invoked a provision in the
law that cut federal funds to all international family planning
organizations by $12 million. The compromise also required that no
more than $15 million in federal money could go to international
family planning groups or their overseas subcontractors that refuse
to abide by the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Should the legislation stand, Clinton could again waive the
restrictions, but a consequence would be further cuts in family
planning financing.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion campaigners in Congress are seeking to extend the
limitations for another year, arguing that a precedent has been
set. They say that the cuts in family planning funds last year did
not result in many family planning groups refusing to accept
American funds for their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our position is much stronger now because all of the
scare tactics that were put forward were totally unfounded,'' said
Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who is a leading abortion opponent in the
House. Indeed, during Thursday's debate, Rep. Jim Ryun, RKan., said
that the House should ``honor the spirit of the compromise.'' The
Senate foreign aid bill does not contain similar restrictions, but
lawmakers say the issue will be among the last resolved resolved
before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have assured abortion-rights advocates
that Clinton intends to stand firm on vetoing any legislation that
contains restrictions on the activities of international family
planning organizations. But some advocates recall that last year
they received the same kinds of assurances from the White House
chief of staff, John Podesta, only to have the president reverse
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a meeting with the chief of staff last year where he
said under no circumstances would the president cave on this,''
said one abortion-rights supporter who requested anonymity. ``A few
days later he did.''
</P>
<P>
   But some abortion rights advocates predicted that the
administration's resolve would be strengthened by a need to keep
faith with a core constituency in an election year. ``It being a
presidential election year, the advocates will direct their
attention to the vice president and tell him it's time to keep the
president's knees straight on this,'' Greenwood said.

EDITORIAL: DEMOCRATIC HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   The formal endorsement of Vice President Al Gore by former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Thursday was predictable, but Gore
had reason to savor it. Although the vice president defeated
Bradley in every state primary early this year, his campaign since
then has been strangely lethargic. The polls show Gore with only 70
percent support among Democrats, while Gov. George W. Bush has 90
percent support among Republicans. Though he did poorly in the
primary season, Bradley might give Gore a lift among young people
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's endorsement also marks a shift toward the convention
season and the vice-presidential selections. As political theater,
Bradley's performance at a boisterous rally in Wisconsin was far
different from the awkward endorsement of Bush in May by Sen. John
McCain, who jokingly compared the exercise to taking medicine. In
both cases, how McCain and Bradley handle themselves for the rest
of the year will be watched by party professionals as a sign of
whether either will be able to pick up the pieces and run again if
their nominees are defeated in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was quick to try to recycle the former New
Jersey senator's earlier criticism of Gore, particularly the
charges that Gore was not telling the truth about his record. But
there is a long history of challengers having to eat their words at
convention time with little ill effect. It was Bush's father, after
all, who had to live down his description of Ronald Reagan's
tax-cut plans as ``voodoo economics.'' Both Bradley and McCain have
ruled themselves out for the vice-presidential nominations of their
parties, and there does not seem to be a rush to make them change
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks before the opening of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia, speculation is rampant over Bush's
choices. The governor said on Thursday he had a short list. The
guessing has centered on three governors _ Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, George Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania _
as well as Elizabeth Dole and Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. Pataki
and Ridge are pro-choice Catholics who might stir up an unwelcome
furor among anti-abortion forces at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore is said to be looking closely at
Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Bob Graham of Florida, as well as
Gov. James Hunt of North Carolina. But because of the vice
president's weak standing among the Democratic faithful, he is said
to be considering the House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri. Some party insiders say Gephardt, more than anyone else,
would put Missouri in the Democratic column and expand Gore's
support generally within the Democratic base, especially in the
industrial Midwest. But such thinking also highlights one of Gore's
problems. At this point, he should be thinking of strategies for
reaching beyond Democrats to independents and Republicans and not
have to worry about support among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a slow season for the campaign. But it is worth
remembering that the primary elections were a time of unusually
intense public interest. Our guess is that the conventions will
reawaken the public's appetite for a combative fall campaign. &QL;

PROSECUTORS CITE DECEPTION IN TRIAL FOR STARR SPOKESMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers and witnesses Thursday
accused Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, of obstructing justice by misleading
colleagues and a federal court about what he told The New York
Times about a possible indictment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening day of Bakaly's trial for criminal contempt of
court, a prosecutor charged that his untrue statements had caused
Starr's office to file a false statement to the court in which it
denied discussing the case with a reporter for The Times.
</P>
<P>
   John Griffith, the prosecutor, said that Bakaly made a false
statement when he claimed that a Times reporter had assured him
that his sources were outside the independent counsel's office.
That was ``false,'' Griffith said, because ``Bakaly knew he had
been the source or a source'' of the Jan. 31, 1999, article at
issue in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The false statement began to unravel, Griffith said, through
Bakaly's gradual admissions, which came only after he had led
Starr's lawyers to file untrue information with U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson. That, in turn, caused an obstruction of
justice by delaying court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bakaly's lawyers argued that he had struggled to
make his statement truthful and complete, but had been thwarted by
a passion for secrecy among those lawyers for the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Michele A. Roberts, a lawyer for Bakaly, said that if the Starr
lawyers had accurately reflected in their court filings what he had
told them, they would have made it clear that Bakaly sought to
steer Don Van Natta, the Times reporter, ``away from writing the
article he ultimately wrote.'' That article embarrassed the
independent counsel's office by making it appear the office was
trying to prejudice the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has also argued that even if Bakaly's statements
were judged false, no serious harm was done. But Johnson has
rejected that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is hearing the case without a jury, ruled Wednesday
that obstruction could be shown if the government proved the claim
that Bakaly's conduct ``required the court to hold two in-chambers
conferences with outside counsel for the Office of Independent
Counsel and imposed unnecessary work and costs on the OIC.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where leaks are as common as broken campaign promises,
the rare spectacle of someone actually on trial for being a source
proceeded with little drama and less revelation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours were devoted to questioning Donald Bucklin, a
lawyer who represented Starr's office in many cases concerning
allegations that the office had improperly disclosed information to
reporters. Bucklin was asked mainly about the preparation of
Bakaly's sworn statement.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, which was presented to Johnson, Bakaly denied
discussing ``nonpublic'' matters with Van Natta. The January
article quoted ``associates of Mr. Starr'' as saying that he had
decided he had the authority to indict a sitting president and that
Starr was being pressed by lawyers in his office to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hoped to use Bucklin's testimony to show that Bakaly
edited and changed the statement and was responsible for what it
said. Efforts to prove that the statement was false are expected to
come in Friday's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Bucklin quoted Bakaly as saying that in the course of three
meetings with Van Natta, the reporter had said he knew that lawyers
were pressing Starr to indict the president, that he also knew
about a meeting to discuss four options concerning an indictment,
and various other matters as well. Bucklin said that Bakaly told
him the reporter said all the information had come from sources
outside the counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after he saw a statement by Bakaly to FBI agents,
Bucklin testified, he believed the original sworn statement had
been false, and formally withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness Thursday, Solomon Wisenberg, recalled reading in
the FBI interview report that Bakaly said he was the ``associate''
quoted in Van Natta's article.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg then demanded to know why Bakaly had told him he was
not one of the associates cited in the article. He said Bakaly
denied ever saying that.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, Wisenberg testified, Bakaly had in fact told him,
speaking of lawyers in the office, ``Van Natta says we are not the
associates referred to in the article.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg also described the meeting reported by the Times as an
all-day session on Jan. 27, 1999. It had been called by Starr to
determine how the office would decide whether to indict the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg said there had been a ``stronger than usual
admonition'' to keep the points of discussion secret. He said when
he read the Jan. 31 article he was dismayed that obviously someone
among the 20 or so lawyers present had leaked details of the
meeting. He said he feared the article would make the counsel's
office look as if it was engaged in a ``ham-handed'' effort to
affect the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton, which was
under way.

GORE WEIGHS TIMING NO. 2 PICK TO UPSET RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is strongly considering
plans to announce his running mate the day after the Republican
National Convention ends early next month, as a way of siphoning
media attention from the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush,
Democratic officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   National conventions have traditionally afforded presidential
nominees a triumphal moment in the spotlight. Sometimes the
post-convention ``bounce'' has been fleeting, but other times it
has provided real momentum going into the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the Republicans could use that bounce to expand
the marginal lead they already hold in many national polls, the
Democrats are assessing whether to try to reduce Bush's
post-convention coverage with the announcement of their
vice-presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a tactical option, it's attractive and under serious
consideration,'' one top adviser to Gore said of the plan, which
was first reported Thursday morning in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser said that Gore had not agreed yet, for several
reasons. Gore may want to allow some time to pass after the
Republican convention ends to gauge the public's response to the
Republican ticket. And he may also need extra time to determine
whether he wants to counter the Republican choice in terms of
gender or geography.
</P>
<P>
   Another variable would be the timing of Bush's announcement of
his running mate. If it is well before the Republican convention,
Gore will be more likely to make his announcement shortly after the
end of that convention, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of when Bush announces his pick, Gore is likely to
announce his choice of running mate well before the Democratic
National Convention begins on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Thursday that they had tentatively
scheduled President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton to address
the convention on its first night, a Monday, allowing Gore to
command the spotlight for most of the following three nights.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some discussion of having Mrs. Clinton, who is
running for the Senate from New York, speak on Tuesday, when the
Democrats plan to focus on women candidates. But Gore's advisers
wanted both Clintons to speak on the first evening, to ensure that
the vice president would dominate subsequent media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Clinton might introduce a biographical
video of her husband on Monday night. But they said she would also
probably give a speech focusing on her own campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who formally endorsed Gore on
Thursday, is scheduled to be among the featured speakers Tuesday,
Democratic officials said. On Wednesday, the convention will begin
focusing more on Gore's biography, with testimonials and, possibly,
video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will accept the nomination on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one hitch to having the Clintons speak Monday
night: no network is planning to cover the convention live that
night. But Democratic officials said they were hoping ABC would
broadcast a halftime report during Monday Night Football in which
Clinton would speak live.

 D.C. AND CONGRESS CLASH OVER CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURE   By STEVEN A. c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting the continued tensions between Congress
and the District of Columbia, House Republicans are angry about a
proposed city ordinance requiring insurance companies to cover
prescription contraceptives routinely and plan to try to overturn
it.
</P>
<P>
   Influential Republicans and some Democratic in the House said
Thursday that the city government's failure to exempt religious
organizations with doctrinal objections to providing contraceptive
benefits to their workers threatened the good will that had been
built up between the city and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the lack of an exemption, or ``conscience clause,''
for church-based employers and by what he termed anti-Catholic
comments of several council members, Rep. Ernest Istook Jr.,
R-Okla., who is chairman of the House subcommittee that
appropriates money for the District, has drafted legislation to
overturn the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did they not put in place a conscience clause, but
there was a very ugly situation regarding comments from some
people,'' Istook said.
</P>
<P>
   Istook and other Republicans singled out the comments of Jim
Graham, one of two openly gay members of the council who, during
debate on the measure, angrily took issue with recent statements by
Pope John Paul II that castigated homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a message delivered last Sunday in Rome, the pope said that
the ``homosexual acts go against natural law'' and that it was an
``objectively disordered'' inclination. The pontiff did add that
homosexuals should be treated with ``respect, compassion and
sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Church groups, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Washington had lobbied heavily for a broad exemption from the
ordinance, asking that not only purely religious organizations be
exempted but that institutions like Georgetown University, with a
largely secular purpose, also be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   To date 13 states require insurance companies that pay for
prescriptions to also pay for at least some prescription
contraceptives. Of those states, nine exempt religious
organizations from the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is surrendering decisions on public health matters
to the church,'' Graham said at a council meeting Monday night as
he waved a newspaper clip containing the pope's comment. ``I've
spent years fighting church dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to criticize the Catholic Church for its opposition
to the distribution of condoms in the 1980s, an action he said
helped foster the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Later during the Monday meeting the council approved the
measure. To become law it must be signed by Mayor Anthony Williams,
who has not yet said how he will act on it.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic leaders who said they were disappointed by Graham's
comments, argued that they should receive a broad exemption from
the ordinance because many functions that seemed secular were
central to what the church was about.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church's mission is not merely to promote religious
beliefs, but has always been involved in education, and health care
and social services,'' said William E. Lori, the auxiliary bishop
of Washington. ``All of these are integral to our mission as a
church. And the government shouldn't tell us which of our Catholic
institutions can follow Catholic principles and which ones
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Graham said he was not anti-Catholic but was
expressing frustration over both the views expressed by the pope
and the lobbying efforts of local Catholic leaders to avoid being
covered by the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just read some very intolerant views from the pope on
gays, and then had the bishops come in and say, hey, cut us some
slack on this law,'' said Brian Bond, president of the Gay and
Lesbian Victory Fund, a group that helps openly gay candidates win
public office.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Democrats complained that the Republicans
were making the municipal law an issue to regain the party's appeal
to Catholics who might have been upset by the visit of Gov. George
W. Bush to Bob Jones University, as well as the House leadership's
initial objection to the appointment of the first Catholic to be
chaplain of the House.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm those suspicions, Rep. Thomas Davis of
Virginia, head of the National Republican Campaign Committee, noted
in an interview how much he objected to the allegedly anti-Catholic
comments made by Graham, who is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the anti-Catholic stuff the Democrats have been
hurling at Republicans, for Jim Graham to get up and say what he
did about the pope was very unfortunate,'' Davis said.

JUDGE SENTENCES ARMY COLONEL TO PRISON FOR WITHHOLDING SMUGGLING
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After being chided by a federal judge for not
apologizing for his crimes, a U.S. Army colonel who once ran the
government's antidrug operations in Colombia was sentenced Thursday
to five months in prison for never reporting that he knew his wife
was smuggling heroin through diplomatic mail from Bogota to New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel, James Hiett, stood with his hands clasped tightly
before him in federal District Court in Brooklyn as U.S. District
Judge Edward Korman pronounced sentence in a weary, troubled
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the sentence was handed down, Korman asked the
colonel if he had anything to say on his own behalf.
</P>
<P>
   His lips set and his chin held high, Col. Hiett said that he did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it you have nothing to say?'' Korman then asked,
slapping his hand on the desk in what seemed like inadvertent
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I could speak at this point to tell you what I
really feel, sir,'' Hiett answered crisply, his jaw muscles
quivering with restrained emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that I did _ that I consciously did _ was try
to protect my wife after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiett admitted in April to paying his household bills with
thousands of dollars he knew his wife had earned from shipping
heroin from the U.S. Embassy in Bogota to accomplices in Manhattan
and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laurie Anne Hiett, pleaded guilty in January to drug
trafficking charges and is serving a five-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Hiett, who oversaw about 200 American troops charged
with training Colombian security forces in drug enforcement
operations, has been an embarrassment for the Army, which cleared
him of all involvement in the smuggling scheme last year after a
three-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Army's findings, Korman excoriated the colonel
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone in a position of trust engages in conduct like
this, it undermines confidence in the military,'' Korman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It undermines confidence in the country's drug program. And
that's what abuse of trust is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, 48, has already filed for his retirement, which is to
take effect in November.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have said that he could face a reduced
pension, even court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   But Army officials did not return phone calls Thursday seeking
comment on the colonel's case.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual emotional twist to the sentencing hearing
Thursday, Korman allowed the mother of an Army captain who died in
a military plane crash last year while serving under Hiett's
command to address the court before the sentence was issued.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Janie Shafer, of Brunswick, Md., has accused Hiett
of causing the death of her daughter, Capt. Jennifer Shafer Odom,
by revealing secret information about military surveillance flights
to Colombian drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Korman allowed Shafer to speak, he acknowledged that
there was no evidence to support her allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the lectern with a photograph of her dead daughter
pressed to her chest, Shafer begged Korman to investigate the plane
crash, which the Army ruled an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Korman said he had no power to investigate the crash, but he
consoled Shafer with gentle words from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the picture of your daughter and I'm holding
back tears myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just imagine your suffering as a parent myself.''

MRS. CLINTON EXPLAINS ARAFAT KISS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a campaign swing Thursday through Queens, Hillary
Rodham Clinton offered her most detailed explanation yet about why
she kissed Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, after Arafat
made scathing remarks about Israel during a joint appearance in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any of you have been to the Middle East,''
Clinton said. ``But if you have, you know that a kiss is a
handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing at the Bell Park Jewish Center in Queens
Village, made the remarks in response to a woman's question on the
encounter with Arafat, and on her stand on the issue of Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not offer her opinion on whether there should be a
Palestinian state, but said that her political opponents would
``keep raising and keep raising'' the encounter with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which provoked harsh criticism at the time from
Jewish organizations in the United States, involved a joint
appearance by the two women on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a very difficult position, and I am the first to
admit that,'' Clinton said to a largely supportive group of more
the 300 people at the Queens Village center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I was expected to do,'' she said, adding that she
had ``responded appropriately as the first lady of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   During the November joint appearance in Ramallah, Arafat,
speaking in Arabic, accused the Israeli government of poisoning
Palestinian women and children with toxic gas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton showed clear signs of discomfort during the remarks but
gave Arafat a polite, salutatory kiss when she left.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton offered an explanation that was similar to
one she gave reporters in November, but it was her first expansive
discussion on the episode before a large group of voters. She said
the translation of Arafat's remarks that she was given in earphones
during the West Bank event was different, and far less offensive,
than the more accurate version she learned of after leaving Israel
for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was great debate over what was the right translation,
the one I heard in my ears or the one that was put out after I left
Israel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, ``immediately when I found out about the
alternative translation I condemned it,'' adding that Arafat's
remarks had been ``inflammatory and outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was asked by another member of the audience in
Queens Village if she had changed her ``pro-Arab'' views, responded
by saying that she and President Clinton had been supporters of
Israel throughout their political careers and that ``all my
comments and work I have done had been premised on what would be in
the best interest of Israel.''

CBS SETTLES KING FAMILY'S LAWSUIT OVER `DREAM' SPEECH COPYRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In exchange for a cash payment, the estate of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has dropped its lawsuit against CBS News
over the rights to King's 1963 masterwork, the ``I Have a Dream''
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would disclose the amount of the payment, which is
considered to be a tax-deductible contribution to the King Center
for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. As part of the settlement
reached on Wednesday, CBS will retain the right to use its film of
the speech and to license it to others, although the network agreed
to provide information on how outside parties could contact the
estate ``regarding the estate's claimed intellectual property
rights,'' according to a news release issued by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also agreed to provide film of King's speeches for the King
estate's own productions.
</P>
<P>
   King's heirs sued the network in 1996 after CBS began selling a
videotape that included excerpts of the civil rights leader's
best-known words, delivered on Aug. 28, 1963, at a civil rights
rally at the Lincoln Memorial. The excerpts were part of a
five-volume documentary, ``The 20th Century With Mike Wallace,''
that was selling for $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which has long been criticized by scholars for its
aggressive profit-making approach to King's legacy, argued that
outside corporations should not be allowed to exploit King's memory
without giving a share to the estate. ``It has to do with the
principle that if you make a dollar, I should make a dime,'' said
Dexter Scott King, King's son and president of the estate, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, a federal judge in Atlanta ruled against the
family, declaring that the speech was a news event in the public
domain. The judge, William C. O'Kelley, noted that the speech had
been televised live and that the text had earlier been distributed
to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, however, a federal appeals panel in Atlanta
overturned that decision and sent the case back to the lower court,
saying CBS had not proved that the speech was not a performance,
which is entitled to copyright protection, as opposed to a
``general publication,'' which is in the public domain. King
copyrighted the speech a month after he delivered it to prevent the
sale of unauthorized recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement means there will not be a formal legal resolution
of these issues. Both CBS and the King family were circumspect
about the settlement, refusing to discuss any aspect of it beyond
the news release, which said that both sides were pleased with the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who represented CBS
in the case, said the settlement preserved the network's original
contentions about the public nature of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``From CBS's perspective, this has always been about the
principle that they have right to use footage they take of news
events,'' Abrams said. ``From their vantage point, that principle
remains inviolate, and is consistent with this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the settlement grew out of a meeting held earlier this
year between Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, and
Dexter King and Coretta Scott King, King's widow.

EDITORIAL: A CRUEL AND UNUSUAL ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   The sickening sight of Philadelphia police officers caught on
videotape punching, kicking and stomping on a man who had already
been shot five times brings to mind the vicious beating of Rodney
King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991. Philadelphia's police
commissioner, John Timoney, says such comparisons are unfair. There
are clear differences in the two cases. But they both show officers
out of control and using excessive force to settle a score with a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia man, Thomas Jones, allegedly resisted arrest,
fired on the police, stole a patrol car and led police on a chase
before he was pulled out of the cruiser. The officers obviously
were enraged by such resistance and by the shootout, which left one
officer wounded in the hand. But that does not excuse the ferocious
beating that took place after Jones was wounded, surrounded and
lying on the ground. The tape showed a mob attack rather than an
orderly arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Since several of the officers involved are black, as is Jones,
there are fewer racial overtones in this case than in the assault
on Rodney King, in which all four of the officers in the beating
were white. That difference, however, offers no comfort to civil
rights groups that have been working for years to end notorious
patterns of abuse in the Philadelphia Police Department. There have
been positive strides in police-community relations in recent
years. But the fact that the officers showed no restraint suggests
that the police culture has not changed enough in Philadelphia,
which will soon play host to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street and Timoney have said they will conduct
vigorous investigations into the officers' actions. The Justice
Department announced on Thursday that it would begin a civil rights
inquiry to determine whether excessive force had been used. The
videotape records a scene that will be hard to justify.

AT TIMES, THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ This is about the happiest racetrack news of
the week, the saddest racetrack news of the week, and what both say
about the worth _ or worthlessness _ of raw statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In Bossier, La., there's an undefeated 3-year-old filly named
Hallowed Dreams who will try to match the record of Citation and
Cigar with a 16th consecutive victory when she faces four other
sprinters Saturday in the $40,000 Dixie Miss Stakes at Louisiana
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Park, there was a 5-year-old gelding named
Nationalore who was winless when he suffered a fatal injury
Wednesday in his 26th career start.
</P>
<P>
   The two horses had nothing to do with each other except for this
oddity: The undefeated filly has earned $366,429, and the winless
gelding had earned $318,227. Remarkably little difference,
considering.
</P>
<P>
   So much for measuring horses by counting wins or money. Hallowed
Dreams, who has won a lot of cheap races, isn't as good as her
historic streak suggests and might be better than her modest
earnings indicate. Nationalore, who lost a lot of rich races,
wasn't as good as his earnings suggest or as bad as his winning
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Their stats are skewed because they're among the more strangely
managed horses in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Hallowed Dreams has never faced anything but Louisiana-breds,
has never run in a graded stakes and has never gone longer than 6
furlongs. She wins her races by daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to break this record in Louisiana if we do,'' Lloyd
Romero, her trainer, told the Associated Press. ``It's good for
Louisiana trainers and it's good for Louisiana jockeys. It's a
record that if we establish, it will be a long time before it's
broken. She's good for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it proper that Hallowed Dreams could share a line with
Citation and Cigar in the racing record book (if she wins Saturday,
and if some enlightened soul publishes a racing record book)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were good horses. I have a good horse,'' Romero said.
``We train for the pleasure of running our horses. If we get a
record, it comes. If not, there will be another race for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero said he might test Hallowed Dreams against tougher
competition next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalore spent his entire career racing against tougher
competition than he should have.
</P>
<P>
   Bred, owned and trained by Myung Kwon Cho, a 58-year-old native
of Seoul, South Korea, the son of Video Ranger and Romantic Jet
earned $120,000 by finishing third in the 1997 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Hollywood Park in his ninth start, and later ran sixth
in the Santa Anita Derby and ninth in the Kentucky Derby. He
finished with seven seconds and seven thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalore met the most unfortunate kind of end in Wednesday's
sixth race at Hollywood Park. He had to be euthanized after
clipping heels with Dramatic Show in the first turn, falling and
fracturing his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Leading apprentice Tyler Baze dislocated a finger in the fall
and was off his scheduled mounts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real, real sound horse, a really gentle horse,'' Cho
said Thursday after saddling another of his 18 horses. ``What can I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   Say it's too bad Nationalore never got to visit a winner's
circle and goes to his grave with the dubious distinction of being
the nation's richest maiden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my problem (fault),'' said Cho, a former clothes
exporter who got into racing more than a decade ago. ``I put him in
too-high conditions early in his career. If you ask me, I will tell
you, that horse was my teacher. I learned a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   We all could. From Nationalore and from Hallowed Dreams. The
lesson is that numbers don't tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   __ The joy of six: Twice in the past week, Hollywood Park has
been reminded that the most powerful marketing ploy in horse racing
is one it can't plan _ the pick-six carryover.
</P>
<P>
   A record two-day carryover of $713,923 drew 12,110 fans to
Hollywood Park last Friday night, nearly 1,900 more than the
previous Friday. A record one-day carryover of $376,152 drew 7,094
to the track Wednesday, nearly 1,700 more than the most recent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Total wagering on those cards was $10.8 million on Friday, up
$3.8 million, and $9.7 million on Wednesday, up $2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's carryover contributed to a total pick-six pool of
$1.4 million and payoffs of $39,523 for each of 30 perfect tickets.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Eight-year-old River Keen goes into Saturday's
Bel Air Handicap with a chance to be the oldest horse to win a
stakes at Hollywood Park since Letthebighossroll won the 1996
Answer Do at the same age. But he might have to wait until he's
even older.
</P>
<P>
   River Keen, ridden by Victor Espinoza and assigned a race-high
122 pounds, seven more than he carried when he won the 1999 Bel
Air, might not be as sharp as possible for his first start since
finishing 11th in the Breeders' Cup last November. His competition
in the 1 1/16-mile Bel Air includes Prime Timber, Patience Game and
Crows, the former Eddie Gregson-trained horse making his first
appearance for Vladimir Cerin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Baffert barn said River Keen, another claiming horse
made good, is being pointed for another try in the Breeders' Cup
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Nakatani and Kent Desormeaux will be out of town Saturday
to ride in Miami at Calder's ``Summit of Speed'' program of sprint
races. A $1 pick-four will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   __ Doing well: Eddie Delahoussaye, who hasn't been riding this
week as his wife Juanita recovers from surgery to repair an
aneurysm near her brain, is scheduled to return to the track aboard
Prime Timber in the Bel Air on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Delahoussaye has been reported stable since the
operation Monday in Los Angeles. A Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
statement said she could go home by the end of the week barring
complications. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOLLYWOOD PARK LEADERS &QL; 
Jockeys: Victor Espinoza, 53 wins; Corey Nakatani, 44; Laffit
Pincay, 35; David Flores, 34; Kent Desormeaux, 30. Trainers: Bob
Baffert, 20; Clifford Sise, 19; Bobby Frankel, 17; Richard
Mandella, 16; Vladimir Cerin,14. &QL; 
PINCAY UPDATE &QL; 
Laffit Pincay's victory aboard Mikala's Star on Wednesday gave him
wins on six of the past seven Hollywood Park programs and extended
his career-record total to 8,942. &QL; 
ON THE STAKES SCHEDULE &QL; 
__ At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $150,000 Bel Air Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1 1/16 miles; Sunday, $100,000 Robert Kerlan

</P>
<P>
   A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hollendorfer became the seventh trainer with 3,000
victories when Boss Ego won the Alameda Handicap at Pleasanton on
Sunday. Russell Baze rode Boss Ego, which is fitting since Baze won
his 7,000th with a Hollendorfer-trained horse July 4. . . . Frank
Stronach said he has bought land in Dixon, 20 miles west of
Sacramento, on which to build a training center, a facility he
hopes will develop into a racetrack to eventually replace Bay
Meadows. . . . Early Pioneer joined the NTRA rankings at No. 10
after his Hollywood Gold Cup victory. Gold Cup runner-up General
Challenge remained ahead of him at No. 7. Golden Missile is No. 1
in the media survey. . . . Gold Cup-winning jockey Victor Espinoza
added four victories Thursday to take command of the Hollywood Park
standings with nine days left in the meet. . . .
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge earned enough points in the Gold Cup to tie
Golden Missile for first place in the ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' as
that series nears its conclusion with the Aug. 6 Whitney Handicap.
. . . Speaking of NTRA series (isn't everybody?): Something called
``The NTRA 2-year-old Challenge'' will begin in September and
include the Sept. 13 Del Mar Futurity, the Oct. 7 Norfolk Stakes at
Santa Anita and the climactic Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup Juvenile at
Churchill Downs. The big payoffs: a $250,000 bonus to a horse who
wins any of the first seven races !ital!and the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile; $1 million more if that horse goes on to win the Kentucky
Derby. . . . Artax's owner said the 1999 champion sprinter, who was
bred to 93 mares this year, is in training to defend his Breeders'
Cup Sprint title. &QL;

IPO SUCCESSES COULD LAUNCH NEW BREAKOUT PHASE FOR TECH STOCKS 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a saying on Wall Street that when the initial public
offering window is almost closed, only the best deals squeak
through.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, then now should be a good time to consider
buying IPOs. But is it?
</P>
<P>
   William Smith, president of the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund,
thinks the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, an article in the Wall Street Journal predicted the
IPO market would remain moribund through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that article came out, our fund is up 40 percent,'' he
says. That gain erased half of a huge loss in the March-to-May
period, leaving the fund up 10 percent year to date.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose fund invests in IPOs at the offering, and later, in
the so-called aftermarket, explains: ``We've been doing research
since 1991. Since then, the IPO market has been officially declared
dead six times. During those times, only good deals were able to
get out, and there was less competition in the aftermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he says, ``we're in the sweet spot _ the early part
of a breakout phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, IPOs had one of their best days in months yesterday.
Investors are feeling more optimistic after two Internet
bellwethers _ Santa Clara's Yahoo and Mountain View's Ariba _
announced better-than-expected earnings earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in three companies that make telecommunications or
computer hardware soared in their first day of trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Sunrise Telecom, which makes equipment for testing
telecommunications networks, premiered at $15 per share and closed
at $40.31, for a 169 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Triton Networks of Fresh Meadows, N.Y., which makes broadband
wireless equipment, went public at $15 (up from an initial range of
$10 to $12) and finished the day at $38.44, up 156 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Network Engines of Canton, Mass., raised the size and price of
its deal, from 5.5 million shares at $13 to $15 per share to 6.5
million shares at $15 to $17. It went public at $17 and closed at
$29, for a first-day gain of 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes computer servers that are a cheaper
alternative to those from Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The laggard of the day was I-Many of Portland, Maine, which
makes software for companies doing business on the Internet. Its
stock was up only 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardware is a much easier sell than software these days,''
says Ross Sakamoto, manager of the H&AMP;Q IPO and Emerging Companies
fund. ``Demand is insatiable for hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some investors were surprised that yesterday's hardware
deals did so well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise's $25 gain ``threw me for a loop,'' says Jeff
Hirschkorn, a senior market analyst for IPO.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company is making money, about 90 percent of its
sales are for testing digital-subscriber lines, and he says DSL is
past its prime as an investment fad. Another risk: 40 percent of
sales are to a single customer, SBC Communications, the parent
company of Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Tuen, director of research with IPO Value Monitor, says
Sunrise ``overshot on the upper end. I probably wouldn't buy it
where it's trading now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakamoto was also surprised by Triton's performance. The company
makes ``fixed-wireless'' equipment, which beams high-speed data to
rooftop antennas over radio waves. It's a cheaper alternative to
laying fiber the ``last mile'' to homes and offices, but the
technology is still unproven, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamoto says this is a sign that the market is becoming more
selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mediocre company might be treated really, really badly. A
really good company will get undue reward,'' he says. ``Everybody's
going to want to have the good name. Nobody wants a neutral or bad
name.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Divine Interventures, a Lisle, Ill., Internet
incubator similar to CMGI, finally got its problem-plagued IPO off
the ground this week. Its shares hit the market at $9, much lower
than planned, and finished their first day at $8.78. They rose
yesterday to $10.56.
</P>
<P>
   Another ho-hum deal was Sohu.com, which operates an Internet
portal in China. It originally hoped to sell shares at $16 to $19
but had to settle for $13. It closed yesterday at the inauspicious
price (at least in the United States) of $13.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive development when you see a company like Divine
that has to cut its price to get out,'' says Smith. ``It's the sign
of a discriminating marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   PICKS OF THE LITTER: I asked the experts to name which IPOs they
think will get the most attention in the weeks ahead.
Unfortunately, some of these stocks may go so high on the first day
you won't want to touch them, unless you can get in at the offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; Blue Martini Software. &LR;  Smith and Hirschkorn think investors
might get legally intoxicated on this San Mateo company, which
makes software that helps companies improve their relationship with
customers on the Web and through traditional channels like call
centers. Its customers include Levi Strauss, Harley Davidson and
Deluxe, the check-printing company.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; America Online Latin America. &LR;  This IPO was shelved awhile
back, but now it's back on the runway. Hirschkorn says it's a joint
venture between AOL and and Cisneros Group, a big telecom player
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; Corvis. &LR;  This Columbia, Md., company isn't making any money,
but it does make fiber-optic equipment, so of course it will
``probably be overvalued,'' says Sakamoto.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; Embarcadero Technologies. &LR;  Sakamoto also likes this San
Francisco maker of software that helps programmers design databases
from many different vendors.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Almost any biotech IPO. &LR;  ``Across the board, these companies
are being snapped up because even if you are extremely
knowledgeable about biotech (which most people aren't), it's hard
to distinguish who the winners will be three to five years from
now,'' says Linda Killian, a portfolio manager on the IPO Plus
Aftermarket fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``So institutional investors are buying portfolios of these
companies. If you don't know which ones are going to be the
winners, you pick a bunch of them and hold them.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, she thinks Discovery Partners, which is developing
compound libraries for drug discovery, may get more attention than
some others.

   More than 25 years after the fall of Saigon, the United States
signed a broad trade agreement on Thursday with Vietnam. The accord
pledges further opening of the Vietnamese economy and permits
American companies there to compete on a more equal footing with
other foreign businesses. Its signing marks another welcome step
toward healing the wounds of a bitter and divisive war.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been opening its markets for more than a decade. But
foreign companies operating there have been discouraged by
burdensome and costly bureaucratic interference. American companies
entered the Vietnamese market after the two countries established
normal diplomatic relations in 1995. But with their late start and
the absence, until now, of a trade agreement, American concerns
have been at a disadvantage. The United States ranks only ninth
among countries investing in Vietnam, and trade between the two
countries is a disappointingly small $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new trade agreement, which still must be approved by
Congress, could change that picture significantly. High-growth
industries like telecommunications will be opened to freer
competition. American tariffs on goods manufactured in Vietnam will
be sharply reduced, permitting American companies there to produce
for export to the United States market. From the Vietnamese side,
the agreement represents a recognition that market reforms must go
forward if Vietnam is to compete effectively with China for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Vietnam remains a repressive Communist
dictatorship. Intellectuals calling for more democracy face
isolation and house arrest, Buddhist leaders are harassed, senior
Communists pressing for faster reforms face persecution. Washington
rightly made progress on refugee issues and finding the remains of
missing American combatants conditions for signing the trade
agreement. With America now likely to play a larger economic role
in Vietnam, Washington should raise its voice on behalf of
persecuted Vietnamese democrats. &QL;

ARCHIPELAGO LIFTS PACIFIC EXCHANGE INTO CYBERSPACE 
 &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco's Pacific Exchange stepped into a brave, new world
Thursday, completing the previously announced merger of its stock
trading business with an all-electronic rival.
<P>
   The combination of Pacific's stock operation with Archipelago, a
new-generation computerized trading system that competes with
conventional exchanges, will create the nation's first fully
automated equity exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As previously disclosed, Pacific will shut its San Francisco and
Los Angeles stock trading floors sometime late this year or early
next year, replacing them with the Archipelago system, which
operates entirely in cyberspace. Pending Securities and Exchange
Commission approval, the new operation will have the full status of
an exchange, allowing it to trade a complete range of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the market has been divided between conventional
exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and electronic
networks operating under a variety of restrictions that have
limited their ability to function as stock marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Archipelago Exchange, as the operation will be called,
``will be the first of its kind,'' said Pacific Exchange Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Philip DeFeo. ``It will be a real
competitor to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago, based in Chicago, is the fifth-largest electronic
communications network, or ECN, as the new-generation stock trading
systems are called.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs directly link buy and sell orders without using middlemen.
They mainly trade Nasdaq stocks, where they command about 30
percent of the market. New York Stock Exchange rules hamper their
ability to trade shares listed on that market.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York rules, however, Pacific and other regional
exchanges are able to trade shares of the companies it lists.
Archipelago agreed to combine with Pacific to get access to those
New York stocks, including such blue-chip names as IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   As compensation, Archipelago is paying Pacific an undisclosed
sum, giving it an equity stake and a seat on the Archipelago board.
</P>
<P>
   For Pacific, a deal with Archipelago removes a millstone from
its neck.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pacific's business of trading stock options has
grown rapidly and profitably. But in the stock-market business, the
exchange has lost market share and millions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Combining with Archipelago and eliminating the expense of a
trading floor will ``solve the burden of the equity drag on us,''
allowing the exchange to concentrate on its options business, DeFeo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new operation faces tough hurdles to establish itself. One
of its most difficult tasks will be to carve out a role for
Pacific's dozens of wholesale brokers, known as specialists, who
serve as middlemen in stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know how (the Archipelago Exchange is) going to
work with the specialists,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Greg Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pacific adopts the Archipelago system, directly linking buy
and sell orders, the specialists will be squeezed out of many
stocks. They might still play a vital function by ``making a
market,'' that is, by guaranteeing to buy or sell shares when
investors don't specify a trading price or when no other orders are
available.
