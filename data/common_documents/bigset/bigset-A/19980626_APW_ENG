Japan may increase flight slots to domestc, foreign airlines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is planning to reshuffle landing quotas at
Tokyo's main international airort in a move that could result in
increased flights by foreign airlines, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Transport Ministry will redistribute about 200 weekly
takeoff and landing slots at Narita Airport, with Japan and the
United States expected to get one-third each, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper said.
	   The remainder will be allotted to other nations, said the paper,
Japan's leading business daily.
	   Ministry official Katsuto Kawarabayashi confirmed the government
was still working out details of the plan, including how many slots
will be redistributed to which countries. But he provided no
specifics.
	   A total of 337 regular flights per day fly into and out of the
airport at Narita, with the United States accounting for 35 percent
of the total, Kawarabayashi said. Japan has 36 percent, while other
countries hold the remaining 29 percent, he said.
	   The Transport Ministry last redistributed flight slots at
Narita, 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Tokyo, in 1991, when 62
were given to the United States, and 50 to Japan. Other nations
received eight.
	   Allotting flight slots to each nation is determined in
accordance with rules established by the Montreal-based
International Air Transport Association and local airports, he
said.
	   Kawarabayashi said an unspecified number of the 185 flight slots
now set aside each day for special or chartered flights will also
be newly allotted for regular flights at Narita.
	   The change in flight slot quotas at the airport is being taken
in response to foreign criticism over Japan's rigid flight
allotment, the daily said.
	   It is also designed to counter growing competition from other
Asian countries which are either building larger airports or
expanding their airport facilities, the paper said.
	   The airport at Narita, which opened in 1978 with a single
runway, is about 65 kilometers (40 miles), northeast of Tokyo.

Two failed financial giants hold final shareholders meetings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shareholders of two of Japan's once mightiest
financial giants gathered for the last time on Friday, the day most
of the country's almost 3,000 listed companies held their annual
meetings.
	   Shareholders of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd. gave largely
symbolic approval to the company's decision last November to shut
down, media reports said.
	   While Yamaichi Securities Co. asked its shareholders to do the
same, so few showed up at Friday morning's meeting at the
brokerage's Tokyo headquarters that the measure failed to get the
needed two-thirds vote, the reports said.
	   Japanese companies say they hold their meetings on the same day
every year to dilute the threat of ``sokaiya'' _ racketeers who
blackmail companies by threatening to reveal corporate secrets at
the annual meetings.
	   Police have started taking the threat seriously, launching an
unprecedented crackdown last year and mobilizing almost 10,000
officers to stand guard at Friday's meetings.
	   As a result, only 28 known racketeers showed up at shareholders
meetings Friday, far fewer than last year, Japan's state-run NHK
news said.
	   One of those companies embroiled in last year's sokaiya scandals
was Yamaichi Securities. Former president Atsuo Miki later pleaded
guilty to giving a racketeer 107 million yen (dlrs 750,000).
	   The scandal proved the brokerage's undoing, however, when the
investigation into the payoffs brought to light more than 260
billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in secret losses that the company
had been hiding from authorities.
	   The revelation forced Yamaichi, once one of Japan's vaunted Big
Four brokerages, to decide in November to close its doors after 101
years in business.
	   With the failure of the measure to close the company, Yamaichi's
management is now expected to seek a court order, NHK said.
	   Things went more smoothly for Hokkaido Takushoku, where
shareholders approved the closure at a meeting near the bank's
former headquarters in the northern city of Sapporo, according to
the reports.
	   Hokkaido Takushoku was one of the country's 10 money center
banks, which provided short-term capital to fuel Japan's postwar
economic ascendance.
	   The bank collapsed in November, crushed by the weight of failed
real estate loans made during the speculative price bubble of the
late 1980s.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters who bombed a bank and
slashed telephone lines attacked on a new front with a
multimillion-dollar bank boycott in their battle against the sale
of the state telephone company.
	   The Federation of Teachers announced Thursday it had closed dlrs
100 million in accounts at Banco Popular, the island's largest bank
and part of a consortium buying the telephone utility. The General
Workers' Council withdrew its dlrs 40 million from the bank and
said it was encouraging affiliated unions and their 50,000 members
to do the same.
	   Protesters planted bombs, smashed automated bank machines and
severed and burned telephone cables on Thursday.
	   Their fury erupted within hours of Gov. Pedro Rossello signing a
law Wednesday selling the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to a group of
buyers led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.
	   Taking advantage of the situation, two other companies said they
would present last-minute bids for the company.
	   That provided no comfort to 6,400 telephone workers whose
weeklong strike had failed to force the government to reconsider
the privatization of one of the last government-owned telephone
companies on U.S. territory.
	   Early Thursday, a bomb concealed in a flashlight planted at a
Banco Popular branch in the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel
exploded in the hands of a police officer. It tore off one finger
and wounded his other hand and leg.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo said he suspected Los Macheteros, a
clandestine guerrilla group that has adopted the strike as part of
its fight for independence, arguing that the government is selling
``the national patrimony'' to the United States. The Macheteros
claimed responsibility for a shot fired after closing time last
week through the door of another Banco Popular branch.
	   Meanwhile, the telephone company reported it had repaired
service to 230,000 of 345,000 customers left without service
because of sabotage and 110 of 335 disabled automated bank
machines.
	   Other unions, mainly of government workers, are threatening to
join the strike. Electric workers, nurses, state insurance fund
workers, teachers and other government employees joined
demonstrations throughout the island Thursday.
	   At a rally in the mountain town of Naranjito, one protester held
a placard with a cow representing the telephone company. ``We
raised it, we fattened it, and if Rossello sells it, we'll kill
it,'' the sign vowed. It represented strikers' hopes that they can
dissuade any private company from buying into what the leader of
one telephone union, Jose Juna Hernandez, described as ``a very
hostile work force.''
	   In the dlrs 1.9 billion deal approved signed Wednesday, the
government would sell a controlling stake to the GTE-led
consortium. GTE would put up dlrs 375 million and manage the
company.
	   The deal awaits approval from the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission, which could take months.
	   The GTE bid was challenged Thursday by an offer from the Spanish
communications company Telefonica Internacional S.A., which already
owns the islands' long-distance carrier Larga Distancia and which
has substantial interests in Latin America. Spokesman Jose Luis
Fernandez said their offer bettered that of GTE by more than dlrs
25 million, the amount the government would have to pay GTE if it
abandoned the deal.
	   A third company, World Services International, said it would
offer a dlrs 2 billion employee buyout that had been ignored in the
bidding process. Company president Howard Stager said he had a
consortium of American, Canadian and Japanese companies ready to
finance a dlrs 2 billion deal that would be much more lucrative.

Nine bodies found in captured North Korean submarine 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with government demanding North Korean apology

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ Navy commandos found nine bodies
Friday in a captured North Korean submarine, all shot dead in an
apparent suicide pact. Seoul said the sub was on a spy mission and
demanded that North Korea apologize.
	   ``North Korea must acknowledge that the incident was a serious
act of provocation, punish those involved and take action to
prevent the recurrence of similar incidents,'' South Korea's
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   The ministry rejected an earlier North Korean claim that the
submarine ``had been missing on a routine training mission after
experiencing mechanical problems.''
	   The ministry said it was asking the American-led U.N. Command to
lodge a formal protest with North Korea.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   President Kim Dae-jung denounced the sub's intrusion but said
the incident would not sway his engagement policy toward the
North's communist government.
	   Kim's ``sunshine policy'' calls for expanded exchanges and
cooperation in an effort to improve relations with the reclusive
North.
	   The 70-ton Yugo-class submarine was found in South Korean waters
off the east coast on Monday with its propeller and periscope
tangled in a fishing net.
	   The sub was brought to this naval base for examination.
	   The navy had delayed opening the hatch overnight for fear it was
booby-trapped. To make sure the hatch was safe, workers drilled six
holes in the submarine and inserted tiny remote-controlled cameras
to survey it.
	   Then they cut through the hatch with welding torches and found
the bodies. Four were in the rear of the submarine and the rest in
other compartments, officials said.
	   Four of the North Koreans had been shot in the head, while the
other five had been shot elsewhere in the body, said Lt. Col. Kim
Jong-sook. Two automatic rifles were found near the bodies.
	   Kim, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said two South
Korean-made plastic beverage containers were found in the sub _ an
indication the vessel was returning north after dropping or picking
up spies.
	   Other items seized include two light machine guns, a pistol, two
hand-grenades, a set of U.S.-made diving gear and three sets of
frogmen's flippers, he said.
	   Kim also said all equipment inside the submarine was intact and
would provide ``valuable information about North Korean navy and
the commando activities.''
	   A day after it was captured, the sub sank while being towed. Bad
weather hampered the salvage operation for two days, but the sub
was finally raised Thursday.
	   The sub was found in the same area where a larger North Korean
sub ran aground in 1996. That incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt
that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead
and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   In that episode, 10 North Koreans reportedly were shot to death
by one of their commanders, who then killed himself.

Clinton says reports of fresh dissident arrests are ``disturbing'' AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New material, editing throughout
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Confronted by a Chinese crackdown on
dissidents as he opened his visit, President Bill Clinton said
Friday the repression was ``not China at its best and not China
looking forward, but looking backward.''
	   The government's action made for a sour beginning to Clinton's
nine-day trip, a journey he began with a gentle lecture about human
rights. Fresh arrests Thursday were an embarrassment to Clinton,
already under fire at home for expanding cooperation with a
communist regime accused of human rights violations and religious
prosecution.
	   The president said one of the objectives of his trip to China
was to discuss, publicly and privately, issues of personal freedom.
The crackdown ``makes it all the more important that we continue to
work with the Chinese and to engage them,'' the president said.
	   Clinton's comments to reporters in a nearby village came amid
reports that several dissidents had been detained by Chinese
authorities around the start of the president's trip. ``I found the
reports disturbing,'' Clinton said. He directed U.S. Ambassador
James Sasser to raise the issue with Chinese authorities.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed various appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news
agencies _ urging the U.S. president to speak out on behalf of
freedom and the release of political prisoners and to make time to
meet with dissidents during his stay in China.
	   The president also said the United States would not alter its
policy toward Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade island. The
United States holds to a one-China policy and does not support a
declaration of independence by Taiwan.
	   ``So I think it's obvious that there will be no change in our
position one way or the other on this trip,'' Clinton said in a
remark sure to disappoint Taiwan but please Beijing.
	   On the first full day of his visit, Clinton journeyed to the
outskirts of this ancient capital to Xiahe, a village of 400 people
where the per capita income is about dlrs 400 a year. Villagers
told the president that their lives were improving under a kind of
grassroots capitalism system.
	   In a roundtable discussion, both the president and his wife
Hillary engaged teachers, students, physicians and entrepreneurs
with questions about how life there had changed in recent years.
	   Arriving from Washington, Clinton was welcomed Thursday night in
the grand style of ancient emperors. He was treated to an
extravagant celebration of costumed warriors and dancers who
cavorted to thunderous drums among a blaze of red lanterns. The
welcome was based on Tang Dynasty traditions dating to the 7th
century.
	   Xi'an, the opening stop on Clinton's trip, was the ancient
capital of China and now is a gritty industrial city of 6.5
million. It is the site of one the most spectacular archaeological
finds of the 20th century: more than 7,000 life-size clay horses
and armored warriors buried in battle formations near the tomb of
Emperor Qin Shihuang more than 2,000 years ago.
	   Historians say construction of the tomb took 39 years and
involved as many as 750,000 laborers. In 1974, the tomb was
discovered in by peasants digging a well.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: Also moving on sports lines as Sports-Soccer-World Cup Fever
By KEVIN GRAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   Auto plants and stock trading are idled in Brazil. A symphony
orchestra in Norway cut short a performance to accommodate the
audience. Thailand's army commander decreed that conscripts can
stay up after lights-out. Millions of Asians go sleepless, and show
up red-eyed for work the next morning.
	   What's going on? It's World Cup fever, a globe-spanning
affliction that grips billions of soccer fans every four years.
	   From a starting field of nearly 200 national teams, 32 made it
through the qualifying rounds to earn a berth in soccer's nirvana _
the World Cup finals in France.
	   With the biggest World Cup field ever, TV audiences are
gigantic. The organizers estimate that 2 billion spectators tuned
in for the opening match on June 10 to watch defending champion
Brazil beat Scotland 2-1. Cumulative TV audiences could hit 40
billion for all 64 games before a champion is crowned July 12.
	   The financial implications are dizzying. Billions of dollars
will be spent on World Cup merchandise, promotions and advertising
during the month-long tournament.
	   Thanks to the media blitz and the world's fascination with the
game, the impact of the World Cup on average people is like no
other sports event: governments and industries are idled so
bureaucrats and workers can watch; students skip classes or watch
on TV sets brought along to classrooms by teachers; cities become
deserted at kickoff as fans rush inside watch broadcasts.
	   ``Let's postpone this discussion,'' said Zurab Zhavnia, speaker
of the Georgian parliament, adjourning a debate before the opening
match, when only 24 of 240 deputies still remained.
	   Sometimes, it seems, the World Cup overshadows the every day
tribulations of modern life.
	   When uncertainty swept Nigeria after its military ruler, Gen.
Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack early this month, residents of
Africa's most populous nation found respite from politics, economic
problems and crime when the national team upset Spain 3-2.
	   ``On a day like this, you're going to have a hard time getting
anyone to talk about politics,'' said Edet Ojo, as Nigeria's
victory resonated to cheers in the streets of a crumbling Lagos
neighborhood.
	   In Iran, the trial of Tehran's mayor for alleged corruption had
to wait until after the country's match against the United States.
Iran won 2-1 last Sunday.
	   Matches can also trigger destructive passions. After a
controversial refereeing decision resulted in a 1-1 draw between
Cameroon and Chile, residents of Yaounde called it an anti-African
plot and attacked businesses and vehicles owned by white
expatriates. No injuries were reported.
	   Crime doesn't take a holiday during the World Cup. While bank
employees in Santiago, Chile, watched the national team qualify for
the second round, four bandits decked out in red and white national
colors made off with 2 million pesos (dlrs 4,400). They showed a
handgun to a teller, then escaped into huge crowds celebrating
Chile's best performance in 36 years.
	   To catch the action, there isn't much people won't do. Jamaicans
lugged their TVs to work to watch their nation's first-ever matches
in the finals. It didn't seem to matter than the Reggae Boyz got
walloped 3-1 by Croatia and 5-0 by Argentina
	   In Norway, Ragnar Lutcherath didn't have tickets for France. So
he built a wooden grandstand in his yard so he could eat hot dogs
with friends, wave Norwegian flags and cheer wildly at the TV _
simulating a stadium experience.
	   In China, crowds stayed up half the night, drawn to Beijing bars
enticing them with cold beer and spiced mutton. ``If I get one or
two hours of sleep, it's enough,'' said Sheng Zhifeng, 30, one
patron.
	   Malaysia's government proved less tolerant, rejecting a plea by
nightclubs to remain open past 1 a.m. for live telecasts.
	   But in some countries, the biggest worry was whether power or TV
reception would fail altogether.
	   In Haiti _ where 12-hour-a-day blackouts are common _
Port-au-Prince residents were asked to turn off air conditioners to
ease the strain on power consumption during broadcasts.
	   In Reconquista, the hometown of Argentine star Gabriel
Batistuta, nearly 3,000 people protested outside a local cable
company when word spread that the the company hadn't bought rights
to the game. Some residents solved the problem by tuning into the
TV broadcasts from neighboring Brazil.
	   Thousands of Bangladeshis were less tolerant of power problems.
Authorities said they ransacked one power station after an outage
just 10 minutes before the Cup opener.

MARSEILLE: Cup opener. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Australia's outback, some die-hard fans wound up driving
hundreds of kilometers (miles) for a TV when broadcast coverage
didn't reach them. ``The guys on the Mir space station can watch it
and we can't,'' Ian Cuthbertson grumbled to one Australian
newspaper.
	   TV salesmen couldn't be happier.
	   ``I wish the World Cup were held every year,'' said Nguyen Viet
Hung, who more than doubled TV sales to 50 a day at his Hanoi shop.
	   Sets even appeared in some classrooms in Lima, Peru, where
teachers feared a dramatic drop-off in attendance.
	   ``The World Cup is what's on the mind of the students, so why
not use it as a teaching tool?'' explained Arturo Sinches,
principal at the Republic of Paraguay elementary school.
	   Students were asked to write reports on the World Cup and study
the history and geography of the teams. They even learned some
French, saying ``bonjour'' and ``au revoir'' to one another.
	   In some factories and workplaces, soccer stopped production.
	   Brazilian's main stock market vowed to fight the tide and remain
open. But it ended up suspending trading during Brazil's
first-round matches. Foreign investors ``can complain all they
want, but it won't change anything,'' said one broker, Alberto
Alves Sobrihno.
	   Four big automakers in Brazil shut down _ either completely or
partially _ during that country's games. An estimated 8,400
autoworkers paused for Brazil's opening game.
	   Workers are making up for lost production by by working through
lunch breaks, on Saturdays or adding hours during the week.
Downtown, each victory is an excuse to samba in the streets,
carnival-style.
	   After early morning broadcasts of South Korea's games, a
construction company gave workers time off, concerned that a lack
of sleep would cause accidents.
	   Britain, beset by worker absences and a daylong subway strike,
was nearly paralyzed by its first game. World Cup fever even
spilled into a summit of European Union leaders in Cardiff, Wales.
	   The talks didn't stop, but British Prime Minister Tony Blair had
updates delivered to the politicians at regular intervals.
	   Even highbrows in Norway couldn't resist their nation's opener:
the Trondheim orchestra sold only 50 tickets for an evening of
Schubert _ until it promised that the performance would be over by
game time. Then about 200 people showed up.
	   ``This way, fans of music and soccer could enjoy both,'' said
Siri F. Mathisen, the symphony's managing director. Like everyone
else, he rushed home to see Norway play.

Hyundai cancels dlrs 774 million deal with Adaptec 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Electronics Industries Co. has
canceled a dlrs 774 million deal to sell its American computer chip
plant to Adaptec Inc., the South Korean company said Friday.
	   The cancellation came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
opposed the deal on grounds it might create a market monopoly,
Hyundai officials said.
	   In February, Hyundai agreed to sell its Symbios Logic Corp.
unit, a Fort Collins, Colo.-based maker of computer storage
devices, to Silicon Valley's Adaptec.
	   Symbios competes in some of its products with Adaptec, which
makes hardware, software and chips that help information move
through computers and telecommunications more quickly.
	   Symbios products go into computers sold by Compaq Computer
Corp., Sun Microsystems Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
	   Hyundai hoped to sell Symbios to ease a cash crunch caused by
South Korea's economic crisis and finance a dlrs 1.3 billion chip
plant under construction in Eugene, Oregon.
	   Hyundai said it would continue to look for ways to sell Symbios.
	   Symbios employs 781 people in research and development, assembly
and testing in Fort Collins and 867 people in wafer fabrication and
engineering in Colorado Springs. It had revenues of dlrs 614
million last year.
	   Hyundai Electronics is South Korea's No. 2 computer chip maker
after Samsung. It is a unit of the Hyundai conglomerate.

Savarese KOs Douglas for IBA title 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with main event
<TEXT>
	   LEDYARD, Connecticut (AP) _ Lou Savarese, beaten in two of his
previous three fights, scored a stunning first-round knockout of
former world heavyweight champion Buster Douglas in an
International Boxing Association heavyweight title fight at the
Foxwoods Resort Casino.
	   Savarese, a slight underdog coming into the fight, floored
Douglas with a short right midway through the first round Thursday
night. Another right floored Douglas again seconds later.
	   A flurry of punches from Savarese sent Douglas to the canvas a
third time and referee Steve Smoger stopped it at 2:34.
	   Savarese of the United States won his first 35 pro fights, then
lost a decision to George Foreman and was knocked out by David Izon
before getting back on the winning track by knocking out Jeff Lally
in the second round in April.
	   It was the first loss for Douglas (36-6-1) in a comeback that
began in June 1996 after a nearly six-year layoff.
	   Douglas, 38, won the undisputed heavyweight title in February
1990 with a shocking knockout of then-unbeaten Mike Tyson in the
10th round of a fight in Tokyo.
	   This loss may have been a career-ender for Douglas, who weighed
242 pounds (110 kilos).
	   ``I screwed up big time,'' Douglas said.
	   The 31-year-old Savarese, at 234 pounds (106 kilos), moved back
into contention for one of the more recognized world titles.
	   Earlier on the card, Julio Cesar Chavez stopped Ken Sigurani of
the United States at 2:09 of the third round of a scheduled
10-rounder.
	   The victory by Chavez (101-2-2) sets up a September rematch with
WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya stopped
Chavez in the fourth round in June 1996.
	   Promoter Bob Arum had guaranteed Chavez dlrs 250,000 if he won
by knockout. It was the first knockout for Chavez since he stopped
Joey Gamache in the eighth round on Oct. 12, 1996.
	   The only thing that might prevent a rematch is Chavez's health.
He suffered a serious cut near the right eye, which he insisted was
from a head butt. Chavez complained bitterly to referee Arthur
Mercante in the second round as blood ran down his face.
	   Sigurani won the first two rounds on the cards of all three
judges. Chavez stunned Sigurani (22-2) with a powerful right hand
in the third, then unleashed a series of combinations that forced
Mercante to stop the fight.
	   Israel Cardona of the United States retained the USBA
lightweight championship by stopping fellow American Richard Kiley
at 1:16 of the eighth round. Cardona (29-2) dropped Kiley (11-2-3)
in the fifth, sixth and seventh rounds before putting him away in
the eighth.

India says no to U.N mediatory efforts on Kashmir 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A United Nations peace envoy has dropped
New Delhi from his itinerary, apparently because Indian officials
feared he would try to mediate in their territorial dispute with
neighboring Pakistan, news reports said Friday.
	   The United Nations had planned to have Alvaro de Soto, the
assistant U.N. secretary-general, visit Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan to discuss controlling nuclear weapons following a series
of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. De Soto was also to have
discussed what many believe to be the root of regional tensions _
the dispute between India and Pakistan over the northern region of
Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of the
Himalayan territory, leaving two thirds of Kashmir in India and the
rest in Pakistan.
	   The Indian-controlled part of Kashmir is the only
Muslim-majority state in India, which is predominantly Hindu. A
separatist movement that New Delhi says is supported by Islamabad
has killed more than 15,000 people there since 1989.
	   De Soto still planned to visit Bangladesh on Saturday and then
Pakistan, but he ``is not going to India as New Delhi had indicated
that It is not ready to receive him,'' Press Trust of India news
agency quoted U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard as saying in New York.
	   PTI quoted Indian foreign ministry officials as saying India
would welcome de Soto only to discuss global nuclear disarmament.
	   ``There is no scope for third-party involvement of any nature in
respect of India's relations with Pakistan. India-Pakistan issues
are purely bilateral, to be resolved through bilateral dialogue,''
K.C. Singh, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters
in New Delhi on Thursday.
	   Pakistan, which is mostly Muslim, has been eager for
international mediation in the Kashmiri dispute, believing it is at
a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its much larger neighbor.
India adamantly resists any outside pressure.
	   Kashmir will be on the agenda when the prime ministers of India
and Pakistan meet next month in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo
on the sidelines of a regional summit.

Helicopter crashes near northern base, rebels blamed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lanka's tiny air force lost a
helicopter in a crash early Friday in a contested northern jungle,
the Defense Ministry said.
	   Ministry officials in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, reached
by telephone from neighboring India, confirmed the crash but could
not immediately provide details.
	   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity from the military air
base at Vavuniya, 210 kilometers (130 miles) north of Colombo, said
all four crew members were killed in the crash just south of the
air base. They suspected the helicopter was hit by a grenade fired
by separatist Tamil rebels hiding in the jungles surrounding the
base.
	   The rebels want a homeland in the north and east for minority
Tamils, who they say are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese. Tamils account for 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18 million
people and have a language, religion and culture distinct from that
of the Sinhalese, who control the army and the government.
	   Sri Lanka's air force has fewer than 40 aircraft, and it lost 10
planes and helicopters last year in crashes blamed mostly on pilot
error or engine failure.
	   The Tamil Tigers, who possess no aircraft of their own, have
used shoulder-held missiles in the past to shoot down aircraft.

Philippine Airlines rejects attempt by pilots to return to work dismissed 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with airline saying pilots remain

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of pilots at flag carrier
Philippine Airlines called off a three-week strike and attempted to
return to work Friday but were rejected by management, who said
they remain fired for having ignored a back-to-work order.
	   The pilots, wearing their uniforms, marched to Manila's airport
to report for work but instead were offered application forms by
the airline to apply as new employees.
	   ``They are no longer working for the company,'' PAL executive
vice president Manolo Aquino said. ``They have signified their
intention to resign by not complying with the return-to-work
order.''
	   The 625-member pilots' union refused the application forms and
said it would file a claim of illegal lockout with the labor
department.
	   The union said it decided to end the strike because its legal
counsel had finally received late Thursday the back-to-work order,
which was issued more than two weeks ago by the labor department.
	   A back-to-work order normally takes effect when it is served to
the union's legal counsel. But the counsel repeatedly foiled the
labor department's attempts to deliver the document, and the
secretary of labor has ruled that the order was effectively
conveyed instead in meetings with union officials.
	   PAL earlier dismissed the strikers for failing to meet the
deadline specified in the order, June 9.
	   PAL also has announced a drastic reduction of operations to cope
with financial problems worsened by the strike. Under the reduced
operations the airline says it needs only 200 pilots.
	   Last week, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers in
an effort to scale down its operations and stave off more losses,
causing the airline's flight attendants and ground personnel to
threaten to strike as well.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an airline
plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of service
or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   ``We are not giving up the fight, but we are going to go back to
the cockpit,'' union president Sotico Lloren said in announcing the
end of the strike. ``Our demands are still there, negotiations are
continuing, but we will go back to work.''
	   PAL says the pilots' strike has worsened financial problems
caused by Asia's currency crisis and has pushed it to the brink of
closure because of more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in
lost revenue.
	   The airline has sought a suspension of payments on about dlrs 2
billion in loans owed to about 1,000 foreign and local banks and
aircraft lessors because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   PAL said more personnel may be laid off under the rehabilitation
plan, which calls for a leaner work force, disposal of 40 out of 54
planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its routes and sale
of some subsidiaries.

Bishop charges possible trap in aborted refugee homecoming 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous.
By TRINA KLEIST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A homecoming for 850
Indian refugees was canceled because organizers suspect a trap by
government supporters, a Roman Catholic bishop said.
	   What was meant to be a demonstration of reconciliation in the
strife-ridden southern state of Chiapas instead became yet another
show of fear and mistrust.
	   Bishops Samuel Ruiz and Raul Vera had planned to accompany about
850 members of the church-linked organization Las Abejas on a march
to return to their homes on Thursday.
	   But they scrapped the idea when they received information about
a possible plot early in the morning, Ruiz said late Thursday after
celebrating Mass.
	   Six months ago, 45 members of Las Abejas who were praying in a
village church were killed by a pro-government vigilante group
allegedly seeking revenge for another killing, federal
investigators say.
	   Several suspected ringleaders who have been jailed are from the
village of Los Chorros, one of two villages to which the refugees
had hoped to return Thursday after fleeing political violence late
last year.
	   They are among an estimated 10,000 people who have fled their
homes in the Chenalho district, largely due to threats or attacks
by pro-government groups that considered them sympathetic to the
leftist Zapatista National Liberation Army.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. A
partial accord was signed with the government in 1996, but peace
talks later broke down.
	   Ruiz said that a ``very sure source'' had told a local priest
that members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, had met in Los Chorros on Wednesday with the district mayor
and members of the vigilante group connected to the massacre.
	   ``The thinking of these PRI members was to allow the refugees to
pass, together with the bishops, and then to close the highway to
hold them as hostages, and from that vantage ask the state
government for the liberation'' of the imprisoned massacre
suspects, Ruiz said.
	   Earlier in the day, the refugees marched in a half-mile-long
(kilometer-long) column along the winding mountain highway to the
rutted dirt turn-off to Los Chorros. There, they announced they
would not return to their villages, saying PRI members wanted to
force them to join the party as a condition of their going home.
	   State officials said pro-PRI villagers were enthusiastic about
the refugees' return.
	   ``What I saw was a really beautiful attitude,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State Alejandro Cruz after the marchers packed up
their babies and water bottles to walk back to an overcrowded
refugee camp several hours away. ``There are no conditions for
return. We have to persevere in re-establishing an environment of
trust.''
	   Mayor Pedro Mariano Perez Arias denied any conditions existed
for the refugees' return. He blamed the bishops for sabotaging the
march.
	   Las Abejas members sympathize with the Zapatistas' demands, but
say they do not agree with taking up arms.
	   In Los Chorros, about five miles (eight kilometers) by rocky
dirt road from the turn-off, hundreds of people had turned out to
welcome the returnees.
	   But a man who gave his name only as ``Tommy'' said PRI leaders
had refused to let them open the Catholic church to welcome the
returnees and said village leaders were still demanding money to
support the vigilantes.
	   ``Sometimes we don't have enough food,'' he said. ``Sometimes we
eat only tortillas and chiles. But we have to seek loans at
interest because if we do not cooperate, they take us to jail.''

Report: Indonesian minister says relations with Singapore strained 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Arguing that Singapore isn't doing enough to
help its ailing neighbor, an Indonesian cabinet minister said
relations between his country and the small island republic have
become strained, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``Ties are not moving in the right direction,'' Tanri Abeng,
minister of state-owned enterprises in President B.J. Habibie's new
government, told The Business Times.
	   He said the main problem was the lack of action on Singapore's
proposed trade finance plan for Indonesia, which was mooted last
year but has yet to progress. The dlrs 3 billion program would
commit the Singapore government to guarantee payments of key
imports into the country.
	   Tanri said that the lack of further action on the plan had
caused unhappiness in the new Indonesian government, and argued
that ``if the relationship is at its best, that (trade financing)
would have been resolved.''
	   He said Singapore and Indonesia ``need to really sit down and
work out exactly what should be done by both countries so that the
need can be facilitated by Singapore.''
	   Seen as a small island of relative stability amid the turmoil of
the economic crisis in Southeast Asia, Singapore has been more
insulated from the ill effects of the slowdown than Indonesia,
where a government was toppled and severe recession looms.
	   Tanri's statements confirm the view in Jakarta that Singapore is
partly responsible for helping its struggling neighbor, and are the
first direct comments by a Cabinet member about the two neighbors'
soured relations.
	   Tanri said that ``if there are problems, they should be
discussed so that there is no misinterpretation _ of what Singapore
can do and what Indonesia needs.''
	   He added that another source of tension between the two major
trading partners were confidence-deflating signals coming from
Singapore.
	   He argued that the country ``can help restore market confidence
by giving a positive assessment of Jakarta's post-Suharto
government and its policies where this was appropriate.''
	   Relations between Indonesia and Singapore have cooled since
February, partly due to comments then by Singapore patriarch Lee
Kuan Yew about the likely negative market reaction to the election
of Habibie as vice-president.
	   The newspaper said those remarks were not well received by the
Indonesian government, especially Habibie, who went on to become
president of the huge republic after popular unrest led to
Suharto's resignation in May.
	   Tanri argued that it was in Singapore's interest to help
Indonesia resolve its problems quickly because of the
interdependence of their economies.

	   HUNTINGTON PARK, California (AP) _ Dozens were arrested when a
disturbance erupted as more than 1,000 people crowded downtown
streets to celebrate Mexico's advance to the second round of World
Cup soccer.
	   Revelers tried to rock a transit bus, bashed a pickup truck and
jumped on cars. Some store windows were broken and there was minor
vandalism.
	   Local police were quickly reinforced by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department and other agencies.
	   Thirty-one people were arrested for various crimes, mostly for
misdemeanor failure to disperse, deputy Bob Killeen said. He said
officers were able to pinpoint ``a small element of this crowd that
is out there causing trouble.''
	   The celebration began about 9:30 a.m. (1630GMT) and calmed hours
later after officers blocked a dozen intersections and ordered
people to go home. Officers marched elbow to elbow down streets and
fired diversionary devices that cause flashes of light, smoke and
loud noises in an effort to scatter the crowd.

conservative One Nation leader Pauline Hanson in her home region
Friday, criticizing her immigration policies.

Queensland state electorates won by the right-wing One Nation

</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust is planning a merger with Japan's
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been foundering under
huge problem loans, Japanese media reported Friday.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Shares in the LCTB plummeted Thursday as executives spelled out
a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger.
	   Trading in shares for both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were
suspended on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   Officials could not immediately comment on the reports, carried
by Kyodo news and NHK, Japan's public television network.

	   At the LTCB's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, officials
detailed plans announced in February to shut down about half its
overseas outlets and cut staff by 20 percent.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners.
	   Japan's government is pushing banks to write off the bad loans
they amassed on the late 1980s and is scrambling to set up an
emergency bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out
in the cold by private banks now unwilling toloan them more money.
	   Investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered the bank's credit rating and sent its
share prices plunging.

DENVER: straight decision. Indians 8, Cardinals 2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Cleveland, St. Louis' Mark McGwire hit his 35th homer, nearly
becoming the first player to hit a ball out of Jacobs Field, but
the Indians got two homers from Jim Thome to beat the Cardinals.
	   McGwire, who homered for the second straight night, hit a 2-2
curveball from Dave Burba (9-5) with two outs in the first that hit
a steel support beam attached to the left-field scoreboard. The
461-foot (141-meter) shot was the second-longest homer hit at the
ballpark. McGwire owns the top three.
	   Thome hit a two-run homer in the fifth off Manny Aybar (3-4),
and made it 5-2 with a solo shot off Bobby Witt in the eighth.
Thome has 21 homers.
 &UR; Tigers 6, Cubs 4 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Sammy Sosa broke the major league record for homers
in a month, but Tony Clark's three-run homer in the seventh inning
lifted Detroit.
	   Clark's homer off Terry Mulholland, broke a 3-3 tie and gave the
Tigers a two-game sweep of the Cubs, who have lost five straight
and 12 of 16.
	   Sosa hit his 32nd homer leading off the seventh inning. It was
his 19th home run in June, breaking the major league mark of 18 set
by Detroit's Rudy York in August 1937. Sosa had broken the NL
record of 17 set by San Francisco's Willie Mays in August 1965 on
Tuesday night.
	   Detroit's Damion Easley homered and Geronimo Berroa, making his
Tigers debut, hit a two-run double off Cubs starter Kerry Wood.
Matt Anderson (1-0) got two outs in the seventh to win his
big-league debut. Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his 12th save.
	   Terry Adams (6-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Yankees 6, Braves 0 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the New York Yankees sent a clear message they are
the best team in baseball, breaking a scoreless tie with a five-run
sixth inning and cruising behind David Wells' six-hitter.
	   New York, with the best record in the majors, took three of four
games from Atlanta, which entered the series with the top record in
the NL, but are in their worst slump of the season, losing six of
eight.
	   Wells (10-2) struck out four and didn't walk anyone as Atlanta
was shut out for just the second time.
	   Denny Neagle (8-6) pitched 5 1-3 innings allowing four hits,
five walks and five runs, including a two-run triple by Paul
O'Neill and a two-run homer by Chad Curtis.
 &UR; Blue Jays 1, Expos 0 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Woody Williams pitched a five-hitter for his first
career shutout and Mike Stanley hit his 18th homer as Toronto beat
Montreal for its season-high fifth straight victory.
	   Stanley homered off Carlos Perez (6-7) with two outs in the
fourth inning to give Williams (8-3) all the support he needed.
Toronto swept the four-game series and has won five in a row
against Montreal over two seasons.
 &UR; Mets 3, Orioles 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Carlos Baerga singled home the winning run with two
outs in the bottom of the ninth inning as New York swept the
two-game series at Shea Stadium.
	   Baerga's third hit of the game came against Armando Benitez
(2-2), who walked leadoff hitter Edgardo Alfonzo and then walked
John Olerud with two outs. Baerga followed with a single to
right-center and there was no play at the plate.
	   The Mets finished with nine hits, exactly one in every inning.
Dennis Cook (3-2) was the winner.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Livan Hernandez pitched an eight-hitter for his second
consecutive complete game and Gregg Zaun homered and drove in two
runs for Florida.
	   Hernandez (6-4), accused last week of assault by his former
girlfriend, struck out nine and walked one for his fifth complete
game of the season, all coming in his last nine starts.
	   Edgar Renteria had three hits as the Marlins beat Julio Santana
(2-1) for their sixth win in eight games. The Marlins won three of
four, including a two-game sweep in Miami, in the first all-Florida
series.
 &UR; Royals 6, Pirates 1 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jeff Conine and Larry Sutton each
homered and Tim Belcher allowed four hits in eight innings to lead
Kansas City.
	   After punishing the Royals for a season-high 19 hits and 10 runs
the night before, Pittsburgh got just two runners as far as second
base against Belcher (6-7) until Aramis Ramirez homered in the
eighth.
	   Conine hit his fifth home run leading off the fifth against
starter Jon Lieber (5-9), and Sutton connected for a two-run shot,
his third of the year, in the sixth.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Phillies 5 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Bret Saberhagen limited Philadelphia to five
hits and no earned runs in six innings as Boston snapped a
three-game losing streak.
	   Saberhagen, 0-2 with a 9.00 ERA in his previous two starts,
walked none and struck out one to improve to 9-5. John Valentin and
Damon Buford hit solo homers off Matt Beech (3-5).
 &UR; Reds 7, White Sox 5 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Brett Tomko ended a personal five-game losing streak
as Cincinnati snapped an 11-game skid.
	   Pokey Reese hit a three-run homer in the eighth and drove in a
career-high four runs for the Reds, who won for only the fourth
time in 23 games this month.
	   Tomko (6-6) gave up two runs _ one earned _ on eight hits and
one walk for his first win since May 13. Jeff Shaw got the last
four outs for his 19th save.
	   Jim Parque (2-1) allowed four runs in three innings for his
first loss in six big league starts.
 &UR; Angels 3, Dodgers 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Knuckleballer Steve Sparks, 0-8 in the minors
before being called up by Anaheim less than two weeks ago, won his
third consecutive start in the Angels' victory over Los Angeles.
	   Sparks (3-0), who missed all of 1997 after elbow surgery,
allowed four hits and shut out the Dodgers for six innings after
giving up a first-inning run. Troy Percival pitched the ninth for
his major league-leading 24th save.
	   Phil Nevin doubled home a pair of runs to highlight a three-run
sixth inning. The victory, the Angels' 21st in their last 24 games,
kept them 2 1/2 games ahead of Texas in the AL West. Anaheim won
the interleague series 3-1.
	   Dennis Reyes (0-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Rangers 9, Diamondbacks 4 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez drove in three runs
each and Todd Van Poppel won for the first time in nearly two
years.
	   Juan Gonzalez added an RBI single off Amaury Telemaco (2-2), his
major league-leading 94th RBI.
	   Van Poppel (1-1) held the Diamondbacks to six hits and four runs
in 8 1-3 innings in his second appearance in the majors since Sept.
27, 1996, After allowing a two-run homer to Travis Lee in the
third, Van Poppel retired the next 10 batters in order.

EU ups cereal land set-aside; Approves banana, olive oil, tobacco reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Concerned about rising cereal stocks, European
Union agriculture ministers on Friday agreed to force farmers to
take 10 percent of their land out of production in 1999, double the
1998 rate.
	   The decision came despite pressure from France, the EU's largest
producer, which wanted a lower set-aside rate than 10 percent, and
was part of a deal that included a 1999 farm price package and
reforms of the EU banana, olive oil and tobacco markets.
	   The ministers kept virtually all farm subsidies unchanged ahead
of negotiations over proposals for deep cuts in cereal, beef and
dairy support prices in the 2000-2003 period.
	   The 1998 EU farm budget is 40.4 billion euros (dlrs 44.4
billion), nearly half the total EU budget.
	   The ministers approved new banana import rules, but some
officials said these may be rejected by the United States and other
trade partners. The World Trade Organization has ruled the EU
banana import system illegal and ordered it changed by Jan. 1,
1999.
	   The set-aside rate for grains is the amount of land farmers must
take out of production. The 10 percent rate was recommended by the
EU executive Commission which saw Western Europe stocks of surplus
grain growing out of control.
	   That ``grain mountain'' now weighs 15 million metric tons, up
from 2.4 million tons a year ago. The commission predicted it could
go by mid-2000 to 30 million tons.
	   In other decisions, the agriculture ministers:
	   _ retained two preferential import quotas for bananas: one for
annual duty free imports of 857,700 metric tons from 12 countries,
the other for the annual import of 2.5 million tons at a reduced
duty of 75 European Currency Units (dlrs 82,50) a ton.
	   The reduced-duty imports tend to come from Latin America. The EU
raised by 8 percent aid to producers in compensation for the end of
the license system. The EU has four banana producers: France,
Spain, Portugal and Greece.
	   _ increased by 32 percent, to 1.78 million metric tons a year,
its quota on subsidized olive oil production and divide that among
the EU's five olive oil producing countries: Spain, Italy, Greece,
Portugal and France. Until now that quota was not split among
countries.
	   The ministers approved a 7 percent reduction, to 1,323 euros
(dlrs 1,430) a ton, in the full olive oil subsidy to limit rises in
spending due to a larger quota. They also abolished the olive oil
intervention system - by which the EU acts as a buyer of last
resort - limit most aid to the production from groves in existence
on May 1, 1998 and ended consumption aid and aid for small
producers.
	   Under the transitional system, the annual country quotas will
be: 760,027 tons for Spain, 543,164 tons for Italy, 419,529 tons
for Greece, 51,244 tons for Portugal and 3,297 tons for France.
	   The national quotas are meant to allow overproduction penalties
to be more directly targeted. Until now, these were imposed on all
producers, not those who overproduced.
	   EU olive oil production has surpassed the existing quota limit
largely because of output in Spain, the world's largest olive oil
producer. Olive oil production in Spain amounted to more than 1
million tons in 1997.
	   _ changed subsidizes for tobacco growers by increasing payments
for higher-quality tobacco and reducing them for lower-quality
tobacco. The 15-member EU has eight tobacco-producing countries _
Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium and
Austria.

<TEXT>
	   HERVEY BAY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard attacked
conservative One Nation leader Pauline Hanson in her heartland
Friday, criticizing her immigration policies.
	   Howard is making a two-day trip through three of the 11
Queensland state electorates won by the right-wing One Nation
earlier this month. One Nation, making its election debut as a
party, won 23 percent of the vote.
	   Hervey Bay is a coastal town about 1,300 kilometers (806 miles)
north of Sydney and 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of the state
capitol of Brisbane.
	   Howard told a public meeting Friday that a healthy debate on
issues such as immigration was important. But he said such a
discussion could be held without reference to people's race or
color.
	   ``And what I object to about some of the utterances of the One
Nation Party is that they have made Australian Asians feel
uncomfortable, they have made them feel unwelcome and I resent that
very, very much,'' Howard said.
	   ``I also happen to disagree very strongly with some of their
economic policies because they will do more harm to Australia and
they will do more damage than the policies that are being followed
at present.''
	   Howard said he understood the concerns of One Nation supporters.
	   ``I don't call them racists, I never have and I never will _ but
I do believe that some of the utterances of the party have
encouraged a sense of hostility in our community towards people of
Asian descent,'' Howard said.
	   ``And I resent that, and it's something that we should all
oppose very strongly, because all Australians are equal and all
Australians should be treated with a decent level of civility.''
	   Howard received a warmer reception in Hervey Bay than he was
afforded in the town of Wondai on Thursday night.
	   At that meeting he was booed by some sections of the audience
and jeered as he left by pork producers angry about Canadian
imports.

Two children killed in a war-era bomb blast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two children were killed and another was
seriously injured when a war-era bomb exploded in the central
province of Nghe An, the newspaper Vanguard reported Friday.
	   The bomb, found by the children in a garden, instantly killed
Nguyen Van Lan, 14, and Nguyen Van Tam, 11, while 8-year-old Nguyen
Van Long was seriously injured.
	   It was unclear if they were related, and efforts by The
Associated Press to reach their village by phone were unsuccessful.
	   Hundreds of people are killed each year by explosions of war-era
ordnance. Many victims are children or scrap-iron collectors who
risk their lives to make a little money.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. is planning a
merger with Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been
foundering under huge problem loans, Japanese media reported
Friday.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Trading in shares for both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were
suspended on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   Hiroshi Nakato, a spokesman for Sumitomo Trust, refused to
confirm or deny the reports, which were carried by several Japanese
media, including the Asahi newspaper and NHK, Japan's public
television network.
	   He said a news conference would be held later in the day.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank.
	   LTCB officials had repeatedly denied rumors that the bank was on
the verge of failure, but recently acknowledged it holds 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution may be foundering.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners.
	   Japan's government is pushing banks to write off the bad loans
they amassed on the late 1980s and is scrambling to set up an
emergency bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out
in the cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them more money.
	   But investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered the bank's credit rating and sent its
share prices plunging.

Australia's BHP posts second-ever loss 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Mining giant BHP Co. posted only the
second loss in its 113-year history Friday, with massive asset
writedowns wiping billions from its asset base.
	   BHP reported a bottom line loss of Australian dlrs 1.47 billion
(U.S. dlrs 890 million) for the year ended May 31, from a
Australian dlrs 410 million (U.S. dlrs 247 million) in the previous
year. The company announced it was cutting more than Australian
dlrs 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion) from the value of its
assets.
	   BHP's chief operating officer Ron McNeilly said the Asian
economic downturn sliced Australian dlrs 50 million (U.S. dlrs 30
million) off its after tax results.
	   ``There's no doubt that market conditions are very difficult,
and in these circumstances, and particularly in light of the Asian
financial turmoil, I believe the operating result we've delivered
is encouraging,'' McNeilly said.
	   BHP had an operating income after tax but before the writedowns
of Australian dlrs 1.3 billion (U.S. dlrs 780 million) versus 1.39
billion (U.S. dlrs 840 million) for the previous year.
	   McNeilly said it was difficult to be precise about the cost of
the Asian crisis but, ``the direct effect is of the order of
Australian dlrs 50 million after tax.''
	   McNeilly indicated that the indirect effect of the Asian crisis
had been much more substantial by attributing some of the
Australian dlrs 3.076 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.85 billion) in asset
writedowns to the problems.
	   ``Changed market and economic circumstances, particularly in
Asia have impacted on our view of forward commodity price levels,''
McNeilly said.
	   The local market reacted positively to the news, perceiving the
company's move as clearing the deck for a new chief executive at
BHP.
	   BHP shares rocketed higher, up 31 cents in early trade.
	   Reynolds &AMP; Co's Peter Struk said brokers had welcomed BHP taking
the hard line and ``cut out a lot of the pf cost overruns and a falling share prices,
managing director and chief executive John Prescott resigned in
March.
	   Battered by management upheaval and plummeting share prices over
the last year, BHP, known as ``The Big Australian,'' fell from
being the biggest publicly listed company in the nation to number
two, after Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd.

Beijing's largest Protestant church awaits Clinton

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ No steeple marks China's largest Protestant
church, where President Bill Clinton will worship on Sunday. The
squat gray building is reached by walking through a hotel parking
lot and a row of brick shanties or down narrow lanes barely wide
enough for a car.
	   Yet on a typical Sunday the humble sanctuary of Chongwenmen
Church draws overflow crowds of worshippers who spill into a
cramped basement to watch a television feed of the service or sit
in a courtyard sheltered by shade trees.
	   Urged by American religious leaders to appeal for more freedom
for China's Christians, Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, Clinton has
promised to convey the message that all believers should be allowed
to worship when and where they choose, free from government
interference.
	   During the radical days of the Cultural Revolution, from the
mid-1960s to late 1970s, churches in China were closed; many were
destroyed. Chongwen men did not reopen until Christmas 1982. Then
about 700 people gathered each Sunday, compared with 2,500 today.
	   Christianity has been growing quickly in China, says the Rev. Wu
Wei, the 36-year-old senior pastor of Chongwenmen.
	   ``Society is going in a direction of diversity. People can
choose their own beliefs,'' Wu said.
	   Beijing, a city of 13 million people, has eight Protestant
churches with a combined membership of about 30,000.
	   The nation, with a population of 1.2 billion, has about 12
million Protestants and a roughly equal number of Catholics, based
on government figures and estimates by Western scholars.
	   The nondenominational Chinese Protestant churches must register
with the government before they legally can hold services.
	   Rights groups say independent, evangelical Christian leaders
have been jailed and harassed.
	   Han Wenzao, president of the official China Christian Council,
acknowledges there have been problems. Every day he receives
letters from churches around the country, and some complain about
unfair treatment by local officials of the government's Religious
Affairs Bureau, he said in an interview.
	   The council investigates and goes through government channels to
resolve cases of local officials who violate the rights of
Christians, Han said.
	   ``China being so vast, one cannot expect the provisions could be
implemented everywhere the same,'' he said.
	   Leaders of China's Protestant and Catholic churches say one of
their biggest problems is lack of clergy.
	   Nationwide, there is about one Protestant minister for every
8,000 believers, church officials say. Many of China's 25,000
legally registered house churches are lead by lay members with a
year or two of theological training.
	   Chongwenmen has three ministers and several lay leaders.
	   Founded by U.S. Methodist missionaries in 1876, it was burned
down in 1900 by the Boxers, rebels who attacked converts and
missionaries across north China, killing thousands of Chinese
Christians and 250 foreigners.
	   The present church was built in 1904, in the waning years of the
last dynasty. It was named for its location near a gate of the city
wall. The gate was destroyed in the 1950s.

Canadian government urged to cut taxes to curb brain drain to U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The federal government is under increasing
pressure to cut taxes to stem the flow of Canadians _ many with
high-tech skills _ to better-paying, lower-taxed jobs in the United
States.
	   There has been a Canada-to-U.S. brain drain for many years, but
it has accelerated recently as U.S. high-tech companies recruit
more aggressively north of the border.
	   Moreover, the issue of tax cuts has become more sensitive for
the Liberal Party government this year. It has finally eliminated
the budget deficit, after five years of painful cutbacks, and can
no longer say that tax cuts are out of the question.
	   The leader of the main opposition faction in Parliament, Preston
Manning of the right-wing Reform Party, has decided to make the
brain drain a cornerstone of his latest push for tax cuts.
	   He released a Reform Party study Wednesday asserting that more
than 660,000 Canadians now work south of the border. It said the
number of Canadians seeking temporary work visas in the United
States increased to 46,574 in 1996 from 19,378 in 1989.
	   ``It's time the Liberals woke up to the fact that this country
is losing a generation thanks to their high-tax policies,'' Manning
said.
	   Finance Minister Paul Martin, considered the top contender to
succeed Jean Chretien as Liberal Party leader and prime minister,
has thus far balked at major tax cuts.
	   Pleas for tax cuts also have come from high-tech executives.
	   ``We lose a lot of our scientists to the United States and we
don't succeed in attracting foreign researchers here,'' said
Francesco Bellini, chief executive of leading pharmaceutical firm
BioChem Pharma.
	   Bellini said he had supported the government's focus on deficit
reduction, but urged it to make tax relief the next priority so
corporations could spend more on research.
	   ``Otherwise, we're going to see certain research and development
activities move to countries that don't face this problem, such as
the United States,'' he said.
	   Help-wanted ads placed by U.S. high-tech firms appear regularly
in Canadian newspapers, and U.S. recruiters flock to high-tech job
fairs in Canada with offers of salaries and perks that Canadian
firms generally won't match.
	   ``The raiding that's going on is just crazy,'' said Shirley-Ann
George, executive director of the Canadian Advanced Technology
Association. ``Americans have found that Canada is a ripe picking
ground.''
	   The recruiters' targets include both experienced workers and new
graduates. U.S. software giant Microsoft has become the top
destination for computer science graduates from the University of
Waterloo in southwestern Ontario, the leading Canadian school in
the field.
	   Taxes in Canada vary from province to province, but the top tax
rate _ combining federal and provincial taxes _ is generally close
to 50 percent.

Reserve Bank governor: Asian crisis worst since oil shocks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The Asian financial crisis may be
the most serious shock to hit New Zealand's economy since the oil
shocks of the 1970s, Reserve Bank governor Don Brash said Friday.
	   But the difference this time is that New Zealand is prepared for
it, he said.
	   ``The benefits of recent economic reforms, in reducing public
sector debt and improving the flexibility and adaptability of the
economy as a whole, will be evident to all to see,'' Brash said.
	   Brash said New Zealand's strengths are a strong banking sector,
a floating exchange rate and low public sector debt.
	   He said New Zealand assets had not been badly overpriced as in
some Asian countries and the lower kiwi dollar would help exporters
switch to non-Asian markets.
	   Growth figures released by Statistics New Zealand Friday showed
the economy shrank by 0.9 percent in the March quarter, the first
quarter to record negative growth for more than five years.
	   Brash spoke as a team of sovereign debt assessors from
U.S.-based Moody's Investor Services met government ministers and
officials over a possible downgrade of the country's credit rating.
	   Brash said ``a monetary policy aimed firmly at price stability
is of enormous benefit in weathering the storm'' of the Asian
financial crisis.
	   A recent newspaper editorial suggested that New Zealand was a
child in an economic storm without a hat or coat, and with leaking
gumboots, he said.
	   ``Certainly the weather is getting rough, and may get rougher.
But in my own view we have good wet weather gear and a sturdy
four-wheel-drive vehicle.''
	   After a decade of fighting inflation it was possible that in the
next year or two the central bank would be working to prevent it
going below zero. The bank currently targets inflation between 0
and 3 percent.
	   He warned that the bank would be as single-minded about stopping
inflation slipping below zero as it had been about fighting it
rising.
	   While it had already eased monetary policy, it also had to be
careful not to ease so much that it would have to slam the brakes
on again in a few years time.
	   ``Monetary policy should be able to protect the economy from any
prolonged deflation and the loss of output and employment which
that would entail,'' he said.
	   He said the best response of the government to the crisis was to
continue with its program of micro-economic reform.
	   The Cabinet meets Monday to further review economic policy in
light of the slowdown sparked by the Asian crisis.

China executes seven for drug trafficking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As part of a government drive against drugs,
authorities in southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong
Kong, have executed seven people convicted of drug trafficking,
according to a report seen Friday in Beijing.
	   Three of those executed were among 58 people sentenced at a
public rally attended by 3,000 people in the city of Shantou, the
Yangcheng Evening News reported Thursday.
	   The executions took place Tuesday and Wednesday, it said.
	   It said that Shantou authorities also destroyed 21 kilograms of
heroin; 13 kilograms of the designer drug, ice; 53 kilograms of
ephedrine and 179 kilograms of caffeine _ the largest such drug
haul ever for the city.
	   In a separate report, the Yangcheng Evening News said the
railway court in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong,
executed four convicted drug traffickers on Thursday.
	   China has showcased its fight against trafficking in illicit
drugs recently with a major exhibition in Beijing that has been
visited by both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Legal Daily reported Thursday that a
court in Hangzhou, eastern China, had sentenced three people to
death for drug trafficking.

Eds: UPDATES with Clinton tour of terra cotta soldiers, US protest
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Confronted by a Chinese crackdown on
dissidents as he opened his visit, President Bill Clinton said
Friday the repression was ``not China at its best and not China
looking forward, but looking backward.''
	   The government's action made for a sour beginning to Clinton's
nine-day trip, a journey he began with a gentle lecture about human
rights. Fresh arrests Wednesday and Thursday were an embarrassment
to Clinton, already under fire at home for expanding cooperation
with a communist regime accused of human rights violations and
religious prosecution.
	   The president said one of his objectives here was to discuss,
publicly and privately, issues of personal freedom. The crackdown
``makes it all the more important that we continue to work with the
Chinese and to engage them,'' the president said.
	   Clinton's comments to reporters in a nearby village came amid
reports that several dissidents had been detained by Chinese
authorities around the start of the president's trip. ``I found the
reports disturbing,'' Clinton said.
	   On a lighter note, the president visited one the most
spectacular archaeological finds of the 20th century: more than
7,000 life-size clay horses and armored warriors buried in battle
formations near the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang more than 2,000
years ago.
	   The tomb was discovered by peasants digging a well in 1974.
``I've been reading about it for 25 years but it's different to see
it,'' the president said, shaking his head in amazement. Unlike
other tourists, Clinton was permitted to go down into the pit for a
closeup view, reaching up to touch the face of one soldier.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said Ambassador James Sasser raised
the issue of the dissidents' arrests with senior Chinese officials.
He was told the government did not regard the arrests as a
crackdown, but an attempt to avoid disruptions during Clinton's
visit, the officials said. The Chinese said it was not meant to
embarrass Clinton.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news agencies _
urging the U.S. president to speak out for freedom and the release
of political prisoners and to meet with dissidents during his stay.
	   The president also said the United States would not alter its
policy toward Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade island. The
United States holds to a one-China policy and does not support a
declaration of independence by Taiwan.
	   On the first full day of his visit, Clinton journeyed to the
outskirts of this ancient capital to Xiahe, a village of 400 people
where the per capita income is about $400 a year. Villagers told
the president that their lives were improving under a kind of
grassroots capitalism system.
	   In a roundtable discussion, both the president and his wife
Hillary engaged teachers, students, physicians and entrepreneurs
with questions about how life there had changed in recent years.
	   The first presidential visit since the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, Clinton's trip is intended to help stabilize
U.S.-Chinese relations after years of grudging distrust. With
little expectation of any breakthroughs, officials said the
symbolism of Clinton's trip likely will outweigh the substance.

U.S. company says it wasn't stealing Thai jasmine rice 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A U.S. rice company downplayed a
growing fear in Thailand that the patenting of its special milling
process was a threat to the country's highly-prized jasmine rice.
	   The Alvin, Texas-based RiceTec Inc. said that it has never sold
or produced Jasmine 85 _ a strain developed from Thailand's special
Khao Dawk Malai 105 _ nor is it trying to patent jasmine rice. Khao
Dawk Malai means jasmine rice.
	   Thailand has backed off original accusations that RiceTec
developed a brand the company calls Jasmati from Thai strains filed
with the Manila-based International Rice Research Institute, but
the country is now considering legally protecting the jasmine name.
	   Thailand, the world's top rice exporter, regards rice
development as intellectual property and in May asked the IRRI to
examine allegations that RiceTec was trying to profit from a
variety it has reportedly developed from the Thai strain.
	   RiceTec denied the allegations in a statement distributed Friday
to The Associated Press.
	   ``What is patented by RiceTec is a special milling process
invented by the company to achieve the soft texture of Jasmati,'' a
long-grain hybrid it developed in the early 1990s, the company
said.
	   The Thai Agriculture Ministry now says RiceTec's Jasmati has no
genetic relation with Thai jasmine rice, but some officials believe
RiceTec is misusing the jasmine name, though it is not patented.
	   Robert Havener, director general of the IRRI, was quoted in The
Nation newspaper as urging the Thai government to patent the
jasmine name so no one can trade in other varieties by that name.
	   Agriculture officials were discussing the idea with exporters,
The Nation cited officials as saying.
	   IRRI officials are currently in Thailand to develop new ways of
cultivating and marketing rice.

Auction of failed finance company assets called success 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The auction of car loans held by
insolvent finance companies shut down by the Thai government has
fetched 25 billion baht (about dlrs 600 million), about half their
original value.
	   Officials of the Financial Restructuring Authority, charged with
disposing the assets of the 56 failed finance companies, said
Thursday the auction was a success and a model of transparency that
would raise foreign investor confidence in Thailand.
	   The proceeds were higher than expected, said Vicharat
Vichit-Vadhakan, the authority's secretary general, and will be
divided evenly among creditors.
	   Vicharat said that liquidity would be loosened as a result of
disposing the assets of the finance companies, which were shut down
last year as Thailand became the first of Asia's tiger economies to
fall into crisis.
	   The winners of the auction included GE Capital (Thailand) Ltd.,
V. Conglomerate Co., Pranakorn Automobile Ltd., Siam Panich Leasing
PCL, and Radhanatun Finance Co.
	   GE Capital is a subsidiary of the U.S.-based General Electric
Co. Siam Panich Leasing is majority owned by Siam Commercial Bank
PCL, the country's fourth-biggest commercial bank.
	   Other assets held by the finance companies include corporate and
commercial real-estate loans, loans for investors to buy stocks and
residential mortgages.

Philippine peso falls sharply on weak yen; stocks end mixed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell sharply
against the dollar Friday, bogged down by a further weakening of
the Japanese yen, dealers said.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, ended trading mixed as the regional currency
jitters continued to undermine investor confidence.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 14.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,723.37, following
Thursday's 3.85-point fall.
	   Decliners, however, outnumbered advancers 51 to 44, while 48
issues were unchanged, as desires by investors to unload their
holdings because of Asia's currency problems outweighed buying
interest, traders said.
	   The yen's continued fall against the dollar has triggered a new
wave of weakness in other Asian currencies.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities
Inc., said buying activity was a mixture of bargain-hunting and
window-dressing as the month of June nears its end.
	   He said the market is expected to trade within a tight range as
long as volatility in Asian currency markets persists.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 42.092 pesos in morning
trading, compared to Thursday's 41.503 pesos.
	   Dealers said the peso's weakness has more to do with regional
currency woes than heavy demand for the U.S. currency.

Regional crisis blamed for decline in foreign tourists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The number of foreign tourists visiting
Vietnam fell 15 percent in the first six months of 1998, compared
with the same period last year, a Vietnam Tourism Administration
official said Friday.
	   The official blamed the regional financial crisis, saying
tourists turned to other countries with weaker currencies that made
their own money go further.
	   ``The number of tourists coming from the crisis-hit countries in
the region fell, too,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified.
	   The official said 800,000 tourists arrived in the first half of
the year, with the number coming by air and sea dropping and those
arriving by rain or road rising.
	   In 1997, Vietnam had 1.7 million foreigners arrive, 60 percent
of which are estimated to be tourists. It had forecast 1.8 million
arrivals this year.
	   The decline in foreign tourists has left many hotels with
painfully low occupancy rates.

Government OKs export tax for high-quality rice 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The government has approved a Finance
Ministry proposal to impose a 1 percent export tax on high-quality
rice, effective July 1, an official at the Tax General Department
said Friday.
	   ``The government wants to use the tax as an instrument to
control rice exports,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified.
	   In February, the government cut the tax to zero to boost exports
and said it would adjust the rate depending on whether world prices
rise or there is a need to curb sales.
	   ``The world market price is high now and local exports can make
higher profits,'' the official said.
	   The tax would affect rice with a broken rate of 25 percent or
less.
	   The Youth newspaper reported that Vietnam can sell rice with a
broken rate of 5 percent or less at dlrs 310 per ton, 10 percent or
less at dlrs 300 per ton and 25 percent or less at dlrs 280 per
ton.
	   It said about 65.6 billion dong (dlrs 5 million) in taxes will
be collected if enterprises export all the rice for which they have
contracted to provide.
	   Vietnam has exported 2.72 million tons of rice this year and
planned to ship a total of 4 million tons for all of 1998.
	   In April, the government asked exporters to slow down and stop
signing new export contracts to ensure domestic food security
during the country's worst drought in a century. Rains have since
ended the drought.

Australia names strong squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby sevens coach Mark Ella
turned to several Super 12 stars Friday in naming a 22-man squad to
prepare for the Commonwealth Games.
	   The Australians, captained by veteran winger David Campese, have
played several tournaments this season without top class players
from Australia's three Super 12 outfits.
	   National team members will be unavailable for the games, in
Kuala Lumpur in September, but Ella has called up Matt Dowling,
Shane Drahm, Jason Jones-Hughes, Damian Smith and Scott Staniforth.
	   The squad will be cut to 10 for the games in Kuala Lumpur in
September.
	   ``The core of the final team will be based on the current crop
of sevens players that have competed in the eight sevens
tournaments so far,'' Ella said.
	   ``Whilst it's important to show loyalty to the guys who have
performed admirably this season, I believe it's necessary to add
players who've featured prominently in Super 12.''
	   Former Australian sevens representatives Daniel Manu, Smith and
Jim Williams have been recalled after long absences from the
abbreviated game.
	   Australia has drawn unofficial world champion Fiji in its pool
for the games, along with Sri Lanka and Gambia. There will be five
pools with the winner of each plus three others advancing to the
quarterfinals.

Police general offers to take sole responsibility for killings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The police general who supervised the
arrests of six alleged drug dealers who were gunned down in custody
has offered to take sole responsiblity for the killings.
	   Salang Bunnag, who is deputy director general of the national
police, was cited by newspapers Friday as saying 17 officers who
are targeted for prosecution in the case were simply doing their
duty.
	   A powerful figure who is widely seen as legally untouchable,
Salang has not been named in the internal police investigation,
though he was in overall command.
	   ``I stood 300 meters (yards) from the shooting,'' Salang was
quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post. ``But I am willing to take
all the blame alone if the 17 will be spared from punishment.''
	   Salang has accused Interior Minister Sanan Krasornprachart of
holding a grudge against him and that the prosecutions would
demoralize the police in their fight against drugs.
	   The November 1996 shootings, criticized by international
human-rights groups, capped a two-day standoff with heavily armed
suspected amphetamines traffickers who had shot a policeman.
	   The suspects eventually surrendered, were handcuffed and brought
outside the house where they had been holed up. They were then led
back in and shot.
	   The bodies were later removed, with bloodstains on the white
shrouds showing they had been shot in the head. Thai television
recorded everything except the shootings themselves.
	   Salang responded to criticism that he had given a shoot-to-kill
order by saying, ``Their cases have been closed.''
	   Salang claimed that the handcuffs had been removed so the
suspects could point out hidden weapons but that they instead
reached for guns and tried to escape.

Dollar soars in Tokyo, stocks higher on reported bank merger currency and bond prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS reports of bank merger, closing stock, mid-afternoon
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar soared against the yen Friday as
Japanese investors bought the U.S. currency in the absence of any
signs of intervention. Tokyo stock prices rose on reports of a bank
merger.
	   The dollar bought 141.94 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.02
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of
142.30 yen overnight.
	   The dollar rose as high as 143.00 yen before news services
reported that ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. will merge
with stronger Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
	   The reports sparked late rallies by the yen and Japanese stocks.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rebounded from earlier losses
to end the day up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent, at 15,210.04. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   Traders said the reports stoked optimism that Japan's powerful
bureaucrats may allow market forces to weed out the country's
weaker banks _ leading the overall financial system back to health.
	   But the yen's rebound was limited by overarching concerns about
the health of Japan's economy.
	   Poor returns at home prompted Japanese institutional investors
to buy dollars during the day to seek better returns for their
funds in booming U.S. financial markets.
	   With no sign that U.S. and Japanese central banks will repeat
the dramatic intervention last week that boosted the yen, traders
said the economic fundamentals of a weak Japanese economy and
robust United States mean demand for dollars will continue.
	   ``Demand and supply is pointing overwhelmingly to
dollar-buying,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar has now recouped nearly all its losses since June 17,
the day Japanese and U.S. financial authorities bought yen to halt
the Japanese currency's slide to eight-year lows.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of both the
Long-Term Credit Bank and Sumitomo Trust after the merger reports.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,190.82. The TOPIX
closed up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before.
	   Japan's state-run NHK television said LTCB and Sumitomo Trust
had reached a basic agreement to merge as early as next April.
	   An LTCB spokesman declined to comment on the report. Sumitomo
Trust officials weren't immediately available to comment.
	   LTCB shares rose sharply on the reports, rising 15 yen, or 26
percent, to 73 yen before trading was suspended. Sumitomo Trust
shares fell 20 yen, or 3 percent, to 648.
	   LTCB says it has 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem
loans, enough to lead traders and investors to question if the bank
could recover on its own.
	   On Thursday, LTCB executives spelled out a drastic restructuring
plan and hinted at a possible merger at the bank's annual
shareholders' meeting.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.235 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.220 percent,
driving its price down to 111.70 yen from 111.81 yen.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen says he will not campaign for elections 
</HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG SPEU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said
Friday he will not take part in a month-long campaign for elections
he is highly favored to win, preferring to stay on the sidelines as
his challengers vie for votes.
	   Hun Sen, whom opponents accuses of stacking the July 26 polls in
his favor through violence and packing electoral bodies with his
supporters, told reporters that he does not see any rivals as a
real threat to his chances.
	   The chief opponents are Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen
ousted as his co-prime minister in a bloody power grab last year,
and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister.
	   Hun Sen said that actively participating in the race, which
officially opened Thursday, could create unwanted tensions among
his challengers and perhaps lessen his position of strength.
	   ``I don't look down on my competitors,'' Hun Sen remarked.
```But they are not fit enough to draw me into a face-to-face
confrontation.''
	   The elections will be Cambodia's first since 1993, when U.N.
peacekeeping troops were part of a dlrs 2 billion effort to usher
in a new era of peace and democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide
of the late 1970s, followed by a decade of Vietnamese occupation.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party won in 1993, but agreed
under threats of renewed civil war to share power with Hun Sen's
formerly communist Cambodian People's Party.
	   The tense coalition shattered in battles between their armed
supporters last year. As many as 90 of Hun Sen's political
opponents, apart from soldiers on the battlefield, have since been
killed. No one has ever been arrested.
	   Hun Sen hopes the elections will win back international
legitimacy and aid, but critics say the process is little more than
a cynical farce.
	   Hun Sen _ who controls the media and the security forces _ said
Friday he prefers to act as a referee during the campaign to ensure
others can do so safely.
	   ``If I campaign, it would look no different than a football
player who also blows the whistle and it would not look good even
if I win,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen's withdrawal from the spotlight suggests he is both
confident of the outcome and wary of upsetting what has so far been
a green-light given by the international community for the polls
despite acknowledged abuses.

Reports: Sumitomo Trust to merge with troubled Long-Term Credit Bank hold press conference at 1200 GMT, impact on yen; ADDS background. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with size of new bank in graf 2, Sumitomo president to
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. is planning a
merger with Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been
foundering under huge problem loans, Japanese media reported
Friday.
	   The combined bank would be the second biggest in Japan after
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., reported one of Japan's largest
newspapers, the Asahi.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   News reports said the merger would take place in April next
year, and a recently proposed government-run ``bridge bank'' would
take over much of LTCB's bad debt.
	   That would make the deal a crucial first test of a government
campaign to clean up Japanese banks' 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) in bad debt. The bad loans have been blamed as a major
cause for Japan's deepest recession in 50 years.
	   An LTCB spokesman said an official decision had not yet been
made, but refused to comment further.
	   Hiroshi Nakato, a spokesman for Sumitomo Trust, refused to
confirm or deny the reports. Sumitomo Trust President Atsushi
Takahashi was to hold a news conference at 9 p.m. Japan time (1200
GMT).
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports appeared Friday
afternoon.
	   The reports sparked late rallies on Tokyo financial markets. The
yen _ weakened recently by concerns over Japan's economic doldrums
_ rose to 141.94 yen to the dollar from an intraday low of 143.00
yen.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank. Japan's
trust banks specialize in managing funds for large institutional
investors.
	   LTCB officials had repeatedly denied rumors that the bank was on
the verge of failure, but recently acknowledged it holds 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution was foundering.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners.
	   Japan's government is pushing banks to write off the bad loans
they amassed on the late 1980s and is scrambling to set up the
emergency bridge bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies
left out in the cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them
more money.
	   But investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered the bank's credit rating and sent its
share prices plunging.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of Chinese dissidents on the eve of
his arrival in China is awkward at best for President Bill Clinton,
who has pledged to push Beijing for greater freedoms, face-to-face.
	   For Chinese authorities, such measures are routine. They
underscore China's resistance to Clinton's human rights agenda, as
well as Beijing's determination to ensure that no protests mar the
president's nine-day tour.
	   Three dissidents were arrested Wednesday and Thursday in and
near the city of Xi'an, Clinton's first stop, human rights groups
said. As of Friday, their whereabouts remained unknown.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing,''
and instructed U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to raise the issue with
Chinese authorities.
	   Three Xi'an dissidents went to the city police bureau at around
midnight Thursday to hand over a letter protesting the arrests and
surveillance of other democracy activists, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police refused to let them through the door, so they left the
letter at reception instead, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Human rights groups report arrests in China and other forms of
harassment nearly every day, often in statements faxed to foreign
reporters. Local officials and police rarely comment.
	   Lu Siqing, who runs the Hong Kong-based monitoring group, said
police were following regulations, many of them internal,
accumulated over dozens of years of authoritarian rule that tell
them how to act when important people visit or at politically
sensitive times.
	   ``Police are just acting according to their regulations. They
have no concepts of human rights. They think ``I must act according
to the rules,'''' Lu said. ``It's their habit.''
	   Officials claim there are no dissidents in China. They allege,
as Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said earlier this week in a news
conference, that most people described as dissidents have
``violated China's criminal law.''
	   Authoritative statistics are lacking on the number of dissidents
or political prisoners imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or forced
into exile, where many continue to work for political change back
home.
	   A 1996 report by Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, recorded about 2,000 people either jailed or subject
to occasional detentions for political or religious activities.
Human Rights Watch, in a 1994 book, documented 1,700 Chinese
imprisoned for political, ethnic or religious beliefs.
	   Many political activists who remain in China complain of
harassment by police and state security agents, of having trouble
running businesses or holding steady jobs.
	   Despite the constant risk of arrest and other trouble, many
still dare to publicize their beliefs.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed various appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news
agencies _ urging him to speak out on behalf of freedom and the
release of political prisoners and to make time to meet with
dissidents during his stay.
	   Tang and other Chinese officials said Clinton had no such plans.
	   Lin Xinshu, a veteran dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province who often gets involved in public appeals for greater
freedom, said dozens of police were standing vigil outside his
door.
	   ``I called their chief and told him not to put so many out
there. One or two would do,'' Lin said. ``After all, I'm old and
not very healthy, how could I cause any trouble?''

EU ups cereal land set-aside; Approves banana, olive oil, tobacco reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Concerned about rising cereal stocks, European
Union agriculture ministers on Friday agreed to force farmers to
take 10 percent of their land out of production in 1999, double the
1998 rate.
	   The decision came despite pressure from France, the EU's largest
producer, which wanted a lower set-aside rate than 10 percent, and
was part of a deal that included a 1999 farm price package and
reforms of the EU banana, olive oil and tobacco markets.
	   The ministers kept virtually all farm subsidies unchanged ahead
of negotiations over proposals for deep cuts in cereal, beef and
dairy support prices in the 2000-2003 period.
	   The 1998 EU farm budget is 40.4 billion euros (dlrs 44.4
billion), nearly half the total EU budget.
	   The ministers approved new banana import rules, but some
officials said these may be rejected by the United States and other
trade partners. The World Trade Organization has ruled the EU
banana import system illegal and ordered it changed by Jan. 1,
1999.
	   The set-aside rate for grains is the amount of land farmers must
take out of production. The 10 percent rate was recommended by the
EU executive commission. which saw Western Europe stocks of surplus
grain growing out of control.
	   That ``grain mountain'' now weighs 15 million metric tons, up
from 2.4 million tons a year ago. The commission predicted it could
go by mid-2000 to 30 million tons.
	   In other decisions, the agriculture ministers:
	   _ retained two preferential import quotas for bananas: one for
annual duty free imports of 857,700 metric tons from 12 countries,
the other for the annual import of 2.5 million tons at a reduced
duty of 75 European Currency Units (dlrs 82,50) a ton.
	   The reduced-duty imports tend to come from Latin America. The EU
raised by 8 percent aid to producers in compensation for the end of
the license system. The EU has four banana producers: France,
Spain, Portugal and Greece.
	   _ increased by 32 percent, to 1.78 million metric tons a year,
its quota on subsidized olive oil production and divide that among
the EU's five olive oil producing countries: Spain, Italy, Greece,
Portugal and France. Until now that quota was not split among
countries.
	   _ changed subsidies for tobacco growers by increasing payments
for higher-quality tobacco and reducing them for lower-quality
tobacco. The 15-member EU has eight tobacco-producing countries _
Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium and
Austria.

Dramatic advances against AIDS leaving millions behind 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Dramatic advances against AIDS are leaving behind
almost all of the 30.6 million people infected with the deadly
virus because they can't afford expensive therapies and live in
parts of the world that have no access to them.
	   ``Only those five percent living in Western Europe and North
America reap the full benefits,'' said Dr. Bernard Hirschel, head
of the HIV-AIDS section of Geneva's Cantonal University Hospital.
	   Hirschel is chairman of a massive undertaking which next week
brings together 12,000 of the world's top experts and other
fighters in the global campaign against AIDS.
	   The World AIDS Conference, convened for the first time in 2 1-2
years, has set itself a challenge: find low-cost ways to stop the
spread of AIDS and help the people afflicted with it in Africa,
Asia and Latin America.
	   A U.N. report this week said that in some parts of Africa, one
adult in four is infected with HIV.
	   Hirschel and other experts say there is hope because many steps
can be taken without the use of expensive technology, even through
further preaching of the need to practice safe sex.
	   The conference, which begins Sunday and lasts until Friday, will
be looking at the latest ideas. The meeting will cover all aspects
of HIV and AIDS and will review 5,000 of 7,000 submitted reports on
research around the world.
	   Organizers refuse to go into detail until each paper is
released, but the reports can be expected to cover the full range
of work under way _ from studying cells in laboratories to working
with prostitutes on the roadside.
	   Combinations of drugs have helped slow the progress of the
disease in Europe and North America. What new combinations are in
the pipeline? What can be done to reduce cost?
	   Robin Gorna, executive director of the Australian Federation of
AIDS organizations and a conference organizer, said another problem
with current treatment is that it is complicated.
	   ``We need simpler treatment, ever more effective, easier to take
with few side effects,'' Ms. Gorna said.
	   Several major drug companies are planning to announce at the
conference that they will cut their prices on AIDS drugs by 75
percent to developing countries, a U.N. official announced in New
York this week.
	   Still, most of the latest drugs will remain out-of-reach for
many people with HIV, experts said, adding that researchers are
looking at whether lower-cost products, such as vitamins, offer any
hope.
	   The latest reports are expected on the development of vaccines,
with scientists turning toward human testing.
	   Has more been learned about why some prostitutes in Africa have
shown immunity to the disease? What does that means for finding
ways to help others? Are there any developments in male or female
condoms that can help women protect themselves?
	   Another major area of research is preventing transmission of
AIDS from mothers to babies, not only during birth but also through
breast milk.
	   UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program on HIV/AIDS, noted in a
report this week that HIV-infected women in industrialized
countries largely stopped breastfeeding when research showed the
virus can be transmitted in breast milk.
	   The question is how this can be applied to the developing world,
where many mothers may not know if they are HIV positive since
testing is unavailable.

IMF releases loan installment to Russia 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday an IMF decision to release
a delayed installment of a dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote
of confidence in Russia's struggling economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's liaison
with international lenders, called Thursday's decision to release
the dlrs 670 million installment ``quite natural and logical.''
	   ``It is important in principle that IMF board members ... regard
the ailments of the Russian economy as quite curable,'' Chubais
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The fund decided last week to hold up the installment, saying
Russia had to do more to balance the federal budget and reform key
areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax collection
system.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan to the
IMF earlier this week that officials said appeared to meet many of
the fund's criteria.
	   The new installment means Russia has so far received dlrs 5.8
billion of the existing dlrs 9.2 billion loan.
	   The fund was to begin deliberations Friday on whether to lend
Russia even more money. Russia is seeking an additional dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion loan to help shore up Central Bank
reserves and foster economic recovery.
	   The country's stock market has lost about half its value since
the beginning of the year, with investors worried about falling oil
prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the Asian
financial crisis.
	   The Kremlin says the new lending is needed to replenish Central
Bank reserves to prevent any devaluation of the Russian ruble.
Analysts say a rise in consumer prices could trigger social unrest.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has postponed a planned visit to the
Soviet republic of Kazakstan originally scheduled for next week,
saying he needs to work on solving the economic crisis.

Expert group favors a national security council in India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A group of experts recommended Friday
that India establish a National Security Council where politicians
would work with military leaders to plan India's defense.
	   The group, headed by former Defense Minister K.C. Pant, handed
its report to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The panel was
set up three weeks after the Vajpayee government assumed office in
March.
	   Apart from the defense minister, the chiefs of army, air force
and the navy are also expected to be members of the proposed
council. Other details were not immediately available.
	   A proposal first surfaced in the late 1980s to create an Indian
body similar to the U.S. National Security Council, where
politicians, bureaucrats and military leaders could sit together to
make defense policy.
	   Military leaders see a council as a way to have more input on
spending in order to defend India against its main potential
enemies, China and Pakistan.

Unlikely poetry in the BBC's Shipping Forecast With FEA-Radio Excerpts 
</HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Plymouth, Biscay, Finisterre, northwesterly
backing southwesterly four or five ...''
	   Like a hypnotic incantation, the words roll out onto the BBC
radio waves day and night in a mysterious code of weather warnings
for all the ships at sea.
	   ``Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, occasional gale force nine
and rising,'' recites the modulated BBC voice, impersonal and oddly
comforting in the face of a storm.
	   To the crews of trawlers, tankers and ocean liners sailing the
treacherous northern seas, this meteorological mantra provides
perfectly intelligible forecasts of winds, visibility and building
storms in specific, named areas of ocean surrounding the British
Isles.
	   ``Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, westerly six to gale eight ...''
	   Thousands more radio listeners have no idea what the words
signify, and many don't particularly care.
	   At six minutes to six in the evening, they've just returned from
walking the dog or they're peeling potatoes in a brightly lit
kitchen in a corner of London or Leeds or Leighton Buzzard. News
analysis gives way to the three-minute Shipping Forecast, pushing
aside the prosaic thoughts of the day.
	   ``Shannon, Rockall, Hebrides; Plymouth, Lundy, Irish Sea. Rain
at times, moderate to good ...''
	   For some devotees, the shipping forecast is a poetic chant,
meaningless, melodic and soothing _ a welcome respite to be found
four times a day just by turning a radio dial.
	   For those of a romantic nature, the words conjure up boatloads
of Vikings squinting into the wind, their beards thick with ice, or
a little Hebrides fishing boat bobbing in the dark on the endless,
inky sea, its half-dozen crewmen huddled over a radio to hear what
dangers the night might hold.
	   Suddenly, the kitchen seems a warmer, safer place.
	   The shipping forecast is a reminder that even in the jet age,
Britain is an island nation, that villages along its thousands of
miles (kilometers) of coast still take their living from the sea
and still pay a price for it in the lives of their men and boys.
	   The forecasts were telegraphed when they were introduced in 1861
by the first head of Britain's Meteorological Service, Robert
FitzRoy, who had been captain of the H.M.S. Beagle on Charles
Darwin's historic voyage to South America.
	   Since they first were broadcast in 1924, several areas have been
divided, others renamed and some added. North Utsire and South
Utsire _ pronounced utt-SEE-ra _ off Norway, joined the list most
recently in 1984 when the North Sea oil industry required wider
forecasts.
	   The Meteorological Office still writes the scripts for the BBC
to broadcast and fields questions from the public.
	   ``We get a lot of inquiries from people who never actually sail,
but they are fascinated by the shipping forecast,'' says Nathan
Powell of the ``Met'' office. ``They love listening to it. They
enjoy the language involved.''
	   ``They want to know what the names actually mean,'' he says.
``Most of the areas are named after sandbanks or major geographical
features. German Bight is one of the favorites.''
	   BBC Radio 4, which transmits the forecast, is well aware that it
is guardian of a beloved British institution.
	   ``It's a very popular, cherished bit of the Radio 4 day for
people who have no practical use for it,'' spokeswoman Marion
Greenwood says.
	   ``It's even inspired sculpture _ a piece of rock with the names
of all the sea areas carved in different typefaces, and somebody's
been and taken photographs of all the bits of sea,'' she says.
``It's extraordinary.''
	   The loyalty of the landlubber comes to the fore every time the
BBC tries to change the forecast schedule.
	   All four broadcasts go out on Long Wave _ an AM frequency _
because that's what the ships get.
	   Until a recent programming shakeup, they also all went out on
FM, but now only the early morning and late-night segments hit
those airwaves. Aficionados protested to no avail. If they want to
hear the shipping forecast while they make their supper, they have
to push the LW button.
	   But woe really betide the programmer who ever decides to remove
the late-night forecast _ a full 11 minutes at 12:48 a.m.,
following ``The Late Book.''
	   After a nightly bedtime story, the oceangoing litany is a
favorite lullaby of the nation's insomniacs.

Low oil prices, surging candidacy of former coup leader wreak havoc on economy 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan business was booming just a
few months ago, but a sharp drop in oil prices and the surging
candidacy of a populist former coup leader have endangered growth
prospects and unmasked the fragility of an economy plagued by
decades of mismanagement.
	   The price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last
week of dlrs 8.43, wreaking havoc on the national budget and the
confidence of investors already nervous over the possibility that
former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who tried to overthrow the government
six years ago, will become president.
	   The Caracas stock exchange is down 40 percent since Jan. 1, the
biggest plunge in Latin America, and consumer prices have risen 40
percent in the past year, the region's highest inflation rate.
Officials estimate lower oil prices will cost the economy dlrs 5
billion this year.
	   ``The economy is either looking at a recession or a very weak
growth scenario,'' said Carl Ross, chief Latin American economist
at BT Alex Brown Inc. ``The short-term outlook depends on oil
prices, and that's not a lot to hang your hat on these days.''
	   OPEC nations agreed Wednesday to new output cuts in an attempt
to boost prices, but similar cuts in recent months failed to
reverse a worldwide glut, which has hurt oil-producing countries
everywhere from Saudi Arabia to Mexico.
	   Venezuela came surging back from a recession last year, when the
economy grew by 5 percent. British Petroleum, Texaco and Mobil took
advantage of the government's much-touted opening of the oil
sector, and poured in hundreds of millions of dollars. Economists
had predicted 4 percent growth for 1998.
	   Then came the plunge in oil prices and the Asian financial
crisis. Venezuela will now be lucky if it grows 1 percent.
	   Oil accounts for more than three-quarters of Venezuela's export
income, and about 60 percent of all government revenue. Officials
have slashed this year's budget by dlrs 1.6 billion and asked
Venezuelans, whose standard of living has fallen dramatically in
recent years, to tighten their belts even further.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's entreaty at a recent regional
summit in Chile for ``a second generation of reform'' to distribute
Latin America's wealth more equitably seems a long way off in
Venezuela. Social spending is taking a back seat to crisis
management, and some officials can hardly hide their frustration.
	   ``We don't need Clinton to tell us to invest in our people,''
Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff told The Associated Press. ``Does
he think he came up with Einstein's Theory of Relativity?''
	   Venezuela's efforts to get its economic house in order through
austerity has led to a public backlash.
	   Chavez is leading the polls for December's presidential
elections. Although he has toned town his populist rhetoric, most
investors think he would turn back the clock on free-market reform,
and many are already packing.
	   ``If he surprises us and becomes a success story, there will be
plenty of time to jump back on the bandwagon,'' said Rafael de la
Fuente, an economist at the French bank Paribas. ``But I don't want
to be there if he confirms all our worst fears.''
	   To raise cash and investor confidence, officials have announced
two bond issues worth dlrs 1 billion and a dlrs 500 million loan
from the InterAmerican Development Bank. They also plan to
privatize the aluminum and electricity sectors.
	   The government has sought to fend off a devaluation at all
costs, keeping both interest rates and the bolivar currency
artificially high _ and putting the breaks on the economy.
	   Many people are asking themselves how the country with the most
proven oil reserves outside the Middle East has become so poor. One
reason is that oil income has allowed the country to ``muddle
through'' without fundamental reform, said Ricardo Penfold, vice
president of research at the Santander Investment Bank.
	   True, the country has welcomed foreign investment, eliminated
trade barriers and privatized some state industries. Yet Venezuela
has one of the most bloated bureaucracies on the continent. Its
schools, roads and hospitals are decaying, tax collection is sorely
deficient, corruption is endemic, and prosperity depends almost
exclusively on volatile oil prices.
	   ``All the money is stolen,'' said 48-year-old Caracas resident
Omar Requena. ``What do they do with all that oil?''
	   Requena said he'll vote for Chavez.

	   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) _ Roughly 400 people waving New
Brunswick flags greeted Princess Anne as she arrived for a four-day
visit to the province.
	   Anne received a 21-gun salute at the legislature under sunny
skies Thursday.
	   The princess, on her second visit to New Brunswick, said the
province is known worldwide for its hospitality and its efforts to
become a center of high technology.
	   The main purpose of Anne's visit is to mark the 150th
anniversary of the 8th Canadian Hussars Armored Regiment.
	   Shortly after arriving, Anne visited RCMP headquarters in
Fredericton to present deputy commissioner Terry Ryan with an
accreditation certificate and plaque marking a new RCMP tartan
honoring the 125th anniversary of the force.
	   The tartan will be used in three new kilted orders of dress,
including a formal dress with RCMP red serge.
	   Anne also received an RCMP 125th anniversary commemorative coin
from the Royal Canadian Mint.

In Chinese village, Clinton touts democracy's potential, while lamenting crackdown on dissidents AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new material
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ In a dusty village square, President Bill
Clinton celebrated local elections as ``a window for all the world
to see'' _the progress democracy can bring to China _ after voicing
his distress Friday at dissident arrests he called a backward look
by Beijing.
	   His message of democracy in a humble setting, a brick-walled
dirt plaza, brushed and bannered for the occasion, with
schoolchildren in blue and white waving bouquets and singing songs,
was in stark contrast to the reports of arrests among Chinese
dissidents.
	   And in contrast, too, to his coming state welcome in the vast,
haunted splendor of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where Chinese
troops bloodily repressed democracy demonstrators nine years ago.
	   President Jiang Zemin greets him there Saturday morning, by the
Great Hall of the People. The Tiananmen setting stirred protests in
Congress in advance; the House adopted a resolution saying Clinton
shouldn't go there.
	   He defended it as protocol, and said he was more concerned about
the substance of his promised effort to promote human rights in
China. But his nine-day visit was marred on that score as it began,
by the denial of visas to three reporters for a U.S. government
Asia broadcasting operation, and by reports that dissidents were
being detained.
	   There was no reliable account of the number, but a handful was
enough to make trouble for Clinton. A White House official said
Ambassador James Sasser had expressed U.S. concern to senior
Chinese officials.
	   The White House official, who spoke on condition that he not be
named, said the U.S. view is that the arrests did not represent a
wholesale crackdown or an effort to embarrass Clinton, but a
situation in which Beijing instructed local governments to avoid
incidents during the president's visit and they responded by
picking up known dissidents.
	   ``I found the reports disturbing,'' Clinton said in Xiahe.
``And, if true, they represent not China at its best and not China
looking forward, but looking backward.''
	   He said one reason he came was to discuss issues of personal
freedom, and dissident arrests emphasize the need for his message.
``... It makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and to engage them,'' he said.
	   At Xiahe, addressing villagers in the square, Clinton praised
the efforts and progress he said have brought the standard of
living in Xiahe and in much of China to the highest point in
history, linking that to fledgling democracy in local elections.
	   ``Whenever there is an election and the people decide, everyone
wins,'' he said.
	   ``Your achievements are a window for all the world to see what
local democracy has brought to China and what a brighter future you
are building,'' he said.
	   The elections are contested, but not on the American model. They
are dominated by communist candidates, although not all running
with the party label. They choose mayors, village committees and
other local officials.

Report: Israel bars hard-line PLO official from Gaza 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel will not allow Farouk Kaddoumi, a top
PLO official and opponent of the Mideast peace agreements, to visit
the autonomous Palestinian areas, Israel radio said Friday.
	   No official confirmation was immediately available.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison office with the
Palestinians, said Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1996, when the Palestine National
Council met in the Gaza Strip.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, boycotted the PNC session.
	   Earlier this week, the Palestinian Authority asked Israel to
approve a visit by Kaddoumi.

More than 20 arrests made for Mafia association in Sicily 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ In a major blow to the Sicilian Mafia,
police arrested more than 20 alleged mobsters Friday, including the
sister of a top boss.
	   Authorities suspect the arrested belong to the Corleone clan,
apparently still headed by boss Vito ``Old Rag'' Vitale, who was
arrested in April.
	   Vitale is believed to have taken over the clan's leadership from
Salvatore ``Toto'' Riina, who was reputed to be the ``boss of
bosses'' when he was captured in 1993 after more than 20 years as a
fugitive.
	   Most of the arrests Friday were made in Partinico, a small town
outside Palermo known as Vitale's home town. His sister, Giusi
Vitale, 26, was among those arrested for Mafia association, drug
and arm trafficking, murder and theft.
	   Vitale's brother, Leonardo Vitale, who is already serving a life
term, was notified of the extra charges in jail.
	   Vitale is considered one of the most ``cold-blooded'' bosses in
the Palermo area.
	   Several other mobsters already in prison were also charged.
Police said at least two of them had ordered murders from inside
their cells using a cellular phone.

South Korean captives return home from Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean men returned home
Friday, three weeks after they were held captive and taken to
Russia's Far East by a runaway ship, police said.
	   Han Hae-dong, 60, and Park Dong-yol, 59, were on board the
Russian refrigerator ship Tibiya early this month when it sailed
away from court-ordered custody in Pusan port on South Korea's
southeast coast.
	   A Pusan court hired them to enforce its order to impound the
683-ton vessel embroiled in a lawsuit with a South Korean dry dock
company.
	   The Tibiya sailed back to the Russian Far East port of Magadan
last week and released the two Koreans to Russian authorities.
	   Police barred the ship's Russian owner, Chavshov Alexay, from
leaving South Korea until he paid dlrs 1.5 million he owed to the
South Korean company.
	   Alexay's ship was impounded for auction when it docked in Pusan
in April.
	   Alexay, 36, came to Pusan to negotiate the debt repayment, but
when talks broke down, he ordered his ship to flee, police said. He
was arrested while trying to leave South Korea shortly after his
ship was found missing.

Amnesty International accuses Japanese prisons of abuse 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese prison guards beat inmates, shackle them
in leather constraints and throw them into solitary confinement for
minor rule violations, Amnesty International human rights group
said Friday.
	   In a broad condemnation of Japan's strict penal system, the
London-based group urged the government to amend and publicize
secret prison rules and sign the U.N. Convention against Torture.
	   ``By failing to reform the tight disciplinary regime in its
prisons, the Japanese government remains in breach of international
human rights standards,'' Mark Allison of Amnesty's East Asia Team
said in a statement.
	   Japanese prisons are tightly run. Prisoners cannot talk or look
aside while working or eating, exercise is forbidden in cells and
tobacco is banned. Inmates are subject to several strip searches a
day.
	   A Justice Ministry spokesman said he could not comment on the
accusations before he had seen Amnesty's report, but officials have
denied similar allegations in the past.
	   The government says strict rules are needed to keep violent
criminals in line, but critics say the network of trivial rules
humiliates prisoners and is used to grind them into submission.
	   ``The enforcement of such a tight web of secret rules
constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment,'' Allison said.
	   Amnesty's report said some prisoners have been killed by the
rough treatment. The group cited the case of a man who died after
suffering heat stroke while being held in a body-belt and handcuffs
for several hours in a poorly ventilated isolation cell.
	   The report also detailed the cases of inmates who are suing the
government over allegations of abuse _ such as stomping on a
prisoner's back and tightening a leather constraint until he could
not breathe.
	   The human rights group described cases of psychological abuse.
Inmates say they are held in solitary confinement for up to two
months at a time, forced to kneel in the same position all day and
stare at the wall.
	   ``It's inhuman and should be stopped,'' Allison said.
	   The report urged the government to give independent monitoring
groups unfettered access to prisons and ban the use of isolated
``protection cells'' to punish inmates.
	   This is not the first time Japan's penal system has faced
allegations of abuse.
	   In November, Amnesty International reported that foreigners
detained in Japan are subject to violence, racism and sexual
assault by police and prison guards.
	   The group said the government has tried to ignore or cover-up
abuse of detained foreigners and urged the government to begin an
independent review.

Aggrieved Chinese Muslim community hopes for Clinton visit GMT With Clinton-China, Clinton-Villagers, China-Church, China-Dissidents 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be UPDATED after Clinton's departure from Xi'an at 1030
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ In what was once one of the world's grandest
cities, amid ramshackle houses with sloping eaves surrounding a
stately mosque, lies the unburied body of a Muslim merchant beaten
to death by Chinese officials.
	   Over 19 months, the body has become a symbol of his family's
grief and of a community's struggle for justice in the narrow
alleys of Xi'an's Beiyuanmen quarter, home to one of China's oldest
Muslim communities.
	   Upon arrival in Xi'an on Thursday night, President Bill Clinton
told city officials he hoped to stop by the Muslim neighborhood
Friday. The Muslims of Beiyuanmen said a visit would show how once
persecuted ethnic minorities have benefited from more tolerant
Chinese policies, but also emphasize the government's persistent
fears about ethnic grievances and separatism.
	   ``If President Clinton comes here, it will be good not only for
us, but for all ethnic groups in China,'' said Mu Bingkun, who runs
a confection shop along Beiyuanmen's main street.
	   Clinton has said he will press for greater religious and other
freedoms during his nine-day visit to China.
	   Rumors in the neighborhood differed as to whether Clinton would
actually stop by. White House advance teams scoped the area as
recently as Thursday, locals said, but Clinton press aides refused
to confirm the visit. Chinese police in uniforms and street clothes
patrolled in greater than usual numbers Friday morning.
	   Beiyuanmen is a remnant of the Silk Road caravan route that
brought Islam to China and made Xi'an one of the world's richest
and most diverse 12 centuries ago. Its open storefronts and tourist
trinket sellers carry the air of the bazaar. At its heart lies what
locals call the Great Mosque, a series of serene courtyards where
hundreds gather daily to pray.
	   The beating death of local restaurateur Mu Bingyao shocked the
quietly prospering community in November 1996. Several protests
erupted.
	   An official with the Xi'an government's Religious Affairs Bureau
said Mu quarrelled with security guards from a city beautification
commission who wouldn't let him set up shop on the street. Locals
said Mu erected a storefront without a proper license and refused
requests by the commission to remove it.
	   The six guards and Mu fought, and Mu was beaten to death, said
the religious official, who refused to give his name. The guards
were sentenced last November, with one getting life imprisonment
and the other five 15 years in jail, he said.
	   Worried about possible government reprisals, residents refused
to speak openly about the incident. But they said Mu's family has
refused to bury his body, contrary to Islamic customs, until the
government provides answers. State media was banned from reporting
the death.
	   ``The government has prevented the truth from coming out. They
worry that this will become a human rights issue, especially
overseas,'' said one Muslim restaurant owner.
	   ``People protested several times but to no avail,'' said one
trinket salesman.
	   Relations between the government _ dominated by China's mught of contributing to the nation. We're not agitating for
independence. Muhammad tells us we should love our country,'' said
another businessman. ``This is a conflict between us and the
government, not us and the Han.''
	   Residents said the incident proved how vulnerable the community
is despite more freedoms. Community leaders are counseling
patience.
	   ``I remember as a child we couldn't read the Koran, we couldn't
go to the mosque. It was shut down,'' said a local businessman and
imam, or prayer leader, surnamed Ma, who was 12 years old when the
decade-long Cultural Revolution ended in 1976.
	   Now, Ma points out that Xi'an has 17 mosques, countless
religious study groups and print shops for the Koran.
	   ``We often discuss ethnic relations in the mosque, but we stress
harmony,'' said Ma.

Grenade damages border post in Dagestan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified attackers fired grenades at a Russian
border post Friday, destroying a field kitchen but causing no
injuries, a news agency reported.
	   The attack on the Derbent frontier guard detachment was the
second such shooting incident in the restive republic of Dagestan
this week, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the border guards
service.
	   The explosions broke windows, tore off a roof and destroyed a
field kitchen at a training center that is part of the border
guards post, the report said. An investigation was underway.
	   Dagestan has been troubled by ethnic conflict as well as
violence that has spilled over from its neighbor, the secessionist
republic of Chechnya.
	   On Sunday, unidentified gunmen fired grenades at a border
guards' helicopter base located near the town of Kaspiisk. One
serviceman was wounded in that attack.

Myanmar says drugs can be wiped out in 15 years if aid given 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar, one of the world's biggest
drug-producing countries, claimed Friday it could wipe out
narcotics within 15 years if international aid was provided.
	   Home Minister Col. Tin Hlaing, chairman of the central committee
for drug abuse control, said in ceremony marking International Day
Against Drug Abuse that Myanmar would eradicate narcotics ``with or
without external assistance.''
	   Myanmar is the source of 60 percent of the heroin reaching the
United States. The Golden Triangle _ where the borders of Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos meet _ has long produced opium and has recently
diversified to amphetamines.
	   In Thailand, authorities burned 632 kilograms (1,390 pounds) of
drugs seized in the past year, mostly heroin, opium and
amphetamines.
	   Assistance to remote areas of Thailand have largely eliminated
opium cultivation, thought the country remains a key smuggling
route for heroin.
	   Western countries, particularly the United States, have limited
similar assistance to Myanmar to protest the military regime's
suppression of dissent and its alleged profiting from the drug
trade.
	   The government denies the charges and says the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency encouraged the production of opium in the
rugged borderlands to fund anti-communist Chinese refugees after
Mao Zedong came to power in China in 1949.
	   Amphetamines exported from Myanmar have become a huge problem in
Thailand in recent years. More than 1 million amphetamine tablets
apparently bound for Thailand were seized at a checkpoint earlier
this month in northeastern Myanmar.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Almost 50 people, including many English
soccer fans, were detained after drunken overnight scuffles in
northern France that left three people injured, police said.
	   In Lens, where England plays Colombia later Friday, 16 people
were detained for being drunk and violent, police said. Their
nationalities were not released. At least three were expected to
remain in custody.
	   In nearby Lille, a major European railway junction, about 30
people were detained after fights broke out between English fans
and locals when bars closed, police said.
	   French television channel LCI said the majority of the people
detained were English fans, including some known hooligans.
	   Four people in Lille, including a taxi driver, were slightly
injured, television reports said.
	   Fearing new violence, this small northern town was adopting a
siege mentality in the runup to England's make-or-break World Cup
match: bars and shops were closing, and schoolchildren were staying
home.
	   English fans were arriving in droves _ with or without tickets _
to cheer their team on at Friday's match which England must win to
advance in the tournament.
	   Lens, a town of about 30,000 people, was the scene of rioting by
German fans last Sunday. A French policeman hit over the head by an
iron bar was left in a coma.
	   Residents fear more of the same, or even worse: reports say some
German hooligans may travel north to confront the English.
	   At the Carnot primary school, teacher Evelyne Tumerelle said
only three of her pupils would come to school on Friday, instead of
the usual number of 20.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' Tumerelle said.
Lens authorities said each school would decide whether to advise
parents to keep their children at home.
	   At a cafe on the central Boulevard Basly, owner Edith Fourneau
said many of her clients would not venture out until the fans were
out of town. She too plans to close for the weekend.
	   ``Having the Spanish in town Wednesday night was very good, but
the fear of British hooligans just won't go away,'' she said.
	   Lens has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its
sale or possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m.
Saturday.
	   Lens mayor Andre Delelis said he regretted the ban had not been
extended to surrounding towns, especially supermarkets.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As many as 20,000
ticketless English fans were expected.
	   Authorities have stepped up security around Friday's game.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have arrested more than 250 people and deported a number of English
and German hooligans.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Thursday
that the German hooligans responsible for Sunday's mayhem were
``ultra violent neo-Nazi and neo-fascist thugs.''
	   He said they ``should be held up to public shame.''

Death toll from Russian stadium collapse rises to 23

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a stadium accident in southern
Russia rose to 23 on Friday, as one more person died from injuries
received when a concrete balcony collapsed onto a crowded stadium
floor.
	   Thirty-eight others were injured Thursday when the 160-foot-long
balcony packed with more than 100 people _ mostly children _ fell
16 feet onto the floor at the Russian National Freestyle Wrestling
Competition in the city of Nalchik.
	   The balcony was a standing-room-only area for non-paying
spectators, which meant most of those on the balcony were children
who couldn't afford tickets. It wasn't clear how many of the
victims were children.
	   A commission from the Federal Security Service was investigating
the incident, said a duty officer at the regional branch of the
Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   So far, authorities believe the collapse was caused by a fault
in the construction of the stadium, which was completed four years
ago, the officer said.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in Nalchik, about 850 miles south of Moscow in the
Kabardino-Balkariya republic. About 2,500 people were watching the
competition.
	   At least four cranes were brought to the scene to help lift
heavy debris.
	   Kabardino-Balkariya was observing a day of mourning Friday. The
government planned to pay 20,000 rubles (about dlrs 3,000) each to
the families of the dead, the republic's premier Khusein Chechenov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Myanmar opposition leader Suu Kyi unhurt in melee 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi was apparently unhurt Friday after getting caught in a
scuffle between police and supporters outside her home, sources
said.
	   Diplomats and opposition figures in exile reported that Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her opposition to
Myanmar's military regime, was believed to have fallen in the
melee.
	   The confrontation erupted Thursday when police barred 30 to 50
youth members of her National League for Democracy from entering
her home in Yangon, Myanmar's capital, for a regularly scheduled
study session.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, and her No. 2, Tin Oo, afterward spent the night
with them in the street in a ``sit-in demonstration'' in monsoon
rains until 9 a.m. Friday, when they went into her compound, the
government said in a statement. Police stood nearby.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Yangon said: ``We understand
that nobody has been allowed in or out of her compound since this
morning, and that security has been increased.''
	   Western diplomats said the scuffle broke out as Suu Kyi tried to
escort the youths past police lines into her home, and many had
heard that Suu Kyi had fallen but was unhurt.
	   An exile opposition group, the National Coalition Government of
the Union of Burma, said it was believed Suu Kyi had been pushed to
the ground and that police had used abusive language with her.
	   Neither Suu Kyi nor other leaders of her party could be
contacted. Suu Kyi has said that the government often cuts her
phone line and a call to one of her colleagues was abruptly cut off
after several seconds.
	   The incident would be the first time since 1996 that Suu Kyi has
been placed in physical danger, though the government has severely
curtailed her activities.
	   In November 1996, a pro-government mob attacked Suu Kyi's
motorcade with sticks and crowbars. Some afterward said they had
been paid by the government to attack the car.
	   The statement from the exile group, as well as secondhand
accounts from witnesses, said the youths trying to enter Suu Kyi's
home Thursday were attacked by people in civilian clothing.
	   The government has tolerated study sessions by NLD youths at Suu
Kyi's home for months, though she cannot meet such large gatherings
of people outside her compound.
	   The party, in an unusually confrontational statement, demanded
Tuesday that the regime convene by Aug. 21 the pro-democracy
Parliament elected in 1990 but never allowed to meet.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
The regime refused to honor the election result when it became
clear that pro-military parties lost.
	   Suu Kyi, who vaulted to prominence during anti-government
protests in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed, has been under
house arrest or close confinement for most of the last nine years.
Hundreds of her supporters are in jail.

Jane's: India to build nuclear submarine by 2004 with Russian aid 
</HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ India will build its first nuclear-powered
submarine by 2004 and eventually fit it with missiles carrying
nuclear warheads, Jane's Intelligence Review reports in its latest
issue.
	   Experts have said that following last month's nuclear weapons
tests by India and Pakistan, the South Asian arms race would shift
to developing means to launch the weapons. Two Jane's reports in
the magazine's June issue focused on a key element of India's
planned delivery system.
	   The reports were by Bombay-based science writer Gopi Rethinaraj
and Andrew Koch, a senior research analyst at the Center for
Defense Information in Washington.
	   India has said it needs a nuclear defense to counter the nuclear
capability of neighbors China and Pakistan, with whom it has fought
a total of four wars in the last 50 yeas. India accuses China of
supporting Pakistan's nuclear program.
	   Rethinaraj, discussing his research Friday in an interview, said
he expected India, with Russian help, to put in place the hull and
reactor of the submarine by the end of this year and finish
assembling the components by 2004.
	   A fleet of five Indian submarines is planned. Jane's said India
would be the only country other than the five official nuclear
weapon states _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States _ to operate nuclear submarines.
	   Since conventional submarines need to surface at least once a
week to draw oxygen to run diesel generators, they can be easily
detected. Nuclear submarines, however, can stay submerged for more
than three months.
	   Rethinaraj said India would eventually arm its subs with nuclear
missiles. Analysts estimated that production would begin in 2005 of
Sagarika missiles, which are being developed for underwater
launching.
	   India's nuclear submarines will be propelled by a pressurized
water reactor that will burn enriched uranium fuel. A land-based
prototype of the submarine's engine has been tested at Kalpakkam in
southern India, according to Rethinaraj and Koch.
	   Russian assistance to the Indian project is mainly in
non-nuclear areas such as hull design and underwater navigation.
Russia also is reportedly helping India develop the Sagarika
missiles and supplying a limited amount of turbojet and guidance
technology.
	   Under a contract signed five days ago, India awarded Russia a
dlrs 2.6 billion contract to build two nuclear power reactors in
southern India. The contract was in exchange for Russia's help on
the submarine project, Jane's said.
	   Despite U.S. opposition to the deal, Russia assured India it
would brook no outside interference in their economic relationship.

Toxic chemical found at several Matsushita plant sites in Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dangerous amounts of a cancer-causing chemical have
been found at several Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. plants
around Japan, the consumer products manufacturer said Friday.
	   Ground water at a television-production plant in the
southwestern Japanese city of Wakicho contains trichloroethylene at
900 times the level the government considers safe, the company
said.
	   The chemical was used to degrease metals at the Wakicho plant.
	   The Matsushita case is the latest in a string of discoveries
around Japan of dangerously high concentrations of toxic chemicals
at old plant sites, including those owned by Toshiba Corp. and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
	   Matsushita also said Friday that the carcinogen had been
detected among ground water samples within the compound of another
subsidiary in Chitose on Japan's northernmost main island of
Hokkaido.
	   Michimasa Kumaki, a local city official in Chitose, said the
city began taking underground water samples at 35 locations within
a 2-kilometer (1.24 mile) radius from the Matsushita's plant to see
whether drinking water was contaminated.
	   There have been no reports of anyone being sickened by the
chemical in Chitose, a city of 80,000 people, Kumaki said. The
plant produces condensers.
	   Matsushita's two other plants in western Oita Prefecture and
Osaka also reported finding dangerous amounts of trichloroethylene
at the plant sites to local governments.
	   Yoshihiro Kitadeya, a Matsushita spokesman, said the plants
involved now do not use the chemical.
	   Matsushita group comapnies currently operate plants at 112 in
Japan.
	   Earlier this month, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said ground
water at a former plant site was found to contain seven times the
legal concentration of CIS-1, 2-dichloroethylene, also a
cancer-causing chemical.
	   Toshiba Corp. has announced the discovery of ground water at its
plant in Nagoya with trichloroethylene, or TCE, at 15,670 times the
legal limit.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The former chief of police in Poland, who
resigned in January after only a year in office, has been found
shot dead outside his apartment, police said Friday.
	   The body of Marek Papala, 39, was found in his car, parked near
his Warsaw apartment, said Slawomir Cisowski, spokesman at the
general police headquarters. He had been shot dead late Thursday.
	   Cisowski refused to comment on a possible motive, but said a
special investigating team has been appointed and a 15,000 zloty
(dlrs 4,400) reward posted for information about the crime.
	   Papala had served as Poland's police chief from January 1997
until Jan. 29. Although he resigned without giving any reasons,
Papala had been faulted for inadequate security during sports
events and a lack of success in combating organized crime, which
has burgeoned since Poland launched democratic reforms in 1989.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean men returned home
Friday, three weeks after they were held captive and taken to
Russia's Far East by a runaway ship, police said.
	   Han Hae-dong, 60, and Park Dong-yol, 59, were on board the
Russian refrigerator ship Tibiya early this month when it sailed
away from court-ordered custody in Pusan port on South Korea's
southeast coast.
	   A Pusan court hired them to enforce its order to impound the
683-ton vessel embroiled in a lawsuit with a South Korean dry dock
company.
	   The Tibiya sailed back to the Russian Far East port of Magadan
last week and released the two Koreans to Russian authorities.
	   Police barred the ship's Russian owner, Alexei Chavshov, from
leaving South Korea until he paid dlrs 1.5 million he owed to the
South Korean company.
	   Chavshov's ship was impounded for auction when it docked in
Pusan in April.
	   Chavshov, 36, came to Pusan to negotiate the debt repayment, but
when talks broke down, he ordered his ship to flee, police said. He
was arrested while trying to leave South Korea shortly after his
ship was found missing.

Tokyo stocks higher on reported bank merger, dollar gains afternoon currency, byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; ADDS analyst comment in 8th graf, closing bond, late
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks ended higher Friday after a late rally
on reports of a merger between two of Japan's largest banks. The
dollar rose in the absence of Federal Reserve intervention to boost
the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rebounded from earlier losses
to close up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent, at 15,210.04. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   The dollar bought 141.28 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.36
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of
142.30 yen overnight.
	   Stocks rose after Japan's state-run NHK television said ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank will merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking as
early as next April.
	   Both banks refused to comment.
	   Analysts praised the reported merger as a sign Japan may allow
market forces to weed out weaker banks _ exactly the sort of tough
medicine they say the country needs to bolster its overall
financial system.
	   ``We should be looking at this as good news because it shows how
the Japanese bank bailout will likely proceed,'' said Pelham
Smithers, strategist at the Tokyo office of ING Baring Securities.
	   LTCB shares rose sharply on the reports, gaining 26 percent to
73 yen before the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading. Shares of
Sumitomo Trust, which were also suspended, dipped 3 percent to 648.
	   A merger would create Japan's No. 2 bank and one of the world's
10 largest in terms of revenues.
	   Trading on the first section was about average, with 424 million
shares changing hands, even with Thursday's 423 million.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,190.82. The TOPIX
closed up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before.
	   The bank tie-up also sparked a late rally by the yen, which
rebounded from an intraday low of 143.00 yen to the dollar to trade
as high as 141.17 yen.
	   The dollar had gained steadily over the last week as Japanese
investors, tired of miserable returns in their home markets, bought
the greenback to shift funds into roaring U.S. stocks financial
markets.
	   And with no sign that U.S. and Japanese central banks will
repeat the dramatic intervention last week that boosted the yen,
traders said such economic fundamentals mean demand for dollars
remains strong.
	   ``Demand and supply is pointing overwhelmingly to
dollar-buying,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar has recouped nearly all its losses since June 17, the
day Japanese and U.S. financial authorities bought yen to halt the
Japanese currency's slide to eight-year lows.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.230 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.220 percent,
driving its price down to 111.73 yen from 111.81 yen.

In Chinese village, Clinton touts democracy's potential, while lamenting crackdown on dissidents arrests, AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs, with further U.S. comment on dissident
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ In a dusty village square, President Bill
Clinton celebrated local elections as ``a window for all the world
to see'' the progress democracy can bring to China _ after voicing
his distress Friday at dissident arrests he called a backward look
by Beijing.
	   His message of democracy in a humble setting, a brick-walled
dirt plaza, brushed and bannered for the occasion, with
schoolchildren waving bouquets and singing songs, was in stark
contrast to the reports of arrests among Chinese dissidents.
	   And in contrast, too, to his coming state welcome in the vast,
haunted splendor of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where Chinese
troops bloodily repressed democracy demonstrators nine years ago.
	   President Jiang Zemin greets him there Saturday morning, by the
Great Hall of the People. The Tiananmen setting stirred protests in
Congress in advance; the House adopted a resolution saying Clinton
shouldn't go there.
	   He defended it as protocol, and said he was more concerned about
the substance of his promised effort to promote human rights in
China. But his nine-day visit was marred on that score as it began,
by the denial of visas to three reporters for a U.S. government
Asia broadcasting operation, and by reports that dissidents were
being detained.
	   There was no reliable account of the number, but a handful was
enough to make trouble for Clinton. A White House official said
Ambassador James Sasser had expressed U.S. concern to senior
Chinese officials.
	   The White House official, who spoke on condition that he not be
named, said the U.S. view is that the arrests did not represent a
wholesale crackdown or an effort to embarrass Clinton, but a
situation in which Beijing instructed local governments to avoid
incidents during the president's visit and they responded by
picking up known dissidents.
	   ``I found the reports disturbing,'' Clinton said in Xiahe.
``And, if true, they represent not China at its best and not China
looking forward, but looking backward.''
	   He said one reason he came was to discuss issues of personal
freedom, and dissident arrests emphasize the need for his message.
``... It makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and to engage them,'' he said.
	   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, told
reporters later that China's reponse so far to U.S. concerns were
disappointing, and that Clinton planned to raise the matter in his
talks in Beijing on Saturday.
	   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor,'' Berger
said. ``We have expressed our concern about this to the Chinese
government. Their response so far has not been terribly
satisfactory. They dispute the facts, or otherwise explain these
incidents away.''
	   At Xiahe, Clinton and Mrs. Clinton sat in the scarce shade of a
sweltering Friday morning, among six villagers, to talk about their
changing lives and the economic progress of their community.
	   He said one point of American interest is in the local elections
held in more than a half million Chinese villages, including Xiahe.
	   Then, addressing villagers in the square, he praised the efforts
and progress he said have brought the standard of living in Xiahe
and in much of China to the highest point in history, linking that
to fledgling democracy in local elections.
	   ``Whenever there is an election and the people decide then
everyone wins,'' he said.
	   The elections are contested, but not on the American model. They
are dominated by communist candidates, although not all running
with the party label. They choose mayors, village committees and
other local officials.

Russian markets fall despite IMF decision to release loan installment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with markets falling.
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy.
	   But investors apparently disagreed, and the stock market opened
sharply lower with traders citing fears that an IMF bailout is
moving too slowly.
	   ``Its a very weak market, but I would not say it is panic
selling yet,'' said Steve Malloy of Credit Suisse First Boston in
Moscow.
	   The Russian Trading System index plummeted 5.4 percent in the
first hour of trading, the index standing at 163.34, down from
Thursday's close of 172.57.
	   The markets have been keeping a close eye on Russia's talks with
the IMF over disbursement of its current dlrs 9.2 billion loan and
negotiations over a new loan the government hopes will top dlrs 10
billion.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's liaison
with international lenders, praised the IMF's decision on Thursday
to release the delayed dlrs 670 million installment as ``quite
natural and logical.''
	   ``It is important in principle that IMF board members ... regard
the ailments of the Russian economy as quite curable,'' Chubais
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The fund decided last week to hold up the installment, saying
Russia had to do more to balance the federal budget and reform key
areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax collection
system.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan to the
IMF earlier this week that officials said appeared to meet many of
the fund's criteria.
	   The new installment means Russia has so far received dlrs 5.8
billion of the existing dlrs 9.2 billion loan.
	   The fund was to begin deliberations Friday on whether to lend
Russia even more money. Russia is seeking an additional dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion loan to help shore up Central Bank
reserves and foster economic recovery.
	   However, traders said investors fear that financial aid may come
too late to prop up the state finances. They also cited investors'
concerns that Russia will ban trading from off-share tax havens as
part of its renewed efforts to crack down on tax evaders.
	   The country's stock market has lost about half its value since
the beginning of the year, with investors worried about falling oil
prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the Asian
financial crisis.
	   The Kremlin says the new IMF loan is needed to replenish Central
Bank reserves to prevent a devaluation of the Russian ruble.
Analysts say a rise in consumer prices could trigger social unrest.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has postponed a planned visit to the
Soviet republic of Kazakstan originally scheduled for next week,
saying he needs to work on solving the economic crisis.

<TEXT>
	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel began handing over 60
prisoners to the Red Cross Friday and hundreds of people gathered
at a crossing point into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon to await
the return of their loved ones.
	   Israel's release of the prisoners, some of whom have been held
for as long as 14 years, is the second stage of a deal between
Lebanon and Israel.
	   On Thursday Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier
for the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Ten prisoners who were held in Israeli jails were brought in
minibuses to the Israeli border town of Metullah Friday morning and
handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   At the same time, 50 prisoners held in the Khiam detention camp
in the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon began embarking on
buses under Red Cross supervision, a Lebanese security official
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The prisoners are expected to be released at about noon (0900
GMT) at a Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous, about 12
kilometers (eight miles) east of the southern provincial capital of
Sidon.
	   At Kfar Falous, hundreds of men, women and children gathered to
wait for them. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah and Amal
guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist Party
and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along the
road.
	   Anis Fouani, 63, said he felt ``extreme happiness and joy'' as
he awaited the arrival of his son, Ali, who was 17 when he was
taken by Israeli forces from his home in the occupied zone 14 years
ago.
	   ``We're all with the resistance until liberation of south
Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri were expected to greet the prisoners in Sidon later in the
day.
	   An Israeli government statement said the prisoners to be
released did not have ``blood on their hands.''
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, who was
crippled when a bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel
room two years ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to
blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   The release of prisoners followed the exchange late Thursday of
the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya for the bodies of
40 Hezbollah, Amal and Communist guerrillas killed in clashes with
Israeli forces.
	   The Red Cross mediated the exchange and France provided the
military aircraft which transferred the bodies.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the mostly Hezbollah fighters,
including the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, with full military honors late Thursday.
	   Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport, reflecting the
government's recognition of the Shiite militants as national
heroes.
	   The bodies are to be buried Saturday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Ilya, a naval commando killed in a botched
raid in the south in September. Israel received his remains with
full honors at a military airport outside Tel Aviv.

Hong Kong to pay ``all reasonable costs'' to keep link 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top finance official said Friday he
is willing to defend the local currency's link to the U.S. dollar
at ``all reasonable costs.''
	   ``I'm quite happy to say at all reasonable costs,'' Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said, answering questions from reporters
about how far he would go to defend Hong Kong's 14-year currency
link to the U.S. dollar.
	   In an interview late Thursday, Tsang had said there are costs
Hong Kong is not willing to bear to defend the currency. Pressed by
the interviewer, he wouldn't say the government will defend the peg
``at all costs.''
	   But he also said he would step down from the job he has had for
almost two years if the peg goes.
	   Local interbank rates went up and the Hong Kong dollar weakened
against U.S. dollar slightly early Friday on his comments.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial crisis better
than most countries, it is paying dearly for the peg. Interest
rates are kept high, eating into corporate profits and hurting bank
liquidity. The economy, which shrank 2 percent in the first
quarter, is on the brink of recession.
	   Economists are divided over whether the peg should go. Some say
scrapping it would hurt investors' confidence in Hong Kong and the
region, while others think floating the Hong Kong currency is the
only way to keep the territory competitive.
	   Tsang also said Friday that he would back international support
for the Japanese yen.
	   ``We cannot, on our own, do something, but we are thinking of an
international effort'' of the Group of Seven industrialized nations
and other countries, he said.
	   Tsang said the weakened yen is hurting Japan's direct investment
in Hong Kong and China. Japanese investment has ``dwindled'' and
``that's all because of the Japanese yen value,'' he said.

World Cup: Iran exits from World Cup with a smile 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) - Iran is going home from the World Cup
smiling.
	   Ousted Thursday on a 2-0 loss to Germany, Iran exited the
tournament after the first round feeling successful. After all,
Iran won the big one, defeating the United States 2-1 in a match of
honor between nations that have been hostile for two decades.
	   That victory set off wild celebrations in Tehran, where the
United States has been ``The Great Satan'' since the Islamic
Revolution toppled the U.S.-backed shah in 1979.
	   In their opening match, the Iranians lost only 2-1 to
Yugoslavia, showing their competitiveness after an absence of 20
years from the World Cup. They also refused to crumble against
Germany, the three-time world champs.
	   ``This World Cup was a great experience for us and I hope it did
a lot for the future of soccer in our country,'' said Iran coach
Jalal Talebi.
	   ``I am pleased with the players and I congratulate them and the
Iranian nation,'' he said.
	   When Iran clinched the last World Cup berth by edging Australia
in the playoffs, millions in Tehran poured into the streets in
celebration.
	   Then Iran was drawn into the tough Group F with powerful Germany
and Yugoslavia and arch-foe United States, and many in the
soccer-mad nation feared their team could end up being humiliated.
Instead, the three-time Asian champion did well in the global
spotlight.
	   ``We are going home happy. We did our best, and we know that our
people also are happy with us,'' said midfielder Ali Reza
Mansourian.
	   ``These games showed us that the difference between Asian soccer
and the best teams in the world is not that great. It is a
difference we can make up,'' he said.
	   Talebi, a native of Iran who now lives in the United States, was
hired this spring to guide the team in the World Cup.
	   ``After our victory against the United States, players felt that
their work was finished, and they didn't have the same motivation
tonight as they had against the United States,'' said Talebi,
explaining the loss to Germany.
	   German coach Berti Vogts admitted it was not an easy win against
Iran.
	   ``I had said before that we have to be careful with Iran, and
tonight I was proven right,'' he said.
	   After a goal-less firs with Iran's first World Cup
appearance in Argentina in 1978. But the Islamic revolution a year
later and the 1980-88 war with Iraq virtually killed the sport.
	   Some of the country's best soccer talent left, or abandoned
sports altogether in an effort to make a living.
	   In recent years, however, several Iranian players have made a
name in some of the world's best clubs.

Germany's Bundesliga, and a fourth player, Alireza Mansourian, says
he also has an offer from a German club.
	   Mehdi Mahdavikia, a rising star who scored the winning goal
against the United States, has an offer from Italy's Inter Milan.
	   More Iranian players are expected to be in demand with European
clubs after showing off their talent at the World Cup.
	   ``We did the best with the minimum facilities available to us
back home,'' said Talebi.

Meteorologists optimistic coming weather will subdue haze 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The smokey haze that shrouded Southeast Asia
last year is unlikely to return this year because of the weakening
of the El Nino weather pattern, Singapore's meteorological service
said Friday.
	   El Nino is blamed for last year's unusually dry Southwest
monsoon season, which allowed fires mostly set by plantation owners
and farmers in Indonesia to burn out of control, blanketing the
region in smoke.
	   ``In view of the weakening El Nino, (the weather) is unlikely to
give rise to the widespread smoke haze that we experienced last
year,'' Wong Teo Suan, a deputy director of Singapore's
Meteorological Service, told reporters.
	   Wong cautioned that the region will experience some haze, though
it will probably will be only slight to moderate. He said it was
common at this time of year, especially when slash and burn
practices intensify in Indonesia.
	   By October, the rains will increase as the dry season subsides,
Wong said
	   In their periodic outlook, released Friday, the Meteorological
Service said drier weather was expected as normal between July and
September as the Southwest monsoon takes hold.
	   But this dry season will not be as severe as last year's, and
the region will even enjoy the respite of occasional widespread
showers, it said.
	   The report also noted that the return to normal weather is
``likely'' to be followed by La Nina in early 1999. That weather
phenomenon is a reversal of El Nino, and would bring unusually
heavy rains to Southeast Asia, further reducing the risk of haze.
	   The report said that there were still some fires burning in
central Sumatra, the Indonesian island to the west of Singapore and
Malaysia, but they were not threatening the region.
	   During June, Southeast Asia has been generally free of forest
fires and smoke haze.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. is planning a
merger with Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been
foundering under huge problem loans, Japanese media reported
Friday.
	   The combined bank would be the second biggest in Japan after
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., reported one of Japan's largest
newspapers, the Asahi.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   News reports said the merger would take place in April next
year, and a recently proposed government-run ``bridge bank'' would
take over much of LTCB's bad debt.
	   That would make the deal a crucial first test of a government
campaign to clean up Japanese banks' 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) in bad debt. The bad loans have been blamed as a major
cause for Japan's deepest recession in 50 years.
	   An LTCB spokesman said an official decision had not yet been
made, but refused to comment further.
	   Hiroshi Nakato, a spokesman for Sumitomo Trust, refused to
confirm or deny the reports. Sumitomo Trust President Atsushi
Takahashi was to hold a news conference at 9 p.m. Japan time (1200
GMT).
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports appeared Friday
afternoon.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Electronics Industries Co. has
canceled a dlrs 774 million deal to sell its American computer chip
plant to Adaptec Inc., the South Korean company said Friday.
	   The cancellation came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
opposed the deal on grounds it might create a market monopoly,
Hyundai officials said.
	   In February, Hyundai agreed to sell its Symbios Logic Corp.
unit, a Fort Collins, Colo.-based maker of computer storage
devices, to Silicon Valley's Adaptec.
	   Symbios competes in some of its products with Adaptec, which
makes hardware, software and chips that help information move
through computers and telecommunications more quickly.
	   Symbios products go into computers sold by Compaq Computer
Corp., Sun Microsystems Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
	   Hyundai hoped to sell Symbios to ease a cash crunch caused by
South Korea's economic crisis and finance a dlrs 1.3 billion chip
plant under construction in Eugene, Oregon.
	   Hyundai said it would continue to look for ways to sell Symbios.
	   Symbios employs 781 people in research and development, assembly
and testing in Fort Collins and 867 people in wafer fabrication and
engineering in Colorado Springs. It had revenues of dlrs 614
million last year.
	   Hyundai Electronics is South Korea's No. 2 computer chip maker
after Samsung. It is a unit of the Hyundai conglomerate.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The auction of car loans held by
insolvent finance companies shut down by the Thai government has
fetched 25 billion baht (about dlrs 600 million), about half their
original value.
	   Officials of the Financial Restructuring Authority, charged with
disposing the assets of the 56 failed finance companies, said
Thursday the auction was a success and a model of transparency that
would raise foreign investor confidence in Thailand.
	   The proceeds were higher than expected, said Vicharat
Vichit-Vadhakan, the authority's secretary general, and will be
divided evenly among creditors.
	   Vicharat said that liquidity would be loosened as a result of
disposing the assets of the finance companies, which were shut down
last year as Thailand became the first of Asia's tiger economies to
fall into crisis.
	   The winners of the auction included GE Capital (Thailand) Ltd.,
V. Conglomerate Co., Pranakorn Automobile Ltd., Siam Panich Leasing
PCL, and Radhanatun Finance Co.
	   GE Capital is a subsidiary of the U.S.-based General Electric
Co. Siam Panich Leasing is majority owned by Siam Commercial Bank
PCL, the country's fourth-biggest commercial bank.
	   Other assets held by the finance companies include corporate and
commercial real-estate loans, loans for investors to buy stocks and
residential mortgages.
	   ___
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top finance official said Friday he
is willing to defend the local currency's link to the U.S. dollar
at ``all reasonable costs.''
	   ``I'm quite happy to say at all reasonable costs,'' Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said, answering questions from reporters
about how far he would go to defend Hong Kong's 14-year currency
link to the U.S. dollar.
	   In an interview late Thursday, Tsang had said there are costs
Hong Kong is not willing to bear to defend the currency. Pressed by
the interviewer, he wouldn't say the government will defend the peg
``at all costs.''
	   But he also said he would step down from the job he has had for
almost two years if the peg goes.
	   Local interbank rates went up and the Hong Kong dollar weakened
against U.S. dollar slightly early Friday on his comments.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial crisis better
than most countries, it is paying dearly for the peg. Interest
rates are kept high, eating into corporate profits and hurting bank
liquidity. The economy, which shrank 2 percent in the first
quarter, is on the brink of recession.
	   Economists are divided over whether the peg should go. Some say
scrapping it would hurt investors' confidence in Hong Kong and the
region, while others think floating the Hong Kong currency is the
only way to keep the territory competitive.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is planning to reshuffle landing quotas at
Tokyo's main international airport in a move that could result in
increased flights by foreign airlines, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Transport Ministry will redistribute about 200 weekly
takeoff and landing slots at Narita Airport, with Japan and the
United States expected to get one-third each, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper said.
	   The remainder will be allotted to other nations, said the paper,
Japan's leading business daily.
	   Ministry official Katsuto Kawarabayashi confirmed the government
was still working out details of the plan, including how many slots
will be redistributed to which countries. But he provided no
specifics.
	   A total of 337 regular flights per day fly into and out of the
airport at Narita, with the United States accounting for 35 percent
of the total, Kawarabayashi said. Japan has 36 percent, while other
countries hold the remaining 29 percent, he said.
	   The Transport Ministry last redistributed flight slots at
Narita, 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Tokyo, in 1991, when 62
were given to the United States, and 50 to Japan. Other nations
received eight.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The Asian financial crisis may be
the most serious shock to hit New Zealand's economy since the oil
shocks of the 1970s, Reserve Bank governor Don Brash said Friday.
	   But the difference this time is that New Zealand is prepared for
it, he said.
	   ``The benefits of recent economic reforms, in reducing public
sector debt and improving the flexibility and adaptability of the
economy as a whole, will be evident to all to see,'' Brash said.
	   Brash said New Zealand's strengths are a strong banking sector,
a floating exchange rate and low public sector debt.
	   He said New Zealand assets had not been badly overpriced as in
some Asian countries and the lower kiwi dollar would help exporters
switch to non-Asian markets.
	   Growth figures released by Statistics New Zealand Friday showed
the economy shrank by 0.9 percent in the March quarter, the first
quarter to record negative growth for more than five years.
	   Brash spoke as a team of sovereign debt assessors from
U.S.-based Moody's Investor Services met government ministers and
officials over a possible downgrade of the country's credit rating.
	   Brash said ``a monetary policy aimed firmly at price stability
is of enormous benefit in weathering the storm'' of the Asian
financial crisis.

Man commits suicide after losing World Cup bet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A 24-year-old man committed suicide after
losing a bet on the Germany-Yugoslavia World Cup soccer match,
local police said Friday.
	   Bui Van Dang, 24 was found dead Monday after hanging himself at
the office of the people's committee of Quyet Thang precinct in the
central highlands province of Kon Tum, police said.
	   Police said he had lost his Honda Dream motorcycle on the Sunday
match between Germany and Yugoslavia, which ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   Dang's family paid to get the motorbike back, but he killed
himself after he was cursed by relatives.
	   Soccer-crazy Vietnam has become obsessed with the World Cup,
even though the country never has qualified for the competition.
	   All matches are being shown on state television, and streets are
virtually deserted when they are aired.

Astronomers discover huge planet 15 light years away 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Astronomers have discovered a planet bigger
than Jupiter just 15 light years from Earth, apparently a huge ball
of gas with a surface temperature well below zero.
	   Geoffrey Marcy, who heads a four-member team of San Francisco
State researchers, announced the discovery this week at a
scientific symposium in Canada. The finding was confirmed by a
separate team in Switzerland.
	   The group found the planet using the Keck I telescope in Hawaii.
	   Its huge mass _ at least 1.9 times bigger than Jupiter's _ was
detected by a wobble in the motion of a nearby star, not by direct
visualization.
	   There is no evidence of any solid land on the planet on which
earthlike life forms might have developed. Scientists say the
planet is mostly hydrogen and helium with a surface temperature of
about 80 degrees below zero (-60 degs. Celsius).
	   The planet was the first to be found orbiting a small star
called Gliese 876, one-third the size of the sun. The star is the
closest to Earth _ other than our own sun _ around which a planet
has been found.
	   It is one of the closest members of a class of low-mass stars
that are the most common in the Milky Way galaxy.
	   The previously closest-known ``extrasolar'' planet orbits a star
about 35 light-years away. A light-year is 5.9 trillion miles, the
distance light travels in one year.
	   ``It's not spitting distance, exactly, but spacecraft distance
perhaps for future generations,'' Marcy said Wednesday.
	   Marcy added that the discovery of a planet around Gliese 876
dramatically raises the odds that many more planets may be found
relatively close to our own solar system.
	   ``The key issue is that this is by far the lowest-mass star
around which a planet has ever been discovered,'' he said.
	   Twelve such planets have been discovered by the world's
astronomers, including seven by Marcy and his associates in the
past three years. A report on the most recent discovery will be
published in Saturday's issue of Science News.

Tokyo stocks higher on reported bank merger, dollar gains afternoon currency, byline 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING

By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks ended higher Friday after a late rally
on reports of a merger between two of Japan's largest banks. The
dollar rose in the absence of Federal Reserve intervention to boost
the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rebounded from earlier losses
to close up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent, at 15,210.04. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   The dollar bought 141.28 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.36
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of
142.30 yen overnight.
	   Stocks rose after Japan's state-run NHK television said ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank will merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking as
early as next April.
	   Both banks refused to comment.
	   Analysts praised the reported merger as a sign Japan may allow
market forces to weed out weaker banks _ exactly the sort of tough
medicine they say the country needs to bolster its overall
financial system.
	   ``We should be looking at this as good news because it shows how
the Japanese bank bailout will likely proceed,'' said Pelham
Smithers, strategist at the Tokyo office of ING Baring Securities.
	   LTCB shares rose sharply on the reports, gaining 26 percent to
73 yen before the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading. Shares of
Sumitomo Trust, which were also suspended, dipped 3 percent to 648.
	   A merger would create Japan's No. 2 bank and one of the world's
10 largest in terms of revenues.
	   Trading on the first section was about average, with 424 million
shares changing hands, even with Thursday's 423 million.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,190.82. The TOPIX
closed up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before.
	   The bank tie-up also sparked a late rally by the yen, which
rebounded from an intraday low of 143.00 yen to the dollar to trade
as high as 141.17 yen.
	   The dollar had gained steadily over the last week as Japanese
investors, tired of miserable returns in their home markets, bought
the greenback to shift funds into roaring U.S. stocks financial
markets.
	   And with no sign that U.S. and Japanese central banks will
repeat the dramatic intervention last week that boosted the yen,
traders said such economic fundamentals mean demand for dollars
remains strong.
	   ``Demand and supply is pointing overwhelmingly to
dollar-buying,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar has recouped nearly all its losses since June 17, the
day Japanese and U.S. financial authorities bought yen to halt the
Japanese currency's slide to eight-year lows.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.230 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.220 percent,
driving its price down to 111.73 yen from 111.81 yen.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ About 100 people, mostly drunken English
soccer fans en route to a World Cup match, were arrested in
overnight clashes in northern France and neighboring Belgium,
police said.
	   In Lens, where England was to play Colombia later Friday, 16
people were detained for being drunk and violent, police said.
Their nationalities were not released. At least three were expected
to remain in custody.
	   In nearby Lille, a major European railway junction, about 30
people were detained after fights broke out between English fans
and locals when bars closed, police said.
	   French television channel LCI said the majority of the people
detained were English fans, including some known hooligans. Four
people in Lille, including a taxi driver, were slightly injured,
the reports said.
	   In other disturbances, 52 soccer fans were taken into custody
Thursday night for running amok in the North Sea port of Ostende,
Belgium, after arriving by ferry.
	   Police said windows were broken and Belgians were challenged to
fights in the disturbances that lasted until 3 a.m. Police were
preparing to return the offenders to Britain.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of dissidents at the outset of his
China visit is awkward at best for U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
has pledged to push Beijing, face-to-face, for greater freedoms.
	   For Chinese authorities, such detentions are routine. They
underscore China's resistance to Clinton's human rights agenda, as
well as Beijing's determination to ensure that no protests mar the
president's nine-day tour.
	   Three dissidents were arrested Wednesday and Thursday in and
near the city of Xi'an, Clinton's first stop, human rights groups
said. As of Friday, their whereabouts remained unknown.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing,''
and instructed U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to raise the issue with
Chinese authorities.
	   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, later
said it was an example of Chinese security forces ``doing what
comes naturally for them,'' and added, ``People are not debris to
be swept up for a visitor.''
	   Berger also said the White House did not believe the action
against dissidents was intended to embarrass Clinton.
	   Three Xi'an dissidents went to the city police bureau at around
midnight Thursday to hand over a letter protesting the arrests and
surveillance of other democracy activists, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police refused to let them through the door, so they left the
letter at a reception desk instead, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Human rights groups report arrests in China and other forms of
harassment nearly every day, often in statements faxed to foreign
reporters. Local officials and police rarely comment.
	   Lu Siqing, who runs the Hong Kong-based monitoring group, said
police were following regulations, many of them internal,
accumulated over dozens of years of authoritarian rule that tell
them how to act when important people visit or at politically
sensitive times.
	   ``Police are just acting according to their regulations. They
have no concepts of human rights. They think `I must act according
to the rules,''' Lu said. ``It's their habit.''
	   Officials claim there are no dissidents in China. They allege,
as Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said earlier this week in a news
conference, that most people described as dissidents have
``violated China's criminal law.''
	   Authoritative statistics are lacking on the number of dissidents
or political prisoners imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or forced
into exile, where many continue to work for political change back
home.
	   A 1996 report by Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, recorded about 2,000 people either jailed or subject
to occasional detentions for political or religious activities.
Human Rights Watch, in a 1994 book, documented 1,700 Chinese
imprisoned for political, ethnic or religious beliefs.
	   Many political activists who remain in China complain of
harassment by police and state security agents, of having trouble
running businesses or holding steady jobs.
	   Despite the constant risk of arrest and other trouble, many
still dare to publicize their beliefs.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news agencies _
urging him to speak out for freedom and the release of political
prisoners and to meet with dissidents during his stay.
	   Tang, other Chinese officials and White House advisers have said
Clinton has no such plans.
	   Lin Xinshu, a veteran dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province who often gets involved in public appeals for greater
freedom, said dozens of police were standing vigil outside his
door.
	   ``I called their chief and told him not to put so many out
there. One or two would do,'' Lin said. ``After all, I'm old and
not very healthy, how could I cause any trouble?''

Belgium's Red Devils face chorus of derisory comments at home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's ouster from the world cup
sparked a chorus of derisory comments in the Belgian media Friday
with commentators seeing nothing good in a team that won not a
single opening round match.
	   Banner headlines proclaiming shame on Belgium's Red Devils
competed with huge photos of dejected players or fans after
Belgium's 1-1 tie against South Korea on Thursday.
	   Earlier, the Belgians drew against the Netherlands and Mexico.
	   Against Mexico and South Korea, they took 2-0 and 1-0 leads
respectively yet allowed their opponents to pull even.
	   The current cup event marked the first time Belgium failed to
reach the second round since 1982.
	   After failing to beat the Dutch and the Mexicans, said the
Brussels daily Het Nieuwsblad nicely caughtcuiaght the national
mood by declaring:
	   ``The Belgian players became the laughing stock of the whole
world by drawing against South Korea. The weak Koreans even went
looking for a victory in the final stages of the match.''
	   Belgium entered the world cup with a relatively old team.
National coach Georges Leekens now must find young talent in a
country that has a poor youth training record.
	   That is, if Leekens stays on. Immediately after the Belgians
drew against South Korea, the first voices were heard calling for
his dismissal.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ About 100 people, mostly drunken English
soccer fans en route to a World Cup match, were arrested in
overnight clashes in northern France and neighboring Belgium,
police said.
	   In Lens, where England was to play Colombia later Friday, 16
people were detained for being drunk and violent, police said.
Their nationalities were not released. At least three were expected
to remain in custody.
	   In nearby Lille, a major European railway junction, about 30
people were detained after fights broke out between English fans
and locals when bars closed, police said.
	   French television channel LCI said the majority of the people
detained were English fans, including some known hooligans. Four
people in Lille, including a taxi driver, were slightly injured,
the reports said.
	   In other disturbances, 52 soccer fans were taken into custody
Thursday night for running amok in the North Sea port of Ostende,
Belgium, after arriving by ferry.
	   Police said windows were broken and Belgians were challenged to
fights in the disturbances that lasted until 3 a.m. Police were
preparing to return the offenders to Britain.

Precede BELGRADE Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders leaders, CHANGES byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke in Pristina, meeting ethnic Albanian
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, met the province's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday.
	   Arriving from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci, an
Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence. The American envoy was then to see the
Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, then
travel to Athens, Greece.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for some Serbian security forces to
withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to resume
talks over the political future of the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   Rugova got a stern reminder from NATO this week that no foreign
power supports the Albanians' quest for independence, and that the
best option is to talk with the Serbs about regaining or expanding
the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   The province has been under virtual martial law ever since, with
hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanians _ dying in periodic
clashes.
	   More than 300 have been killed since March, when Serbian police
began a crackdown against militant separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a shadowy group which emerged in 1996 and has
gained ground rapidly since spring among Kosovo Albanians weary of
Serbian repression and Rugova's peaceful tactics.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of the rugged
province.
	   Holbrooke reiterated late Thursday, after hours of talks with
Milosevic, that no outside power wants an independent Kosovo.
	   ``The international community will not recognize Kosovo as an
independent country,'' Holbrooke said. ``The international
community is opposed to forcible change of boundaries.''
	   Both sides should now ``exercise restraint,'' he added,
``because the situation in Kosovo threatens the stability in all
this part of Europe.''
	   ``Security forces, the armed forces on both sides, should
dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ... barracks,'' Holbrooke
said.
	   Christopher Hill, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, clarified the
request, saying only ``special police who have been engaged in some
of the operation need to be pulled back.''
	   ``It's not a request that all police in Kosovo need to be pulled
back nor it is a request that Yugoslavia not exercise its right to
control its borders,'' Hill said reporters.
	   Holbrooke has taken on a diplomacy mission many see as a
last-ditch attempt to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes. On
Wednesday, he met with Milosevic, then traveled into the heart of
the battle zone and met with ethnic Albanian militants.
	   In the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said Thursday
that a Yugoslav army patrol clashed with a group of militants
trying to cross into Yugoslavia from Albania. Two Albanian citizens
were killed and six others captured. Large quantities of weapons
were seized.

WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Mrs. Clinton demoted, husband mum on favorite Chinese dish 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has been demoted _
from Mrs. President to respectable Mrs. Clinton.
	   That's according to two mayors who introduced the President and
the First Lady at their first stops on China.
	   ``Your Excellency Mr. President and Mrs. President,'' was the
salutation from Mayor Feng Xichu of Xiang, who, presumably, was
unaware that critics at home have sometimes suggested that's the
role the First Lady really wanted.
	   Today, the welcoming line in the village of Xiahe was more
restrained.
	   ``Your Honorable Excellency President Clinton, respectable Mrs.
Clinton,'' Mayor Yang Yunlong began.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   The Chinese may not be capitalists, but one entrepreneurial
restaurant owner knew the value of well-timed publicity.
	   Won't you come to my restaurant, he asked the president and Mrs.
Clinton when his turn came during an outdoor roundtable discussion
with villagers in Xiahe.
	   ``If you don't have the chance this time, you're still welcome
after you finish your duty as president to come back,'' he
continued. ``And, what are your favorite Chinese dishes?''
	   The president chuckled approvingly. ``Now I understand how you
fill a restaurant with 500 seats every night!''
	   Without weighing in on any favorites, Clinton continued, ``This
is very nice. You know, most people in my position wonder if anyone
will want us to eat with them when we're not in office anymore.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Not every tourist gets up-close-and-personal with the
painstakingly restored Terracotta Warriors _ an ancient version of
Secret Service agents for Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who wanted
guards in the afterlife.
	   But Clinton, his wife and daughter Chelsea were allowed into the
pit to walk among one battalion of the 7,000-plus excavated statues
lined up for battle. ``I've been reading about it for 25 years but
it's different to see it,'' Clinton said.
	   Agog, he stopped before one of the lifesize warriors and reached
out to touch its face.

Russian patrol fires warning shots at Japanese fishing boat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards fired warning shots and
detained a Japanese fishing boat Friday that was discovered in
Russian waters, a news agency reported.
	   Officials on the Russian patrol boat spotted the ship three
kilometers (about two miles) off of Tanfilyev Island, part of the
Kuril chain in Russia's Far East. After the Japanese fishermen did
not stop when ordered, border guards fired warning shots from a
hand-held machine gun, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The boat then stopped and Russian officers boarded, finding
seven fishermen. Their ship will be detained at the city of
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk for further investigation, Interfax said.
	   Russian coast guard ships have frequently fired at Japanese
fishing boats suspected of poaching in Russian waters, especially
around the disputed Kuril Islands.

Taiwan central banker predicts another downward revision of growth forecast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A board member of Taiwan's central bank said
Friday he expects the government to lower its 1998 economic growth
forecast to between 5 percent and 6 percent, the third downward
revision this year.
	   Taiwan has cut its original forecast of 6.5 percent twice so
far. The current prediction of 6.01 percent is considered by some
economists to be overly optimistic.
	   Speaking at a foreign exchange conference in Singapore, Central
Bank of China board member Chen Po-chih said he expects Taiwan's
healthy electronics industry to provide much of the growth.
	   He argued that Taiwan has a ``comparative advantage'' over rival
Japan in shipping low-priced personal computers because it enjoys a
market lead in computers based on Intel chips.
	   Chen, also a professor at the National University of Taiwan,
added that he disagrees with manufacturers who urge a further
depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar. He noted that their
international market share has remained constant despite the
relative strength of the currency.
	   He said he foresees interest rates in Taiwan remaining in the 6
percent to 7 percent range, adding the country will supply the
necessary liquidity to insure that interest rates remain stable.

Meteorologists optimistic coming weather will subdue haze 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CHANGES `smokey' in lead to `severe.'
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The severe haze that shrouded Southeast Asia
last year is unlikely to return this year because of the weakening
of the El Nino weather pattern, Singapore's meteorological service
said Friday.
	   El Nino is blamed for last year's unusually dry Southwest
monsoon season, which allowed fires mostly set by plantation owners
and farmers in Indonesia to burn out of control, blanketing the
region in smoke.
	   ``In view of the weakening El Nino, (the weather) is unlikely to
give rise to the widespread smoke haze that we experienced last
year,'' Wong Teo Suan, a deputy director of Singapore's
Meteorological Service, told reporters.
	   Wong cautioned that the region will experience some haze, though
it will probably will be only slight to moderate. He said it was
common at this time of year, especially when slash and burn
practices intensify in Indonesia.
	   By October, the rains will increase as the dry season subsides,
Wong said
	   In their periodic outlook, released Friday, the Meteorological
Service said drier weather was expected as normal between July and
September as the Southwest monsoon takes hold.
	   But this dry season will not be as severe as last year's, and
the region will even enjoy the respite of occasional widespread
showers, it said.
	   The report also noted that the return to normal weather is
``likely'' to be followed by La Nina in early 1999. That weather
phenomenon is a reversal of El Nino, and would bring unusually
heavy rains to Southeast Asia, further reducing the risk of haze.
	   The report said that there were still some fires burning in
central Sumatra, the Indonesian island to the west of Singapore and
Malaysia, but they were not threatening the region.
	   During June, Southeast Asia has been generally free of forest
fires and smoke haze.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel handed over 60 Lebanese
prisoners to the Red Cross Friday and several thousand people
gathered at a crossing point into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon
to await the return of their loved ones.
	   Israel's release of the prisoners, some of whom have been held
for as long as 14 years, is the second stage of a deal between
Lebanon and Israel.
	   On Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier
for the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Ten prisoners who were held in Israeli jails were brought in
buses to the Israeli border town of Metullah Friday morning and
handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   At the same time, 50 prisoners held in the Khiam detention camp
in the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon embarked on buses
under Red Cross supervision, Lebanese security officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The two groups headed in one convoy through winding mountain
roads to Kfar Falous, about 12 kilometers (eight miles) east of the
southern provincial capital of Sidon, where they will be met by
Lebanese soldiers.
	   At Kfar Falous, several thousand men, women and children
gathered to wait for them. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
and Amal guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist
Party and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along
the road, reflecting the makeup of those to be released.
	   Hezbollah supporters shouted ``Death to Israel'' and Communist
activists, some wearing T-shirts with portraits of South American
Communist revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, danced the dabke,
a folk dance.
	   Most of the prisoners were held without trial on suspicion of
aiding guerrillas fighting Israeli forces.
	   Lebanese officials said that with Friday's release, 167
prisoners remain in Khiam or in Israel.
	   Anis Fouani, 63, said he felt ``extreme happiness and joy'' as
he awaited the arrival of his son, Ali, who was 17 when he was
taken by Israeli forces from his home in the occupied zone 14 years
ago and jailed in Khiam.
	   ``We're all with the resistance until the liberation of south
Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri were expected to greet the prisoners in Sidon later in
the day.
	   An Israeli government statement said the prisoners to be
released did not have ``blood on their hands.''
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, who was
crippled when a bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel
room two years ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to
blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   The release of prisoners followed the exchange late Thursday of
the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya for the bodies of
40 Hezbollah, Amal and Communist guerrillas killed in clashes with
Israeli forces.
	   The Red Cross mediated the exchange and France provided the
military aircraft which transferred the bodies.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the fighters, including the son
of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, with full military
honors late Thursday.
	   Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport, reflecting the
government's recognition of the Shiite militants as national
heroes.
	   The bodies are to be buried Saturday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Ilya, a naval commando killed in a botched
raid in the south in September. Israel received his remains with
full honors at a military airport outside Tel Aviv.

Precede WINDHOEK, Namibia Chirac tries to forge alliances during first trip to southern Africa Mandela; changes byline

Eds: UPDATES with Chirac arrival in South Africa, meeting with
By ANDREW SELSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela and
French President Jacques Chirac met Friday at Mandela's office in
Pretoria at the beginning of the French leader's state visit to
South Africa.
	   ``Voila my friend, how are you,'' said Mandela, dressed in a
business suit and smiling broadly as he greeted Chirac with an
embrace on the steps of the Union Building.
	   Chirac then reviewed a 200-member South African Defense Force
honor guard and a military band played the French national anthem.
	   The 79-year-old Mandela, hobbled by age, then struggled up the
stairs arm-in-arm with Chirac and into the Union Building where the
two will sign bilateral accords later.
	   South Africa is the key stop on Chirac's six-day tour of
southern Afrian countries that is meant to encourage new
relationships that will bring closer political and economic ties.
	   Less than a year ago, Franch launched major changes in its
Africa policies away from involvement in her former West African
colonies.
	   The new French policy recognizes that South Africa since 1994's
first all-race elections has become the anchor for new investment
and economic growth in the region.
	   Chirac arrived in South Africa from Namibia, where on Thursday
that the new policy was an attempt by France to counterbalance
increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   ``Contrary to the polemics I'm hearing, there is no competition
between the United States and and France in Africa. That is
completely absurd,'' he said on the first day of his trip.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   Chirac said France continues to offer official development
assistance to countries that need it, while the United States
places more focus on trade and investment.
	   Chirac and Namibian President Sam Nujoma signed agreements on
health care assistance, a 35 million French francs (dlrs 6 million)
loan to Nampower, the power utility, and transportation
development.
	   The trip marks the first time a French President is visiting
Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.
	   The late President Francois Mitterrand visited South Africa soon
after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994.

Cambodia's Hun Sen doubts guerrilla leader will surrender 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG SPEU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said
Friday he is confident that the three remaining top leaders of the
Khmer Rouger rebels will be captured, but does not expect one of
them will turn in the others.
	   ``I believe that they cannot escape,'' he said of Ta Mok, Nuon
Chea and Khieu Samphan, still at large in Cambodia's northern
jungles. ``But it is too premature for me to say how they will be
taken.''
	   Lsat week Hun Sen hinted that Khieu Samphan, the guerrilla
group's president, could be granted amnesty if he turns in his
comrades.
	   Hun Sen said then that if Khieu Samphan helped capture the other
two, ``we will forgive (him).''
	   On Friday, however, Hun Sen said it was unrealistic at this
stage to believe Khieu Samphan would cooperate.
	   ``I believe that Khieu Samphan will not undertake this job,''
Hun Sen said. ``So, the last solution is to capture him alive.''
	   He said he still hoped that the three could be brought to trial
for genocide.
	   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2
million Cambodians from overwork, starvation and execution when it
held power from 1975-79.
	   After the Khmer Rouge was ousted by Vietnamese-backed troops, it
continued to wage guerrilla warfare against successive governments.
	   ``As long as there is no trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders, it
should not be determined that its political and military
organization is finished,'' Hun Sen said.
	   The government wants to try Ta Mok, the real leader of what
remains of the radical group; Nuon Chea, who had been No. 2 to the
group's former leader, Pol Pot; and Khieu Samphan, long seen as the
guerrilla group's more palatable public face.
	   Wracked by defections since 1996 _ including five influential
hard-liners just last week _ the decades-old revolutionary movement
appeared to be on the verge of extinction.
	   Pol Pot, ousted by his own comrades last year, died in mid-April
of a heart attack as the group was being driven out of its last
major stronghold.
	   Hun Sen also said Friday that Cambodia's neighbor, Thailand, has
been cooperating in the hunt for the three by preventing them from
seeking sanctuary on Thai soil.

Prime Minister Vajpayee's lackluster 100 days in office 
</HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee proclaimed his nuclear tests the ``one historic
achievement'' of his first 100 days in office, in full-page
newspaper ads Friday.
	   Those same tests soured India's relations with its neighbors and
prompted international economic sanctions that sent the rupee
plummeting . It's clear that any conclusions about the government's
early successes or failures are very much in the eyes of the
beholder.
	   The May nuclear tests were at first welcomed by ordinary
Indians, who saw them as proof of their country's scientific
expertise and of its ability to defy Western powers. But the
euphoria soon died down in the face of answering tests from rival
Pakistan and cuts in aid and loans from the United States, Japan
and other countries.
	   ``The political leadership might not have expected the extent of
reaction from the world community,'' said Subodh Bhargava, former
president of Confederation of Indian Industries.
	   The sanctions are likely to make it harder for Vajpayee's
government, led by his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, to
spend on development or attract foreign investment. The resulting
economic uncertainty has added to Vajpayee's main political
challenge: keeping his fractious coalition together.
	   A key partner, Jayaram Jayalalitha is hinting she will withdraw
support if Vajpayee does not dismiss the state government led by
her rivals in southern Tamil Nadu. The survival of the BJP-led
government depends on the support of the 30 lawmakers Jayalalitha
controls.
	   There was no immediate threat that an even more divided
opposition would try to topple the BJP-led government. The BJP and
its allies control 249 of 545 seats in Parliament, the Congress
Party and its partners 191 and the United Front 75. The rest are
held by independents.
	   The opposition has tried to fan anti-BJP sentiment by raising a
six-year-old issue: the destruction of a mosque by right-wing
Hindus that set off nationwide riots. In recent weeks, opposition
politicians rose in parliament to warn that more religious unrest
would result if rightists went ahead with plans to build a Hindu
temple atop the mosque's rubble.
	   BJP leaders said the temple project was on hold until a court
ruled on what should be done with the disputed site, but the
controversy intensified when a Hindu group with close ties to the
BJP said it would build a temple no matter what the courts said.
	   Parties in Vajpayee's 20-party coalition government range from
socialists to far rightists. They agreed on the nuclear tests, but
have come together behind few other policy initiatives.
	   ``Overall, I would say, it has been a sort of period of lost
opportunity,'' said Bhargava, the business leader.

	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ In a major blow to the Sicilian Mafia,
police arrested scores of suspected mobsters on Friday, including
the sister of a top boss.
	   The huge bust came just a day after the army began pulling out
after a six-year deployment aimed at freeing up police to fight
organized crime.
	   Among those arrested in the Palermo area on charges ranging from
murder, theft, drug trafficking and gun running were 22 suspected
members of the infamous Corleone clan.
	   The reputed head, Vito ``Old Rag'' Vitale, was arrested in
April.
	   His sister, Giuseppina Vitale, 26, was picked up in Vitale's
hometown, Partinico, just outside Palermo. Police also filed new
charges against his brother, Leonardo, who is serving a life prison
sentence.
	   In Catania, on Sicily's west coast, police arrested another 40
people and filed Mafia-related charges 14 more people already in
jail. Among them were two men accused of ordering murders from
prison using cellular phones.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel handed over 60 Lebanese
prisoners to the Red Cross on Friday, and several thousand people
gathered at a crossing point into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon
to await the return of their loved ones.
	   Israel's release of the prisoners, some of whom have been held
for as long as 14 years, is the second stage of a deal between
Lebanon and Israel.
	   On Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier
for the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Ten prisoners who had been held in Israeli jails were brought in
buses to the Israeli border town of Metullah Friday morning and
handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   At the same time, 50 prisoners at the Khiam detention camp in
the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon embarked on buses
under Red Cross supervision, Lebanese security officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The two groups headed in one convoy through winding mountain
roads to Kfar Falous, about 12 kilometers (eight miles) east of the
southern provincial capital of Sidon, where they were to be met by
Lebanese soldiers.
	   At Kfar Falous, several thousand men, women and children
gathered to wait for them. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
and Amal guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist
Party and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along
the road, reflecting the allegiances of those to be released.
	   Hezbollah supporters shouted ``Death to Israel'' and Communist
activists, some wearing T-shirts with portraits of South American
Communist revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, danced the dabke,
a folk dance.
	   Most of the prisoners have been held without trial on suspicion
of aiding guerrillas fighting Israeli forces.
	   Lebanese officials said that with Friday's release, 167
prisoners remain in Khiam or in Israel.
	   Anis Fouani, 63, said he felt ``extreme happiness and joy'' as
he awaited the arrival of his son, Ali, who was 17 when he was
taken by Israeli forces from his home in the occupied zone 14 years
ago and jailed in Khiam.
	   ``We're all with the resistance until the liberation of south
Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri were expected to greet the prisoners in Sidon later in
the day.
	   An Israeli government statement said the prisoners to be
released did not have ``blood on their hands.''
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, who was
crippled when a bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel
room two years ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to
blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   The release of prisoners followed the exchange late Thursday of
the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya for the bodies of
40 Hezbollah, Amal and Communist guerrillas killed in clashes with
Israeli forces.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the fighters, including the son
of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, with full military
honors late Thursday.
	   Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport, reflecting the
government's recognition of the Shiite militants as national
heroes.
	   The bodies were to be buried Saturday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Ilya, a naval commando killed in a botched
raid in the south in September. Israel received his remains with
full honors at a military airport outside Tel Aviv.

Yeltsin to visit Egypt next year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin will pay a state
visit to Egypt in the first few months of 1999, he said Friday in a
telephone phone conversation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   During the conversation, Yeltsin praised Mubarak for Egypt's
call to create a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East,
according to the Kremlin press service. The Egyptian president in
turn lauded Russia's efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo by
diplomatic means.
	   The two leaders agreed to consult regularly on issues of mutual
interest.

Kohl's junior coalition partner to decide on future coalition 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ The Free Democrats, junior partner in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, opened a party convention
Friday with the question of whether to stick with the center-right
coalition at the top of their agenda.
	   Some party leaders have recently raised the possibility of a
switch to the opposition Social Democrats, who are leading in the
polls ahead of Sept. 27 national elections. Others have advocated
waiting until August to announce coalition plans.
	   But party chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt has said he wants to clear
things up now to concentrate on the election campaign.
	   The pro-market, anti-tax liberals were expected to pass easily a
resolution calling for a continuation of Kohl's three-party
coalition, in power since 1982, if it wins.
	   There also was expected to be discussion of demands by some Free
Democrats for Kohl to step down early if he wins in favor of
Wolfgang Schaeuble, his parliamentary whip, to provide fresh blood
at the top.
	   Kohl, 68, has said he wants Schaeuble, 55, to be his successor,
but has never indicated when that might be.
	   Calls for tax and other economic reforms also were expected to
be on the party congress agenda.

Taiwan looks for results from negotiator's China visit 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan said Friday it wants solid results
from a fall visit by its top negotiator to China. But a wary
critics said Beijing timed the invitation to polish its image.
	   China issued the invitation for Koo Chen-fu to visit in
September or October just as U.S. President Bill Clinton was
arriving on Thursday for a historic visit to the mainland.
	   Taiwan hopes Koo's visit will lead to restarting negotiations
that China suspended more than three years ago. Koo is chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation, Taiwan's semiofficial body for
negotiating with China.
	   ``Our stance is that we will not avoid unofficial exchanges of
views on relevant matters during the visit,'' said Sheu Ke-sheng,
vice chairman of the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   Taiwan hopes for formal discussions to restart later this year,
Sheu said.
	   Shi Hwei-yow, secretary general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, who is in charge of mid-level negotiations, said he
hoped to visit China first to arrange Koo's agenda.
	   ``This is an important meeting, so we wish to make the
appropriate preparations,'' Shi said.
	   The Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait, invited Koo to meet its chairman, Wang Daohan,
in Shanghai. Koo also was invited to tour coastal Fujian province,
where most Taiwanese trace their roots, along with the cities of
Beijing, Nanjing and Xian. Shi was invited to accompany Koo.
	   But the United Daily News said in an editorial that China sent
the invitation just before Clinton's summit with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to make itself look good.
	   The invitation's timing ``points out the competitive
atmosphere,'' between the sides over the restart of talks, the
editorial said. ``But we must question whether interaction between
the sides will continue to move along at such a clip after the
Clinton-Jiang summit.''
	   China wants to take advantage of the attention on Chinese issues
to shift the blame for stalling talks, The Independence Evening
Post said.
	   Washington has called on the sides to restart their dialogue as
a way of bringing stability to the region.
	   China suspended talks in 1995 over a trip by Taiwanese President
Lee Teng-hui to the United States that it considered proof he was
abandoning the stated goal of reunification.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven off the
mainland by Communist forces in 1949. Koo and Wang's initial
meeting in Singapore in 1993 was the first open dialogue between
the sides since the split.
	   China recently has dropped a demand that Taiwan agree to
directly discuss reunification in order to resume talks. Taiwan
wants to return to the practical issues previously under
discussion, including resolution of fishing disputes and
repatriation of hijackers,
	   A Taiwanese official visited Beijing in April to break the ice
between the sides and clear the way for Koo's invitation.

Report: Israel bars hard-line PLO official from Gaza 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel will not allow Farouk Kaddoumi, a top
PLO official and opponent of the Mideast peace agreements, to visit
the autonomous Palestinian areas, Israel radio said Friday.
	   No official confirmation was immediately available.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison office with the
Palestinians, said Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1996, when the Palestine National
Council met in the Gaza Strip.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, boycotted the PNC session.
	   Earlier this week, the Palestinian Authority asked Israel to
approve a visit by Kaddoumi to the nominally autonomous Palestinian
areas.

New Malaysian minister to handle economy sworn in 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, was sworn in Friday as a new
minister to handle economic problems.
	   Daim's installation has raised questions about the relationship
of the new department with the Finance Ministry, which is headed by
Mahathir's deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Although Mahathir did not make any comment after the swearing
in, he said Thursday that the move was not aimed at undermining
Anwar's powers.
	   ``There's no precedence between Daim and Anwar,'' Mahathir told
reporters, indicating that the health of the country's economy was
the priority. Daim's position, Mahathir said, ``doesn't imply that
Anwar isn't doing a good job.''
	   Daim's promotion comes days after Anwar and Mahathir denied a
rift between them on economic policy.
	   But neither have yet backed down from their opposing positions,
with Anwar maintaining that high interest rates are needed to
protect the ringgit and keep inflation down and Mahathir saying
that the tight monetary policy was choking business.
	   Daim has supported Mahathir's position, insisting that Malaysian
businesses needed loans and high-growth policies to survive the
Asian financial crisis.

Report: Next stage of Israeli spy satellite project approved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Defense Ministry has approved funding for
the next stage of the Israeli spy satellite, Ofek, a newspaper said
Friday.
	   After the failure of an Ofek launch in January, the ministry's
director, Ilan Biran, had held up budget approval until the cause
for the mishap was established, the Jerusalem Post said.
	   The satellite Ofek 4 was launched with an Israeli-manufactured
Shavit missile from a base in southern Israel. Radio reports said
at the time that the first stage went off without a hitch, but that
problems were detected two minutes into the second stage and the
launch was aborted.
	   An earlier version of the satellite, Ofek 3, has been in orbit
since 1995. According to foreign reports, it has provided
information on Iran, Iraq and Syria. Israel is especially worried
about Iran's attempts to develop nuclear weapons and long-range
missiles capable of reaching Israel.

Cambodian military aircraft hits land mine on runway 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A military aircraft hit a land mine
Friday in southern Cambodia, causing serious damage to the plane
but no injuries, officials said. It was the second such incident in
six months.
	   ``We suspect the same people who laid the mine last time were
involved,'' said Gen. Kong Mony, commander of the air force.
	   Authorities speculated the first mine was planted by groups
opposed to the government of Hun Sen, who deposed his co-prime
minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup last July.
	   Three passengers and five crew members were on board the
Ukrainian-made Antonov 24 transport, which was being used to bring
supplies and equipment to Koh Kong province in southern Cambodia,
Kong Mony said.
	   The plane hit the mine shortly after landing as it was steering
towards the taxiing pad. The left wing and tire were badly damaged.
	   An official with Royal Air Cambodge, which flies regularly to
Koh Kong province, said that some flights may have to be canceled
due to runway damage.
	   How the land mine got on the runway remained a mystery. Koh Kong
authorities said after a similar incident in December they
carefully checked the area for other explosives.
	   Cambodia is one of the world's most heavily mined countries.

Long-Term Credit Bank has much to gain from merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ News of a merger with Sumitomo Trust and Banking
came just in time for ailing Long-Term Credit Bank, and for Japan's
government, which is struggling to revive the country's moribund
financial system. Here is what analysts are watching for:
	   _THE BIRTH OF A GIANT. The combined bank would likley be the
second largest in Japan in terms of revenues. It would combine
LTCB's business lending and investment banking businesses with
Sumitomo's Trust's asset management expertise. With combined
revenues of 3.64 trillion yen (dlrs 26 billion) last year, the
merged entity could be one of the world's 10 biggest banks.
	   _BOOST IN CONFIDENCE. The yen soared against the dollar and bank
stocks staged a late rally as market participants were cheered by
reports of the merger plans. Traders said it was good news for the
ailing banking sector because it shows the industry is moving more
aggressively to clean up its bad loans.
	   _TEST OF PUBLIC BAILOUT. Japan's banks are buried under a
mountain of bad debt, and the merger would be a first crucial test
of a government plan to dig them out. Bank analysts welcomed
reports that many of LTCB's most problematic loans would be shifted
to a new government-run ``bridge bank'' and reports that public
money would be used to bolster the new bank's capital. Such
measures are needed to lighten the load for Sumitomo Trust and
ensure that the new bank begins on a solid footing, they said.
	   _RESTRUCTURING IMPETUS. Both banks operate in limited areas of
the banking world. LTCB's traditional business of long-term lending
to industry is shrinking as more companies turn directly to stock
and bond markets to raise money. Sumitomo Trust specializes in
managing money for big-time investors, a business expected to
change dramatically and become more competive as deregulation opens
the market to competition from overseas.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela and
French President Jacques Chirac met Friday at Mandela's office in
Pretoria at the beginning of the French leader's state visit to
South Africa.
	   ``Voila my friend, how are you,'' said Mandela, dressed in a
business suit and smiling broadly as he greeted Chirac with an
embrace on the steps of the Union Building.
	   Chirac then reviewed a 200-member South African Defense Force
honor guard and a military band played the French national anthem.
	   The 79-year-old Mandela, hobbled by age, then struggled up the
stairs arm-in-arm with Chirac and into the Union Building where the
two will sign bilateral accords later.
	   South Africa is the key stop on Chirac's six-day tour of
southern Afrian countries that is meant to encourage new
relationships that will bring closer political and economic ties.
	   Less than a year ago, Franch launched major changes in its
Africa policies away from involvement in her former West African
colonies.
	   The new French policy recognizes that South Africa since 1994's
first all-race elections has become the anchor for new investment
and economic growth in the region.
	   Chirac arrived in South Africa from Namibia, where on Thursday
he denied that the new policy was an attempt by France to
counterbalance increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   ``Contrary to the polemics I'm hearing, there is no competition
between the United States and and France in Africa. That is
completely absurd,'' he said on the first day of his trip.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   Chirac said France continues to offer official development
assistance to countries that need it, while the United States
places more focus on trade and investment.
	   Chirac and Namibian President Sam Nujoma signed agreements on
health care assistance, a 35 million French francs (dlrs 6 million)
loan to Nampower, the power utility, and transportation
development.
	   The trip marks the first time a French President is visiting
Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.
	   The late President Francois Mitterrand visited South Africa soon
after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
generally lower Friday on profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 57.97 points, or 0.7 percent, to 8,607.86. On Thursday, the
index surged 369.06 points, or 4.4 percent.
	   Turnover slipped to 5.36 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
687 million), down from Thursday's 6.17 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 791 million).
	   Brokers said share prices fell sharply in the morning as
investors took profits following Thursday's sharp rally.
	   They said prices regained some of their losses in the afternoon
following news from Tokyo that the Japanese Long-Term Credit Bank
and Sumitomo Trust and Banking have agreed to merge their
operations as early as next April.
	   The merger could help boost the ailing financial sector in
Japan, brokers said.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.10 Hong Kong
dollars to 33.30, and Cheung Kong fell 20 cents to 38.90.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 2.50 dollars to

Official: Kidnappers of Russian envoy demand dlrs 5 million ransom 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kidnappers holding a Russian presidential envoy
captive have demanded more than dlrs 5 million for his release,
Chechnya's premier said in an interview published Friday.
	   Chechnya is determined not to pay any money to gain release of
the envoy, Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped in the republic
nearly two months ago, Prime Minister Shamil Basayev told the daily
Noviye Izvestia.
	   ``We have enough problems with our own hostages,'' Basayev said.
``Let Russia worry about Vlasov.''
	   ``Let them bargain, if they have money,'' he added. ``We have
none.''
	   Basayev also accused Russian secret services of staging the
kidnapping of Vlasov. ``This whole story looks very much like a
provocation by secret services,'' he said.
	   Vlasov was abducted at gunpoint May 1 while traveling from
Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia.
	   Earlier this month, Chechnya's deputy Prosecutor General Magomed
Magomadov said the kidnappers made a ``tentative demand'' for dlrs
2 million. Neither Magomadov nor Basayev said who the kidnappers
were or how the demands were communicated.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   Basayev also threatened to close Chechnya's pipeline that
transports oil from Azerbaijan to Russia if Moscow doesn't transfer
funds for Chechnya's pension payments before the end of this month.
	   The pipeline through Chechnya is an essential conduit for the
growing output at Azerbaijan's Caspian oil wells.
	   Chechnya stands to make about dlrs 7.9 million this year from
the route, which is expected to handle more than 570 million
gallons of crude. Basayev insisted that the republic ``has not
received a penny for the transportation of oil.''
	   While Chechnya insists it is an independent country, it still
demands money from Russia's federal budget for pension payments. It
also wants a ``compensation'' for war damages.
	   No country, including Russia, has recognized Chechnya as an
independent state.

Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke in Pristina, meeting ethnic Albanian
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, met the province's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday.
	   Arriving from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci, an
Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence. The American envoy was then to see the
Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, then
travel to Athens, Greece.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for some Serbian security forces to
withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to resume
talks over the political future of the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. Kosovo is part of Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and other nations fear that violence in Kosovo
could flare into a wider Balkan war.
	   Rugova got a stern reminder from NATO this week that no foreign
power supports the Albanians' quest for independence, and that the
best option is to talk with the Serbs about regaining or expanding
the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   The province has been under virtual martial law ever since, with
hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanians _ dying in periodic
clashes.
	   More than 300 have been killed since March, when Serbian police
began a crackdown against militant separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a shadowy group that emerged in 1996 and has
gained ground rapidly among Kosovo Albanians weary of Serbian
repression and Rugova's peaceful tactics.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of the rugged
province.
	   Holbrooke reiterated late Thursday, after hours of talks with
Milosevic, that no outside power wants an independent Kosovo.
	   ``The international community will not recognize Kosovo as an
independent country,'' Holbrooke said. ``The international
community is opposed to forcible change of boundaries.''
	   Both sides should now ``exercise restraint,'' he added,
``because the situation in Kosovo threatens the stability in all
this part of Europe.''
	   ``Security forces, the armed forces on both sides, should
dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ... barracks,'' Holbrooke
said.
	   Christopher Hill, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, clarified the
request, saying only ``special police who have been engaged in some
of the operation need to be pulled back.''
	   ``It's not a request that all police in Kosovo need to be pulled
back, nor it is a request that Yugoslavia not exercise its right to
control its borders,'' Hill said reporters.
	   Holbrooke has taken on a diplomacy mission many see as a
last-ditch attempt to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes. On
Wednesday, he met with Milosevic, then traveled into the heart of
the battle zone and met with ethnic Albanian militants.
	   In the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said Thursday
that a Yugoslav army patrol clashed with a group of militants
trying to cross into Yugoslavia from Albania. Two Albanian citizens
were killed and six others captured. Large quantities of weapons
were seized.

Poll: Brazilian footballers objects of Thai monks' devotion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Underneath the saffron-colored robe of
your average Thai Buddhist monk beats the heart of a Brazilian
soccer team supporter.
	   A poll of 937 monks, conducted from June 15-25, showed that 46.8
percent were rooting for Brazil's team during the current World Cup
tournament in France.
	   The second most popular team was England, the darlings of 29
percent, followed by Italy, idolized by 10.7 percent, said the
poll, seen Friday.
	   More than half the monks surveyed in the Dusit Poll, conducted
by the Rajaphat Institute teachers colleges, admitted that they
should not follow the matches as it was not consistent with
religious discipline.
	   However, a substantial minority _ 42 percent _ said that they
should follow the games to keep up-to-date and relieve stress.
	   Newspapers were the preferred medium for monks following the
World Cup, followed by television, the poll said.

Tense waiting game for results to Northern Ireland election comment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with count begins; grafs 10-16 final exit-poll data,
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Election officials began a
painstaking ballot count Friday to determine who among nearly 300
candidates will sit in Northern Ireland's new cross-community
government.
	   The outcome to Thursday's complex election for a 108-seat
Assembly will have profound implications for the Belfast peace
agreement, struck in April among eight parties but opposed by two
Protestant parties committed to blocking compromise.
	   An exit poll indicated that Protestants appeared deeply divided
between supporters and opponents of the accord, which could make
the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party the largest
in the new assembly. But the poll results don't answer the crucial
question of how many seats each party will win.
	   The Assembly must implement key elements of the agreement, such
as the nomination of a 12-member administration of Protestants and
Catholics alike, and will gradually take over some power from the
British government. Under terms of the agreement, it must make
decisions by consensus across the sectarian divide.
	   The exit poll indicated that Protestant hard-liners led by the
Rev. Ian Paisley fared well. And the bombastic Paisley predicted
that his Democratic Unionists and other anti-agreement Protestants
would win enough seats to form an obstructionist bloc in the
Assembly, but other parties doubted this.
	   Electoral officials estimated the turnout of Northern Ireland's
1.18 million eligible voters at about 65 percent, average in this
highly politicized society _ but well down on the 81 percent who
voted in last month's straightforward ``yes'' or ``no'' referendum
to ratify the agreement.
	   Politicians attributed the lackluster turnout to the cautious
campaigns waged by most parties and to ``ballot fatigue'' _ the
public had already endured four votes in two years of almost
nonstop debate.
	   Ever since 71 percent of Northern Ireland voters said ``yes''
May 22, Paisley and the leader of the major Protestant party, David
Trimble, have argued about the significance of the 29 percent of
voters, overwhelmingly Protestant, who voted no.
	   Trimble, whose support for the agreement has badly split his
Ulster Unionist Party, insisted that most Protestants voted yes and
would back his own support for the agreement in the Assembly
election.
	   But Thursday's exit polling of about 1,600 voters, collated
early Friday, painted a picture of a Protestant community
profoundly split on the prospect of compromise.
	   The Ulster Unionists scored 22 percent of first-preference
votes, the Democratic Unionists 17 percent, in the full results
from the poll commissioned by Irish broadcasters RTE and the Irish
Times newspaper. The sample had a margin of of error of 3 percent.
	   Paisley's smaller but just as stubborn ally, the United Kingdom
Unionist Party, attracted 3 percent, according to the survey. Two
parties that represent pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups
and support the agreement, potential allies of Trimble, received 6
percent.
	   On the Catholic side, the SDLP had 22 percent support in the
poll, compared with 15 percent to its militant rival, the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
	   RTE released the first half of its polling data late Thursday
based only on the surveying of voters from morning until
midafternoon. This had indicated a narrower gap between the Ulster
Unionists and Democratic Unionists, and a stronger showing for John
Hume's SDLP.
	   But the fuller figures, indicating that Hume's party would
finish on top for the first time in Northern Ireland's history, was
a major gossip point as politicians arrived at ballot counting
centers.
	   ``It could well be that the SDLP will be the largest party. We
have always feared that might be the case,'' said John Taylor,
deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, which normally is No. 1 in
elections.
	   The official count could take all of Friday, and possibly part
of Saturday, because of the highly democratic but painstaking
``proportional representation'' system.
	   The system allows voters to mark candidates in order of
preference. Ballots marked ``1'' for certain candidates _ either
those at the top or the bottom of the popularity table _ have their
lower preferences registered with other candidates.
	   This means a party could win a higher, or lower, percentage of
seats than its share of first-preference votes suggest. In the case
of Ulster Unionists, for instance, their candidates may benefit
from lower-preference votes from moderate Catholics who want
pragmatic Protestants, rather than Paisley's supporters, to prevail
in the Assembly.
	   Six winners will be declared in each of Northern Ireland's 18
electoral districts.

World Cup: South Korea's thoughts turn to 2002 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ South Korea's thoughts of the 2002
World Cup began the moment the final whistle signaled the team's
elimination from France 98.
	   After a bitter 3-1 loss to Mexico and a devastating 5-0 defeat
by the Netherlands _ prompting team officials to fire head coach
Cha Bum-kun _ South Korea managed to pull itself together Thursday
for a 1-1 draw against Belgium.
	   South Korea had arrived at the World Cup hoping to post its
first win in five World Cup appearances. A good showing in France
was regarded by those involved in Korean soccer as vitally
important to underline the country's right to co-host the
tournament with Japan in 2002.
	   Now, South Korea will have to wait four more years to seek that
elusive World Cup victory.
	   ``South Korea has attained the international level. The only
difference is that we lack experience,'' said defender Hong
Myung-Bo, who has played 94 internationals for South Korea,
including in three World Cups. ``Football is a collective sport. I
may have experience but you need maturity for the entire team.
	   ``Of course, the level of football in Asia is still inferior to
that in Europe,'' added the 27-year-old veteran.
	   An international tournament of the scope of the World Cup every
four years is not enough to give South Korea and other Asian teams
the experience they so badly need.
	   ``More South Korean players, more Asian players in general, need
to play in Europe to gain experience and advance on the
international scene, to elevate the level of soccer in Asia,'' said
Hong.
	   Only two of the squad's 23 men played for a European team this
season: forward Seo Jung-won, who signed with Strasbourg (France)
for dlrs 1.5 million in January, and midfielder Noh Jung-yoon, who
plays for NAC Breda (Netherlands).
	   It was the team's inexperience, combined with rather naive
tactics against the European teams and injuries to key players that
hurt the team's campaign.
	   The disappointment was all the greater after South Korea had
showed such promise at the last World Cup in the United States in
1994. Then, the team had shown strength and character, drawing with
soccer-power Spain and Bolivia before before losing a tight 3-2
game to Germany.
	   Despite what the team has gained from these championships, South
Korea will once again start from scratch when it welcomes the World
Cup to its homeland.
	   Kim Pyung-seok, who took over as head coach after Cha was fired,
has no plans to continue as the national team coach, despite
guiding the players to their best result in France _ the draw with
Belgium.
	   ``I don't want to replace Cha as the head coach of the team,''
said Kim. ``He got the team so far, they reached the finals with
flying colors.
	   ``Besides it's the technical committee which has to decide on a
replacement. And I have no such perspectives.''
	   Kim said he doesn't rue his short stint as the interim coach.
	   ``I had no regrets during the time I took over for Cha,'' he
Kim. ``The only thing I might regret is that it could have been
like that the whole time _ no injuries, no red cards, just smooth
running for the team.
	   ``We would have gotten further,'' Kim added.

Talks drag on, while fighting continues 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Church leaders hoping to halt daily
artillery and rocket battles in and around Guinea-Bissau's capital
have failed to meet with besieged President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Bissau's Roman Catholic Bishop Setinio Artur Franzetti on Friday
said he was unable to meet with Vieira, but instead talked with his
representatives one day earlier.
	   ``We simply are looking to have both sides talks and stop the
fighting,'' Franzetti said.
	   He would not elaborate on the talks.
	   Despite his efforts and those of other religious leaders,
fighting pounded the northern outskirts of Bissau, where the
breakaway military is locked in a standoff with loyalist troops and
their Senegalese allies.
	   The pre-dawn quiet of a capital nearly deserted was shattered by
the sound the exploding shells.
	   Earlier in the week, Franzetti met with rebel leader and former
army chief of staff Ansumane Mane and appealed for a cessation of
hostilities.
	   A breakthrough in the talks is unlikely until both sides ease up
on their demands.
	   The rebels say they will stop fighting when Vieira leaves the
country, while the government says they will halt the shelling when
the rebels lay down their arms.
	   The capital as been shattered by almost three weeks of fighting,
after Mane launched a coup attempt against Vieira.
	   Almost the entire city population of 300,000 people has fled to
nearby towns, prompting what could become a major humanitarian
crisis without an influx of food and medical relief, aid workers
have said.

Thousands march in East Timor in support of Indonesia: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of people in favor of
Indonesian rule marched through the streets of East Timor's capital
Friday, protesting calls for a referendum on the future of the
disputed territory, a news report said.
	   The demonstration ended peacefully at the office of the
provincial governor, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   The protest was held 24 hours before three Jakarta-based
ambassadors from Britain, the Netherlands and Austria were
scheduled to arrive in Dili on a European Union fact-finding
mission.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering a long
running guerrilla war and human rights abuses.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie has offered to grant special
status to East Timor and to release imprisoned rebel commander
Xanana Gusmao in exchange for international recognition.
	   However, pro-independence groups, as well as Portugal and
Gusmao, demand a referendum.
	   The organizers of Friday's pro-Indonesian protest said a
referendum could result in bloodshed between rival East Timorese
groups.

Officials: NATO might set up mission in Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ NATO might set up a mission in Ukraine to
serve as a liaison office for the development of military contacts
with the former Soviet republic, Ukrainian and NATO officials said
Friday.
	   The question was discussed at a meeting between NATO's visiting
assistant secretary-general of political affairs, Klaus-Peter
Klaiber, and Volodymyr Horbulin, secretary of Ukraine's Security
Council.
	   Horbulin said it would also be raised during the visit of the
alliance's Secretary-General Javier Solana, expected next month.
Klaiber's delegation arrived in Ukraine on Thursday for a three-day
visit to prepare Solana's trip.
	   Klaiber backed the notion of a NATO mission in Ukraine, saying
it could help facilitate military cooperation.
	   He praised Ukraine for its participation in the alliance's
Partnership for Peace program, and stressed Kiev's importance for
European stability and security, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Horbulin said relations with NATO were one of the government's
main priorities, especially expanding cooperation with Ukraine's
military-industrial complex, Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that it wants close relations
with NATO, and some officials have said the country may eventually
seek membership.
	   Russia, Ukraine's giant northern neighbor, is vehemently opposed
to any former Soviet republic joining NATO.
	   Although relations between the two are often tense, Moscow has
offered Ukraine security guarantees and signed a treaty of
friendship and cooperation.
	   Ukraine signed a cooperation charter with NATO last year, and
has eagerly hosted and participated in peacekeeping maneuvers under
the Partnership for Peace program.
	   Ukrainians are split over NATO relations. Communists and other
leftists who want tight ties with Russia say Ukraine should be wary
of the alliance, while most nationalists want Ukraine to move
closer to NATO more quickly.
	   Klaiber's delegation would also be meeting foreign and defense
ministries' officials and visiting the Black Sea Crimea Peninsula
before leaving Ukraine on Sunday.

Salvadoran guard says `higher ups' ordered murder of nuns 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By EDITH BELTRAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ A former El Salvador national
guardsman soon to be freed from prison says ``higher-ups'' ordered
the 1980 killing of four American church workers that he and four
comrades were convicted of raping and murdering.
	   ``They gave us the order while we were driving along. One had to
obey and nothing more,'' Daniel Canales told The Associated Press
on Thursday.
	   He spoke a day after a judge ordered parole for him and two
other guardsmen under a new early-release law to ease prison
overcrowding.
	   Canales insisted he did not take part: ``I didn't see anything
because the night was very dark.''
	   He repeatedly refused to say specifically who ordered the
killings. Some of the other guardsmen sentenced in the attack have
made similar accusations _ also without providing names.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and
lay worker Jean Donovan were driving along a Salvadoran road when
they were kidnapped, raped and shot dead on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   Like many affiliated with the church, all four had been on a
blacklist of suspected leftist sympathizers kept by rightist death
squads who helped the military fight leftist guerrillas.
	   Human rights groups estimated more than 75,000 people were
killed, most by death squads, during El Salvador's 14-year civil
war that ended in 1993.
	   Canales spoke bitterly about senior officers: ``All the while,
they are enjoying benefits and unmerited survival. It was something
inhuman because (the church workers) were messengers in the name of
God and were working for the welfare of the least protected
people.''
	   A U.N. investigating team has said Col. Eugenio Vides Casanova,
then-director of the National Guard, and Defense Minister Gen. Jose
Guillermo Garcia covered up for senior officers involved.
	   The five guardsmen were sentenced to 30 years in prison at
Quezaltepeque, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of San Salvador.
	   A new law allows freedom for prisoners after they have served
two-thirds of their sentence, including time off for good behavior.
Three of the guardsmen could be released by Tuesday; two were
refused parole because of misconduct in prison.
	   The U.S. government and lawyers for the victims' families have
criticized the decision to free the men.

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders car. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with two Serbs reportedly found shot dead in their
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, met the province's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday.
	   Arriving from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci, an
Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence. The American envoy was then to see the
Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, and travel
to Athens, Greece.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for some Serbian security forces to
withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to resume
talks over the political future of the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   Foreign powers fear the increasingly violent conflict could
flare into a wider Balkan war.
	   Rugova got a stern reminder from NATO this week that no foreign
power supports the Albanians' quest for independence, and that the
best option is to talk with the Serbs about regaining or expanding
the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   The province has been under virtual martial law ever since, with
hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanians _ dying in periodic
clashes.
	   More than 300 have been killed since March, when Serbian police
began a crackdown against militant separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a shadowy group which emerged in 1996 and has
gained ground rapidly since spring among Kosovo Albanians weary of
Serbian repression and Rugova's peaceful tactics.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of the rugged
province. Road travel is increasingly dangerous, with KLA and
police checkpoints blocking normal routes and daily gun battles
waged for control of key arteries.
	   On Friday, the Serbs' Media Center reported that two Serbs had
been found shot dead in their car in northwest Kosovo, reportedly
gunned down in an ambush.

Unveiling of U.S. stamp kicks off weekend of Berlin airlift commemorations 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Fifty years after American pilots began flying
supplies to west Berlin to counter a Soviet blockade, the U.S.
Postal Service flew a new stamp to the city Friday to kick off a
weekend of events marking the airlift anniversary.
	   The 32-cent U.S. stamp _ the first ever unveiled outside the
United States _ shows a C-54 cargo plane coming in for a landing as
Berliners standing on the city's postwar rubble gaze skyward.
	   The Americans, British and French launched the airlift on June
26, 1948, two days after the Soviet Union cut off all land and
water routes to the western half of the city in an attempt to force
its former allies out.
	   The main base of operations for the airlift, which lasted 15
months, was Tempelhof Airport, which is where most of the 50th
anniversary events are being held amid a festival atmosphere.
	   The stamp was flown in on the ``Spirit of Freedom,'' a restored
C-54 that has been turned into a flying museum about the division
of Berlin.
	   Among the dignitaries at the airport unveiling were U.S.
Ambassador John Kornblum; the commander of the U.S. Air Force in
Europe, John P. Jumper; Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and former
U.S. pilot Gail Halvorsen, who started the airlift hallmark of
tossing packages of gum and chocolate to West Berlin children from
his plane.
	   A re-enactment of the candy drops was among the events planned
for the weekend _ only this time the tiny parachutes will be thrown
from a construction crane instead of an airplane.
	   Also planned is the opening of a museum dedicated to the postwar
Allied occupation of Berlin, which ended after Germany's 1990
unification.
	   The museum is on a boulevard named after U.S. Gen. Lucius D.
Clay, the former military governor in West Germany who is known as
the ``father'' of the airlift.
	   To recapture the spirit of the times, city officials are also
planning recreations of the black market that operated in postwar
Berlin, a fashion show featuring late 1940s attire, and free
screenings of ``A Foreign Affair,'' the 1948 Billy Wilder movie
starring John Lund and Marlene Dietrich which was partly shot in
the city's postwar ruins.

Cricket hierarchy pledges tests will not go to highest bidder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's cricket hierarchy has pledged that fans
who don't subscribe to pay television will not miss out on seeing
test matches.
	   A government decision Thursday to remove test matches from a
list of sports events reserved for terrestrial television cleared
the way for subsciption broadcasters to buy live rights to the
game.
	   However, England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Lord MacLaurin
said broadcast rights would not simply go to the highest bidder.
	   McLaurin said any new television deal would strike a balance
between satellite and terrestrial television coverage.
	   ``We must get the best deal for the development of cricket and
the widest access for viewers,'' he said.
	   ECB chief executive Tim Lamb said Thursday's decision was
welcome news to people running cricket in England.
	   ``We can now be more confident about securing investment from
television to raise standards of skills and facilities around the
country,'' he said.
	   Ian Botham, former England captain and one of the most
well-known figures in the game, said the government's decision to
open up broadcasting rights to test matches was a good one.
	   ``This is great news for cricket and for all those who really
care about the game,'' he said.
	   ``If English cricket is to reclaim its place at the top of the
tree, then investment is needed at all levels of the game.''

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders car.

Eds: UPDATES with two Serbs reportedly found shot dead in their
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, met the province's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday.
	   Arriving from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci, an
Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence. The American envoy was then to see the
Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, then
travel to Athens, Greece.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for some Serbian security forces to
withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to resume
talks over the political future of the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. Kosovo is part of Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and other nations fear that violence in Kosovo
could flare into a wider Balkan war.
	   Rugova got a stern reminder from NATO this week that no foreign
power supports the Albanians' quest for independence, and that the
best option is to talk with the Serbs about regaining or expanding
the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   The province has been under virtual martial law ever since, with
hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanians _ dying in periodic
clashes.
	   More than 300 have been killed since March, when Serbian police
began a crackdown against militant separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a shadowy group that emerged in 1996 and has
gained ground rapidly among Kosovo Albanians weary of Serbian
repression and Rugova's peaceful tactics.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of the rugged
province.
	   On Friday, the Serbs' Media Center reported that two Serbs had
been found shot dead in their car in northwest Kosovo, reportedly
gunned down in an ambush.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom in southern Lebanon Friday, completing a
swap between the two foes.
	   Three buses bearing signs of the International Committee of the
Red Cross arrived at a Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous on
the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon at 1:00
p.m. (1000GMT).
	   Troops kept crowds of relatives and well wishers about a hundred
meters (yards) down the road.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel handed 60 Lebanese prisoners over to the
Red Cross in the second stage of a deal between Lebanon and Israel.
Four chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone and one
decided to stay in Israel, Lebanese media quoted Red Cross
officials as saying.
	   On Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier
for the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Some of the prisoners have been held for as long as 14 years and
most were held without trial.
	   Ten of the prisoners had been held in Israeli jails.
	   Fifty were held in the Khiam detention camp in the occupied zone
in southern Lebanon.
	   The two groups headed by bus through winding mountain roads to
Kfar Falous, about 12 kilometers (eight miles) east of the southern
provincial capital of Sidon, where they were met by Lebanese
soldiers.
	   At Kfar Falous, several thousand men, women and children had
gathered to wait for them. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
and Amal guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist
Party and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along
the road, reflecting the makeup of those to be released.

Asian stock markets close mixed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with both share prices and the Japanese yen rising in Tokyo
on news of a merger between Japan's two largest banks.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rebounded from
earlier losses to close up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent, at
15,210.04. On Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04 points, or
0.06 percent.
	   Shares rose after Japan's state-run NHK television said ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank will merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking as
early as next April.
	   Analysts praised the reported merger as a sign Japan may allow
market forces to weed out weaker banks _ exactly the sort of tough
medicine they say the country needs to bolster its overall
financial system.
	   The report also sparked a late rally by the yen, which rebounded
from an intraday low of 143.00 yen to the dollar to trade as high
as 141.17 yen.
	   The dollar was quoted at 141.28 yen in late afternoon trading,
up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York
rate of 142.30 yen overnight.
	   Singapore shares also closed mostly higher, boosted by property
stocks following unconfirmed rumors that off-budget measures to be
announced Monday would revive the beleaguered property market,
dealers said.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index rose 15.76 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 1,085.42.
	   Malaysian share prices closed lower, hurt by the fragility of
Asian currencies, including a substantial fall in the value of the
Malaysian ringgit.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 2.75
points, or 0.6 percent, to 445.67.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 4.0550 ringgit late in the
day, compared with 3.9710 late Thursday.
	   Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed generally lower on
profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 57.97 points, or 0.7 percent, to 8,607.86. On Thursday, the
index had surged 369.06 points, or 4.4 percent.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by
profit-taking. The market's Weighted Price Index fell 40.68 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 7,681.96.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The NZSE-40
Capital Index rose 13.24 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,973.24.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected issues rose 14.34 points, or 0.8
percent, to 1,723.37.
	   SYDNEY: Share prices closed higher as fund managers scrambled
for stocks ahead of the end of the Australian financial year on
June 30. The All Ordinaries Index rose 17.9 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 2,609.9.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on jitters over the possibility
of the shutdown of several banks as the country's financial sector
undergoes restructuring. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
2.3 points, or 0.6 percent, to 298.54.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed as bargain hunting just
overcame selling pressure amid jitters over weakness in the
Japanese yen. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index gained 0.89
point, or 0.3 percent, to 2,64.98.
	   JAKARTA: The market's key index rose on arbitrage-related
buying. The Composite Index rose 2.060 points, or 0.4 percent, to
430.870.

Belarus president say diplomats can return only with permission 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Diplomats from seven countries who left
Belarus over a housing dispute will be allowed to return to Minsk
``only with the permission of the Belarusian authorities,'' Belarus
president Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.
	   Before boarding a plane for Switzerland, Lukashenko told Belarus
state television that he had offered to meet the ambassadors to
discuss the dispute, but they refused, saying they needed to
consult with their governments.
	   ``Let them consult, but they should know they can come back only
with our permission,'' he said.
	   Lukashenko's government has been trying for weeks to oust the
ambassadors from their homes on the wooded outskirts of Minsk.
Officials say that the houses need urgent sewer and plumbing
repairs, and Lukashenko says the compound belongs to him.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus this week to consult with
their governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish
ambassadors have also been recalled home.
	   The countries maintain that Lukashenko's orders violate
international law, which designates ambassadors' home as the
territory of their home countries. The host country must ask
permission to enter and cannot demand that residents leave.
	   Lukashenko called the diplomats' decision to leave a ``political
maneuver.''
	   ``And there will be more maneuvers the closer parliamentary and
presidential elections come,'' he said.

Angry youths protest slaying of popular Algerian singer with police, funeral Sunday, trims.

Eds: LEDES with angry Berber youths smashing windows, minor clashes

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Groups of Berber youths smashed windows
and damaged cars in angry protests Friday, after the slaying of
popular Algerian singer Lounes Matoub.
	   Matoub, 42, was killed Thursday near his Berber hometown. He was
an outspoken critic of this North African country's violent
six-year insurgency. He had just returned from exile after
surviving a kidnapping by Muslim militants.
	   Youths took to the streets of several towns in the region of
Kabylie, eastern Algeria, and many clashed with police. No arrests
were reported.
	   Thousands of people arrived in the Berber regional capital of
Tizi-Ouzou overnight to pay their respects to Matoub. His funeral
will take place Sunday.
	   In a brief statement Thursday, Algeria's security forces said
the singer had been ``cowardly assassinated'' and shot several
times.
	   Matoub, who like other Berbers fiercely criticized both the
military-backed government and Islamic militants, was killed
outside the village of Oued Aissi, near Tizi-Ouzou.
	   It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist during an
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   Witnesses said his wife and two sisters-in-law were also wounded
in the attack and were hospitalized.
	   They said Matoub's car was stopped at a false roadblock, but
that the singer drove on. The assailants then showered the car with
bullets. They said he was shot three times in the head.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Living in exile in France since his 1994 kidnapping, Matoub had
only returned to Algeria this month. The militants have killed
other singers including Cheb Hasni, as well as intellectuals.
	   ``He had the courage to denounce, to speak out,'' Algeria's
best-known singer Cheb Khaled said in a radio interview in France,
where he lives in exile. ``It's not over. ... The situation is
still critical.''
	   ``When you silence a journalist or an artist, you're silencing
the people,'' he added.
	   Malika Matoub, the victim's sister, said in a separate radio
interview that ``his songs will speak for him.''
	   ``They'll never kill him. He'll remain engraved in people's
memories,'' she said. ``He's immortal.''
	   Matoub was kidnapped Sept. 25, 1994, by the Armed Islamic Group,
the insurgency's most violent movement. He was freed two weeks
later with a letter from the group, demanding the Berbers support
the militants.
	   In other violence, security forces killed 18 Muslim militants
and five civilians were slain, according to reports Thursday.
	   A bomb exploded in an Algiers cafe Thursday morning, causing one
slight injury.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government in the
former French colony scrapped second-round parliamentary elections
in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win
the balloting.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton celebrated local
elections as ``a window for all the world to see'' the progress
democracy can bring to China _ after voicing his distress Friday at
dissident arrests he called a backward look by Beijing. His message
of democracy in a humble setting, with schoolchildren waving
bouquets and singing songs, was in stark contrast to the reports of
arrests among Chinese dissidents. And in contrast, too, to his
coming state welcome in the splendor of Tiananmen Square in
Beijing, where Chinese troops bloodily repressed democracy
demonstrators nine years ago.
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, met the province's ethnic Albanian leaders Friday. Arriving
from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci, an Albanian who
spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating Kosovo's
independence. The American envoy was then to see the Kosovo
Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova. Holbrooke is
pushing for some Serbian security forces to withdraw from Kosovo
and for both the Serbs and Albanians to resume talks over the
political future of the province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs nine to one. Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic
in Yugoslavia.
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Election officials began a
painstaking ballot count Friday to determine who among nearly 300
candidates will sit in Northern Ireland's new cross-community
government. The outcome to Thursday's complex election for a
108-seat Assembly will have profound implications for the Belfast
peace agreement, struck in April among eight parties but opposed by
two Protestant parties committed to blocking compromise. An exit
poll indicated that Protestants appeared deeply divided between
supporters and opponents of the accord, which could make the
moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party the largest in
the new assembly.
	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel handed over 60 Lebanese
prisoners to the Red Cross on Friday, and several thousand people
gathered at a crossing point into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon
to await the return of their loved ones. Israel's release of the
prisoners, some of whom have been held for as long as 14 years, is
the second stage of a deal between Lebanon and Israel. On Thursday,
Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier for the bodies
of 40 guerrillas. Lebanese officials said that with Friday's
release, 167 prisoners remain in Khiam or in Israel.
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Astronomers have discovered a planet bigger
than Jupiter just 15 light years from Earth, apparently a huge ball
of gas with a surface temperature well below zero. Geoffrey Marcy,
who heads a four-member team of San Francisco State researchers,
announced the discovery this week at a scientific symposium in
Canada. The finding was confirmed by a separate team in
Switzerland. The group found the planet using the Keck I telescope
in Hawaii. Its huge mass _ at least 1.9 times bigger than Jupiter's
_ was detected by a wobble in the motion of a nearby star, not by
direct visualization.

China's top religion official: No one in jail for beliefs 
</HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Friday that none of the 30 jailed
religious leaders that visiting U.S. clerics asked in February to
be released was being held because of their beliefs.
	   ``While we protect freedom of religious belief, we do not allow
anyone to use religion to disrupt normal public order,'' said Ye
Xiaowen, a sociologist and director of the State Administration for
Religious Affairs.
	   Religion is expected to come up during the current visit of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, who meets with President Jiang Zemin in
Beijing this weekend. Clinton said before the trip that he would
speak out about religious freedom and autonomy for Tibet.
	   The pre-summit Chinese briefing on Friday, complete with slides,
appeared designed to preempt and ward off Clinton's expected
criticisms.
	   Three U.S. religious leaders gave a list of jailed Catholic,
Protestant and Buddhist leaders to Ye during a visit at the
government's invitation in February.
	   The three were Rabbi Arthur Schneier of New York, Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick of Newark, New Jersey, and Don Argue, president
of National Association of Evangelicals.
	   Ye said he worked hard to provide them with a quick response.
Some of the names on the list were fictitious, and some were not
actually in detention, he said.
	   Those in prison were there ``because they committed crimes, not
because they are religious believers,'' Ye said.
	   Yet allegations of repression continue.
	   A bishop of the underground Roman Catholic Church, Julias Jia
Zhiguo of Zhengding, Hebei, 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of
Beijing, was arrested ``in the last few days,'' an advocacy group
for the church, the Cardinal Kung Foundation, said in a statement
Friday.
	   Beijing insists that Catholics run their own church in China
instead of following the orders of the pope in such matters as the
selection of bishops. Those who refuse worship in underground
churches the government views as illegal.
	   Ye asserted China accepts international principles on protection
of religious freedom, but added that it had a right to take its own
conditions into account.
	   China's constitution protects ``normal religious activity,'' but
leaves ``normal'' open to interpretation.
	   On Tibet, Ye said Tibetans had no human rights in the ``darkest
and most savage system of serfdom'' under the rule of the Dalai
Lama before China entered Tibet in 1950. Now they benefit from
economic development and ``enjoy to the full human rights,'' Ye
said.
	   He condemned what he called ``fabrications and nonsense'' in the
Hollywood films ``Kundun'' and ``Seven Years in Tibet.''
	   Ye also reiterated the government's condemnation of the Dalai
Lama as a political leader trying to gain independence for Tibet,
accusing him of trying to destroy Buddhism, Tibet and China.
	   ``If he continues what he's doing, he'll meet with retribution
according to Buddhist scriptures,'' the government official said.
	   The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, has
said he seeks cultural autonomy for Tibet, not independence.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is not allowing Farouk Kaddoumi, a top
PLO official and opponent of the Mideast peace agreements, to visit
the autonomous Palestinian areas, a government official said
Friday.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the decision to bar Kaddoumi was not final and that
Israel might reconsider in the future.
	   Earlier this week, the Palestinian Authority asked Israel to
approve a visit by Kaddoumi.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison office with the
Palestinians, said Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1996, when the Palestine National
Council met in the Gaza Strip.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, boycotted the PNC session.

Government warning: don't buy Viagra without a prescription 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government warned Britons Friday not to buy
the male potency drug Viagra over the Internet or through other
unofficial channels.
	   ``Viagra is an unlicensed medicinal product in the (United
Kingdom) and can only be sold or supplied to an individual patient
via a prescription by a doctor,'' the Department of Health said.
	   ``Viagra is a powerful medicinal product and should only be used
in accordance with the directions of a doctor. People run very real
risks with their health if they obtain it from other sources such
as mail order or the Internet, and take it without the direction of
a doctor,'' it said/
	   Viagra is not licensed in any of the 15 European Union nations,
but the drug is being reviewed by the European Medicines Evaluation
Agency.
	   Besides potential vision and headache problems, Viagra's side
effects include an incompatibility with some heart drugs.
	   In the United States, 16 men have died after taking the drug
since it was put on the market earlier this year. An Israeli man
also died after taking Viagra.

Estrada to advise Imelda Marcos to bury husband in hometown instead of heroes' cemetery

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Friday he will ask the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos to bury
her husband's remains in his northern Philippine hometown to defuse
an emotional storm over plans to inter him in a heroes' cemetery.
	   On Thursday, former first lady Imelda Marcos bowed to widespread
opposition and said she would indefinitely postpone the plan.
	   Estrada said he would urge Mrs. Marcos and her family to follow
the advice of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines,
which has suggested that Marcos be buried in his hometown of Batac.
	   ``I hope and pray that they listen and heed the advice of the
CBCP. That will take the burden off of me,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   Estrada added, however, that it is the Marcos family's right to
insist on burying the former strongman at the Heroes' Cemetery in
metropolitan Manila because there is no law prohibiting Marcos from
being buried there.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, had earlier approved plans
for Marcos to be buried July 11 at the Heroes' Cemetery. He said
Friday he did not expect the decision to explode into an emotional
issue that is dividing Filipinos.
	   ``I did not realize (the extent of the opposition), but at the
same time I am not a bit worried because I am on the side of the
law,'' he said.
	   ``It's very petty,'' he said of the controversy. ``There are
more serious problems to concentrate on instead of the remains of
one person.''
	   More than 100 members of a recently formed ``Marcos is No Hero''
movement rallied Friday near the Malacanang presidential palace to
urge the government to totally scrap the plan to bury Marcos at the
Heroes' Cemetery. In suburban Quezon City, hundreds of students
also linked arms in a protest against the burial plans.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986. He died
in exile in Hawaii three years later but his body was not allowed
to return to the Philippines until September 1993. Since then it
has been kept in a glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in
Batac in Ilocos Norte province, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
north of Manila.
	   Both President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino,
refused to let Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing conflicts
between the former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Ramos ordered a halt Tuesday to construction of Marcos' grave at
the cemetery for the week remaining in his term.
	   Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial went
ahead. Other critics said they plan to seek a court injunction
against the burial, and Estrada said Thursday he would wait for a
court ruling.

Striking coal miners block traffic in downtown Kiev

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of striking Ukrainian miners blocked
Kiev's main street Friday, accusing the government of failing to
pay their overdue wages and violating agreements with the workers.
	   The protesters sat on the pavement of Khreshchatik street,
banging their helmets in a rhythm that has become common in the
Ukrainian capital in recent weeks.
	   Police stood by but did not intervene in the demonstration,
which created traffic jams across central Kiev.
	   ``This action is a gesture of despair,'' said Volodymyr
Martynov, a leader of the Coal Industry Workers' Union, the largest
miners' group.
	   The former Soviet republic's coal industry is plagued by lack of
funds and a huge backlog in overdue wages which has led to
scattered strikes that began last month and still continue at some
mines.
	   Miners at one company in eastern Ukraine staged a march to Kiev
and besieged government buildings earlier this month, but returned
to their homes when some money was paid.
	   Friday protesters accused the government of violating a general
agreement with the coal workers signed in late May and denounced
plans to close old mines and purchase cheap coal abroad.
	   The Verhkovna Rada, or parliament, planned to debate industry
problems on Friday, while union leaders were meeting with premier
Valery Pustovoitenko.
	   Besides funding problems, Ukraine's mines are known for outdated
equipment and accidents caused by poor safety measures.
	   The pattern continued this week with three more miners killed in
job accidents in eastern Ukraine, according to the Emergency
Situations Ministry. The deaths Wednesday brought the total of coal
industry fatalities to about 180 this year.

New rebel group abducts 15 bus passengers; burns bus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A new rebel group calling itself the
Uganda National Rescue Front II ambushed a bus, made off with 15
passengers and set the vehicle ablaze, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The bus, owned by a member of parliament from Arua near the
border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was ambushed
Wednesday about 360 kilometers (223 miles) from Kampala, the
government-owned New Vision reported.
	   The newspaper said the rebels also robbed the passengers of cash
and valuables. The bus plies the road between Arua to Moyo, near
the border with Sudan on the west bank of the White Nile River.
	   The NRFII is made up of members of the former Uganda National
Rescue Front, a rebel group defeated by government troops two years
ago.
	   The ambush occurred near a mosque from which the rebels recently
abducted 50 Muslims, New Vision said. The newspaper said the rebels
have so far abducted about 200 people, including children, in
Aringa and Obongi counties in Arua district.
	   The newspaper said the rebels have their base near Juba in
southern Sudan.
	   The government is fighting at least two other rebel groups in
western and northern Uganda. Both have stepped up abductions in
recent weeks _ mostly of boys and girls from boarding schools.

German far-right party fined for violating donor laws 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A phony address listed on disclosure forms
for a French donor will cost the far-right German People's Union
about 549,000 marks (dlrs 305,000), parliament said Friday.
	   Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said the People's Union
correctly listed Jacques de Mathan as having donated about 274,500
marks in 1995, but gave a false address for him.
	   German law requires parties to publish the name and address of
anyone who donates more than 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,000).
	   The anti-foreigner party said it wanted to protect the donor
from possible attacks.
	   Suessmuth said, however, that the law does not allow for
providing a false address for any reason. The fine is twice the
donation, as provided for under German party financing laws.
	   Party spokesman Bernd Droese said the People's Union would
challenge the fine in court.
	   The extremist party recently took a surprising 13 percent of the
vote in elections in a depressed eastern German state, and hopes to
win its first seats in the federal parliament this September.

Nine years on, Tiananmen's ghosts still haunt survivors

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ For those who were there when Chinese soldiers
killed freedom on Tiananmen Square, the sounds, sights and feelings
have never faded.
	   Nine years later, the bullet holes from that dark night have
long been filled in, the tank tracks erased, the handbills calling
for democracy scrubbed off walls and lampposts.
	   But Tiananmen's ghosts remain. For many, the square evokes a sea
of memories as vivid as the red flags and banners carried by
student protesters in 1989.
	   For some, it is the cackle of bullets that sounded deceptively
like the joy-filled pop of firecrackers at Chinese New Year.
	   Others can't see a flatbed tricycle without recalling the sound
of their rusty chains squeaking furiously as they ferried the dead,
dying and wounded to hospitals. The tricycles, used to haul goods,
carried a bloody human cargo that night.
	   Labor activist Han Dongfang, who founded a short-lived free
trade union on the square, still can picture bullets streaking pink
ribbons across the night sky.
	   ``It was so beautiful, but so scary,'' said Han, who was caught
in the wave of arrests that followed the crackdown and jailed for
22 months without trial.
	   ``I can never forget it. Lines, in every direction. A really
amazing color in the dark sky,'' he said.
	   Veteran democracy activist Ren Wanding, imprisoned for seven
years _ his second spell in jail for pro-democracy activities _
remembers the metallic grate of ``tanks going back and forth on the
square.''
	   ``Every time I go past Tiananmen I remember that night,'' he
said. ``Sometimes I stop, walk about, think back.''
	   Wang Youcai, a student leader in 1989 jailed for 2 years, 3
months, recalls ``the endless sound of gunfire ... going around in
my head.''
	   ``Sometimes, I don't want to think back,'' he said. ``It's too
painful.''
	   Since the protests, security on the vast square has been tight.
Green-uniformed officers patrol its dusty gray paving, backed by
plainclothes police whose cover often is blown by the crackling
walkie-talkies tucked in their waistbands.
	   The needle-shaped Monument to the People's Heroes in the
square's center _ which student protesters used as their
headquarters in 1989 _ has been sealed off to the public.
	   Yet, the square's hustle and bustle goes on. Crowds gather to
watch soldiers hoist and lower China's five-starred red flag every
morning and evening. Kite-flyers ride the square's light breezes,
families revel in its space, and tourists from all over China make
a point of having their pictures taken in front of a giant portrait
of revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, who gazes serenely over the
plaza.
	   Han, the labor activist who now lives in exile in Hong Kong,
said he tries not to dwell too much on his terrible memories of the
bloodshed in 1989 because ``otherwise, you'll go crazy.''
	   But it's not easy. Sometimes, Han said, a stranger's face or a
sight in the street can trigger recollections of people or events
on the square, and ``suddenly, you remember something.''
	   ``For me, it's helicopters,'' said Robin Munro, a human rights
worker. Helicopters swooped over protesters dropping leaflets May
20, 1989, when the government declared martial law.
	   Even now, ``that noise. Every time I hear the slow `swoosh,' I
just immediately think of Tiananmen Square,'' said Munro, who
witnessed the protests through to their bloody end and was one of
the last foreigners to leave the square when troops attacked June
3-4.
	   The soldiers, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers,
marched in from Beijing's outskirts, firing on crowds as they
headed for the square in the city's heart. Hundreds, some say
thousands, were killed. Reporters spoke of hospitals looking like
abattoirs, with bodies on benches, beds and blood-soaked mattress
on the floor.
	   In the small hours of June 4, with the crackdown still underway,
Munro visited medical tents in the shadow of a Statue of Liberty
look-alike erected by protesters on the square and later demolished
by the army.
	   Volunteer doctors were ``trying to tend to horribly injured
people,'' he said. ``One guy had the side of his head blown off. It
was clear that he wasn't going to make it.''
	   Finally, as dawn began to break, the few hundred students left
on the square began filing out in ranks, clutching ragged banners,
some still shouting slogans. Munro tried to comfort a woman who was
crying uncontrollably.
	   ``As she went past, I said this isn't a defeat,'' Munro said.
``She said, `Yes, it is a victory. We really did everything we
could.'''

Serbs allow U.N. aid agency access to refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Friday Serbian
security forces had allowed it access to hundreds of refugees in
conflict-hit parts of the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   UNHCR says it previously has been prevented by the Serb
authorities from reaching areas of the province where it suspects
large numbers of refugees are camped out, waiting to cross over the
border into Albania.
	   On Thursday, however, an agency aid convoy was allowed to pass
through security lines and was led by Kosovo rebels to an area near
the village of Junik, where some 600 people are living, said UNHCR
spokesman Kris Janowski in Geneva.
	   Janowski said the refugees were mostly children, women and
elderly ``in a pretty bad physical shape.''
	   The refugees were ``roughing it'' and living in makeshift
shelters, said Janowski.
	   The children, who made up about one third of the refugees,
appeared very exhausted and some were quite sick, he said.
	   ``The bottom line is that they are afraid to go back to areas
controlled by the Serbian security forces,'' said Janowski.
	   Some of the villages along Kosovo's border with Albania were
still being targeted by sporadic fire, Janowski said. Junik is one
of the biggest villages still controlled by the
independence-seeking Kosovo Liberation Army along the border.
	   For weeks, Serbs trying to wipe out the KLA have targeted the
border communities, aiming to seal off the secessionist province
and prevent an influx of new arms and fighters.
	   The convoy from Pristina to Junik carried five tons of wheat
flour provided by the World Food Program and one half ton of soap
by the UNHCR, staff at the Belgrade office of the refugee agency
said.
	   The aid has been given to the Mother Teresa aid organization for
distribution to the refugees.
	   This was the first time such assistance had reached the area
since the outbreak of the conflict in this particular region of the
province at the end of May, Janowski said.
	   ``We need access on a regular basis both from the Serbian
authorities and from the other side,'' he said.
	   ``The very fact that the Serbian authorities allowed us to go to
that area and visit those people is progress in itself.''

Japan's banks burdened with nearly 30 trillion yen in bad loans 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Japan-Troubled Bank
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese commercial banks were saddled with more
than 29.5 trillion yen (dlrs 209 billion) in bad loans at the end
of the fiscal year that ended March 31, Japan's banking federation
said Friday.
	   The soured loans held by the association's 146 member banks
represented 5.47 percent of their total loans, the Federation of
Bankers Association of Japan said in a report.
	   Many of the bad loans are left over from the collapse of the
speculative real estate bubble of the 1980s.
	   The bad loan burden was calculated using stricter accounting
standards introduced for fiscal 1997. The new guidelines included
restructured loans and loans that have been delinquent for more
than three months.
	   Under the old standards, the total amount of bad debts held by
Japan's banks fell from about 23.3 trillion yen (dlrs 165 billion)
in fiscal 1996 to about 20.9 trillion yen (dlrs 148 billion) in
fiscal 1997, the federation said.
	   However, the amount of unrecoverable loans to bankrupt companies
rose 41 percent in the same period from 4.9 trillion yen (dlrs 34
billion) to 6.8 trillion yen (dlrs 48 billion).
	   The data come amid reports that Japan's troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank, saddled with 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion), will
merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp.
	   Japan's government is under pressure both at home and abroad to
address the financial system's bad loan problem _ a step experts
say is vital to encourage banks to start lending more and help spur
economic growth.
	   The government recently announced it will set up a ``bridge
bank'' to absorb the bad loans of failed financial institutions and
to lend money to healthy borrowers from those companies.
	   The federation also said Japanese banks' net business profits
fell 14.3 percent in fiscal 1997 to 5.4 trillion yen (dlrs 38
billion).

World Cup: Italy and Norway battle for quarterfinal berth 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Italy tests its newly discovered
offensive punch against Norway's tough defense in the first battle
for a quarterfinal berth.
	   The match at Stade Velodrome on Saturday afternoon (1430 GMT)
begins the knockout second phase of the World Cup, in which lapses
mean elimination. The winner will play either France or Paraguay in
the quarterfinals at Saint-Denis next Friday.
	   Twice a winner against the Norwegians in previous World Cup
matches, Italy is aiming to cause Norway's second-consecutive
elimination, but it's meeting a better team than in 1994.
	   ``We are prepared to play a tough team, physically very strong,
accustomed to defend itself with 10 players and launch sudden,
dangerous counterattacks,'' Italy's coach Cesare Maldini said. ``We
must overcome a difficult hurdle.''
	   Norway coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said he was looking ahead,
not to the past, after leading Norway to its first-ever
qualification for the second round of the World Cup.
	   ``I believe we have a 50 percent chance of reaching the
quarters. I expect Italy to take the initiative and attack. We will
be there waiting for them and ready to strike back,'' Olsen said.
	   The Norwegian team, including several players from the English
Premier League, is especially dangerous in aerial play. This may
ring an alarm bell for the Italian defense which has been allowing
goals on high crosses _ two by Chile and one in a previous warmup
against Sweden.
	   Maldini was pondering the best tactic for overcoming the
physical Norwegians without taking undue risks.
	   He suggested a continuation of the successful rotation between
team stars Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio, with
top-scoring striker Christian Vieri leading the attack.
	   Vieri, a strongly-built center forward, scored four goals in
three matches to boost Italy's first-round total to seven. This is
Italy's highest scoring rate since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina,
when the team had six goals in the three first games.
	   Italy was also expected to field a reinforced midfield, possibly
benching a defender in view of Norway's cautious 4-5-1 formation.
	   Chelsea's striker Tore Andre Flo is Norway's only forward. He
used his height and mobility to cause big problems for defending
champion Brazil in Tuesday's Group A match.
	   Flo scored one goal and earned the penalty which gave his team a
last-minute 2-1 victory and qualification for the second round.
	   Italian players are especially impressed with Norway's unbeaten
streak of 17 matches, and with the two wins in a year over Brazil.
Tuesday's World Cup upset followed Norway's 4-2 victory in an
exhibition game last year.
	   ``Its consecutive wins against Brazil are alarming,'' said
Baggio. ``Norway is a team which must not be underestimated. They
are physically strong and determined.''
	   Baggio, who scored two goals in the first round, played only a
little of the match against Norway at the '94 World Cup in the
United States. He was taken off by then-coach Arrigo Sacchi to make
room for No. 2 goalie Luca Marcheggiani, following the expulsion of
starting keeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Playing 10 against 11, Italy still won 1-0 and moved to the
quarterfinals on its way to the final.
	   In 1938 in France, Italy beat Norway 2-1 in the first round
before clinching the second of its three world titles.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom in southern Lebanon Friday, completing a
swap between the two foes.
	   Three buses bearing signs of the International Committee of the
Red Cross arrived at a Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous on
the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon at 1:00
p.m. (1000GMT).
	   Troops kept crowds of relatives and well wishers about a hundred
meters (yards) down the road.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel handed 60 Lebanese prisoners over to the
Red Cross in the second stage of a deal between Lebanon and Israel.
Four chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone and one
decided to stay in Israel, Lebanese media quoted Red Cross
officials as saying.
	   On Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier
for the bodies of 40 guerrillas. Some of the prisoners have been
held for as long as 14 years and most were held without trial.
	   Ten of the prisoners had been held in Israeli jails. Fifty were
held in the Khiam detention camp in the occupied zone in southern
Lebanon.
	   The two groups headed by bus through winding mountain roads to
Kfar Falous, about 12 kilometers (eight miles) east of the southern
provincial capital of Sidon, where they were met by Lebanese
soldiers.
	   At Kfar Falous, several thousand men, women and children had
gathered to wait for them. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
and Amal guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist
Party and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along
the road, reflecting the politics of those to be released.

	   BAFATA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ A rusting single-action rifle at
his side, a brown militia man's cap on his head, an aging guerrilla
peers out from a concrete bunker.
	   Gazing across peanut fields and off into the horizon, he's a
``camarada,'' or comrade, from Guinea-Bissau's 1960s independence
war who has been pressed back into service in this African
country's newest conflict. A romantic filled with the rhetoric of
Cuban hero Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, he's back in his element.
	   Decades ago, Portuguese troops were under siege in the capital
Bissau while peasant guerrillas ruled the countryside. Today, a
similar scenario is shaping up with the country's unpopular
president under fire in this brief and tragic war.
	   In the rice and peanut fields, in sleepy provincial towns, the
``camaradas'' are riding again.
	   With Guinea-Bissau's army split between loyalist and rebellious
forces in a capital battered with daily artillery fire, the bulk of
the soldiers from both sides are camped out in or around the city.
	   In the countryside, though, security, propaganda and
revolutionary rhetoric are left to the ``camaradas.''
	   Across the country, from the border with Senegal to the Atlantic
coast, aging guerrillas are coming out of retirement this time
against their own president, Joao Bernardo Vieira, himself a
veteran and hero.
	   Mamading Tcham, a 64-year-old veteran of the independence war,
says he's ready to fight again.
	   ``What we had at the time of war was suffering but we also had
happiness to be free,'' he says, shuffling to his feet with a
timeworn Russian-made assault rifle in his hand.
	   In rubber flip-flop sandals and straw sun hat, Tcham says all
the men in his former militia regiment have volunteered to fight.
	   ``Nino isn't with the people anymore,'' he says, using Vieira's
nickname. ``Brother, we just need some justice.''
	   A part-time security guard, Tcham says he has rejoined the
struggle for his country _ a struggle that first ended in 1975 when
Guinea-Bissau won its independence from Portugal after 14 years of
war.
	   Now he says, the people must get rid of Vieira, who many accuse
of widespread corruption and mismanagement.
	   Tcham _ known by his guerrilla nickname ``little 49'' _ says he
remembers well the struggle against the Portuguese and insists he's
able and willing to head back into the forests.
	   Vieira, a senior commander with the African Party for
Independence in Guinea and Cape Verde, was a vanguard member of the
revolution and a chosen favorite to lead the country after
independence.
	   He came to power in 1980, when then-President Luiz Cabral _ from
the nearby island of Cape Verde _ was assassinated during a coup.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A methane explosion in an abandoned coal mine
shaft killed one child and injured six others near the Pacific port
city of Vladivostok on Friday, a news agency reported.
	   The children, aged eight to 12, were playing in the ventilator
shaft of the derelict mine in the city of Artyom when the explosion
occurred.
	   Flying debris from concrete blocks in the mine caused most of
their injuries, the Interfax news agency reported, citing regional
law enforcement officials.
	   Two children were in critical condition, and four others were
hospitalized with broken bones and other serious wounds, the news
agency said.
	   A criminal inquiry into the incident has been opened.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of pilots at Philippine
Airlines called off a three-week strike and attempted to return to
work Friday but were rejected by management, who said they remain
fired for having ignored a back-to-work order.
	   The pilots, wearing their uniforms, marched to Manila's airport
to report for work but instead were offered forms by the airline to
apply as new employees.
	   ``They are no longer working for the company,'' PAL executive
vice president Manolo Aquino said. ``They have signified their
intention to resign by not complying with the return-to-work
order.''
	   The 625-member pilots' union refused the application forms and
said it would file a claim of illegal lockout with the labor
department.
	   The pilots' union also plans to ask the labor department to
issue a restraining order prohibiting management from hiring new
pilots.
	   The union said it decided to end the strike because its legal
counsel had finally received late Thursday the back-to-work order,
which was issued more than two weeks ago by the labor department.
	   A back-to-work order normally takes effect when it is served to
the union's legal counsel. But the counsel repeatedly foiled the
labor department's attempts to deliver the document, and the
secretary of labor has ruled that the order was effectively
conveyed instead in meetings with union officials.
	   PAL earlier dismissed the strikers for failing to meet the
deadline specified in the order, June 9.
	   PAL also has announced a drastic reduction of operations to cope
with financial problems worsened by the strike. Under the reduced
operations the airline says it needs only 200 pilots.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said the strike
``pushed PAL into the corner.''
	   ``The die has been cast,'' Zapanta said. Because of the strike,
``the market is no longer conducive to return to what we were
before. It has become a losing proposition.''
	   Union spokesman Florendo Umali said the pilots ``returned on
bended knees'' and the management rebuff has pushed them to ``use
all available legal means to fight.''
	   Last week, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers in
an effort to scale down its operations and stave off more losses,
causing the airline's flight attendants and ground personnel to
threaten to strike as well.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an airline
plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of service
or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   PAL says the pilots' strike has worsened financial problems
caused by Asia's currency crisis and has pushed it to the brink of
closure because of more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in
lost revenue.
	   The airline has sought a suspension of payments on about dlrs 2
billion in loans owed to about 1,000 foreign and local banks and
aircraft lessors because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   PAL said more personnel may be laid off under the rehabilitation
plan, which calls for a leaner work force, disposal of 40 out of 54
planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its routes and sale
of some subsidiaries.

Philippine peso falls sharply on weak yen; stocks end mixed 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell sharply
against the dollar Friday, bogged down by negative sentiment toward
regional currencies caused by a further weakening of the Japanese
yen.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, ended trading mixed as the regional currency
jitters continued to undermine investor confidence.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 14.34 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 1,723.37, following Thursday's 3.85-point fall.
	   Decliners, however, outnumbered advancers 51 to 44, while 48
issues were unchanged, as desires by investors to unload their
holdings because of Asia's currency problems outweighed buying
interest, traders said.
	   The yen's continued fall against the dollar has triggered a new
wave of weakness in other Asian currencies.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities
Inc., said buying activity was a mixture of bargain-hunting and
window-dressing as the month of June nears its end.
	   He said the market is expected to trade within a tight range as
long as volatility in Asian currency markets persists.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 42.091 pesos for the
day, compared to Thursday's 41.503 pesos.
	   The dollar hit an intra-day high of 42.350 pesos and was last
traded at 41.970 pesos.
	   Dealers said the peso's weakness had more to do with regional
currency woes than heavy demand for the U.S. currency.

Red Cross releases third photo album of missing children
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hoping to reunite families, the Red Cross
on Friday released a third album of photos of children separated
from their parents when they were refugees in neighboring
countries.
	   The Red Cross has put out two other photo albums since nearly a
million Hutu refugees returned to Rwanda in November 1996, mostly
from what was then eastern Zaire.
	   Thousands of children were separated from their families during
the return.
	   Jean Wenker, coordinator of the Red Cross tracing program in
Rwanda, said of the 1,850 unaccompanied children who were too young
or too traumatized to explain where they were from, 449 have been
reunited with their families since the photo distribution began.
	   ``Since the mass repatriation, we found some kids too young to
give us the details we need,'' Wenker said. ``So we started in
November 1996 to take pictures of them.''
	   Larger than those released last year, the third album contains
1,000 photographs, bringing the total of photographs published to
1,655, Wenker said.
	   The album will be distributed to aid agencies and government
offices throughout Rwanda.
	   The children in the albums are mostly Hutu. Their families were
part of the nearly 2 million Rwandans who fled their country when
Tutsi rebels took control in July 1994, ending the Hutu-government
orchestrated genocide of Rwandan Tutsis. More than 500,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus were killed during the 90-day slaughter.
	   Tutsi-backed rebels dispersed the refugee camps when they swept
through eastern Zaire _ now Congo _ in late 1996.
	   The refugees who did not return to Rwanda fled deeper into
Zaire. Families were separated, and hundreds of children were
discovered unaccompanied in the forests.
	   ``It's really to give hope again to the parents that some of
those very young children who were lost in the former Zaire managed
to survive,'' Wenker said.
	   ``We humanitarian organizations can provide food, water
accommodation to people, and that's okay for the first two or three
days,'' Wenker added. ``But after that, people are separated from
their families, they won't even eat or sleep.''

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The former chief of police in Poland, who
resigned in January after only a year in office, has been found
shot to death outside his apartment, police said Friday.
	   The body of Marek Papala, 39, was found in his car, parked near
his Warsaw apartment, said Slawomir Cisowski, spokesman at the
general police headquarters. He had been shot in the head late
Thursday.
	   Cisowski refused to comment on a possible motive, but said a
special investigating team has been appointed and a 15,000 zloty
(dlrs 4,400) reward posted for information about the crime.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek promised that the government will
make every effort to find those responsible for the shooting, which
he called ``very depressing.''
	   Leszek Miller, a former interior minister who had worked with
Papala, suggested the shooting may have been vengeance by a
criminal gang dealing in drugs, stolen cars or counterfeit money.
Papala had led police actions against such gangs.
	   Papala had served as Poland's police chief from January 1997
until Jan. 29. Although he resigned without giving any reasons,
Papala had been faulted for inadequate security during sports
events and a lack of success in combating organized crime, which
has burgeoned since Poland launched democratic reforms in 1989.

Russian markets fall despite IMF decision to release loan installment recess, Nazarbayev comment. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with market figures in 4th graf, parliament may delay
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy.
	   But investors apparently disagreed, and the stock market opened
sharply lower with traders citing fears that an IMF bailout is
moving too slowly.
	   ``Its a very weak market, but I would not say it is panic
selling yet,'' said Steve Malloy of Credit Suisse First Boston in
Moscow.
	   The Russian Trading System index dropped 4 percent in early
trading, standing at 165.80 at midday, down from Thursday's close
of 172.57.
	   The markets have been keeping a close eye on Russia's talks with
the IMF over disbursement of its current dlrs 9.2 billion loan and
negotiations over a new loan the government hopes will top dlrs 10
billion.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's liaison
with international lenders, praised the IMF's decision on Thursday
to release the delayed dlrs 670 million installment as ``quite
natural and logical.''
	   ``It is important in principle that IMF board members ... regard
the ailments of the Russian economy as quite curable,'' Chubais
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The fund decided last week to hold up the installment, saying
Russia had to do more to balance the federal budget and reform key
areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax collection
system.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan to the
IMF earlier this week that officials said appeared to meet many of
the fund's criteria.
	   The new installment means Russia has so far received dlrs 5.8
billion of the existing dlrs 9.2 billion loan.
	   The fund was to begin deliberations Friday on whether to lend
Russia even more money. Russia is seeking an additional dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion loan to help shore up Central Bank
reserves and foster economic recovery.
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy speaker of parliament, said the
legislature may delay its summer recess to debate the government's
austerity plan and vote on the necessary legislation, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency. The summer recess was scheduled to begin
July 3.
	   Traders said investors fear the aid may come too late to prop up
the state finances. They also cited investors' concerns that Russia
will ban trading from offshore tax havens as part of its renewed
efforts to crack down on tax evaders.
	   The country's stock market has lost about half its value since
the beginning of the year, with investors worried about falling oil
prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the Asian
financial crisis.
	   The Kremlin says the new IMF loan is needed to replenish Central
Bank reserves to prevent a devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has postponed a planned visit to the
Soviet republic of Kazakstan originally scheduled for next week,
saying he needs to work on solving the economic crisis.
	   Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who spoke to Yeltsin by
telephone, said the Russian president told him he ``cannot leave
Moscow in such a difficult situation for even half a day,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with both share prices and the Japanese yen rising in Tokyo
on news of a merger between Japan's two largest banks. Tokyo's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rebounded from earlier
losses to close up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent, at 15,210.04. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04 points, or 0.06 percent.
Shares rose after Japan's state-run NHK television said ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank will merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking as
early as next April. Analysts praised the reported merger as a sign
Japan may allow market forces to weed out weaker banks _ exactly
the sort of tough medicine they say the country needs to bolster
its overall financial system. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy. But investors apparently disagreed, and the
stock market opened sharply lower with traders citing fears that an
IMF bailout is moving too slowly. The Russian Trading System index
plummeted 5.4 percent in the first hour of trading, the index
standing at 163.34, down from Thursday's close of 172.57. The
markets have been keeping a close eye on Russia's talks with the
IMF over disbursement of its current dlrs 9.2 billion loan and
negotiations over a new loan the government hopes will top dlrs 10
billion. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of pilots at Philippine
Airlines called off a three-week strike and attempted to return to
work Friday but were rejected by management, who said they remain
fired for having ignored a back-to-work order. The pilots, wearing
their uniforms, marched to Manila's airport to report for work but
instead were offered forms by the airline to apply as new
employees. The 625-member pilots' union refused the application
forms and said it would file a claim of illegal lockout with the
labor department. The pilots' union also plans to ask the labor
department to issue a restraining order prohibiting management from
hiring new pilots. (PHILIPPINES-PHILIPPINE AIRLINES)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Customers in the United States who snapped up
boxes of Windows 98 on Thursday just minutes after midnight could
be taking home a version significantly different from copies of the
same software sold in a few months. As part of its landmark
antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department and 20
states want a judge to force the company to make important changes
to the dlrs 89 software. A hearing is set for Sept. 8 _ just over
10 weeks after Windows 98 made its retail debut. The government
contends that Microsoft, among other things, illegally forces
customers to use its own Internet browser because it is bundled
within Windows. (CYBER-U.S. WINDOWS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A board member of Taiwan's central bank said
Friday he expects the government to lower its 1998 economic growth
forecast to between 5 percent and 6 percent, the third downward
revision this year. Taiwan has cut its original forecast of 6.5
percent twice so far. The current prediction of 6.01 percent is
considered by some economists to be overly optimistic. Speaking at
a foreign exchange conference in Singapore, Central Bank of China
board member Chen Po-chih said he expects Taiwan's healthy
electronics industry to provide much of the growth.

Turkish coalition partner threatens to withdraw 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Angered at not being consulted over an
election deal, a small, center-right party threatened Friday to
withdraw from the governing coalition.
	   Yildirim Aktuna, deputy head of the Democratic Turkey Party,
told reporters the survival of the government would depend on the
government introducing a 40 percent pay hike to civil servants and
fulfilling pledges to bring about a series of legal reforms.
	   The party, which has only 20 seats in the 550-member Parliament,
is unhappy over a deal between Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and an
opposition leader to hold early elections in April. Under the deal,
Yilmaz is to step down in December to allow the formation of a
caretaker government.
	   If the party withdraws its backing, the government would lack a
majority in parliament.
	   But Yilmaz's party played down the threat.
	   ``All of the proposals, except for the 40 percent pay rise, are
already in the government's program,'' said Motherland Party Deputy
Ugur Aksoz.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year in a coalition that also includes
the Democratic Left Party after the military forced the previous,
Islamic-led government out of power.

Leaders hope for summit of substance, not just symbolism 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, in a summit heavy on symbolism, are looking to achieve
some substance, too.
	   Although U.S. officials have publicly sought to hold down
expectations for dramatic agreements, the United States is pressing
China to take more measures to halt the spread of missile
technology and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons _ from the
Indian subcontinent to the Korean Peninsula. It's part of a
``constructive strategic partnership'' the two leaders say they
want.
	   ``China will either be part of the problem or part of the
solution,'' Clinton said this week, laying the ground for the
Saturday summit.
	   ``I have come to China to strengthen the ties between our two
nations,'' Clinton declared before flying to Beijing from Xi'an on
Friday night.
	   For Jiang's part, he said China under his leadership will work
more closely with the United States despite deep differences over
human rights, illustrated with a roundup of dissidents at the
outset of Clinton's visit. Clinton aides said the president would
press the matter in his Saturday summit.
	   ``I think all peace-loving countries should work together,
including the United States and China,'' Jiang said ahead of the
meeting.
	   Jiang went to Washington last October, ending the diplomatic
isolation that began in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
	   Now Clinton, the first American president to visit China since
the crackdown, will be welcomed on the edge of Tiananmen Square
outside the Great Hall of the People, where the Chinese greet their
foreign visitors. Human rights groups and many dissidents have
criticized Clinton for agreeing to be received at Tiananmen, but
the president said it was simply a matter of protocol and he
promised to speak out on human rights frequently while here,
including at a church and at Beijing University.
	   Indeed, the president scolded Chinese authorities Friday for
detaining political dissidents. This is ``not China at its best and
not China looking forward, but looking backward,'' he said.
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, used even
stronger language. ``I think China's human rights record is
terrible,'' Berger said.
	   Clinton, in his meeting with Jiang, was expected to urge Chinese
authorities to release political prisoners _ and not simply exile
them as China did with Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, both now living
in America. Berger, however, cautioned not to expect early results.
	   The president also will urge China to talk directly with Tibet's
exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, on autonomy for the
region.
	   China, on the other hand, sees Taiwan's future as its No. 1
priority and Jiang will urge Clinton to reiterate that the United
States doesn't want to see an independent Taipei government, which
has been the U.S. position since President Nixon made his historic
1972 visit to China. Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province.
The United States provides military aid to Taiwan and urges talks
for a peaceful settlement.
	   Putting aside differences, the two presidents will focus on how
the United States and China can work together to ensure stability
in a region rocked by nuclear tests from India and Pakistan and an
Asian financial crisis. For decades, Beijing helped Islamabad's
nuclear program, but in just the past couple years has agreed to
stop, including halting delivery of missiles to Pakistan. China
also has halted cooperation with Iran.
	   Now, the Clinton administration wants China to stop exporting
all missile-related technology and know-how to Pakistan and Iran as
well by agreeing to adhere to all aspects of the Missile Technology
Control regime.
	   Improved Chinese export controls on chemical and biological
materials to prevent their use as weapons also are on the agenda.
	   Negotiations continued through the eleventh hour, said Stanley
Roth, assistant secretary of state for the region.
	   ``The whole agenda is aimed at strategic cooperation,'' Roth
said.
	   As an example, Clinton and Jiang will discuss pushing harder for
successful four-party peace talks among North and South Korea,
China and the United States, Roth said. China played a key role in
getting North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons program in 1994.
	   China, one of five declared nuclear powers, has 13
nuclear-tipped missiles aimed at U.S. cities and has been
discussing detargeting them as a goodwill gesture, too. Beijing
wants the U.S. government to pledge that it would never be the
first to use nuclear weapons, however, and Berger reiterated today
that the Clinton administration would not make such a promise.
	   On other issues, the two presidents will likely agree to step up
U.S. training of Chinese judges and lawyers and establish ways to
reduce environmental pollution in China. Agreement also is likely
on cooperative approaches to health issues such as birth defects,
polio and the effects of tobacco use.
	   No progress is expected on China's bid to join the World Trade
Organization as U.S. negotiators seek to lower tariffs and barriers
to commerce and reduce the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with
China.

	   OSTEND, Belgium (AP) _ Police prepared to return to Britain
Friday 50 France-bound British soccer fans who were taken into
custody after running amok in this North Sea port. Two others were
to appear before an investigating judge and risk being charged with
causing a disturbance.
	   A police spokesman blamed ``excessive drinking'' for the
smashing of shop and cafe windows and damage to two police cars.
	   As cleanup crews cleared sidewalks of glass and debris, more
British soccer arrived from Britain. Police escorted them from the
ferry port and put them on trains to France to prevent further
disturbances.
	   Fifty Britons were kept in custody, to be put on a ferry back
home in the late afternoon to prevent them from returning to the
continent later in the day to see the Colombia-England evening
match in the northern French city of Lens.
	   The Britons _ part of a group of some 200 soccer fans headed for
Lens _ were involved in disturbances in the center of town after
they arrived here by ferry Thursday evening from Dover.
	   Police said windows were broken by stone throwing Britons and
Belgians were challenged to fights by the British soccer fans. The
disturbances lasted until 3 a.m.

Unusually high sea tempeartures bleaching coral 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) _ Unusually high sea temperatures have
damaged up to 70 percent of the coral reefs and other marine plants
at the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa, a Kenyan scientist said
Friday.
	   Kenya Wildlife Service regional biodiversity coordinator Nyawira
Muthiga said the high temperatures attributed to El Nino weather
phenomenon have caused the brown and yellow coral to loose its
color and turn pale or white, a condition known as bleaching.
	   ``Definitely bleaching is a very stressful condition for corals
as it causes them to lose about 80 percent of an algae,
Zooxanthellae, which they depend on to manufacture up to 80 percent
of their energy requirement,'' said Muthiga, ``Often, most corals
don't recover from bleaching but loose their tissue and die,'' she
said.
	   Muthiga said scientists from KWS, the Kenya Coral Reef
Conservation Project and Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research
Institute have recorded bleaching of up to 70 percent of all
corals, sea anemones and giant clams in the reef lagoons and reef
edges.
	   She said only deep reefs at 40 meters have not been affected.
	   Muthiga said researchers in Tanga and Zanzibar in neighboring
Tanzania as well as in Seychelles and Madagascar are also recording
bleaching, indicating that the phenomenon is very widespread _
perhaps the largest ever recorded in the western Indian Ocean.
	   Muthiga said temperatures as high as 33 degrees Celsuis in
shallow reefs and 30 degrees Celsius in 25 meters of water were
recorded in March and May.
	   Corals, which are like undersea forests, thrive at temperatures
between 26-27 degrees Celsius, Muthiga said.

Venus vs. Serena looms closer AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with rain delay, forecast in 8th graf
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams is gearing up for a
Wimbledon showdown against the ``juggernaut'' _ otherwise known as
her best friend and kid sister, Serena.
	   The Williams sisters crushed their second-round opponents in
straight sets Thursday _ each conceding only three games _ and are
on course for a high-powered meeting in the fourth round.
	   Venus routed Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2, a victory that featured
the fastest serve ever recorded in women's tennis. Serena trounced
fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Venus watched the first set of her sister's match on Centre
Court, then walked over to Court 1 to play her own.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' she said. ``I guess you
have to become the nemesis.''
	   Showers delayed the start of Friday's play and, with more rain
forecast, there were fears of a total washout. To make matters
worse, the long-term forecast was bleak.
	   Friday was the third rain-affected day of the tournament so far.
	   Last year, two straight washouts during the first week forced
organizers to schedule play on the middle Sunday for only the
second time in history. That could be an option again this year if
no play is possible on Friday and Saturday.
	   Venus Williams, who turned 18 last week and is the No. 6 seed,
is playing in her second Wimbledon, while the unseeded Serena is
appearing in her first.

	   Hague, 37, had surgery under general anesthetic Thursday at
Darlington Memorial Hospital, and has returned to his home, the

	   ``This kind of respiratory infection ... could hit anybody and
the accompanying sinusitis would make any sufferer feel very

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders formula for peace, NATO planning intensified. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke leaving, saying he's found no magic
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, ended four days of Balkan shuttle diplomacy Friday saying
he'd found no magic formula for peace.
	   Arriving in Kosovo from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci,
an Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence.
	   He then saw the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, before flying to Athens, Greece.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke told reporters.
	   He said he hopes that in the next two or three days, a
diplomatic observer mission consisting of scores or even hundreds
of foreigners will get going in Kosovo, scouring it to observe
fighting and observe tension first hand.
	   It was not clear whether that could serve as prelude to NATO
bombing the Serbian security forces if they refuse to withdraw.
	   Holbrooke noted only that ``in the last two days, NATO has
accelerated and concentrated their planning.''
	   Holbrooke is pushing for at least some Serbian security forces
to withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to
resume talks over the political future of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.

Women challenging men in tennis popularity AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There was a time when women's tennis
tended to be dull. Chris Evert remembers it well because she played
then.
	   ``The women lacked power, and it was tedious to watch all those
baseline rallies,'' Evert admits.
	   Today, the only thing boring about tennis is the men.
	   The women have become a promoter's dream, thanks to those
feisty, photogenic teen queens _ Martina Hingis, Anna Kournikova
and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena. Couple their success
with comebacks by Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, and the result has
been plenty of melodrama at Wimbledon.
	   ``Without question, women's tennis is in the best shape in its
history,'' says Hall of Famer Billie Jean King, a six-time
Wimbledon champion.
	   The men, meanwhile, are suffering from a shortage of stars.
Recent Grand Slam finalists Carlos Moya, Alex Corretja, Greg
Rusedski, Cedric Pioline and Gustavo Kuerten may be famous in their
own countries, but they haven't sustained sufficient success to
become international celebrities.
	   Even 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, who once alleged
that ``80 percent of the top 100 women are lazy, fat pigs,''
acknowledges the changing times.
	   ``The women are doing very well,'' Krajicek says. ``They may
even be doing better than the men. They get a lot of attention and
have a lot of different personalities. There's a very big
variation, maybe a little bit more than the men.''
	   As a result, the WTA Tour _ long regarded as the ATP's kid
sister _ is challenging the men in popularity. The women find
themselves on magazine covers while the men have become footnotes.
	   ``The men's game needs to take a hard look at what it has been
doing,'' says three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe, now an
analyst for NBC-TV. He sees problems with the product and the way
it's marketed.
	   ``Among the top players, except for Pete Sampras, I don't think
you can put them at the level of Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors, Ivan
Lendl or Mats Wilander. Those players were taught tennis more
completely. They had more diverse strategies and game plans, and
the ability to change gears.''
	   These days find the men in reverse. One solution for them is to
ride the WTA's coattails, and the ATP has begun courting the women,
proposing more combined tournaments.
	   Bart McGuire, who became chief executive officer of the WTA in
January, says he would favor adding one to three joint events. But
he also wants equal prize money, and purses are larger for the men
than the women at every Grand Slam except the U.S. Open.
	   McGuire plans to ask Grand Slam chairmen to eliminate the
disparity when he meets with them next week.
	   ``I believe a very strong case can be made,'' he says, noting
that recent TV ratings have frequently been higher for the women
than the men. HBO's coverage this week focused on the women, and
ratings were up 20 percent over a year ago.
	   Evert, a three-time Wimbledon champ now with the American
television network NBC, favors equal prize money for players
advancing to the quarterfinals or beyond. But in the early rounds,
she says, the women still aren't as competitive as the men.
	   ``There's more depth in men's tennis,'' she says. ``In the early
rounds we're seeing a lot of 6-1, 6-2 scores for the women, and
tough five-set matches for the men. The WTA won't like me saying
this, but we're not there yet.''
	   The women's top 10, however, has superior star power. McGuire
cites several reasons for the boom in the women's game, including
cultural changes throughout the world that make it more acceptable
for females to play sports.
	   Another factor, he says, is modern rackets that allow women to
hit harder. Ironically, the rackets hurt the appeal of the men's
game because big servers now dominate, especially on grass.
	   ``The new technology helped the women's game and made them
appear to be hitting almost as hard as men,'' McEnroe says.
	   ``In the men's case it's a little overwhelming, especially on
the grass at Wimbledon. What you're seeing is a guy hitting a serve
and then maybe a guy going for a winner with his return. There's no
buildup in strategy, and people don't enjoy it.''
	   The women also have become more entertaining off the court,
thanks to those cocky, charismatic, candid teen-agers. They've
introduced a new attitude, and with the Williams' hair beads,
Hingis' perpetual smile and Kournikova's bare midriff, they've
given the game a new look.
	   ``I like the fact that they believe in themselves,'' says King,
now a commentator for HBO. ``Their self-esteem is better than my
generation's. They think they can do anything they want, and that's
important.''
	   The veterans provide an exciting contrast, with Graf, Seles,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Jana Novotna and Lindsay Davenport all
capable of teaching the youngsters a lesson.
	   ``The beauty of the women's tour is it has both elements _ youth
and experience,'' Evert notes.
	   McGuire says the teens have benefited from a change in WTA rules
that now allow players to enter only a limited number of
tournaments until they turn 18.
	   The restriction, he says, promotes career longevity by reducing
the risk of injury at an early age. It also allows young players to
adjust gradually to the tour lifestyle, and it gives them more time
to develop a complete game.
	   ``Our top young players can all volley,'' he says, ``and I don't
think that's a coincidence.''
	   Those tedious battles from the baseline are a thing of the past.

Space experts seek ways to keep Mir in orbit 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space experts held a brainstorming session
Friday to try to devise ``nonstandard'' ways to keep the Mir in
orbit despite a lack of government funding.
	   Space officials have warned that Russia may have to discard the
Mir a year ahead of schedule and send it crashing back to Earth
this fall unless the cash-strapped government comes up with money.
	   The state-run RKK Energia corporation, which built Mir and has
been running it since it was put in orbit in early 1986, is owed
440 million rubles (dlrs 70 million) for station operations last
year, Energia chief Yuri Semyonov said. The government has not paid
any bills this year, he said.
	   The money shortage already threatens to stall the arrival of the
station's next crew, currently scheduled to blast off in August.
	   ``We realize the situation the government is in, so we see there
is no counting on the budget,'' the head of the Russian Space
Agency Yuri Koptev was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   A decision on whether to send a new crew needs to be made
shortly, since any replacement crew must arrive at the Mir at least
11 days before the current team leaves on Aug. 25. No extension of
the current team's stay is possible, since the useful life time of
their escape capsule runs out in late August, Koptev said.
	   ``If we cannot act, there will be a situation when we will have
to lift off the crew from the Mir in August and close the
station,'' Koptev said.
	   Experts spent the meeting trying to generate ``nonstandard
solutions'' to the problem, he said. ITAR-Tass did not say whether
the participants came up with any new ideas.
	   Even abandoning the Mir in August could cause serious problems.
Left uncontrolled, the 130-ton station will gradually spin out of
orbit and fall back to Earth within two years _ with large pieces
possibly landing in populated areas.
	   Discarding the Mir properly would cost more in the short run
than leaving it in orbit. To control the station's descent to
Earth, Russia would have to launch several cargo ships over a short
period to dock with the station and use their engines to direct it
into lower orbits.
	   Russian space officials had planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir
flying until the end of 1999, after the first parts of the
international space station were placed in orbit.

Strategic forces commander says missile deterrent necessary 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia needs to keep its nuclear arsenal in place
into the next century as a deterrent to potential military
aggressors, the chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces said Friday.
	   Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev told graduates of the military and
rocketry academies that Russia will face ``quite real military
dangers'' before the end of this century and after 2000, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Strategic nuclear warheads remain a credible deterrent for a
potential aggressor,'' he said.
	   Yakovlev said the service life of existing nuclear missile
systems will be extended as far as possible and modernized to
maintain the preparedness of strategic rocketry.
	   ``Depending on financing, we will try to keep 450 to 650
launchers fully deployed,'' Yakovlev said. The country's missile
stockpiles will be maintained within restrictions set under the
START-2 arms limitation treaty, he said.

<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has been demoted _
from Mrs. President to respectable Mrs. Clinton.
	   That's according to two mayors who introduced the President and
the First Lady at their first stops on China.
	   ``Your Excellency Mr. President and Mrs. President,'' was the
salutation from Mayor Feng Xichu of Xi'an, who, presumably, was
unaware that critics at home have sometimes suggested that's the
role the First Lady really wanted.
	   Today, the welcoming line in the village of Xiahe was more
restrained.
	   ``Your Honorable Excellency President Clinton, respectable Mrs.
Clinton,'' Mayor Yang Yunlong began.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   The Chinese may not be capitalists, but one entrepreneurial
restaurant owner knew the value of well-timed publicity.
	   Won't you come to my restaurant, he asked the president and Mrs.
Clinton when his turn came during an outdoor roundtable discussion
with villagers in Xiahe.
	   ``If you don't have the chance this time, you're still welcome
after you finish your duty as president to come back,'' he
continued. ``And, what are your favorite Chinese dishes?''
	   The president chuckled approvingly. ``Now I understand how you
fill a restaurant with 500 seats every night!''
	   Without weighing in on any favorites, Clinton continued, ``This
is very nice. You know, most people in my position wonder if anyone
will want us to eat with them when we're not in office anymore.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Not every tourist gets up-close-and-personal with the
painstakingly restored Terracotta Warriors _ an ancient version of
Secret Service agents for Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who wanted
guards in the afterlife.
	   But Clinton, his wife and daughter Chelsea were allowed into the
pit to walk among one battalion of the 7,000-plus excavated statues
lined up for battle.
	   Agog, Clinton stopped before one of the lifesize warriors and
reached out to touch its face, modeled after a real person 2,000
years ago.
	   ``Whenever I experience something like this I feel a little more
humble and I also feel reminded that you have this limited amount
of time on Earth and you have to do what you can to try to help
people make the most of it,'' Clinton said, turning philosophical.
	   Afterward, Clinton and Chelsea bought a warrior head from the
museum gift shop after a bit of hard bargaining that brought the
price down from about dlrs 225 to dlrs 45.
	   The president's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, did the first
family one better, buying a full-size replica of a Terracotta
Warrior for dlrs 1,100. No word on how well his bargaining went.
	   ``My wife will either like it or she's gonna kill me,'' he said.

Polish director picks teen-ager to star in next epic 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo planned
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After a nationwide search including
newspaper and radio ads, award-winning director Andrzej Wajda said
Friday he has chosen a government official's singing teen-age
daughter to star in his adaptation of a classic Polish verse novel.
	   Alicja Bachleda-Curus, a pretty 15-year-old with brown eyes and
long brown hair, will play the romantic, delicate Zosia in ``Pan
Tadeusz'' (``Mr. Tadeusz''), a 19th century epic about the life of
Polish aristocrats.
	   The daughter of Poland's deputy minister for environment
protection, she has been performing in school and at festivals
since she was 8 years old. In 1995, she won a Polish Television
competition for young singers and has recorded about two dozen
songs since.
	   With all the other roles cast long ago, Wajda said the film
would now begin shooting July 6 near Warsaw.
	   His films made under communism were remarkable for their
anti-government undertones, including ``The Man of Iron,'' which
chronicles the rise of the Solidarity trade union.
	   Banned in Poland shortly after its premiere, the movie was
awarded the Grand Prix prize at the Cannes International Film
Festival in 1981 and nominated for an Academy Award the same year.
	   Wajda will receive a career achievement award at this year's
Venice Film Festival.

Lebanese prisoners return home to festive welcome

<TEXT>
	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom and a tumultuous welcome from thousands
of people in southern Lebanon Friday.
	   The release completed a swap between Israel and Lebanon. On
Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier for
the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Lebanese soldiers distributed refreshments to the freed men as
their convoy inched past the border toward thousands of relatives
and well wishers.
	   Prisoners smiled and waved to the crowd. Some people broke into
tears and showered rice on the buses in a traditional Arab welcome.
	   Soldiers tried to keep order as activists swarmed around the
buses and on their roofs, shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is
Great.''
	   The three buses and an ambulance bearing signs of the
International Committee of the Red Cross arrived at a Lebanese army
checkpoint at Kfar Falous on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone
in southern Lebanon at 1:00 p.m. (1000GMT).
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, who was
crippled when a bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel
room two years ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to
blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   His wife and mother rushed to join him in a special Red Cross
ambulance.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel handed 60 Lebanese prisoners over to the
Red Cross in the second stage of a deal between Lebanon and Israel.
	   Four chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone and one
decided to stay in Israel, ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard said.
	   ``It's their choice,'' Fresard said at the crossing.
	   Some of the prisoners have been held for as long as 14 years and
most were held without trial on suspicion of aiding guerrillas
fighting Israeli forces.
	   An Israeli government statement said the prisoners to be
released did not have ``blood on their hands.''
	   Ten of the prisoners had been held in Israeli jails.
	   Fifty were held in the Khiam detention camp in the occupied zone
in southern Lebanon.
	   At Kfar Falous, several thousand men, women and children
gathered to great the men. Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
and Amal guerrilla groups as well as that of the Lebanese Communist
Party and the national flag hung from light poles and trees along
the road, reflecting the makeup of those to be released.
	   Hezbollah supporters shouted ``Death to Israel'' and ``Death to
America,'' Israel's main supporter. Communist activists, some
wearing T-shirts with portraits of South American Communist
revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, danced the dabke, a folk
dance.
	   Lebanese officials said that with Friday's release, 167
prisoners remain in Khiam or in Israel.
	   Anis Fouani, 63, said he felt ``extreme happiness and joy'' as
he awaited the arrival of his son, Ali, who was 17 when he was
taken by Israeli forces from his home in the occupied zone 14 years
ago and jailed in Khiam.
	   ``We're all with the resistance until the liberation of south
Lebanon,'' he said.
	   The release of prisoners followed the exchange late Thursday of
the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya for the bodies of
40 guerrillas killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
	   France provided the military aircraft which transferred the
bodies between Beirut airport and a military airport outside Tel
Aviv.
	   Lebanon accorded the bodies full military honors late Thursday,
reflecting the government's recognition of the guerrillas as
national heroes.
	   The bodies are to be buried Saturday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, the remains of Ilya, a naval
commando killed in a botched raid in the south in September, were
sent home. The remains were received with full military honors.

World Cup: U.S. players to be fined for criticizing coach AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ U.S. coach Steve Sampson, angered by
criticism of his World Cup leadership, announced Friday that
``significant fines'' would be levied against players who
complained.
	   ``There will be fines imposed against those individuals who
spoke out against the federation as a way of directing a message to
younger players that this is not professional behavior,'' Sampson
said. ``These will be significant fines.''
	   Sampson would not elaborate on the amount, as the team left its
base camp near Nantes en route back to the United States after
being ousted in the first round. Team general manager Tom King said
two or three players would be fined.
	   The Americans lost all three matches, including the shocking 2-1
defeat by Iran in their first soccer meeting in the two decades of
hostility between Washington and Tehran.
	   The Americans were blanked in their two other outings _ 2-0 by
Germany in Paris and 1-0 by Yugoslavia on Thursday in Nantes to
finish bottom of Group F with no points.
	   The U.S. experience was summed up by two conclusions _ they
played badly and they hated their coach.
	   Players who couldn't find the net saved their best verbal shots
for Sampson and his assistant, Clive Charles. Veterans on the team,
puzzled and angered ever since captain John Harkes was cut in
April, slammed the staff before heading off on their own.
	   ``I don't think we got the best out of the talent we had here,''
Tab Ramos said after the loss to Yugoslavia. ``From the beginning,
this whole World Cup has been a mess. I blame the coaches for the
losses. I have no problem saying that.''
	   Ramos vowed to remove himself from the program unless there's a
coaching change.
	   ``As long as Steve and Clive are around this team, I won't have
anything to do with it,'' he said.
	   Star forward Eric Wynalda, who started just one of the three
games, said, ``My disappointment came from the fact that I was
denied the opportunity to show what I'm capable of.''
	   ``We all have a scrapbook, and I would have liked to at least
have a picture of myself on the field,'' said Alexi Lalas, who
didn't get into any of the three games.
	   Lalas and teammate Jeff Agoos also said they'd never play
another game for Sampson.
	   ``My viewpoints and his viewpoints are at polar opposites on how
a player should be treated,'' Agoos said as he and Lalas left
France.
	   The Americans, who arrived with the goal of showing Europe that
U.S. soccer has come of age, instead showed they're better
finger-pointers than goal-scorers.
	   ``I think it was immature of us to go around and point
fingers,'' said Claudio Reyna, a major disappointment. ``It doesn't
look good.''
	   The United States, already eliminated by a 2-1 loss to Iran, is
guaranteed of finishing no better than 30th in the 32-team field
and could wind up dead last.
	   While the U.S. team showed flashes of improvement from four
years ago in brief stretches, all in all it was an embarrassment
for a nation that has spent millions of dollars trying to build its
program to a world-class level.
	   Sampson refused Thursday night to respond directly to players'
complaints, saying: ``I'm not going to criticize my players. I'm
not going to be drawn into that.''
	   ``It has everything related to do with playing time,'' he said.
``Certain players who haven't gotten playing time have been angered
by that and have vented their frustrations publicly. We had hoped
that it would have stayed internal.''
	   Still, Sampson felt stung. ``I'm a human being. I'm human,'' he
said slowly, his face flushing with emotion.

Parliament debates refugee program that the West had welcomed 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led after vote expected late Friday, time uncertain
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Clearly aware that Croatia's acceptance
by Europe hinges on the vote, Foreign Minister Mate Granic urged
parliament Friday to vote for a new plan on refugee returns that
envisages the unimpeded return of tens of thousands of Serbs.
	   Croatia could take ``a big step'' toward the European Union and
other institutions by voting for the plan, Granic said.
	   The 127-member House of Deputies, dominated by the ruling party
of President Franjo Tudjman, debated the new plan, which was
adopted after Europe bluntly told Croatia that previous schemes
were not good enough.
	   Early debate indicated there would be a solid majority for the
plan in a vote expected late Friday.
	   Some 180,000 Serbs fled Croatia in 1995 when government troops
retook areas captured four years earlier by Serb rebels against
Tudjman's rule. Only about 35,000 have been able to return, with
tens of thousands of others finding their way back home blocked by
bureaucratic hassles or other harassment.
	   Croatia was repeatedly told that it would not get any closer to
the western institutions unless it stop resisting to the Serbs'
return.
	   The new plan has been praised by both European and U.S.
officials, and the U.N. refugee agency. However, they cautioned
that it must not only be approved, but also implemented.
	   ``The refugee return plan ... is a big step on Croatia's road
towards Euro-Atlantic integration,'' Granic said. ``Let's use this
momentum, aware that the plan should also be implemented fully and
in good faith.''
	   There are indications that Tudjman's party will endorse the
plan, but it is possible party hard-liners will oppose it.
	   During early debate, both the ruling party and opposition
deputies voiced support. The only one against it is a far rightist
party, which holds just four seats.

One prisoner opted not to return to Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Lebanese guerrilla jailed in Israel decided
Friday not to return home with dozens of fellow prisoners even
though his release had been secured as part of a swap between
Israel and Lebanon, a spokesman of Red Cross said Friday.
	   The spokesman, David Lynch, did not release the prisoner's name,
nor would he say why he decided to stay behind.
	   Lynch said the prisoner could choose his next destination.
	   As part of the swap, carried out in several stages Thursday and
Friday, Israel received the remains of a soldier killed last year
in an ambush in southern Lebanon. Israel returned to Lebanon the
remains of 40 guerrillas, most of them members of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah group, and freed 60 prisoners.

UN plans to double food aid to Sudan where famine looms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with growing food shortages in Sudan, a U.N.
agency said Friday it planned to double its aid deliveries to the
area.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said the Sudanese government,
which has been fighting rebels since 1983, had recently given it
permission to fly over virtually the entire country for air drops.
The government had been enforcing several no-fly zones.
	   With extra planes, WFP expects to increase its capacity to
100,000 tons of food per month. It said that some 2.6 million
people faced famine if they did not receive aid, and that in
certain areas up to 15 children per day are dying from
malnutrition.
	   The agency said it had asked donors to contribute dlrs 137.6
million to expand its operation in Sudan, and had received dlrs
58.7 so far.
	   ``We are optimistic that we will receive the rest,'' said Mike
Sackett, WFP regional manager for the Horn of Africa.
	   WFP said it did not expect the crisis to improve before October,
when crops are harvested.
	   Fifteen years of civil war, coupled with several droughts,
brought on the food shortages.
	   Despite the ongoing conflict, in which the mostly Christian and
animist population in the south is fighting for autonomy from the
Muslim north, Sackett said WFP was certain the food was getting
``into the hands of the people who need it.''

Belarus president say diplomats can return only with permission actions ``undiplomatic, ADDS byline.'' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in last three grafs with Russia calling Belarus
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Diplomats from seven countries who left
Belarus over a housing dispute will be allowed to return to Minsk
``only with the permission of the Belarusian authorities,'' Belarus
president Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.
	   Before boarding a plane for Switzerland, Lukashenko told Belarus
state television that he had offered to meet the ambassadors to
discuss the dispute, but they refused, saying they needed to
consult with their governments.
	   ``Let them consult, but they should know they can come back only
with our permission,'' he said.
	   Lukashenko's government has been trying for weeks to oust the
ambassadors from their homes on the wooded outskirts of Minsk.
Officials say that the houses need urgent sewer and plumbing
repairs, and Lukashenko says the compound belongs to him.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus this week to consult with
their governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish
ambassadors have also been recalled home.
	   The countries maintain that Lukashenko's orders violate
international law, which designates ambassadors' residences as the
sovereign territory of their home countries. The host country must
ask permission to enter and cannot demand that residents leave.
	   Lukashenko called the diplomats' decision to leave a ``political
maneuver.''
	   ``And there will be more maneuvers the closer parliamentary and
presidential elections come,'' he said.
	   Russia has expressed concern about the dispute, but has kept its
ambassador in Minsk. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
denounced Belarus' actions as ``undiplomatic.''
	   ``Now it is important to not give in to emotion and remove any
strain in the interests of developing good relations between
governments,'' Rakhmanin said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia has signed a nominal union agreement with Belarus, and is
often cautious about criticizing its ally in public.

Bahrain police seize dlrs 800,000 in heroin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahraini police have seized 300,000
dinars (dlrs 800,000) in heroin during the past two months, the
English-language Gulf Daily News reported Friday.
	   Police arrested 478 people in 1997 for trying to smuggle 4
kilograms (8.8 pounds) of heroin, 7 kilograms (15 1/2 pounds) of
marijuana and 45 packets of poppy seeds, the newspaper quoted Maj.
Abdel Khalifa Al Fadhel, head of the anti-drug squad, as saying.
	   The newspaper gave no other details on the seizures.
	   Bahrain has a relatively low drug abuse rate but authorities
fear that its ports, like those of other Arab Gulf states, are
increasingly used as a transit point by drug traffickers.

Ministry denies plot to kidnap Americans in Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The government denied reports Friday that
police had uncovered a plot by suspected Islamic militants to
kidnap Americans in Egypt and swap them with jailed extremist
leaders.
	   A security official said Thursday the plot was revealed during
investigations into the activities of 17 men detained earlier this
month for attempting to revive al-Jihad, a radical Muslim group.
	   Al-Jihad had claimed responsibility for the 1981 assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   But Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting an unidentified
Interior Ministry official, called the report ``baseless.''
	   ``The reports about the kidnapping of American citizens are not
correct. The group was only trying to spread its ideology among the
youth,'' the official told the news agency.
	   Officials at the Interior Ministry were not available to comment
Friday, the Muslim sabbath. The government often uses the agency to
release official statements.
	   The security official had said investigations showed the 17
detainees wanted to secure the release of Aboud el-Zommor, who is
serving a 40-year sentence for taking part in Sadat's
assassination.
	   They also wanted to free Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is
currently serving a life sentence in the United States. The
57-year-old blind and diabetic sheik was convicted along with nine
others in a plot to blow up the United Nations, a federal building,
two tunnels and a bridge in New York.
	   The report was also carried by Al-Hayat, the respected
Arabic-language newspaper based in London.
	   Islamic militants are critical of U.S. support for Israel but
have never targeted Americans during their six-year campaign to
replace Egypt's secular government with strict religious rule.

Danish haute couture designer Erik Mortensen dead at 72 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Erik Mortensen, one of haute
couture's leading figures as the head of French fashion houses
Pierre Balmain and Jean-Louis Scherrera, has died at age 72, Danish
national radio said Friday.
	   The Danish-born Mortensen, who had been suffering from cancer,
died in Paris, the radio report said.
	   Mortensen entered the Pierre Balmain house in Paris in 1948.
After Balmain's death in 1982, he became chief designer until 1990
when he quit to work for rival house Jean-Louis Scherrer.
	   He was awarded the prestigious Golden Thimble in 1983, 1987 and
1994 and was a member of the French Knight of the Arts and Letter
order.
	   In the mid-80s, Mortensen created new uniforms for the French
police, replacing the famed `'kepi'' hats with a flat cap inspired
by American police.
	   In 1994, Mortensen retired to southern France but led an active
life, designing gowns for royalties and wealthy customers. He also
created theater costumes for plays in Denmark and wrote two books
in Danish, including one autobiography that became a best-seller at
home.
	   No information was given about the date of his death, funeral
arrangements or survivors.

Russian markets fall despite IMF decision to release loan installment

Eds: UPDATES with bond market dropping.
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy.
	   But investors apparently disagreed, and the stock market opened
sharply lower with traders citing fears that an IMF bailout is
moving too slowly.
	   ``Its a very weak market, but I would not say it is panic
selling yet,'' said Steve Malloy of Credit Suisse First Boston in
Moscow.
	   The Russian Trading System index dropped 4 percent in early
trading, standing at 165.80 at midday, down from Thursday's close
of 172.57.
	   The bond market also fell, with treasury yields surging to 74
percent from 61.5 percent Thursday.

Hakkinen leads free practice for French GP With Sports-Auto Racing-French Grand Prix 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - Formula One leader Mika Hakkinen of
Finland drove to the fastest time in Friday's free practice for the
French Grand Prix edging Ireland's Eddie Irvine.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes was timed in 1 minute, 16.515
seconds, barely in front of Irvine's 1:16.597. Hakkinen averaged
199.96 kph (124.28 mph).
	   David Coulthard, also in a McLaren-Mercedes, was third with
1:16.707. Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fourth with 1:17.026 in a
Williams-Mecachrome.
	   Two-time series champion Michael Schumacher, last year's winner
here and the winner of the Canadian Grand Prix three weeks ago, was
fifth in 1:17.429 in a Ferrari.
	   Saturday is the official qualifying for Sunday's race. Coulthard
and Hakkinen have taken the top two spots in qualifying for nearly
every race so far this year with Hakkinen having four pole
positions and Coulthard the other three.
	   The Grand Prix season reaches its mid-point Sunday with the
eighth race of the 16-race season. Sunday's French Grand Prix is 72
laps on the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Circuit, just outside
Nevers in central France.
	   Hakkinen, with 46 points, has a 12-point advantage over
Schumacher. Coulthard is third with 29.
	   Last year Schumacher won an exciting race here in both wet and
dry conditions to move 14 points ahead in the driver's standings
over Jacques Villeneuve. He lost the title to Villeneuve in the
last race of the season following the dramatic collision with the
Canadian that forced Schumacher off the track.
	   Villeneuve is having his problems this year in a
Williams-Mecachrome, having just the 17th best time in 1:19.009.
	   Schumacher, with an improving Ferrari, is battling the McLaren
drivers this year.
	   Schumacher won the crash-marred Canadian Grand Prix where both
McLaren drivers failed to finish. That was Schumacher's second
victory of the season compared to Hakkinen's four.

Hong Kong to pay ``all reasonable costs'' to keep link in lead; EDITS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to CLARIFY sequence of Tsang's comments; ADDS context
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top finance official strengthened
his support for the local currency's link to the U.S. dollar
Friday, saying the he would defend the peg at ``all reasonable
costs.''
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's comments softened a
reluctance to back the currency peg expressed in an interview late
Thursday, in which he refused to say the government would mount an
all-out effort to protect the currency.
	   ``I'm quite happy to say at all reasonable costs,'' Tsang told
reporters questioning him Friday about how far he would go to
defend Hong Kong's 14-year currency link to the U.S. dollar.
	   In the earlier interview, Tsang said there were costs Hong Kong
was not willing the bear to protect the currency peg, and he
refused to say that he would preserve the peg ``at all costs.'' He
did, however, say he would step down from the job he has had for
almost two years if the peg goes.
	   After the interview, local interbank rates went up and the Hong
Kong dollar weakened against U.S. dollar slightly early Friday.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's financial crisis better
than most countries, it is paying dearly for the peg. Interest
rates are kept high, eating into corporate profits and hurting bank
liquidity. The economy, which shrank 2 percent in the first
quarter, is on the brink of recession.
	   Economists are divided over whether the peg should go. Some say
scrapping it would hurt investors' confidence in Hong Kong and the
region, while others think floating the Hong Kong currency is the
only way to keep the territory competitive.
	   Tsang also said Friday that he would back international support
for the Japanese yen.
	   ``We cannot, on our own, do something, but we are thinking of an
international effort'' of the Group of Seven industrialized nations
and other countries, he said.
	   Tsang said the weakened yen is hurting Japan's direct investment
in Hong Kong and China. Japanese investment has ``dwindled'' and
``that's all because of the Japanese yen value,'' he said.

Moscow stadiums to be checked for radiation before Youth Olympics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The 45 facilities to be used in next month's Youth
Olympics in Moscow will be checked for possible radioactive
contamination, a news agency reported Friday.
	   Radiation specialists will examine the Olimpiysky and Luzhniki
sport complexes, as well as the Dinamo stadium and other
structures, the Interfax news agency said, citing Moscow
radioactive cleanup company Radon.
	   More than 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) of roads on
which the games participants are expected to travel will also be
checked.
	   Experts generally agree that Moscow has more radioactive waste
sites than any other city in the world. Radon has detected and
cleaned up more than 1,000 radioactive sites around the Russian
capital over the past two decades, including 100 just last year.
	   There are no statistics available on the prevalence of
radiation-related illness in Moscow, but officials insist the risks
are relatively low. Much of the contamination comes relatively weak
medical and research materials, not nuclear waste.

International conference pledges dlrs 5 million for Crimean Tatars 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An international conference in Ukraine
pledged about dlrs 5 million Friday to help resettle Crimean
Tatars, expelled in the Soviet era and now returning to their
homeland.
	   Of 26 countries taking part in the 2nd conference of donor
nations in Kiev, about half pledged actual support and the others
said they also were prepared to contribute, according to Ukraine's
deputy premier Valery Smolii.
	   Ukraine had suggested a dlrs 13.8 million aid package, but
Smolii said Kiev was nevertheless pleased by the results of the
meeting, sponsored by the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   ``This has demonstrated the world's psychological, moral and
material readiness to respond to Ukraine's problems,'' Smolii said.
	   He said the money would be used to build infrastructure, add new
jobs and provide for cultural needs of the returning Tatars.
	   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled the Crimean Tatars to
Central Asia in 1944 for allegedly helping the Nazis in the war
against Russia. Some 260,000 members of the Muslim group have
returned in the past decade.
	   That has added to ethnic tensions on the Black Sea's Crimean
Peninsula, where many in the ethnic Russian majority chafe under
Ukrainian rule.
	   The Tatars, many of whom still don't have Ukrainian citizenship,
clashed with Ukrainian police this spring, demanding voting rights
for non-citizens and a quota in the regional parliament.
	   Ukraine's central government has spent dlrs 300 million on
Crimean Tatar resettlement since 1992, and international aid in
1996-97 amounted to about dlrs 2 million, Interfax said.

China executes 22 for drug trafficking, other crimes Eds; RECASTS throughout to UPDATE number of executions from seven to 22, details 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As part of a government drive against drug
running and other crimes, Chinese authorities have executed 22
people following public rallies in several cities, official reports
said Friday.
	   In Wenzhou, 15 people were executed after they were convicted of
drug trafficking or murder, the state-run newspaper China Business
Times reported.
	   It said the 15 were among 34 people sentenced on Wednesday by
the Wenzhou Intermediate Court.
	   Authorities in southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong
Kong, have executed seven people convicted of drug trafficking,
according to another report seen Friday in Beijing.
	   Three of those executed were among 58 people sentenced at a
public rally attended by 3,000 people in the city of Shantou, the
Yangcheng Evening News reported Thursday.
	   The executions took place Tuesday and Wednesday, it said.
	   It said that Shantou authorities also destroyed 21 kilograms of
heroin; 13 kilograms of the designer drug, ice; 53 kilograms of
ephedrine and 179 kilograms of caffeine _ the largest such drug
haul ever for the city.
	   In a separate report, the Yangcheng Evening News said the
railway court in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong,
executed four convicted drug traffickers on Thursday.
	   China has showcased its fight against trafficking in illicit
drugs recently with a major exhibition in Beijing that has been
visited by both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Legal Daily reported Thursday that a
court in Hangzhou, eastern China, had sentenced three people to
death for drug trafficking.

	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ In a major blow to the Sicilian Mafia,
police arrested scores of suspected mobsters on Friday, including
the sister of a top boss.
	   The huge bust came just a day after the army completed its
withdrawal after a six-year deployment aimed at freeing up police
to fight organized crime.
	   Some 150,000 soldiers had been deployed on the territory since
1992, following the bombings that killed Italy's top anti-Mafia
prosecutors.
	   ``Army forces must always be used on emergency basis alone,''
said Lt. Col. Nicola Tota, a defense ministry official in Rome. But
police and Carabinieri paramilitary forces were beefed up to ``give
a sign the State is still there.''
	   ``We must not drop our guard,'' Tota said.
	   Among those arrested Friday in the Palermo area on charges
ranging from murder, theft, drug trafficking and gun-running were
22 suspected members of the infamous Corleone clan.
	   The reputed boss, Vito ``Old Rag'' Vitale, was arrested in
April.
	   His sister, Giuseppina Vitale, 26, was picked up in Vitale's
hometown, Partinico, just outside Palermo. Police also filed new
charges against his brother, Leonardo, who is serving a life prison
sentence.
	   In Catania, on Sicily's east coast, police in a separate
operation arrested 40 people and filed Mafia-related charges
against 14 people already in jail. Among them were two men accused
of using cellular phones from their prison cells to order murders.

Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with U.S. team announcing fines
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nineteen minutes changed the fortunes of three
World Cup teams. All the time in the world couldn't help the
hapless, dissension-riddled squad from the United States.
	   The England-Columbia match Friday in Lens drew added attention
because of the violent reputation of English fans. Some 100 people,
most of them supporters from England, were arrested overnight in
northern France and across the border in Belgium, and Lens braced
for trouble from hooligans.
	   Mexico and the Netherlands advanced to the second round, and
Belgium was knocked out of the tournament, on the strength of three
second-half goals Thursday _ two by the Mexicans, one by South
Korea.
	   Germany beat Iran 2-0, dominating a game the Iranians hoped
would produce an upset and a second-round spot.
	   For the United States, the last game was another loss in its
utter flop of a World Cup. The Americans hit another goalpost with
a shot, lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia and did more finger-pointing.
	   ``I don't think we got the best out of the talent we had here,''
Tab Ramos said. ``From the beginning, this whole World Cup has been
a mess. I blame the coaches for the losses. I have no problem
saying that.''
	   As the team left France on Friday, coach Steve Sampson announced
``significant fines'' against American players who criticized the
U.S. Soccer Federation ``as a way of directing a message to younger
players that this is not professional behavior.''
	   Mexico had no such problems after its second straight comeback
victory.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Luis
Hernandez, whose goal in the fifth minute of injury time produced a
2-2 draw with the Netherlands. ``It was a fantastic game for us, a
triumph for Mexico and the Mexican people.''
	   Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 75th minute, starting Mexico's
rally.
	   Tied with the Dutch in points entering the match, and ahead of
Belgium by two points, Mexico supposedly had the toughest task of
reaching the second round. Belgium, after all, played against South
Korea, winless in five World Cups.
	   With the Netherlands leading 2-0 in Saint-Etienne, and the
Belgians up 1-0 in Paris, that forecast seemed right.
	   But Yoo Sang-chul tied it for South Korea in the 71st minute for
a 1-1 tie. And the two late-developing draws meant Mexico will get
Germany on Monday in Montpellier, while the Netherlands will face
off against Yugoslavia in Toulouse.
	   Belgium goes home.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' Mexican coach Manuel
Lapuente said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big
heart and they displayed that all over the field.''
	   The second-round pairings were to be completed Friday when
Romania faced Tunisia and England took on Colombia in Group G,
while in Group H, it was Argentina vs. Croatia. Japan played
Jamaica in a match that had no bearing on anything except final
positions _ although both were seeking their first World Cup
points.
	   In Montpellier, Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored
early in the second half and Germany ended Iranian hopes.
	   ``We tried hard in the first half, but it didn't work,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow
score.''
	   At Nantes, the Yugoslavs scored less than four minutes after
kickoff, then struggled to hold off the Americans.
	   The U.S. team, which lost all three games by a combined 5-1
scored and was humiliated in a 2-1 loss to Iran, hit the post after
only 24 seconds. The Americans came away frustrated when Slobodan
Komljenovic headed in a rebound off a free kick.
	   ``We wanted to win and end the qualifications with a victory,
and that was our only aim,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``The game was not flamboyant, I know, but that is how you play
good matches.''
	   In the midst of a tournament filled with officiating
controversies, FIFA defended its referees.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' said David Will, a Scottish lawyer who has run FIFA's
referee office for eight years. ``The overall standard remains high
_ higher than in the United States, to be sure.''
	   It did little to appease the African Football Confederation,
which accused FIFA of a conspiracy against African nations. Only
one of five African teams advanced past the first round.

Israel's defense minister calls for deal in south Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel and Lebanon exchanged prisoners and
bodies of the fallen, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on
Friday urged Lebanon to negotiate an agreement on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
	   ``I very much hope that the Lebanese ... will move forward with
the initiative in order to change the situation in Lebanon,''
Mordechai said, adding that he hoped the Syrians would give their
blessings to such negotiations.
	   However, Lebanon has informed Israel that it will not conduct
any negotiations until Israel has reached agreement with the
Palestinians on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, the
Haaretz daily quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
	   The newspaper said that Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
asked a third country to convey the message to Israel.
	   Negotiations on the scope of a West Bank pullback have been
deadlocked for more than a year and there appears to be little
chance for a breakthrough.
	   Israel has occupied a strip of land in southern Lebanon for more
than 20 years to protect its northern border. Hundreds of Israeli
soldiers have been killed in the buffer zone and calls in Israel
for a unilateral withdrawal have been growing louder.
	   Two months ago, the Israeli Cabinet announced its adoption of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. However, Israel insisted that the Lebanese
government undertake to prevent attacks on the Israeli border by
Lebanese guerrillas. Lebanon maintains that the withdrawal must be
unconditional.
	   Israel believes Syria, which has 40,000 troops stationed in
Lebanon, is preventing the Lebanese government from agreeing to the
Israeli initiative. Syria wants Israel to withdraw from the Golan
Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. The
Syrian government has come out against the Israeli initiative in
Lebanon.
	   In the latest violence in south Lebanon, two Israeli soldiers
were killed Thursday and four wounded by a roadside bomb set off by
the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   At the same time, Israel released 60 Lebanese prisoners and the
bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas Thursday and Friday in return for
the remains of one Israeli naval commando.

Russia and Japan make headway on peace treaty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Japan have made considerable progress
in preparing a peace treaty that would formally end World War II, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The two countries have never signed a treaty ending the war
because of an on-going dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain
which were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news
briefing that the latest meeting between a Russian and Japanese
treaty commission in Tokyo on June 22 ``showed the sides'
constructive mood and converging positions on the majority of the
issues,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said the two sides ``have started to coordinate the main
provisions of the future treaty, except for the territorial
issues.''

Dissident arrests routine for China, embarrassing for Clinton dissident released. 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: SUBs 3rd graf, Three dissidents ..., to UPDATE with one
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of dissidents at the outset of his
China visit is awkward at best for U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
has pledged to push Beijing, face-to-face, for greater freedoms.
	   For Chinese authorities, such detentions are routine. They
underscore China's resistance to Clinton's human rights agenda, as
well as Beijing's determination to ensure that no protests mar the
president's nine-day tour.
	   Three dissidents were arrested Wednesday and Thursday in and
near the city of Xi'an, Clinton's first stop, human rights groups
said. One of them, Yang Hai, was released Friday, but the
whereabouts of the other two were unknown.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing,''
and instructed U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to raise the issue with
Chinese authorities. Sandy Berger, the president's national
security adviser, later said it was an example of Chinese security
forces ``doing what comes naturally for them,'' and added, ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor.''
	   Berger also said the White House did not believe the action
against dissidents was intended to embarrass Clinton, but that
Clinton intended to raise it in his talks Saturday.
	   Three Xi'an dissidents went to the city police bureau at around
midnight Thursday to hand over a letter protesting the arrests and
surveillance of other democracy activists, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police refused to let them through the door, so they left the
letter at a reception desk instead, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Human rights groups report arrests in China and other forms of
harassment nearly every day, often in statements faxed to foreign
reporters. Local officials and police rarely comment.
	   Lu Siqing, who runs the Hong Kong-based monitoring group, said
police were following regulations, many of them internal,
accumulated over dozens of years of authoritarian rule that tell
them how to act when important people visit or at politically
sensitive times.
	   ``Police are just acting according to their regulations. They
have no concepts of human rights. They think `I must act according
to the rules,''' Lu said. ``It's their habit.''
	   Officials claim there are no dissidents in China. They allege,
as Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said earlier this week in a news
conference, that most people described as dissidents have
``violated China's criminal law.''
	   Authoritative statistics are lacking on the number of dissidents
or political prisoners imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or forced
into exile, where many continue to work for political change back
home.
	   A 1996 report by Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, recorded about 2,000 people either jailed or subject
to occasional detentions for political or religious activities.
Human Rights Watch, in a 1994 book, documented 1,700 Chinese
imprisoned for political, ethnic or religious beliefs.
	   Many political activists who remain in China complain of
harassment by police and state security agents, of having trouble
running businesses or holding steady jobs.
	   Despite the constant risk of arrest and other trouble, many
still dare to publicize their beliefs.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news agencies _
urging him to speak out for freedom and the release of political
prisoners and to meet with dissidents during his stay.
	   Tang, other Chinese officials and White House advisers have said
Clinton has no such plans.
	   Lin Xinshu, a veteran dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province who often gets involved in public appeals for greater
freedom, said dozens of police were standing vigil outside his
door.
	   ``I called their chief and told him not to put so many out
there. One or two would do,'' Lin said. ``After all, I'm old and
not very healthy, how could I cause any trouble?''

Religious, civic leaders call for talks to end northern rebellion 
</HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GULU, Uganda (AP) _ Fed up with the government's inability to
crush an 12-year rebellion in northern Uganda, religious and civic
leaders on Friday called for negotiations to end the violence and
rebel abductions of the region's children.
	   ``We should sit down and see what we can do, because we have
waited for government to solve the problem, but it is still in
vain. Now we have to write the president to talk peace with the
rebels,'' Roman Catholic priest Remigion Christopher Obol told a
packed conference hall in this northern Ugandan town.
	   Several hundred people are attending the three-day conference in
Gulu, 360 kilometers (223 miles) north of the capital, Kampala.
	   ``Religious leaders have decided to sit down and discuss the
war, which has lasted for 12 years and why it has not ended,''
Anglican archbishop Onene Onwene told the forum.
	   President Yoweri Museveni, himself a former rebel leader who
took power in 1986, has refused to negotiate with the Lord's
Resistance Army.
	   More than 300,000 people have been forced by the rebels to flee
their homes in the northern districts of Gulu, Kitgum and Lira
inhabited mainly by members of the Acholi tribe.
	   In contrast to the first 25 years of Uganda's independence from
Britain when government leaders were mostly Acholi or from other
northern tribes, Museveni and most members of his government are
from the south. People in the north feel they are marginalized.
	   Many of the displaced people have been herded into camps where
the army is supposed to protect them, but the LRA attacks with near
impunity.
	   Anglican minister Ben Ocan told The Associated Press his
daughter was abducted Wednesday from Gulu Primary School just
outside town.
	   ``The rebels have a stronger intelligence network than that of
the government,'' he said. ``I am praying that my daughter comes
back.
	   The rebels, who by some accounts have abducted as many as 10,000
children and young people, force them to take up arms or serve as
bearers or sex slaves.
	   Although the LRA has no clearly articulated political agenda, it
does play on Northerners' belief that the government is neglecting
them and that they are missing out on Uganda's new-found
prosperity.
	   ``It is like we are in an ocean which is not stable,'' said Gulu
resident Andrew Adimola, a member of the opposition Democratic
Party. ``Gulu appears surrounded, and the government must talk
peace with the rebels. I myself have offered to go right to where
(rebel leader Joseph) Kony is in Sudan and talk with him.''
	   Gulu District Commissioner Peter Odek Wo'Cheng told The
Associated Press a military solution is the only realistic one.
	   ``The government is defending the people by use of arms. People
accuse the government for nothing. You cannot defend people without
the use of guns,'' he said.
	   But Museveni himself has said his 40,000-strong Uganda People's
Defense Force _ his former rebel army _ suffers from indiscipline,
drunkeness and laziness.
	   ``We are in a dilemma,'' said resident Ferdinand Ochola. ``Last
week alone, the rebels have staged six attacks around the town. We
hope government becomes more serious.''

World Cup: Brazil faces Chile in South American shootout 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Almost any score is imaginable when Brazil
faces Chile, except maybe 0-0.
	   Two of the best front lines in the World Cup go head-to-head on
Saturday in a South American classic that will send the winner to
the quarterfinals and the loser home.
	   For the Brazilian duo of Ronaldo and Bebeto, Chile counters with
Marcelo Salas and Ivan Zamorano. And since neither team plays
inspired defense, a shootout is in the offing at Parc des Princes
stadium.
	   ``Chile has one of the most efficient and feared front lines in
the Cup,'' admits Brazilian midfielder Leonardo. ``But that doesn't
worry us. Their defense isn't so good. They let in almost as many
goals as they score.''
	   ``Brazil plays and lets play,'' replies Chilean defender Miguel
Ramirez. ``That's where we might have our chance. We always have
good games against them.''
	   Still, the Chileans will be heavy underdogs against defending
champion Brazil. Chile had an uneven first round, squeaking into
second place in Group B with ties against Italy, Austria and
Cameroon.
	   Coach Nelson Acosta can't even count on all his starters.
Midfielder Nelson Parraguez and defenders Moises Villarroel and
Francisco Rojas picked up their second yellow card against Cameroon
and will sit out the game with Brazil.
	   So Chile's fate rides more than ever on its twin strikers, the
most talented of a generation that has never played in a World Cup.
	   The 23-year-old Salas, headed for Italy's Lazio after the Cup
for a reported dlrs 24 million, has carried the scoring load so far
with three goals. His partner is the wily veteran Zamorano, 31,
Ronaldo's teammate on Internazionale of Milan. Backing them up is
seasoned playmaker Jose Luis Sierra.
	   ``We do not fear Brazil or anyone,'' said Zamorano, adding that
he had seen Chile's victory over Brazil in a dream.
	   But Chileans also dream of erasing a black mark in their history
_ the 1990 Cup qualifier against Brazil, when goalie Roberto Rojas
feigned an injury and the team walked off the field. The farce cost
them a two-Cup suspension by FIFA.
	   ``We shall play to the death,'' said Acosta.
	   Brazil, meanwhile, is looking to get back on track for a fifth
Cup title after a stumble against Norway in its last game.
	   After beating Scotland and Morocco to lock up first place in
Group A, Brazil fell apart in the final seven minutes against
Norway, giving up two goals in a 2-1 loss.
	   The defeat soured the team's mood and triggered a rash of
finger-pointing and recrimination. This week, the players held a
private meeting to clear the air.
	   ``We washed a lot of dirty laundry,'' said fullback Aldair.
	   Brazil should be at full strength against Chile. Cesar Samapio
returns to the midfield after sitting out the Norway game with two
yellow cards. Aldair, benched protectively with a single yellow,
also will be back.
	   Bebeto, who banged his thigh in practice Thursday and limped to
the dressing room, was expected to be ready to play.
	   ``We're back to our ideal formation,'' said coach Mario Zagallo.
``Our equilibrium is back. Brazil is coming in with morale high.''
	   The loss to Norway taught the team a lesson, players said.
Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos, who complained they weren't getting the
ball enough, promised to move more and play for the team. Playmaker
Rivaldo, the target of their criticism, pledged to pass quicker.
	   Even Dunga promised to reform. Stung by criticism of his
dictatorial style on the field, the Brazilian captain was
uncommonly silent against Norway, and Brazil seemed to miss his
leadership. Zagallo promised Dunga would be his old self against
Chile.
	   ``I hope we find ourselves again,'' said Leonardo. ``It's a new
moment. Now it's for real, and it's important to think
positively.''
	   ``When you lose, you question everything, trying to find the
mistakes,'' he added. ``Defeats bring some messages, and perhaps
the group is stronger now than before.''

Space experts seek unconventional ways to keep Mir in orbit next week, space officials signing an appeal to prime minister.

Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 9-10 with another meeting scheduled for
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space experts held a brainstorming session
Friday to try to devise ``nonstandard'' ways to keep the Mir in
orbit despite a lack of government funding.
	   Space officials have warned that Russia may have to discard the
space station a year ahead of schedule and send it crashing back to
Earth this fall unless the cash-strapped government comes up with
money.
	   The state-run RKK Energia corporation, which built Mir and has
been running it since it was put in orbit in early 1986, is owed
440 million rubles (dlrs 70 million) for station operations last
year, Energia chief Yuri Semyonov said. The government has not paid
any bills this year, he said.
	   The money shortage already threatens to stall the arrival of the
station's next crew, currently scheduled to blast off in August.
	   ``We realize the situation the government is in, so we see there
is no counting on the budget,'' the head of the Russian Space
Agency Yuri Koptev was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   A decision on whether to send a new crew needs to be made
shortly, since any replacement crew must arrive at the Mir at least
11 days before the current team leaves on Aug. 25. No extension of
the current team's stay is possible, since the useful life time of
their escape capsule runs out in late August, Koptev said.
	   ``If we cannot act, there will be a situation when we will have
to lift off the crew from the Mir in August and close the
station,'' Koptev said.
	   Experts spent the meeting trying to generate ``nonstandard
solutions'' to the problem, he said. ITAR-Tass did not say whether
the participants came up with any new ideas.
	   Apparently seeking to make one more attempt at persuading the
government to pay up, the space officials signed an appeal to Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Space officials planned to hold another meeting next week, said
Space Agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov.
	   Even abandoning the Mir in August could cause serious problems.
Left uncontrolled, the 130-ton station will gradually spin out of
orbit and fall back to Earth within two years _ with large pieces
possibly landing in populated areas.
	   Discarding the Mir properly would cost more in the short run
than leaving it in orbit. To control the station's descent to
Earth, Russia would have to launch several cargo ships over a short
period to dock with the station and use their engines to direct it
into lower orbits.
	   Russian space officials had planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir
flying until the end of 1999, after the first parts of the
international space station were placed in orbit.

Ukrainian, Polish presidents meet in Kharkiv

<TEXT>
	   KHARKIV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
his Polish counterpart Alexander Kwasniewski met Friday in this
northeastern industrial town for a two-day summit devoted to
bilateral ties.
	   After brief private talks, the two presidents visited the
Kharkiv aviation plant and watched flights of the new
Ukrainian-designed An-74 and An-140 airplanes.
	   Kuchma and Kwasniewski, accompanied by government and military
officials, were also to visit other enterprises and confer with the
business elite of the Kharkiv region, which is attracting growing
attention of foreign investors.
	   On Saturday, they are to lay wreaths at a World War II memorial
and place a symbolic Resurrection Stone at the Ukrainian-Polish
cemetery in Kharkiv.
	   The two leaders also were likely to discuss recent statements by
Polish officials suggesting that Warsaw may introduce visas for
Ukrainian travelers if the European Union demands that as a
condition for accepting Poland.
	   Many Ukrainians engaging in shuttle trade travel back and forth
between their country and Poland. The two nations signed an
agreement on visa-free travel in 1997.
	   In Kiev Thursday, the pro-government Popular Democratic Party
issued a statement saying Poland's stance on the visas could
contradict ``the spirit of partnership'' between the two countries
and threatened Europe with ``the creation of new dividing lines.''
	   Kuchma and Kwasniewski last met in late May at an international
economic forum in the Polish city of Rzeszow.

Cambodian refugees returning to homeland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of 396 Cambodian refugees were
repatriated Friday from Thailand, bringing to 619 the number who
this week voluntarily returned to their country with international
help.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a
statement that the refugees had been taken by road from a camp in
Thailand to a reception center in Sisophon district, 310 kilometers
(190 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh in Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey
province.
	   The returnees will be given a kit of basic household items, as
well as a supply of rice, fish, vegetable oil and salt from the
World Food Programme sufficient for 40 days, the U.N. refugee
agency said.
	   Since last October, more than 5,500 Cambodians have returned
voluntarily to their country, leaving 55,000 Cambodians remaining
as refugees inside Thailand.
	   Most of them fled fighting between political factions after a
coup d'etat by Cambodian strongman Hun Sen last July against his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.

Human Rights Watch urges change in draft Jordanian press law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A U.S.-based human rights group is urging
Jordan to amend a proposed press law, which it says would
``constitute unreasonable interference with the internationally
protected right to freedom of expression.''
	   In its letter to Parliament Speaker Saaed Hayel Srour, which The
Associated Press obtained Friday, the New York-based Human Rights
Watch called the bill ``an unfortunate step backward for Jordan.''
	   The government sent the bill to Parliament last week.
	   ``If the draft law is enacted without substantial revisions, we
believe that it will limit severely the right of Jordanians to
obtain and disseminate a diversity of information,'' the letter
said.
	   It added that the press bill ``represents an unwarranted attempt
by the state to limit access to information and to control the
content of what is written and read in the kingdom.''
	   Last week, deputies said the draft would restrict press freedoms
and voted to refer it to parliament's legal body for revision.
Debate is expected next month.
	   The government has argued that flexible provisions of existing
press laws have led to a freewheeling media that has violated the
ethics of professional journalism.
	   Officials have said the bill targets Jordan's 22 weekly
tabloids, which are largely affiliated with hard-line groups
opposed to King Hussein's pro-western style and the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   But the draft law would limit reporting on the military and
security forces, the king and his family, heads of state and
reports that lead to strikes, sit-ins or public gatherings,
threaten the national currency, corrupt morals, promote perversion
or contradict the principles of ``national responsibility'' and the
``values of the Arab Islamic nation.''
	   It also bans publishing information on investigations and trials
taking place in Jordan. It forces journalists to divulge their
sources in court.
	   It would apply to local and foreign journalists, writers,
cartoonists, photographers, book publishers, newspapers,
specialized journals, research institutes, polling centers and
translation houses.
	   Under the law, the state could impose sanctions against
journalists such as fines and the suspension of press credentials.

Social Democratic leader to push for a minority government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman said Friday he would push for a minority coalition with the
small center-right Christian Democrats.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman to organize a new cabinet
after the Social Democrats won last week's elections. But although
they came out on top, the center-left party has only 74 seats in
the 200-seat legislature and lack allies needed to form a majority
government.
	   ``We'll go for a minority government with a tacit support from
others,'' Zeman told journalists, adding that his party expects a
``flexible stance'' from another small center-right party, the
Freedom Union.
	   Negotiations for the future cabinet began almost immediately
after elections _ held two years early _ in a vain attempt to
overcome a political deadlock _ but are expected to take weeks to
complete.
	   While Zeman is leaning toward a minority government, Christian
Democratic leader Josef Lux, whose party captured 20 seats, prefers
a three-party Cabinet with the Social Democrats and the Freedom
Union.
	   But the Freedom Union's leader, Havel's personal friend and a
lifelong fighter against communism Jan Ruml, has firmly rejected
the idea of a coalition with the Social Democrats.
	   The media said Friday Zeman is trying to appease Ruml by
inviting the former foreign minister and Freedom Union supporter
Josef Zieleniec, to join the new government.
	   Zieleniec stepped down from office last Septmber, accusing the
leadership of the ruling Civic Democratic Party, of which he was a
member, of keeping secret funds in Switzerland.
	   His resignation triggered a wave of further accusations against
the party and caused the government to collapse, forcing the
downfall of Premiere Vaclav Klaus.
	   Late Thursday, Zeman met with President Vaclav Havel to inform
him of progress made. He said there was a forty-percent chance he
would succeed in forming a cabinet.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same. Klaus' party won
63 seats in the elections.
	   The next round of talks on forming a new government is scheduled
to start Monday, with the president meeting Lux and Ruml in
separate talks.

Manager's Association condemns Everton 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer managers Friday condemned Everton
for its treatment of Howard Kendall, whose third stint as boss at
Goodison Park was terminated Thursday.
	   League Manager's Association chief executive John Barnwell said
the events leading up to Kendall's departure from the Premier
League team had been a ``very undignified affair.''
	   ``We're unhappy with what has happened,'' he said. ``It's bad
enough leaving such a high-profile job but it's even worse when it
was drawn out like this.''
	   Kendall's third spell at Goodison Park ended ``by mutual
consent'' after weeks of speculation about his future at Everton,
which just avoided relegation last season.
	   Kendall was one of Everton's favorite sons after steering the
team to two League championships and a European Cup Winner's Cup
during his first period at the helm between 1985 and 1987.
	   He said his 1997 season progress was hindered by financial
constraints and a late pre-season arrival last June.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A methane explosion in an abandoned coal mine
shaft killed one child and injured six others near the Pacific port
city of Vladivostok on Friday, news agencies reported.
	   The explosion occurred when the children, aged eight to 12,
began throwing burning pieces of wood from a fire they had lit into
the leaky ventilator shaft in the city of Artyom, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Flying metal debris from inside the concrete shaft caused most
of their injuries, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
regional law enforcement officials.
	   One child was killed instantly. Two children were in critical
condition, and four others were hospitalized with broken bones and
other serious wounds, Interfax said.
	   A criminal inquiry into the incident has been opened, the
reports said.

Dissident arrests routine for China, embarrassing for Clinton 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: CORRECTS number detained to four.
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of dissidents at the outset of his
China visit was awkward at best for U.S. President Bill Clinton,
who has pledged to push Beijing, face-to-face, for greater
freedoms.
	   For Chinese authorities, such detentions are routine. They
underscore China's resistance to Clinton's human rights agenda, as
well as Beijing's determination to ensure that no protests mar the
president's nine-day tour.
	   Four dissidents were arrested Wednesday and Thursday in and near
the city of Xi'an, Clinton's first stop, human rights groups said.
As Clinton left Xi'an for Beijing, Yang Hai and Zhang Jiankang were
released, but the but the whereabouts of the other two could not be
confirmed.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing,''
and instructed U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to raise the issue with
Chinese authorities.
	   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, later
said it was an example of Chinese security forces ``doing what
comes naturally for them,'' and added, ``People are not debris to
be swept up for a visitor.''
	   Berger also said the White House did not believe the action
against dissidents was intended to embarrass Clinton, but that
Clinton intended to raise it in his talks Saturday.
	   Three Xi'an dissidents went to the city police bureau at around
midnight Thursday to hand over a letter protesting the arrests and
surveillance of other democracy activists, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police refused to let them through the door, so they left the
letter at a reception desk instead, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Human rights groups report arrests in China and other forms of
harassment nearly every day, often in statements faxed to foreign
reporters. Local officials and police rarely comment.
	   Lu Siqing, who runs the Hong Kong-based monitoring group, said
police were following regulations, many of them internal,
accumulated over dozens of years of authoritarian rule that tell
them how to act when important people visit or at politically
sensitive times.
	   ``Police are just acting according to their regulations. They
have no concepts of human rights. They think `I must act according
to the rules,''' Lu said. ``It's their habit.''
	   Officials claim there are no dissidents in China. They allege,
as Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said earlier this week in a news
conference, that most people described as dissidents have
``violated China's criminal law.''
	   Authoritative statistics are lacking on the number of dissidents
or political prisoners imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or forced
into exile, where many continue to work for political change back
home.
	   A 1996 report by Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, recorded about 2,000 people either jailed or subject
to occasional detentions for political or religious activities.
Human Rights Watch, in a 1994 book, documented 1,700 Chinese
imprisoned for political, ethnic or religious beliefs.
	   Many political activists who remain in China complain of
harassment by police and state security agents, of having trouble
running businesses or holding steady jobs.
	   Despite the constant risk of arrest and other trouble, many
still dare to publicize their beliefs.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news agencies _
urging him to speak out for freedom and the release of political
prisoners and to meet with dissidents during his stay.
	   Tang, other Chinese officials and White House advisers have said
Clinton has no such plans.
	   Lin Xinshu, a veteran dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province who often gets involved in public appeals for greater
freedom, said dozens of police were standing vigil outside his
door.
	   ``I called their chief and told him not to put so many out
there. One or two would do,'' Lin said. ``After all, I'm old and
not very healthy, how could I cause any trouble?''

<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ In a dusty village square, U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Friday celebrated local elections as ``a window for
all the world to see'' the progress democracy can bring to China.
En route to Beijing for a state visit he rummaged among the
excavated ruins of an ancient emperor.
	   On the second day of his China tour, Clinton delivered a message
of democracy in a brick-walled dirt plaza, brushed and bannered for
the occasion, with schoolchildren in blue and white waving bouquets
and singing songs. It was a stark contrast to the reported
detention of several Chinese dissidents, and Clinton was quick to
express his unease.
	   From Xiahe, Clinton went to the nearby excavations of the
Terracotta Warriors, an army of more than 7,000 pottery soldiers
and horses, created and buried 2,200 years ago to guard the tomb of
Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. They were unearthed beginning in 1974,
when Xiahe villagers found one while digging a well, and now are
displayed in their burial pits in giant archeological museums.
	   ``I kept thinking how interesting it was that this emperor
thought so much about his death,'' Clinton told reporters
accompanying him. He described the experience of wandering through
the ruins of an emperor's resting place ``a good argument for a
little humility.''
	   During his tour, Clinton stopped often and looked intently into
the faces of some of the warriors. At one point he made his Chinese
guides laugh when he mugged for the official photographers,
standing next to one of the warriors to show his nearly identical
height.
	   The informality was a contrast to his coming state welcome in
the vast, haunted splendor of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where
Chinese troops bloodily repressed democracy demonstrators nine
years ago. Clinton arrived in Beijing this evening and was spending
the night at a government guest house.
	   President Jiang Zemin greets him Saturday morning by the Great
Hall of the People. The Tiananmen setting stirred protests in
Congress in advance; the House adopted a resolution saying Clinton
shouldn't go there.

Lebanese prisoners return home to festive welcome from Israeli defense minister

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom and a tumultuous welcome from thousands
in southern Lebanon Friday.
	   The release completed a swap launched Thursday, when Lebanon
exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier for the bodies of 40
guerrillas.
	   The rare exchange prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to urge Lebanon to negotiate an agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
	   ``I very much hope that the Lebanese ... will move forward with
the initiative in order to change the situation in Lebanon,''
Mordechai said, adding that he hoped the Syrians would give their
blessings to such negotiations.
	   Lebanon has informed Israel that it will not conduct any
negotiations until Israel has reached agreement with the
Palestinians on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, the
Haaretz daily quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
	   At the Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous on the edge of
the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, government troops
distributed refreshments to the freed men.
	   A convoy of three buses and an ambulance bearing signs of the
International Committee of the Red Cross inched past the border
toward thousands of relatives and well wishers.
	   Prisoners smiled and waved to the crowd. Some people broke into
tears and showered rice on the buses in a traditional Arab welcome.
	   Soldiers tried to keep order as activists swarmed around the
buses and on their roofs, shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is
Great.''
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, crippled when a
bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel room two years
ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to blow up an
Israeli airliner.
	   His wife and mother rushed to join him in the ambulance.
	   Ten of the prisoners had been held in Israeli jails and 50 were
held in the Khiam detention camp in the occupied zone in southern
Lebanon. Lebanese officials said 167 prisoners remain in Khiam or
in Israel.
	   Four prisoners chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone
and one decided to stay in Israel, ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques
Fresard said.
	   Some of the prisoners have been held for as long as 14 years and
most were held without trial on suspicion of aiding guerrillas
fighting Israeli forces.
	   An Israeli government statement said the prisoners to be
released did not have ``blood on their hands.''
	   Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah and Amal guerrilla groups
as well as the Lebanese Communist Party and the national flag hung
from light poles and trees along the road, reflecting the politics
of the released.
	   Hezbollah supporters shouted ``Death to Israel'' and ``Death to
America.'' Communist activists danced the dabke, a folk dance.
	   Anis Fouani, 63, said he felt ``extreme happiness and joy'' as
he awaited the arrival of his son, Ali, who was 17 when he was
taken by Israeli forces from his home in the occupied zone 14 years
ago and jailed in Khiam.
	   ``We're all with the resistance until the liberation of south
Lebanon,'' he said.
	   The exchange started late Thursday when the remains of Israeli
Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya were swapped for the bodies of 40
guerrillas killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
	   Lebanon accorded the bodies full military honors late Thursday,
reflecting the government's recognition of the guerrillas as
national heroes. The bodies are to be buried Saturday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, the remains of Ilya, a naval
commando killed in a botched raid in the south in September, were
sent home. The remains were received with full military honors.

Possible first death in Singapore from Taiwanese killer virus 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: KK Women's and Children's Hospital takes an ampersand
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A toddler in Singapore has died of a virus
similar to the one that has killed scores of children in Taiwan,
but it is not clear whether the sicknesses are the same, the
government said Friday.
	   Enterovirus 71 has swept through Taiwan since mid-May, killing
50 children and sickening thousands of others.
	   A joint statement from Singapore's health and environment
ministries said a 4 1/2-year-old Chinese boy died from
complications Thursday after a severe enterovirus infection.
	   The government said results from laboratory tests to determine
exactly which enterovirus had killed the toddler would be available
in one to four weeks.
	   Enterovirus describes a large group of different viruses, almost
all of which are not lethal. Hand, foot and mouth disease _ the
original diagnosis in the boy's case _ is caused by one such
enterovirus.
	   The ministries said investigations into the child's background
were conducted, and neither the boy nor his family had traveled to
Taiwan. The statement noted that enterovirus is a common infection
in Singapore.
	   The head of the pediatric department at KK Women's and
Children's Hospital, where the boy died, told The Associated Press
that the case was ``very unusual,'' noting that no children have
ever died from an enterovirus infection in Singapore.
	   Dr. Phua Kang Boo said that ``enterovirus 71 occurs in
Singapore, and last year there were 22 cases.'' But none of these
cases were virulent, and all the children recovered.
	   He added that the Taiwan strain is ``particularly vicious.''
	   In the cases in Taiwan, the virus broke down immunity and left
the infants susceptible to encephalitis, meningitis, and acute
inflammation of the heart. The child in Singapore died from
encephalitis and mycarditis, according to the government.
	   Children under five are especially susceptible to enterovirus
infections, which are usually spread by physical contact via
oral-faecal transmission. Early symptoms are similar to the flu,
including fever, headache and vomiting.
	   The ministries advised Singaporeans to be vigilant in
identifying the symptoms, urged good hygiene practices, and advised
parents to keep children exhibiting signs of infection away from
crowded public places.

Singapore industrial output shrinking as economy slows 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Led by a sharp decline in its electronics
sector, Singapore's industrial output shrank 4.5 percent in May
compared to a year earlier, the government said Friday.
	   Singapore's electronics output shrank for the second consecutive
month, falling a hefty 9.6 percent in May from a year earlier,
according to the Economic Development Board. In April, it dropped
4.4 percent.
	   The country's economy has been slowing along with other Asian
countries, and growing body of recent data suggest Singapore may
enter a recession sometime this year.
	   A number of analysts, economists and investment houses have
predicted outright contraction in 1998, and the prime minister has
admitted that the economy may shrink for the first time since the
mid-80's.
	   The EDB report said the decline in electronics dragged down
total output, despite increases in chemicals and engineering.
	   The board also said that except for computer peripherals and
assembled printed circuit boards, all major segments of the
electronics sector posted lower output in May.
	   ``Weak demand lowered the output levels of personal computers
and telecommunications equipment,'' it said, ``while the persistent
market oversupply continued to depress the output of disk drives.''
	   The EDB said oversupply also plagued semiconductor
manufacturing, while the downtrend in consumer electronics
continued.
	   But the board pointed out that over the first five months of the
year, output rose 3 percent compared with the same period in 1997.
Last month, industrial output was up 2.0 percent on the year.

Coach Troussier returns to face angry fans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ French soccer coach Philippe
Troussier returned to South Africa Friday to face angry fans after
the national team's failure in the World Cup.
	   Troussier, surrounded by 15 police as he walked through the main
Johannesburg airport, said he had planned to stay on in France to
follow the rest of the finals but ``felt compelled to come back
since I was the coach in charge.''
	   The Frenchman took over the South African squad, known as Bafana
Bafana or ``the boys'' in the local Zulu language, in February.
	   The South African Football Association said then his contract
would end after the World Cup.
	   That has not changed, said SAFA head Molefi Oliphant on Friday.
Trott Moloto, Troussier's assistant, will take over until a new
coach is found.
	   Troussier told reporters he was keen to stay on to guide the
squad to the next African Cup of Nations in two years time.
	   ``Taking into consideration the fact that this was our World Cup
debut, I don't think we performed that badly. At least we collected
two points in a difficult tournament,'' Troussier said. `` I think
it is just that the expectations were too much.''
	   South Africa were eliminated in the World Cup first round after
losing 3-0 to France, drawing 1-1 with Denmark and drawing 2-2 with
Saudi Arabia.
	   ``There are countries who have been participating for a long
time but failed to register a single point,'' Troussier said.
	   After years of sporting isolation during the apartheid era, the
nation's first all-race elections in 1994 brought South Africa back
to international competitions.
	   Troussier said he was happy with players he chose in France.
	   South African commentators have blamed the 3-0 loss to France on
Troussier's exclusion of striker Jerry Sikhosana and midfielder Doc
Khumalo.
	   The returning players were greeted at the Johannesburg airport
by about 500 fans. One jeered that Troussier ``doesn't understand
our kind of football.''
	   Lucas Radebe, the team captain, said players gained valuable
experience in the competition.
	   ``We deserved to be there. Unfortunately we did not produce the
required results ... surely we are a force to be reckoned with in
the future,'' he said.

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders: `no magic peace.' intensified. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke leaving, comments, NATO planning
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, trying
to head off NATO intervention in the conflict over secessionist
Kosovo, ended four days of Balkan shuttle diplomacy Friday saying
he'd found no easy formula for peace.
	   Arriving in Kosovo from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke met first with Adem Demaci,
an Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence.
	   He then saw the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, before flying to Athens, Greece.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke told reporters.
	   He said he hopes that in the next two or three days, a
diplomatic observer mission consisting of scores or even hundreds
of foreigners will get going in Kosovo, scouring it to observe
fighting and observe tension first hand.
	   Holbrooke noted that ``in the last two days, NATO has
accelerated and concentrated their planning.'' NATO has warned of
military intervention if Milosevic fails to come to a diplomatic
accommodation with the ethnic Albanians.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for at least some Serbian security forces
to withdraw from Kosovo and for both the Serbs and Albanians to
resume talks over the political future of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.

UN plans to double food aid to Sudan where famine looms 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with UN clarifying number of tons delivered per month
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with growing food shortages in Sudan, a U.N.
agency said Friday it planned to double its aid deliveries to the
area.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said the Sudanese government,
which has been fighting rebels since 1983, had recently given it
permission to fly over virtually the entire country for air drops.
The government had been enforcing several no-fly zones.
	   With extra planes, WFP expects to increase its capacity to
15,000 tons of food per month. It said that some 2.6 million people
faced famine if they did not receive aid, and that in certain areas
up to 15 children per day are dying from malnutrition.

Central bank cuts reserve requirement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank Friday
said it is cutting its statutory reserve requirement for commercial
banks, a move described by analysts as a step toward a softer
monetary policy.
	   In a statement, Bank Negara Malaysia said the reserve
requirement cut _ from 10 percent to 8 percent, is aimed at
reducing the cost of funds to the banking sector. It is the second
cut this year.
	   The cut is aimed at allowing banks to have access to more funds
and greater opportunity to extend new loans. Bank Negara said the
new measure will release around 8 billion ringgit (dlrs 2 billion)
to the banking sector.
	   ``Basically, we're seeing this because Malaysian corporates are
cash strapped,'' said economist Jimmy Koh at Independent Economic
Analysis.
	   ``The Malaysian economy is so highly geared that if they
continue to have high interest rates, the economy will collapse.''
	   Bank Negara said the cut was part of measures taken to ``ensure
that the Malaysian economy does not spiral into major economic
slowdown while maintaining the macroeconomic objectives that have
been announced earlier this year.''
	   Domestic lending in Malaysia accounts for around 160 percent of
gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in Asia.
	   However, lending has been slowing down sharply because banks are
fearful of being dragged down by a growing burden of bad loans.
	   However, the central bank said it would continue to lend to the
interbank market at 11 percent. The last time the reserve
requirement was cut, to 10 percent from 13.5 percent in March, Bank
Negara compensated for the extra liquidity by hiking the rate at
which it lends to the interbank market.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has repeatedly blamed Bank
Negara's tight monetary policy for stifling businesses and impeding
recovery.
	   Friday's move coincides with the installation of Daim Zainuddin
as a Cabinet-ranked minister supervise the economy. Daim has backed
Mahathir on a softer monetary policy.
	   Mahathir's deputy and finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has
steered a different path, saying tighter policies and higher
interest rates were needed to contain inflation and check the
sliding ringgit.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Japan have made considerable progress
in preparing a peace treaty that would formally end World War II, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   The two countries have never signed a treaty ending the war
because of a dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain that were
seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news
briefing that the latest meeting between a Russian and Japanese
treaty commission in Tokyo on June 22 ``showed the sides'
constructive mood and converging positions on the majority of the
issues,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said the two sides ``have started to coordinate the main
provisions of the future treaty, except for the territorial
issues.''
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament's lower house, said
Russia will never allow the Kurils to fall under Japanese
jurisdiction.
	   ``There has been some speculation recently about a possible
handover of some of our territories to certain countries,''
Seleznyov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``This will
never happen,'' he said, adding that the Russian Constitution
clearly prohibits such actions.

Social Democratic leader to push for a minority government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman said Friday he would push for a minority coalition with the
small center-right Christian Democrats.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman to organize a new cabinet
after the Social Democrats won last week's elections, but the
center-left party has only 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature and
lacks allies needed to form a majority government.
	   ``We'll go for a minority government with a tacit support from
others,'' Zeman told journalists, adding that his party expects a
``flexible stance'' from another small center-right party, the
Freedom Union.
	   Negotiations for the future cabinet began almost immediately
after elections _ held two years early in a vain attempt to
overcome a political deadlock _ but are expected to take weeks to
complete.
	   While Zeman is leaning toward a minority government, Christian
Democratic leader Josef Lux, whose party captured 20 seats, prefers
a three-party Cabinet with the Social Democrats and the Freedom
Union.
	   Freedom Union leader Jan Ruml has firmly rejected the idea of a
coalition with the Social Democrats. Zeman is reportedly trying to
appease Ruml by inviting the former foreign minister and Freedom
Union supporter Josef Zieleniec, to join the new government.
	   Zieleniec stepped down from office last Septmber, accusing the
leadership of his Civic Democratic Party, of which he was a member,
of keeping secret funds in Switzerland.
	   His resignation triggered a wave of further accusations against
the party and caused the government to collapse, forcing the
downfall of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
	   Late Thursday, Zeman met with President Vaclav Havel and told
him there was a forty-percent chance he would succeed in forming a
cabinet.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same. Klaus' party won
63 seats in the elections.
	   The next round of talks on forming a new government is scheduled
to start Monday, with the president meeting Lux and Ruml in
separate talks.

Report: Next stage of Israeli spy satellite project approved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Defense Ministry has approved funding
for the next stage of the Israeli spy satellite, Ofek, a newspaper
said Friday.
	   After the failure of an Ofek launch in January, ministry
director Ilan Biran had held up budget approval until the cause for
the mishap was established, the Jerusalem Post said.
	   Ofek 4 was launched with an Israeli-manufactured Shavit missile
from a base in southern Israel. Radio reports said at the time that
the first stage went off without a hitch, but that problems were
detected two minutes into the second stage and the launch was
aborted.
	   An earlier version of the satellite, Ofek 3, has been in orbit
since 1995. According to foreign reports, it has provided
information on Iran, Iraq and Syria. Israel is especially worried
about Iran's attempts to develop nuclear weapons and long-range
missiles capable of reaching Israel.

Palestinian leaders call for general strike in east Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders called for a general strike
in Jerusalem on Saturday to protest Israel's plans for expanding
the disputed city to maintain a Jewish majority.
	   The strike plans were announced in a leaflet signed by the major
Palestinian political groups and distributed in the city Friday.
	   Saturday also mark's the 31st anniversary of Israel's annexation
of east Jerusalem, the sector it captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to make east Jerusalem, home to
180,000 Palestinians, their future capital.
	   Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan that
would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West
Bank settlements and expand the city's boundaries westward.
	   Planners wrote that one of the objectives was to maintain a
Jewish majority of 70 percent. Demographers have predicted that
unless the government intervenes, Palestinians could make up 40
percent of the city by 2020 because of a higher birth rate.
	   Palestinians have denounced the expansion plan as an attempt to
pre-empt the outcome of negotiations that would determine the final
status of the city. Such talks have yet to begin.
	   ``This strike will show the Israelis that we stand against the
conspiracy to make east Jerusalem Jewish,'' the leaflet said.
	   The leaflet also urged Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem
not to participate in the Jerusalem municipal elections in
November. Most Palestinians believe voting is tantamount to
recognizing Israel's annexation.
	   However, the boycott has also deprived the Palestinians of
political clout in the city. At stake in November is the
re-election bid of the hardline mayor, Ehud Olmert.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement staged a march protesting the Jerusalem
plan. Waving flags and marching through downtown Nablus, some 200
protesters chanted: ``Jerusalem is ours, there is no peace without
Jerusalem.''

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders plans, refugee agency allowed into Junik in western Kosovo; three Serbs kidnapped. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Holbrooke warning NATO stepping up
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Friday that NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in
secessionist Kosovo and said his four days of shuttle diplomacy in
Yugoslavia yielded no magic formula for peace.
	   Both Serbian security forces and Albanian militants fighting for
independence should be aware that their next major clash could have
``tragic consequences,'' Holbrooke said, speaking briefly to
reporters at Pristina airport as Yugoslav fighter jets screamed
overhead. He then flew to Athens, Greece.
	   Arriving in Kosovo from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke held an unusual and lengthy
meeting with Adem Demaci, an Albanian who spent 28 years in
Yugoslav jails for advocating Kosovo's independence.
	   Unlike the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, Demaci is more of an advocate of armed struggle for
independence. As such, he could be a link to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the separatist fighters who increasingly threaten the Serbian
security forces' hold on the restive province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   Demaci refused to say anything about his talks with Holbrooke.
The American denied he saw Demaci as a link to the KLA, whose
fighters he met in western Kosovo during a tour of the province's
war zone on Wednesday.
	   Holbrooke also saw Rugova before leaving Friday.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Foreign powers fear the increasingly violent conflict could
flare into a wider Balkan war.
	   Holbrooke said NATO planning for some kind of intervention in
Kosovo had accelerated in the past two days. The Alliance staged a
show of air power around Kosovo's borders last week that was
intended to persuade Milosevic to withdraw special police forces
held largely responsible for recent assaults on ethnic Albanian
civilians and villages thought to harbor KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke and NATO want Milosevic to pull back, and the
Albanians to cease fire and return to talks with the Serbian
authorities. They firmly rule out the Kosovo Albanians' aim of
independence, saying instead that they should negotiate a return or
expansion of the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   But the still shadowy KLA has been gaining ground in Kosovo, and
swelled in numbers after Serbian police began a crackdown which has
killed more than 300 people since March.
	   They insist they will fight their way to independence, making it
harder for the pacifist Rugova to back down from that goal.
	   Holbrooke noted that fighting between the KLA and Serbian
security forces is escalating around Kijevo, a key crossroads on
the main east-west road between Kosovo's capital Pristina, and the
western, Serb-dominated town of Pec.
	   Fighting has intensified this week around the village, which is
surrounded by KLA fighters who are themselves surrounded by Serb
police checkpoints.
	   ``There is no question that the Serb security forces with their
overwhelming preponderance of power could force open the (KLA)
checkpoint in the road (to Kijevo),'' said Holbrooke. ``There is
equally no question that such an action would have tragic
consequences.''
	   Holbrooke said a Kosovo observer mission of diplomats from
dozens of countries will likely arrive in Kosovo in the next few
days.
	   ``Their job will be to travel throughout Kosovo and learn what
they can and help calm the situation,'' he said.
	   Both sides report events largely through their media in
Pristina, preventing independent confirmation often by refusing
access to the area of action.
	   The U.N. refugee agency did say, however, that the Serbs on
Thursday allowed an aid convoy through to hundreds of refugees,
mostly women and children, trapped in the western village of Junik.
They reported them in ``pretty bad physical shape.''
	   Holbrooke reminded both sides that they need to dismantle
checkpoints. He said he has no means of communicating with the KLA,
but stressed: ``They should be listening to this press
conference.''
	   On Friday, the Serbs' Media Center reported that two Serbs had
been found shot dead in their car in northwest Kosovo, reportedly
gunned down in an ambush. Another three Serbs were reported
kidnapped from the village of Pantina as they fled a KLA attack. An
unknown number of other Serbs from that village are missing, the
Serbs' Media Center said.
	   The Serbs also said that supplies were running short in Kijevo,
which they said had been under militant attack overnight and into
Friday.

Violence must be prevented, human rights commissioner says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The world needs to work to prevent
violent conflicts, not just react to them after the fact, the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees said Monday at the opening of a
human rights conference.
	   ``I believe our shortcomings have not been due to limited
resources, but to limited political will,'' said Mary Robinson, the
human rights commissioner and former Irish president.
	   Since the end of the Cold War, long-simmering internal conflicts
have boiled over into violence in many corners of the world. Last
year alone saw clashes in 34 countries, she said.
	   Instead of reacting to the violence broadcast on TV, ``to a
worrying degree we are turning away to make a telephone call or get
a cup of coffee,'' she said.
	   Civilians bear the brunt of the violence, with civilian
casualties outnumbering military casualties 9-to-1.
	   International officials can do more to stop violence by
addressing its root causes, such as poverty, lack of education and
prejudice. The conflict in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo is a
prime example, she said.
	   At a press conference following her speech, Robinson said the
world knew about the longstanding ethnic conflicts in the province
long before the shooting started, but failed to do anything to
prevent the violence that has engulfed Kosovo. More than 300 have
died in clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians since
March.
	   She said the violent backlash was ``connected with the denial of
so many rights for so long.''
	   During the two-day conference, participants will discuss justice
in post-conflict countries, focusing on Angola, Mozambique, Albania
and Bosnia.
	   ``Without justice, lasting peace and sustainable development
remains an illusion,'' said Benita Ferrero-Waldner, state secretary
of Austria's Foreign Ministry.
	   To attain that, setting up an international court to hold people
accountable for their crimes is indispensable , Robinson said.
	   ``It is a terrible shame on us that it is more likely that
somebody will get away with killing 100,000 people than one
murder,'' she said.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. officials gathered in Rome, Italy, to
begin hammering out a treaty on the world's first permanent
international war crimes tribunal. The court would try individuals
accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   The conference continues Saturday and will feature a public
assembly with such dignitaries as former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nigerian Nobel
laureate Wole Soyinka and actor Michael Douglas.

Cambodia seeks more foreign funds for election 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Cambodia-Elections
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Just one day after campaigning
officially began, Cambodia's National Election Committee on Friday
appealed to foreign donors for an additional dlrs 5.1 million to
help conduct the July 26 poll.
	   Without new funds, the body ``will be unable to fulfill its
mandate properly,'' committee spokesman Leng Sochea said in a
statement.
	   It was one of the first suggestions from the government that
there may be hitches in the election process.
	   Cambodia already has been pledged more than dlrs 10 million in
election aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan,
and almost dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has expressed serious doubts over the
ability of the government to conduct a fair election, is providing
the money solely to non-governmental groups.
	   Chhay Kim, who heads the finance subcommittee of the election
committee, said Friday that dlrs 2.6 million is needed to pay for
polling, transportation of ballot boxes and counting.
	   An additional dlrs 2 million will be required for logistical
support, for training of election officials, and for voter
education. Another dlrs 500,000 should be set aside for last-minute
problems, he said.
	   United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan earlier this week
pledged his personal willingness to help Cambodia in its upcoming
elections, and called on donor countries to help pay for the
balloting.

Serbs allow U.N. aid agency access to refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Serbian security forces have allowed the U.N.
refugee agency access to hundreds of refugees in conflict-hit parts
of the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the agency said
Friday.
	   A UNHCR aid convoy was allowed to pass through security lines
Thursday and was led by Kosovo rebels to an area near the village
of Junik, where some 600 people are living, said UNHCR spokesman
Kris Janowski in Geneva.
	   UNHCR had previously been prevented by the Serb authorities from
reaching areas of the province where it suspects large numbers of
refugees are camped out, waiting to cross over the border into
Albania.
	   ``We need access on a regular basis both from the Serbian
authorities and from the other side,'' he said. ``The very fact
that the Serbian authorities allowed us to go to that area and
visit those people is progress in itself.''
	   Janowski said the refugees were mostly children, women and
elderly ``in a pretty bad physical shape'' living in makeshift
shelters. The children, who made up about one third of the
refugees, appeared very exhausted and some were quite sick, he
said.
	   ``The bottom line is that they are afraid to go back to areas
controlled by the Serbian security forces,'' said Janowski.
	   For weeks, Serbs trying to wipe out the independence-seeking
Kosovo Liberation Army have targeted the border communities, aiming
to seal off the secessionist province and prevent an influx of new
arms and fighters.
	   Some of the villages along Kosovo's border with Albania were
still being targeted by sporadic fire, Janowski said.

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ Navy commandos found nine bodies
Friday in a captured North Korean submarine, all shot dead in an
apparent suicide pact. Seoul said the sub was on a spy mission and
demanded that North Korea apologize for it.
	   ``North Korea must acknowledge that the incident was a serious
act of provocation, punish those involved and take action to
prevent the recurrence of similar incidents,'' the Defense Ministry
said in a statement.
	   The ministry rejected an earlier North Korean claim that the
submarine ``had been missing on a routine training mission after
experiencing mechanical problems.''
	   The ministry said it was asking the American-led U.N. Command to
lodge a formal protest with North Korea.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   President Kim Dae-jung denounced the sub's intrusion but said
the incident would not sway his engagement policy toward the
North's communist government.
	   Kim's ``sunshine policy'' calls for expanded exchanges and
cooperation in an effort to open up the North's closed society.
	   The 70-ton Yugo-class submarine was found in South Korean waters
off the east coast on Monday with its propeller and periscope
tangled in a fishing net.
	   The sub was brought to this major naval base for examination.
	   The navy had delayed opening the hatch overnight for fear it was
booby-trapped. To make sure the hatch was safe, workers drilled six
holes in the submarine and inserted tiny, remote-controlled cameras
to survey it.
	   Then they cut through the hatch with welding torches and found
the bodies. Four were found in the rear of the submarine, the rest
in other compartments, officials said.
	   Four of the North Koreans had been shot in the head, while the
other five had been shot in other parts of the body, said Lt. Col.
Kim Jong-sook. Two automatic rifles were found near the bodies.
	   Kim, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said two South
Korean-made plastic beverage containers were found in the sub _ an
indication the vessel was returning north after dropping or picking
up spies.
	   Other items seized include two shoulder-fired rocket launchers,
two light machine guns, two pistols, four hand-grenades, a set of
U.S.-made diving gear, a camcorder, and three sets of frogmen's
flippers, he said.
	   Kim also said all equipment inside the submarine was intact and
would provide ``valuable information about North Korean navy and
the commando activities.''
	   A day after it was captured, the sub sank while being towed. Bad
weather hampered the salvage operation for two days, but the sub
was finally raised Thursday.
	   The sub was found in the general area where a larger North
Korean sub ran aground in 1996. That incursion triggered a 53-day
manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   In that episode, 10 North Koreans reportedly were shot to death
by one of their commanders, who then killed himself.

Striking coal miners block traffic in downtown Kiev

Eds: UPDATES throughout with protest ending, details

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of striking Ukrainian miners blocked
Kiev's main street Friday, accusing the government of failing to
pay overdue wages and violating agreements with workers.
	   The protesters sat on the pavement of Khreshchatik street,
banging their helmets in a rhythm that has become common in the
Ukrainian capital in recent weeks.
	   Police observed but did not intervene in the seven-hour
demonstration, which created traffic jams across central Kiev. Two
miners were taken in for questioning but later released.
	   ``This action is a gesture of despair,'' said Volodymyr
Martynov, a leader of the Coal Industry Workers' Union, the largest
miners' group.
	   The former Soviet republic's coal industry is plagued by lack of
funds and a huge backlog in unpaid wages which has led to scattered
strikes that began last month and still continue at some mines.
	   Miners at one company in eastern Ukraine staged a march to Kiev
and besieged government buildings earlier this month, but returned
to their homes when some money was paid.
	   Protesters Friday accused the government of violating a general
accord with the coal workers signed in late May and denounced plans
to close old mines and purchase cheap coal abroad.
	   The Verhkovna Rada, or parliament, debated industry problems on
Friday, while union leaders met with premier Valery Pustovoitenko.
The demonstrators dispersed after working out some thorny details
of a separate deal that the authorities signed with their union
Thursday.
	   Besides funding problems, Ukraine's mines are known for outdated
equipment and accidents caused by poor safety measures.
	   The pattern continued this week with three more miners killed in
job-related accidents in eastern Ukraine, according to the
Emergency Situations Ministry. The deaths Wednesday brought the
total of coal industry fatalities to about 180 this year.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The prime ministers of the four-nation Central
Asian Union signed a wide array of cooperation agreements in the
Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek on Friday, a news agency reported.
	   The delegates from Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and
Uzbekistan agreed to cooperate on research and development
programs, and will join forces in sanitary and epidemic control,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   They will also coordinate on providing health care to the
region, which lies between Russia, China, and the Middle East.
	   But the leaders of the former Soviet republics postponed
discussing the creation of an international hydroelectric power
consortium until the union's next meeting, scheduled for the end of
September in the Kazak capital of Astana.

Ministry denies plot to kidnap Americans in Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government denied reports
Friday that police had uncovered a plot by suspected Islamic
militants to kidnap Americans in Egypt and swap them for jailed
extremist leaders.
	   A security official said Thursday the plot was revealed during
investigations into the activities of 17 men detained earlier this
month for attempting to revive al-Jihad, a radical Muslim group.
	   Al-Jihad had claimed responsibility for the 1981 assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   But Egypt's Middle East News Agency, quoting an unidentified
Interior Ministry official, called the report ``baseless.''
	   ``The reports about the kidnapping of American citizens are not
correct. The group was only trying to spread its ideology among the
youth,'' the official told the news agency.
	   Officials at the Interior Ministry were not available to comment
Friday, the Muslim sabbath. The government often uses the agency to
release official statements.
	   The security official had said investigations showed the 17
detainees wanted to secure the release of Aboud el-Zommor, who is
serving a 40-year sentence for taking part in Sadat's
assassination.
	   They also wanted to free Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is
currently serving a life sentence in the United States.

Dissident arrests routine for China, embarrassing for Clinton 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with three dissidents released.
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of several dissidents at the outset
of his China visit was awkward at best for U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who hoped to diffuse criticism of his summit here by
making a face-to-face push for greater freedoms.
	   For Chinese authorities, detention of dissidents are routine.
They underscore China's resistance to Clinton's human rights
agenda, as well as Beijing's determination to ensure that no
protests mar the president's nine-day tour.
	   According to human rights groups, four dissidents were detained
Wednesday and Thursday in and near the city of Xi'an, the first
stop on Clinton's China tour. As Clinton left for Beijing, Yang
Hai, Yan Jun and Zhang Jiankang were released, but the whereabouts
of Li Zhiying remained unknown.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing,''
and instructed U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to raise the issue with
Chinese authorities.
	   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, later
said it was an example of Chinese security forces ``doing what
comes naturally for them,'' and added, ``People are not debris to
be swept up for a visitor.''
	   Berger also said the White House did not believe the action
against dissidents was intended to embarrass Clinton, but that
Clinton intended to raise it in his talks Saturday.
	   Three Xi'an dissidents went to the city police bureau at around
midnight Thursday to hand over a letter protesting the arrests and
surveillance of other democracy activists, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police refused to let them through the door, so they left the
letter at a reception desk instead, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Human rights groups report arrests in China and other forms of
harassment nearly every day, often in statements faxed to foreign
reporters. Local officials and police rarely comment.
	   Lu Siqing, who runs the Hong Kong-based monitoring group, said
police were following regulations, many of them internal,
accumulated over dozens of years of authoritarian rule that tell
them how to act when important people visit or at politically
sensitive times.
	   ``Police are just acting according to their regulations. They
have no concepts of human rights. They think `I must act according
to the rules,''' Lu said. ``It's their habit.''
	   Officials claim there are no dissidents in China. They allege,
as Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said earlier this week in a news
conference, that most people described as dissidents have
``violated China's criminal law.''
	   Authoritative statistics are lacking on the number of dissidents
or political prisoners imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or forced
into exile, where many continue to work for political change back
home.
	   A 1996 report by Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, recorded about 2,000 people either jailed or subject
to occasional detentions for political or religious activities.
Human Rights Watch, in a 1994 book, documented 1,700 Chinese
imprisoned for political, ethnic or religious beliefs.
	   Many political activists who remain in China complain of
harassment by police and state security agents, of having trouble
running businesses or holding steady jobs.
	   Despite the constant risk of arrest and other trouble, many
still dare to publicize their beliefs.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news agencies _
urging him to speak out for freedom and the release of political
prisoners and to meet with dissidents during his stay.
	   Tang, other Chinese officials and White House advisers have said
Clinton has no such plans.
	   Lin Xinshu, a veteran dissident based in southeastern Fujian
province who often gets involved in public appeals for greater
freedom, said dozens of police were standing vigil outside his
door.
	   ``I called their chief and told him not to put so many out
there. One or two would do,'' Lin said. ``After all, I'm old and
not very healthy, how could I cause any trouble?''

Danish haute couture designer Erik Mortensen dead at 72 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Erik Mortensen, one of haute
couture's leading figures as the head of French fashion houses
Pierre Balmain and Jean-Louis Scherrera, has died at age 72, Danish
national radio said Friday.
	   The Danish-born Mortensen, who had been suffering from cancer,
died in Paris, the radio report said.
	   Mortensen entered the Pierre Balmain house in Paris in 1948.
After Balmain's death in 1982, he became chief designer until 1990
when he quit to work for rival house Jean-Louis Scherrer.
	   He was awarded the prestigious Golden Thimble in 1983, 1987 and
1994 and was a member of the French Knight of the Arts and Letter
order.
	   In the mid-1980s, Mortensen created new uniforms for the French
police, replacing the famed `'kepi'' hats with a flat cap inspired
by American police.
	   In 1994, Mortensen retired to southern France but led an active
life, designing gowns for royalty and wealthy customers. He also
created theater costumes for plays in Denmark and wrote two books
in Danish, including an autobiography that became a bestseller at
home.
	   No information was given about the date of his death, funeral
arrangements or survivors.

Hong Kong leader sets up group for reunification monument 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has appointed a
group of prominent business people and academics to draw up plans
for the building of a monument to mark Hong Kong's reunification
with China, the government announced Friday.
	   A statement said the group, headed by businessman Leung
Chun-ying, will consider the cost and design of the monument, which
will commemorate the handover of Hong Kong to China last year after
156 years of British rule.
	   Leung is a member of the Executive Council, which serves as
Tung's de facto cabinet.
	   The statement said the group will also consider a new name for
Government House, the former residence of British governors.
	   Tung decided not to use Government House as his residence
because he didn't like the feng shui or geomancy in the area.
	   Chris Patten was the last British governor to occupy Government
House, which was built in 1855.

Human Rights Watch urges change in draft Jordanian press law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A U.S.-based human rights group is urging
Jordan to amend a proposed press law, which it says would
``constitute unreasonable interference with the internationally
protected right to freedom of expression.''
	   In a letter to Parliament Speaker Saaed Hayel Srour, the New
York-based Human Rights Watch called the bill ``an unfortunate step
backward for Jordan.'' The Associated Press obtained a copy of the
letter Friday,
	   The government has argued that flexible provisions of existing
press laws have led to a freewheeling media that has violated the
ethics of professional journalism.
	   Last week, deputies said the draft of the new law would restrict
press freedoms and they voted to refer it to parliament's legal
body for revision. Debate is expected next month.
	   ``If the draft law is enacted without substantial revisions, we
believe that it will limit severely the right of Jordanians to
obtain and disseminate a diversity of information,'' the letter
said.
	   It added that the press bill ``represents an unwarranted attempt
by the state to limit access to information and to control the
content of what is written and read in the kingdom.''
	   The draft law would limit reporting on the armed forces as well
as the king and other officials. It would also ban reports leading
to public demonstrations, threats to national security or moral
corruption.
	   Publishing information on investigations and trials taking place
in Jordan would also be prohibited. The law would apply to local
and foreign journalists.
	   Officials have said the bill targets Jordan's 22 weekly
tabloids, which are largely affiliated with hard-line groups
opposed to King Hussein's pro-western style and the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   Under the law, the state could fine journalists or suspend their
press credentials.

Schumacher looking to close the gap on McLaren 
</HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - Michael Schumacher is looking to
close the gap on the McLaren-Mercedes -- both on the track and in
the season point standings -- as the Formula One season reaches it
halfway mark.
	   Sunday's French Grand Prix is the eighth race of the series and
begins a hectic period with four races over the next five weeks.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, enters Sunday's
French race on a roll. He won the Canadian Grand Prix three weeks
ago while both McLaren cars dropped out. And he has won three of
the last four French races here, missing out only in 1996 when his
engine blew up on the warmup lap after leading qualifying.
	   This time Schumacher doesn't expect have to have a chance for
the pole positions -- Mika Hakkinen or David Coulthard have taken
all seven this year for the McLaren team with Hakkinen taking four
and Coulthard three.
	   Although Schumacher hasn't won a pole position all year, he has
won two races and is still in contention for the driving title.
	   Hakkinen, with 46 points, has a 12-point advantage over
Schumacher. Coulthard is third with 29 in the driver's standings.
	   Schumacher is looking for the Ferrari to continually improve and
get closer to the McLarens.
	   ``Since the beginning of the year, it's pretty clear the
direction it's going,'' said Schumacher. ``What wasn't clear after
Canada was whether we've closed the gap or whether it was lucky
circumstances due to the weather or whether our car was working
good and their cars wasn't.''
	   Over the first few races of the season, the McLaren-Mercedes
were making a mockery of the championship race. Schumacher failed
to finish the first race of the season while the McLaren's
dominated so much that Hakkinen was the winner in a friendly -- but
highly criticized -- agreement between the drivers.
	   But over the last two races, Ferraris have the better
performance, with both cars finishing the races while only Hakkinen
has finished even one.
	   Coulthard knows it is hard to improve on perfection at the
start.
	   ``It's obvious if we started with a car closest to the optimum,
it would be harder for us to make developments compared to the
others,'' Coulthard said.
	   Schumacher said he has been testing new equipment on the
Ferraris.
	   ``We have a new adaptation of the front wing that I used in
Montreal,'' Schumacher said. ``We also have a new floor and
sidepods which are new since Canada.
	   ``After the short run that Eddie did with them at Maranello on
Monday, things look quite promising,'' Schumacher said.
	   Schumacher's teammate Eddie Irvine did well, coming within a
tenth of a second of Hakkinen's time in Friday's free practice.
Hakkinen led the unofficial session with 1 minute 16.515 seconds
with Irvine right behind at 1:16.597. Schumacher was fifth with
1:17.429.
	   Schumacher feels he is close enough to challenge in a race.
	   ``Even if they are a couple of tenths ahead, I wouldn't be
worried because in the race you can play different games and you
close the gap,'' Schumacher said.
	   Race circumstances always make a difference and Schumacher has
excelled under them.
	   Last year, the race started it dry conditions then it rained.
	   Schumacher risked the final laps without changing tires and in
the hopes the rain would not increase. It didn't and he won.

Holbrooke meets Albanian leaders; says `no easy peace' plans, refugee agency allowed into Junik in western Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Holbrooke warning NATO stepping up
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Friday that NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in
secessionist Kosovo and said his four days of shuttle diplomacy in
Yugoslavia yielded no magic formula for peace.
	   Both Serbian security forces and Albanian militants fighting for
independence should be aware that their next major clash could have
``tragic consequences,'' Holbrooke said, speaking briefly to
reporters at Pristina airport as Yugoslav fighter jets screamed
overhead. He then flew to Athens, Greece.
	   Arriving in Kosovo from a day of secretive talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke held an unusual and lengthy
meeting with Adem Demaci, an Albanian who spent 28 years in
Yugoslav jails for advocating Kosovo's independence.
	   Demaci advocates of armed struggle for independence to a greater
degree than the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Holbrooke denied he saw Demaci as a link to the the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the separatist fighters who increasingly threaten
the Serbian security forces' hold on the restive province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   Holbrooke, who met KLA fighters he met in western Kosovo during
a tour of the province's war zone on Wednesday, also saw Rugova.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Foreign powers fear the increasingly violent conflict could
flare into a wider Balkan war.
	   Holbrooke said NATO planning for some kind of intervention in
Kosovo had accelerated in the past two days.
	   The Alliance staged a show of air power around Kosovo's borders
last week that was intended to persuade Milosevic to withdraw
special police forces held largely responsible for recent assaults
on ethnic Albanian civilians and villages thought to harbor KLA
fighters.
	   Holbrooke and NATO want Milosevic to pull back, and the
Albanians to cease fire and return to talks with the Serbian
authorities. They firmly rule out the Kosovo Albanians' aim of
independence, saying instead that they should negotiate a return or
expansion of the autonomy Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   The KLA insists it will fight to independence, making it harder
for the pacifist Rugova to back down from that goal. The shadowy
group has swelled in numbers after Serbian police began a crackdown
which has killed more than 300 people since March.
	   Holbrooke said a Kosovo observer mission of diplomats from
dozens of countries will likely arrive in Kosovo in the next few
days.
	   ``Their job will be to travel throughout Kosovo and learn what
they can and help calm the situation,'' he said.
	   Both sides report events largely through their media in
Pristina, preventing independent confirmation often by refusing
access to the area of action.
	   The U.N. refugee agency did say, however, that the Serbs on
Thursday allowed an aid convoy through to hundreds of refugees,
mostly women and children, trapped in the western village of Junik.
They reported them in ``pretty bad physical shape.''
	   Holbrooke reminded both sides that they need to dismantle
checkpoints. He said he has no means of communicating with the KLA,
but stressed: ``They should be listening to this press
conference.''

Sumitomo Trust considering merger with troubled Long-Term Credit Bank take LTCB's bad loans, details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote from Sumitomo president, Sumitomo won't
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. is considering a
merger with Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been
foundering under huge problem loans, Sumitomo said Friday.
	   The combined bank would be the second biggest in Japan after
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., reported one of Japan's largest
newspapers, the Asahi.
	   ``A merger would aim to restore health to our assets, boost
earnings and gain the trust of the markets,'' Sumitomo Trust
President Atsushi Takahashi told reporters in Tokyo.
	   Takahashi also said that Sumitomo Trust would take over only
LTCB's sound loans _ not those that require monitoring.
	   ``I don't know who's going to take them, but we certainly
won't,'' Takahashi said. He gave no deadline for the deal, but said
the banks aimed for a merger within one year.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   News reports earlier Friday said the merger would take place in
April next year, and a recently proposed government-run ``bridge
bank'' would take over much of LTCB's bad debt.
	   That would make the deal a crucial first test of a government
campaign to clean up Japanese banks' 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) in bad debt. The bad loans have been blamed as a major
cause for Japan's deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports of the merger
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   The reports sparked late rallies on Tokyo financial markets. The
yen _ weakened recently by concerns over Japan's economic doldrums
_ rose to 141.94 yen to the dollar from an intraday low of 143.00
yen.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank. Japan's
trust banks specialize in managing funds for large institutional
investors.
	   LTCB officials had repeatedly denied rumors that the bank was on
the verge of failure, but recently acknowledged it holds 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution was foundering.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners.
	   Japan's government is pushing banks to write off the bad loans
they amassed on the late 1980s and is scrambling to set up the
emergency bridge bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies
left out in the cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them
more money.
	   But investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered the bank's credit rating and sent its
share prices plunging.

Iraq to cooperate with inspectors despite row over nerve gas 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep cooperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with dismantling its weapons programs, despite
mounting tension over a report that it put nerve gas in missile
warheads, a top Iraqi official said Friday.
	   Iraq's relations with the United Nations worsened after the
chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, said tests by a U.S.
Army laboratory left ``no doubt'' that Iraq had put deadly VX gas
in missile warheads. Baghdad denied it did so.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the Security
Council does not move to end sanctions soon, and the Iraqi
government has repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action.
	   But in conciliatory remarks Friday, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a
presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical warfare program,
said Iraq would keep up its cooperation and that it did not want to
create a crisis over the inspections.
	   ``Iraq will go on meeting commitments vis-a-vis the (U.N.)
Special Commission. It will not stop cooperation with it,''
al-Saadi said in an interview on state-run television.
	   He added that any new crisis, however, would be the fault of
U.N. inspectors, since they are pressing the nerve gas issue.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   In recent months, Iraq had convinced some council members _
notably Russia, France and China _ that it had made significant
progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   But the report by the U.S. Army laboratory raised doubts about
Iraq's claims and could set back efforts to complete inspections.
	   The ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra took a tougher line
on the inspectors Friday.
	   ``Seven bloody years of weapons destruction, elimination of
equipment and the provision of documents ... have not led us to
obtain our legal and human right to get the sanctions lifted,'' the
paper said.

Aussies beat Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Dallas Mavericks' Chris Anstey
scored 22 points as Australia withstood a second-half comeback
before wrapping up its two match series against Japan with a
21-point victory Friday.
	   After beating the Asian world championship qualifiers by 56
points Thursday, Australia posted a 97-76 win.
	   Anstey shot 10-10 from the free-throw line, while former
Minnesota guard Shane Heal was again at his accurate best in
sinking 19 points, including five of eight from three-point
territory.
	   The Boomers led by 27 points in the second half, before Japan
rallied to get within nine late in the game.
	   It was the type of opposition Australian coach Barry Barnes had
been hoping for as part of the Boomers preparation for the world
championships, which start in Greece on July 29.
	   Australia plays 10 lead-up matches and Barnes wants tough
opposition to fine tune his players for the event.
	   ``They were a lot more competitive tonight and put a lot more
pressure on us which we wanted,'' Barnes said. ``Last night was a
bit easy but tonight we were put under pressure and some of our
young blokes lost their way.''
	   Australia has a four game pre-world championship series against
Canada early next month.

Palestinian leaders call for general strike in east Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders called for a general strike
in Jerusalem on Saturday to protest Israel's plans for expanding
the disputed city to maintain a Jewish majority.
	   The strike plans were announced in a leaflet signed by the major
Palestinian political groups and distributed in the city Friday.
	   Saturday also mark's the 31st anniversary of Israel's annexation
of east Jerusalem, the sector it captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to make east Jerusalem, home to
180,000 Palestinians, their future capital.
	   Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan that
would extend Jerusalem municipal authority to nearby Jewish West
Bank settlements and expand the city's boundaries westward into
Israel proper.
	   Planners wrote that one of the objectives was to maintain a
Jewish majority of 70 percent. Demographers have predicted that
unless the government intervenes, Palestinians could make up 40
percent of the city by 2020 because of a higher birth rate.
	   Palestinians have denounced the expansion plan as an attempt to
pre-empt the outcome of negotiations that would determine the final
status of the city. Such talks have yet to begin.
	   ``This strike will show the Israelis that we stand against the
conspiracy to make east Jerusalem Jewish,'' the leaflet said.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement staged a march protesting the Jerusalem
plan. Waving flags and marching through downtown Nablus, some 200
protesters chanted: ``Jerusalem is ours, there is no peace without
Jerusalem.''

Russian markets fall despite IMF decision to release loan installment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Chubais saying talks could be completed in month,
TRIMS pvs.
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy.
	   But investors apparently disagreed, and the stock market opened
sharply lower with traders citing fears that an IMF bailout is
moving too slowly.
	   ``Its a very weak market, but I would not say it is panic
selling yet,'' said Steve Malloy of Credit Suisse First Boston in
Moscow.
	   The Russian Trading System index dropped 4 percent in early
trading, standing at 165.80 at midday, down from Thursday's close
of 172.57. The bond market also fell, with treasury yields surging
to 74 percent from 61.5 percent Thursday.
	   The markets have been keeping a close eye on Russia's talks with
the IMF over disbursement of its current dlrs 9.2 billion loan and
negotiations over a new loan the government hopes will top dlrs 10
billion.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's liaison
with international lenders, praised the IMF's decision on Thursday
to release the delayed dlrs 670 million installment as ``quite
natural and logical.''
	   ``It is important in principle that IMF board members ... regard
the ailments of the Russian economy as quite curable,'' Chubais
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The fund decided last week to hold up the installment, saying
Russia had to do more to balance the federal budget and reform key
areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax collection
system.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan
to the IMF earlier this week that officials said appeared to meet
many of the fund's criteria.
	   The fund was to begin deliberations Friday on whether to lend
Russia even more money. Russia is seeking an additional dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion loan to help shore up Central Bank
reserves and foster economic recovery.
	   Chubais said he was optimistic that the negotiations could be
completed within a month.
	   ``There is no super-difficult problem with the IMF,'' Chubais
said. ``That is why we will try to speed up the process, not in the
two months as was announced before, but in one month.''
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy speaker of parliament, said the
legislature may delay its summer recess to debate the government's
austerity plan and vote on the necessary legislation, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency. The summer recess was scheduled to begin
July 3.
	   Traders said investors fear the aid may come too late to prop up
the state finances. Russia's stock market has lost about half its
value since the beginning of the year, with investors worried about
falling oil prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the
Asian financial crisis.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.

World Cup: Germans reach first objective, but signs of tension 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann are
scoring their goals and Germany is marching on. It may not be
pretty, but the Germans are where they want to be.
	   But, there are sign of tension within the team, with some
players unhappy with being demoted to the bench.
	   ``We wanted to be first in the group and we achieved our
objective,'' said coach Berti Vogts after his team's 2-0 victory
over Iran in Montpellier on Thursday.
	   The win put Germany atop Group F, to face Mexico in the second
round Monday, also in Montpellier.
	   The Germans have played Mexico twice in the World Cup, winning
6-0 in 1978 in Argentina and 4-1 on penalties after a goalless
quarterfinal clash on Mexican soil in 1986.
	   Bierhoff, who like Klinsmann has scored two goals so far for
Germany, conceded Friday that the European champion has not
provided much entertainment.
	   ``Yes, it's correct to a certain extent to say that we've been
playing for results so far,'' Bierhoff said. ``But we don't go into
a match like that, we go in trying to score as many as we can. But
what good is a 6-1 if you go home?''
	   Spain beat Bulgaria 6-1 but still failed to advance to the
second round.
	   ``We try to score as many goals as we can to please the fans,
but I must say we haven't done that in the first three games. We
were not convincing.''
	   ``There have been many surprises here. We finished the group
with seven points, more than Brazil or the Netherlands,'' Bierhoff
said, whose goal against Iran brought his international tally to 19
in 29 games.
	   Germany also beat the United States 2-0 and had a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia, finishing first on goal difference.
	   ``We are a typical tournament team. We can improve a lot and I
am sure we will,'' said Bierhoff, who topped the Italian league
with 27 goals this season.
	   Speaking about Mexico, Bierhoff said, ``On paper, they look like
an easier rival for us.''
	   ``I thought they were finished after going down 2-0, but they
came back and they played with a lot of heart,'' Bierhoff said.
``We have to be on alert for 90 or 95 minutes and we have to keep
them under pressure.''
	   Mexico trailed the Netherlands 2-0 before coming back and
clinching a draw with a last-second goal, after achieving a similar
comeback against Belgium.
	   Two Germans who played against Mexico in 1986 are still in the
team _ Lothar Matthaeus and Olaf Thon.
	   And it is precisely these two who are in the center of a storm
brewing in the German ranks.
	   Thon came into the World Cup as No. 1 libero, with Matthaeus as
his understudy.
	   But Matthaeus, the 37-year-old veteran in his fifth World Cup,
wasn't going to be happy on the bench forever. Against Iran, both
were starters, Thon as libero, Matthaeus in midfield.
	   At halftime, Thon was left in the locker room, Matthaeus moved
into libero and Dietmar Hamann came into midfield. That helped
Germany score two quick goals and secure the victory.
	   ``I wasn't very pleased, I was angry'' Thon said of his
substitution. ``I was surprised and disappointed and I didn't
understand the substitution.''
	   Matthaeus, who scored one goal in the penalty shootout against
Mexico in 1986, looks set to remain as libero and is quickly
assuming the role of leader on the field, something Germany
appeared to be lacking in early games.
	   ``Olaf was upset and I can understand him,'' Matthaeus said.
``But he has to have respect for other players. He must also
understand how I feel.''
	   Meanwhile, midfielder Thomas Haessler missed Friday's practice
because of a sore Achilles' tendon. But he is expected to be fit
for Mexico.
	   After training Friday mid-morning, the Germans were given off
until Saturday 10 a.m.

Coalition and opposition to seek agreement on administrative division 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek is meeting
Friday with the leaders of the government coalition and opposition
hoping to overcome a deadlock over the new administrative division
of Poland.
	   The government plan, which calls for consolidating Poland's
provinces, is to do away with the communist-era administration by
transferring power to municipalities. It is to take effect Jan. 1.
	   The general idea has a broad support among politicians, but the
government and the leftist opposition disagree over the number of
provinces.
	   The original Cabinet plan provided for reducing the number of
provinces from 49 to 12 and for giving local governments more
power.
	   But following protests from cities that would lose their capital
status and under pressure from the opposition, the government
agreed to increase the number to 15. Government experts indicate
that further increases in the number of provinces would produce
municipalities that are too small to be self-financing.
	   However, leaders of the leftist opposition as well as
ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski argue that Poland
should return to its pre-1975 division into 17 provinces, which is
less controversial than fewer provinces.
	   The plan still needs parliament's and the president's approval,
but Kwasniewski has vowed to veto the government-drawn map of 15
provinces.
	   The government coalition of Solidarity and center-right Freedom
Union is short of a a three-fifths majority required to overrule a
presidential veto.
	   Kwasniewski, who has toured several provinces and argues Poles
favor the leftist plan, wants to add the northwestern province of
Koszalin and the central province of Kielce to the map. His critics
say he apparently hopes to win more popularity before seeking
re-election in the year 2000.
	   The president was in Ukraine Friday and has refused to take part
in the talks.
	   Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski threatened to cut contacts
with the president if he vetoes the government plan.
	   He said the opposition fears that the good effects of the reform
will be seen before the presidential elections and therefore want
to block it.

Iraq to cooperate with inspectors despite row over nerve gas 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep cooperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with dismantling its weapons programs, a top
Iraqi official said Friday, despite mounting tension over a report
that it fit missile warheads with nerve gas.
	   Iraq's relations with the United Nations worsened after the
chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, said tests by a U.S.
Army laboratory left ``no doubt'' that Iraq had put deadly VX gas
in missile warheads. Baghdad denied it did so.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the Security
Council does not move to end sanctions soon, and the Iraqi
government has repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action.
	   But in conciliatory remarks Friday, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a
presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical warfare program,
said Iraq would maintain its cooperation and that it did not want
to create a crisis over the inspections.
	   ``Iraq will go on meeting commitments vis-a-vis the (U.N.)
Special Commission. It will not stop cooperation with it,''
al-Saadi said in an interview on state-run television.
	   He added that any new crisis, however, would be the fault of
U.N. inspectors, because they are pressing the nerve gas issue.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   In recent months, Iraq had convinced some council members _
notably Russia, France and China _ that it had made significant
progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   The report by the U.S. Army laboratory raised doubts about
Iraq's claims and could set back efforts to complete inspections.

Date set for Lithuania's first Nazi war-crimes trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ After repeated delays and criticism
from abroad that it was acting too slowly, a Lithuanian court on
Friday set a Sept. 1 trial date for alleged Nazi war criminal
Aleksandras Lileikis.
	   The trial of the 91-year-old Lileikis would be the first Nazi
war crimes trial in Lithuania since it broke off from the Soviet
Union in 1991.
	   Lileikis, who headed the security police in the capital of
Vilnius when Lithuania was under Nazi occupation, is charged with
sending scores of Jews to their death. Lithuania's pre-war Jewish
population of some 200,000 was nearly wiped out during the
occupation.
	   Lileikis later lived for decades in the United States, but was
stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1996.
	   His lawyer on Friday insisted Lileikis is too ill to stand
trial.
	   ``I do not see how it's possible how this trial can go on,''
Algimantas Matuiza said. ``Lileikis is seriously ill and he can not
attend the sittings.''
	   Since the country broke with the Soviet Union, five emigres,
including Lileikis, have been stripped of their U.S. citizenship
for lying about their Nazi past and have returned to Lithuania.
	   Lithuania has vowed to prosecute Nazi war criminals, and
genocide charges are pending against several other Lithuanians.
	   But Lithuania has been crriticized by Nazi-hunting groups for
moving slowly on prosecutions.

World Cup: Fade against Italy still weighs on Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ It's been four years since Nigeria threw
away a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals with a last-minute
collapse against Italy, and some Super Eagles acknowledged Friday
the loss haunts them.
	   The team again has advanced to the round of 16 and as it
prepares to face Denmark the usually self-confident group has
turned cautious.
	   ``Doing more than we did in 1994 is very important to us,''
winger Mutiu Adepoju, who entered that Italy match as a substitute,
said after a short training session at the team's ground in this
village 80 kilometers (55 miles) north of Paris.
	   ``We're going to guard against what happened against Italy. We
learned a great deal from that experience.''
	   Adepoju sat out the last half of practice Friday after hurting
his right heel in a shooting drill. He had the foot bandaged.
	   Nigeria led Italy 1-0 at USA '94 with a minute remaining and the
eventual finalists down to 10 players because of a red card. But
the Nigerian defense, perennially the squad's Achilles heel, left
space for Roberto Baggio to hit the tying goal at the end of
regulation and the star striker added a penalty kick to win the
game in extra time.
	   ``I think it happened because we lacked experience,'' Adepoju
said. ``We have more now. I hope it's not going to happen again.''
	   Captain Uche Ukechukwu, who was on the field in Boston four
years ago along with eight other players on the France 98 roster,
said the team has talked this week about the lost opportunity.
	   ``You never forget something like that,'' the veteran defender
said. ``Of course you still have it in your mind. We always say,
`Don't let that happen again.'
	   ``But now we have to get over that,'' he added, ``put it out of
our minds and focus on what has to be done now.''
	   The last African nation left in the tourney won Group D with a
match to spare and faces Denmark on Sunday at Saint-Denis. Unlike
four years ago, Nigeria is the favorite this time.
	   Taribo West said the disappointment could help the current
squad.
	   ``We're lucky to have Uche and other players from '94 here. He
and (Sunday) Oliseh and (Daniel) Amokachi were there. It can be a
psychological help for us,'' the hulking Inter Milan defender said.
``Those guys can push us new ones harder.''
	   Ever since fading against Italy, Nigeria has been building a
reputation as a comeback team.
	   The Eagles rallied to beat Ariel Ortega's Argentina and
Ronaldo's Brazil en route to the 1996 Olympic gold medal, and twice
fought off one-goal deficits to defeat Spain 3-2 at this World Cup.
	   ``It's better not to dwell on what happened in 1994,'' coach
Bora Milutinovic said. ``It's better to speak about what happened
at the Olympic Games. That was so great. They showed they had
learned.''
	   He and his players would not discuss in any detail their next
opponent, which finished second behind host France in Group C with
a 1-1-1 record.
	   ``Denmark is a very experienced team,'' Ukechukwu said. ``It's
very disciplined, very intelligent. But we're not going into the
game thinking about their team. We're thinking about us.''

Thieves steal candy from babies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Children at a Norwegian nursery school were
furious about a theft that really was as easy as stealing candy
from a baby.
	   Burglars broke a window at Loen day care center near the
southern town of Fredrikstad on Thursday, and emptied a box of
caramels the 40 children had planned to share, the Fredrikstad Blad
newspaper reported on Friday.
	   According to the report, the candy was the only thing missing in
the early morning break-in, but that didn't make it any less
criminal in the eyes of the preschoolers.
	   ``I hope the thieves get cavities,'' four-year-old Pernille
Medini was quoted as telling the newspaper.

Indian troops won't pursue militants into Pakistan, says minister 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India said Friday its troops won't chase
suspected militants into Pakistan as part of its stepped-up
campaign to put down an uprising in New Delhi's share of Kashmir.
	   In recent weeks, India has put the troubled province's security
in the hands of its hard-line federal police minister, announced a
crackdown on militants and even raised the possibility of building
a fence along its disputed border with Pakistan.
	   But comments Friday from Defense Minister George Fernandes
showed India did not want its confrontation with Pakistan to
escalate out of control.
	   ``I don't think the army will ever cross the cease-fire line,''
Fernandes said when asked whether Indian troops might enter
Pakistan in ``hot pursuit.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir, since both gained independence from Britain in 1947. India
controls two thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest, while both
countries claim the entire Himalayan region.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim guerrillas
fighting a separatist war in Indian-held Kashmir since 1989.
Officially Islamic Pakistan says it provides only moral support to
insurgents in predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority
state.
	   Fernandes, who spent four days in Kashmir this week, said
Pakistani soldiers opened fire from across the disputed border at
least twice while he was visiting.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Indian and Pakistani troops are
deployed in the region and firing there is common.

Norway's state central bank hikes interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The state central Bank of Norway on Friday
announced a 0.25-percent increase in its lending rates to other
banks in an effort to maintain the stability of the krone.
	   The bank said its new overnight lending rate would be 6.5
percent and its deposit rate would be 4.5 percent as of Monday.
	   The value of the krone had been slipping against other European
currencies, due party to a slump in oil prices.
	   However, the interest rate hike appeared to have little
immediate impact in currency markets.
	   ``The effect of the move was to boost the krone for four
minutes,'' said Peter Warren, chief currency dealer at Finansbanken
in Oslo.

Iranian cleric says U.S. ties depend on its respect for Islam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The restoration of Iranian-U.S. ties depend
on America's showing respect for Islam, a senior Iranian cleric
said Friday.
	   Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, who heads several powerful official
bodies in Iran, told the Friday prayers sermon at Tehran University
that it was hypocritical of the United States to talk about
normalizing relations with Iran while allowing its Israeli allies
to ``push out Muslims'' from Jerusalem, state-run Iranian radio
reported.
	   Israel's leaders ``do what they want ... only because they are
being supported by America,'' Jannati said in the sermon, which was
broadcast on the radio.
	   The crowd responded with shouts of ``Death to America.''
	   Jannati, a hard-liner in the ruling hierarchy, used the sermon
to give his views on remarks from U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright earlier this month, who urged
Iran to take steps that could lead to the restoration of relations.
	   ``Dialogue with the United States would be possible only after
the U.S. has set aside its anti-Islamic feelings. If they allow us
to safeguard our religion, safeguard our Islam and perform our
duties . . . then we can talk to each other,'' Jannati said.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has promoted sporting,
cultural and academic exchanges with the United States, but has
said it is too early to renew government contacts.
	   The United States broke off relations with Iran after militants
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran at the start of the 1979 Islamic
revolution and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   In his comments on Jerusalem, Jannati was referring an Israeli
Cabinet decision on June 21 to extend the city's municipal services
to Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Palestinians have condemned
the move as they fear it will cut off Arab parts of Jerusalem from
other Palestinian areas and diminish the Arab proportion of the
city's population.
	   Palestinians want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem to be the
capital of their future state.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is not allowing Farouk Kaddoumi, a top
PLO official and opponent of the Mideast peace agreements, to visit
the autonomous Palestinian areas, a government official said
Friday.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the decision to bar Kaddoumi was not final and that
Israel might reconsider in the future.
	   Earlier this week, the Palestinian Authority asked Israel to
approve a visit by Kaddoumi.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for Israel's liaison office with the
Palestinians, said Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1996, when the Palestine National
Council met in the Gaza Strip.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, boycotted the PNC session.

World Cup: Adepoju latest injury worry for Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ The string of injuries hitting Nigeria
continued Friday, two days ahead of its France '98 second round
game, as winger Mutiu Adepoju hurt his right heel during a practice
session that striker Daniel Amokachi skipped because of a bad knee.
	   Amokachi, who likely will start against Denmark at Saint-Denis
Sunday if he is healthy, originally twisted the knee during
training June 9. He was slated to play in Nigeria's 3-1 loss to
Paraguay Wednesday, but aggravated the injury while warming up
before that game.
	   The striker has been sidelined since, but coach Bora Milutinovic
said Friday, ``Amokachi has only a little problem. He'll play
against Denmark.''
	   Adepoju was participating in a shooting drill during Friday's
abbreviated training when he lost his footing. The 27-year-old, who
scored in Nigeria's 3-2 victory over Spain in the France '98 opener
for both teams, limped off the field and trainers bandaged his
foot.
	   Both Amokachi and Adepoju are vital to Nigeria's attack, which
has slowed after the impressive outing against Spain. The team's
front line is already thin, with veteran Emmanuel Amunike not even
here because of a knee injury and Nwankwo Kanu still not in top
match form.
	   Kanu played the full game against Paraguay, but was rusty.
	   ``I am very happy he played 90 minutes the other night,''
Milutinovic said of Kanu, whose comeback from 1996 heart valve
surgery has been slowed by a series of leg injuries. ``I hope he
keeps improving. The surgery is in the past. What is important now
is that he plays and gets in game shape.''
	   Milutinovic did have some good news Friday, as influential
midfielder Sunday Oliseh, who left Wednesday's game at halftime
with a bothersome left ankle, took part in drills and looked to be
fit.
	   In addition to Amunike, three other top players are not even on
Milutinovic's roster because of injuries: goalkeepers Ike Shorunmu
and Joseph Dosu and defender Jero Shakpore.

VW says reopening of Bosnia plant on schedule 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's largest carmaker, Volkswagen
AG, said Friday preparations to reopen its Vogosca factory near
Sarajevo, Bosnia, were on schedule and it should resume operations
in July or August.
	   VW will assemble Skoda Felicia cars at the plant. In the
start-up phase, VW plans to produce 5,000 to 10,000 cars per year,
reaching up to 30,000 cars a year in 2000.
	   The Skoda Felicia cars will be sold in the states of former
Yugoslavia and other countries in southeast Europe, VW said.
	   VW and Bosnia's Unis Holding have jointly set up a company to
operate the plant. VW holds a 58 percent stake in the company, and
Unis the remaining 42 percent, the carmaker said.
	   The Vogosca factory was first opened in June 1972 by VW and
Unis, a state-owned holding company, which held equal shares. The
factory closed in 1992 due to the war in Bosnia.

German high court lets noise ruling stand 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Constitutional Court refused
Friday to hear an appeal of a controversial ruling that resulted
from a neighbor's complaints about noise coming from a house for
mentally handicapped men.
	   Social workers placed seven retarded men in the home near
Dueren, just west of Cologne, in 1993. Neighbors soon began to
complain about the ``screams, groans and shrieks'' they made in the
garden.
	   Attempts to negotiate a compromise failed and the neighbor went
to court.
	   In January, a court in Cologne ruled that the garden could not
be used during specified ``quiet times,'' namely evenings and
weekend afternoons.
	   The social workers' association appealed, charging the court
relied on a tape recording made by the neighbor instead of
appointing its own expert.
	   But the Constitutional Court noted the association did not
present any expert opinion of its own. It refused to accept the
case on technical grounds, saying something left undone could not
be called unconstitutional.

Eds: UPDATES with new details on Belgian disturbance, ADDS Prince
By SEBASTIEN HEMBERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ About 100 people, mostly drunken English
soccer fans en route to a World Cup match, were arrested in
overnight clashes in northern France and neighboring Belgium,
police said.
	   In Lens, where England was to play Colombia later Friday, 16
people were detained for being drunk and violent, police said.
Their nationalities were not released. At least three were expected
to remain in custody.
	   In nearby Lille, a major European railway junction, about 30
people were detained after fights broke out between English fans
and locals when bars closed, police said.
	   French television channel LCI said the majority of those
detained were English fans, including some known hooligans. Four
people in Lille, including a taxi driver, were slightly injured,
the reports said.
	   In other disturbances, 52 soccer fans were taken into custody
Thursday night for running amok in the North Sea port of Ostende,
Belgium, after arriving by ferry. Fifty were to be deported Friday,
while another two were to appear before an investigating judge.
	   Police said windows were broken and Belgians were challenged to
fights in the disturbances that lasted until 3 a.m. Police were
preparing to return the offenders to Britain.
	   Fearing new violence, this small northern town was adopting a
siege mentality in the runup to England's make-or-break World Cup
match: bars and shops were closing, and schoolchildren were staying
home.
	   As many as 30,000 English fans were expected _ many without
tickets _ to cheer their team on. England needs at least a point to
advance to the second round.
	   Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were to attend the
match.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday. A
French policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a
coma.
	   Residents fear more of the same, or even worse.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   Lens officials have banned the sale or possession of alcohol on
the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday. But the ban does
not extend to surrounding towns.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes.
	   A known English soccer hooligan, Paul Dodd, from Carlisle, was
detained for questioning Friday as he was about to board a ferry in
Dover, police said.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have arrested more than 250 people and deported a number of English
and German hooligans.

Pakistan's stock market plunges to all-time low 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's stock market, which has been
on a slide since last month's nuclear tests, hit an all-time low on
Friday, prompting calls for the resignation of the governor of the
State Bank of Pakistan.
	   The Karachi Stock Exchange closed at 876.90, down from
Thursday's close of 913.28.
	   ''This is the lowest in history,'' said Yasin Lakhani, president
of the Karachi Stock Exchange. ''There is chaos in the market. The
State Bank governor should resign.''
	   Lakhani blamed the chaos in large part on a government decision
to freeze foreign currency accounts. That decision was taken last
month after Pakistan detonated six nuclear devices in response to
five atomic blasts by its uneasy neighbor India.
	   On May 8, the last trading day before India conducted its first
three tests, the stock market closed at 1,551.91.
	   After Pakistan's testing two weeks later, it froze foreign
currency accounts to prevent a panic withdrawal of U.S. dollars,
which would have destroyed the government' fragile foreign exchange
reserve, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said at the time.
	   Lakhani said that government policy has been changing daily. And
the government has arbitrarily set exchange rates, which vary
depending on the origin of the money.
	   For example dollars sent to Pakistan by expatriate Pakistanis
are being converted at 46 rupees to the dollar. But U.S. dollars
sent to Pakistan from other sources have been tied to an official
rate of 44.05 rupees to the dollar.
	   Lakhani said the constantly changing policies are causing havoc
in the market.
	   ''There is just so much confusion about foreign exchange that
investors want to get out,'' he said.
	   Furthermore, the government's months-old battle with private
power companies, particularly the Hubco Power Co., which is heavily
backed by the World Bank, is hurting the stock market, said
Lakhani.
	   In a statement issued Friday by Hubco, management said that the
government-owned water and power company, which has agreed to
purchase power from Hubco, has not paid its June bill of 845
million rupees (roughly dlrs 2 million).
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has been trying to
renegotiate its power rates with power companies, saying that his
predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, agreed to inflated rates in exchange
for kickbacks.
	   Both the private power companies and Ms. Bhutto have denied the
claims.
	   And finally, Lakhani said, the relentless ethnically motivated
violence in the last month in the southern port city of Karachi has
further dampened investor confidence.
	   Nearly 150 people have died in the feud between rival factions
of a militant ethnic group demanding a greater say in government.
	   The financial heart of Pakistan and home to 14 million people,
some neighborhoods in Karachi are patrolled by police and
paramilitary soldiers in armored personnel carriers and jeeps
mounted with machine guns.
	   ''The law and order situation is just adding to the chaos,''
said Lakhani.

Norway's state central bank hikes interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The state central Bank of Norway announced a
0.25-percent increase in its lending rates to other banks Friday in
an effort to maintain the stability of the krone.
	   The bank said its new overnight lending rate would be 6.5
percent and its deposit rate would be 4.5 percent as of Monday.
	   The value of the krone had been slipping against other European
currencies, due partly to a slump in oil prices.
	   The interest rate hike appeared to have little immediate impact
in currency markets.
	   ``The effect of the move was to boost the krone for four
minutes,'' said Peter Warren, chief currency dealer at Finansbanken
in Oslo.

Catholics strong, Protestants divided in Northern Ireland election 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with first winners, fresh analysis; trims pvs
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ First results in elections for
Northern Ireland's new cross-community government Friday showed
strong support among Catholics for making the peace agreement work,
but bitter divisions within the pro-British Protestant majority.
	   In East Londonderry, a hard-line Protestant opposed to the
agreement became the first politician elected to sit in the
108-seat Belfast Assembly, which will require majorities of both
Protestant and Catholic members for decisions to pass.
	   ``Thanks be to the Lord, we have been able to get a very high
vote,'' said Gregory Campbell of the Democratic Unionist Party,
whose leader the Rev. Ian Paisley has led Protestant opposition to
compromise.
	   Campbell predicted that a majority of Protestants in the
Assembly would oppose implementing a key aspect of the agreement _
joint policy-making with the neighboring Irish Republic, which
Catholics demanded as a gesture towards promoting Irish unity.
	   ``Anything that comes up in the Assembly that will lead us
closer to the Republic of Ireland, we will block it,'' said
Campbell, who received 6,099 first-preference votes, far higher
than Protestant candidates in his area who support the April accord
among eight parties.
	   Minutes later in Belfast City Hall, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
became the first of his IRA-allied party's 37 candidates across
Northern Ireland to be elected.
	   Adams topped the list of 13 candidates in his Catholic west
Belfast power base with 9,078 first-preference votes, compared with
6,140 for Joe Hendron, the district's top representative of the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, Sinn Fein's moderate rival for
Catholic votes. Hendron also was elected.
	   An exit poll and partial returns in key Protestant areas
provided disappointing news for the Ulster Unionists, the largest
Protestant party, whose support for the agreement is considered
crucial for its operation.
	   The final exit poll commissioned by RTE and the Irish Times
newspaper, which had a margin of error of 3 percent, estimated that
the Ulster Unionists received only about 20 percent of
first-preference votes, while Paisley's party received 17 percent.
In the 1997 local council elections, the Ulster Unionists were 12
percentage points ahead of Paisley's party.
	   ``We're on course for a disastrously disappointing result, and
the party leadership has only itself to blame,'' said Jeffrey
Donaldson, an Ulster Unionist member of British Parliament who was
barred from running for the Assembly because he opposes the
agreement.
	   At least six of the 48 Ulster Unionist candidates are opposed to
the agreement. One of them, Roy Beggs Jr., was among the first
elected.
	   ``The unionist vote has been shredded, which I regret,'' Adams
said, saying Protestants needed ``more positive leadership at this
time.''
	   A complex system of ``proportional representation'' _ in which
voters rate candidates in order of preference and election workers
must conduct several rounds of ballot counting _ makes it difficult
to project how many seats a party will win.
	   Results were coming more slowly than expected in most of
Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies, from which six candidates
each will be declared winners. Electoral officials said counting in
some areas was likely to run into Saturday.

Pakistan says Indian shells kill five in disputed Kashmir region 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Shells fired by Indian soldiers
slammed into Pakistani villages along the disputed Kashmir border
on Friday, killing five people, including a woman and her two
granddaughters, the state-run news agency reported.
	   It was the latest in a series of reports this week of firing by
Indian soldiers across the disputed border. Police officials and
witnesses in the area sau as many as 10 people have been killed
since last Friday.
	   There was no immediate comment from India.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir -- in 1948
and again in 1965 _ over ownership of Kashmir since the Asian
subcontinent gained its independence from Britain in 1947.
	   The Kashmir dispute shot to international prominence last month
after both India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests,
sparking fears of a nuclear arms race in a volatile region.
	   Both countries have been urged to open negotiations. The prime
ministers of the two countries are expected to hold face-to-face
talks next month in Sri Lanka at a summit of South Asian countries,
and the U.N. Secretary General has sent an envoy to the region to
try to find a way to ease tensions in the region.
	   Pakistan is demanding international mediation in the Kashmir
dispute, which India flatly rejects.
	   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence on its territory
where a Muslim-led secessionist uprising has been raging since
1989. A predominantly Hindu India says Pakistan is arming and
training militants to create turmoil in its only Muslim-dominated
state.
	   Secessionists are demanding either outright independence or
union with Islamic Pakistan.
	   Pakistan says it is giving only moral and political support to
Kashmiri militants.

Woodhall will defend world title on home soil 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HERTFORD, England (AP) _ Boxing promoter Don King's loss was
Richie Woodhall's gain Friday, when he discovered his first WBC
super-middleweight title defense will be on home soil.
	   The British fighter can now concentrate on his title defense
against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello, which is expected to be held in
the West Midlands.
	   King, Nardiello's promoter, won the initial purse for the fight,
which was due to go ahead in Italy on July 25.
	   But King failed to conclude the necessary contracts or finalize
a venue and the World Boxing Council awarded the promotion to Frank
Warren.
	   Warren is expected to announce a date and venue for Woodhall's
first world title defense next week.

Sumitomo Trust working on merger with troubled Long-Term Credit Bank 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lead; UPDATES with Sumitomo president suggesting use
of public money, LTCB president quote in 16th graf
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. is working on a
merger deal with Japan's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, which has
been foundering under huge problem loans, the two banks said
Friday.
	   The combined bank would be the second biggest in Japan after
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., reported one of Japan's largest
newspapers, the Asahi.
	   ``A merger would aim to restore health to our assets, boost
earnings and gain the trust of the markets,'' Sumitomo Trust
President Atsushi Takahashi told reporters in Tokyo.
	   Takahashi also said that Sumitomo Trust would take over only
LTCB's sound loans _ not those that require monitoring. He
suggested that public money would be used to handle the bad debt.
	   ``I don't know who's going to take them, but we certainly
won't,'' Takahashi said. He gave no deadline for the deal, but said
the banks aimed for a merger within one year.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, had become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   News reports earlier Friday said the merger would take place in
April next year, and a recently proposed government-run ``bridge
bank'' would take over much of LTCB's bad debt.
	   That would make the deal a crucial first test of a government
campaign to clean up Japanese banks' 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) in bad debt. The bad loans have been blamed as a major
cause for Japan's deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports of the merger
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   The reports sparked late rallies on Tokyo financial markets. The
yen _ weakened recently by concerns over Japan's economic doldrums
_ rose to 141.94 yen to the dollar from an intraday low of 143.00
yen.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank. Japan's
trust banks specialize in managing funds for large institutional
investors.
	   LTCB officials had repeatedly denied rumors that the bank was on
the verge of failure, but recently acknowledged it holds 1.4
trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution was foundering.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners.
	   ``We have to work towards making a strong and more competitive
bank,'' Onogi told reporters Friday night, while expressing regret
for the steep decline in the bank's fortunes.
	   Japan's government is pushing banks to write off the bad loans
they amassed on the late 1980s and is scrambling to set up the
emergency bridge bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies
left out in the cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them
more money.
	   But investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered the bank's credit rating and sent its
share prices plunging.

Italian Mafia suspect arrested after eight-year search 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A suspected member of the Italian
Mafia was extradited Friday after being arrested in Romania after
eight years on the run, police said.
	   Romeo Alfio, 35, was arrested April 24 in Bucharest after the
local Interpol bureau tipped them that he and two partners were to
arrive at the local Otopeni airport.
	   Alfio is suspected of being a member of Laudani Mafia clan from
Catalania in southern Italy. Alfio fled Italy in 1990. He and two
partners are suspected of bungling an attempt to kill local police
officers.
	   Police arrested Alfio as he was driving from the airport to
Bucharest. His two partners were driving in a separate car, but
sped away. Police finally caught them when the vehicle had a flat
tire.
	   Alfio told police he had been in Romania since 1995 doing
business fronted by Romanian partners.
	   The Laudani family has been involved in murders, robberies and
bank frauds.
	   Alfio is wanted on charges of Mafia association in Italy. He
faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, the Rompress news
agency reported.

Tajik opposition disarmament in second stage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The disarmament of Tajikistan's opposition entered
its second stage Friday with rebel fighters being sworn into
government service, a news agency reported.
	   About 100 opposition fighters were sworn into a military unit
set up to ensure the safety of U.N. observers and other
international organizations in the Central Asian country, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The first stage of the disarmament and disbandment of the
opposition, agreed to in a peace accord signed a year ago, involved
the appointment of opposition members to Cabinet posts and
amnesties for rebel fighters.
	   In the final stage of the reconciliation process, oppositions
leaders are to officially announce the disbandment of their armed
units.
	   Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, marking the anniversary of
the peace accord, said it was one of the government's ``most
important'' achievements.
	   Opposition leader Sayed Abdullo Nouri, chairman of the
Commission on National Reconciliation, said the world respected the
Tajik people's wisdom in choosing ``the graceful path of peace,''
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The peace accord ending the 1992-93 civil war was signed in
Moscow on June 27, 1997, but there have been several outbreaks of
fighting since.

Angry India refuses Japanese aid 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India refused tents, blankets and other
Japanese emergency aid for cyclone victims because Tokyo has
imposed anti-nuclear sanctions, a Japanese embassy official said.
	   The official, who refused to be named, confirmed on Friday a
report in the Times of India the same day that called India's
decision a ``diplomatic protest.''
	   The official said Japan had offered the tents, blankets,
generators and other goods worth 40 million to 50 million yen
(about dlrs 282,000 to dlrs 354,000) after a cyclone devastated the
western coast state of Gujarat on June 9.
	   Japan cut off new loans and grants to India as punishment for
its nuclear weapons tests in May. Japan is India's largest donor,
extending about 133 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion) in loans annually
since 1992.
	   India's tests prompted anti-nuclear protests by hundreds of
Japanese. The U.S. atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, killed a total of nearly a
quarter of a million people in the world's only nuclear bomb
attacks.

Kohl's junior coalition partner endorses coalition details. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Free Democrats endorsing Kohl's coalition,
<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ The Free Democrats, junior partner in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, endorsed plans Friday to stick
with the center-right coalition after fall elections despite talk
of joining the opposition.
	   Some leaders of the Free Democrats recently raised the
possibility of a switch to the left-leaning Social Democrats, who
are leading in the polls ahead of the Sept. 27 national elections.
Others advocated waiting until August to announce coalition plans.
	   Both those ideas were set aside by the Free Democrats at
Friday's opening of a three-day convention of the free-market,
anti-tax liberals in Leipzig.
	   The 662 party delegates approved by a show of hands a resolution
calling for a continuation of Kohl's three-party coalition, in
power since 1982, if it wins the election.
	   Party chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt rejected party members'
suggestions that the Free Democrats condition the endorsement on
specific policy demands.
	   However, Gerhardt said he had a list of ``target goals'' he
would seek during coalition negotiations after the election. They
included a call for updating Germany's citizenship rules to better
integrate children born in Germany of foreign parents.
	   Kohl's party has in the past rejected the Free Democrats' push
for double citizenship for such children. Currently, the children
receive the citizenship of their parents and can apply for German
citizenship only by giving up their own.
	   The party congress also was expected to discuss demands by some
Free Democrats for Kohl to step down early if he wins in favor of
Wolfgang Schaeuble, his parliamentary whip, to provide fresh blood
at the top. Kohl, 68, has said he wants Schaeuble, 55, to be his
successor, but has never indicated when that might be.
	   Calls for tax and other economic reforms also were expected to
be on the agenda.

EDs: UPDATES in first 4 grafs with Clinton in Beijing
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING, China (AP) _ Uneasy about China's arrest of several
dissidents, U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday praised local
elections as ``a window for all the world to see'' how democracy
can work in China. En route to Beijing for a state visit he
rummaged among the excavated ruins of an ancient emperor.
	   Ending a day of preoccupation with Beijing's heavy-handed
detention of political reformers, Clinton's motorcade wound past
Tiananmen Square en route to his government guest quarters.
	   Friday night, Clinton was to be formally welcomed by the
communist government at the edge of the vast, haunted splendor of
the square where Chinese troops waged a bloody crackdown on
democracy demonstrators nine years ago.
	   Before flying here, Clinton visited the famed Terracotta
Warriors, an army of more than 7,000 pottery soldiers and horses,
created and buried 2,200 years ago to guard the tomb of Emperor Qin
Shi Huangdi. They were unearthed beginning in 1974, when Xiahe
villagers found one while digging a well, and now are displayed in
their burial pits in giant archeological museums.

Three drug smugglers arrested in Far East 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three men have been arrested for trying to smuggle
drugs into Russia's Far East, a news agency reported Friday.
	   Police in the Pacific port city of Vladivostok confiscated 700
grams (24 ounces) of opium from the men, who had come to the region
from Tajikistan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing Interior
Department officials.
	   The drug traffickers were caught when a policeman, posing as a
buyer, offered to trade a Japanese car for the opium, valued at
35,000 rubles (dlrs 5,700).
	   The narcotics division of the Interior Department will now try
to trace the route by which the opium was brought to Vladivostok,
ITAR-Tass reported.

U.S. agriculture secretary says trade blocks in with China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's fresh proposal to join the World Trade
Organization broke no new ground in opening its agricultural market
to U.S. imports, a senior Clinton administration official said
Friday.
	   ``China has a way to go before it gets WTO entry,'' said Daniel
Glickman, the secretary of agriculture. ``It will ultimately
happen, but I don't believe it's imminent.''
	   Speaking to reporters following a speech before Chinese
economists, Glickman said that while high-level talks between the
two countries had addressed specific agriculture trade stumbling
blocks, no specific agreements have been reached.
	   Agricultural trade conflicts have been one of the major reasons
the U.S. has withheld support for China's WTO membership, Glickman
said.
	   China has restricted imports of agricultural products to protect
its own markets, said Glickman, who is accompanying U.S. President
Bill Clinton on his visit to China.
	   The United States wants to see freer markets in China,
particularly for grains, Glickman said. State control of production
and price-setting play too large a part in China's farming sector,
he said.
	   In 1998, China's imports of U.S. agricultural products are
forecast to remain about even with the dlrs 1.6 billion 1997 total,
said Suzanne Hale, a U.S. official for agricultural affairs in
China.

Malaysia's Proton faces economic slowdown this year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hit by the Asian economic crisis,
Malaysian car-maker Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd reported on
Friday a pre-tax profit of 724.617 million ringgit (dlrs 181,154
million) for the year ended March 31, down 29.6 percent from the
year before.
	   Proton made a pre-tax profit of 1,029.117 million ringgit (dlrs
257.029 million) in the previous fiscal year.
	   Considering the difficulties in the market, the economic
slowdown and the depressed prices in the world market, Proton
expects difficulties in the current year, the company said.
	   In announcing the unaudited results Friday, Proton said the
group's sales increased marginally to 6.78 billion ringgit (dlrs
1.695 billion) from 6.22 billion (dlrs 1.555 billion) the year
before.
	   Proton attributed the lower earnings to the expenditure for
product development and substantial margin reduction due to changes
in the product mix during the second half of the year.
	   Earnings per share for the year just ended amounted to 81.2 sen
(20 cents as against 137.5 sen (34 cents) previously.
	   The board has recommended a second and final dividend of 7 sen
per share (4 cents) to be paid on Sept. 8.

World Cup: Argentina leads Croatia 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Boosted by a goal from defender Hector
Pineda, Argentina led Croatia 1-0 at halftime Friday in the match
that would decide the winner of Group H.
	   In the 36th minute, a deep pass from Daniel Ortega was deflected
into the path of Pineda on the left, and with the Croatian defense
all over the place, Pineda took his time to put the ball past
Drazen Ladic.
	   For most of the first half, the teams clashed in midfield and
left their strikeforce stranded with too few passes to create real
danger.
	   The Argentines were quicker of the ball and it showed after the
goal, with Croatia being forced to commit several fouls to keep the
South Americans at bay.
	   On the stroke of half time Marcelo Gallardo almost added a
second, when he hit a freekick into the wall and was allowed to
line up the rebound from 12 meters, forcing a great save from
Ladic.
	   In the 21st minute, Croatian defender Slaven Bilic was given a
yellow card for pulling down Gabriel Batistuta close to the penalty
area.
	   Two minutes later, Argentina's Daniel Ortega committed a similar
foul in the midfield area on his marker Dario Simic and Moroccan
referee Said Belquia showed him yellow for shoving.
	   Argentine defender Roberto Ayala then got a yellow card for a
late tackle on Aljosa Asanovic in the 35th minute.
	   And in the 44th minute, Zvonimir Soldo got one for a body check
on Ortega. It almost led to the second goal, when Gallardo took the
freekick.
	   Both teams were already assured a place in the second round so
the battle centered on who would take first place in Group H.
	   Croatia was boosted by the return of team captain and playmaker
Zvonimir Boban, who sat out the Japan game with a pulled leg
muscle. Veteran defender Igor Stimac, suffering from blistered
feet, was the only regular starter missing. Silvio Maric took his
place.
	   After routing Jamaica 5-0 and defeating Japan 1-0, the South
Americans only needed a draw to finish atop the group and set up a
second-round game with the Group G runner-up _ most likely England
or Colombia.
	   Croatia, which beat Jamaica only 3-1, can expect to face Romania
unless it wins on Friday.
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella replaced AC Parma's Roberto
Sensini, who has a pulled leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. He also
rested Jose Chamot, who was facing the threat of suspension because
he already received a yellow card in an earlier game.

World Cup: Jamaica leads Japan 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Theodore Whitmore scored in the 40th minute
as Jamaica took a 1-0 halftime lead over Japan on Friday in a game
that marked the last chance for two newcomers to earn their first
World Cup victory.
	   Against a tiring Japanese team that had dominated the first 30
minutes, Whitmore capitalized when a teammate and a Japanese player
collided while trying to play the ball in the penalty area.
Whitmore then drove his 12-meter shot past defender Naoki Soma and
the right of goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   The game matched the plodding attack of the Japanese, who all
tournament have done everything well except finish their scoring
chances, against the long-ball strategy of the Jamaicans, who
repeatedly fell victim to the offside trap.
	   While surviving one Japanese attack after another, the Jamaicans
failed even to get the ball into Japan's penalty area until the
15th minute _ when their first shot on goal actually went into the
net.
	   It didn't count, however. Ian Goodison, who headed in a
well-laid corner kick from Fitzroy Simpson, was apparently whistled
for pushing by Austrian referee Gunter Benko.
	   Meanwhile, Jamaican keeper Aaron Lawrence didn't have to make a
tough save, as Japan's strikers were well off the mark after solid
midfield play had brought the ball into scoring position.
	   The blue-clad Japanese fans overwhelmed the noisy black, green
and gold contingent from Jamaica on another rainy day at the Stade
de Gerland. Japan would like a win to help justify its role as
co-host of the 2002 World Cup.

Finland imposes visa requirement for Croatians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland will demand visas from all
visitors from Croatia, in hopes of stemming a flow of refugees to
the Nordic countries, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   The Foreign Ministry said the requirement, which comes into
force on Saturday, brings Finland's policy in line with that of
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
	   Earlier this month, the Norwegian government said it will
require visas from Croatians, following the arrival of 2,350
asylum-seekers since the beginning of the year.
	   Denmark imposed a visa requirement last month following the
arrival of 160 Croatian refugees. Sweden and Iceland have required
visas since Croatia became independent in 1992.
	   The Interior Ministry said it had no record of refugees or
asylum seekers arriving in Finland from Croatia this year.

One prisoner opted not to return to Lebanon against the swap, final grafs

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Lebanese guerrilla jailed in Israel decided
Friday not to return home with dozens of fellow prisoners even
though his release had been secured as part of a swap between
Israel and Lebanon, a spokesman of Red Cross said Friday.
	   The spokesman, David Lynch, did not release the prisoner's name,
nor would he say why he decided to stay behind.
	   Lynch said the prisoner could choose his next destination.
	   As part of the swap, carried out in several stages Thursday and
Friday, Israel received the remains of a soldier killed last year
in an ambush in southern Lebanon. Israel returned to Lebanon the
remains of 40 guerrillas, most of them members of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah group, and freed 60 prisoners.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements for an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   However, Labor legislator Yossi Beilin, a leading advocate of a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, said the swap was a security
mistake on the part of Israel.
	   ``Future hostages may be in danger if they (the guerrillas)
think they can get the same price for only their bodies,'' Beilin
told the Associated Press, ``It won't be so important for them to
keep them alive.''

China tells U.S. treasury secretary it will keep yuan steady 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's top economic officials told U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin on Friday that China was committed to
maintaining a stable yuan exchange rate.
	   Rubin met with Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic
reforms, Central Bank Governor Dai Xianlong, and other officials.
	   Rubin said that Chinese authorities, while concerned about
softening exports, reaffirmed that it was in China's self-interest
to maintain the current yuan exchange rate because it would
maintain stability in Asia.
	   ``I think they are getting and deserve a great deal of respect
in the world community,'' Rubin said.
	   Japan's economic troubles and reform prospects figured
prominently in discussions between Rubin and the top Chinese
economic leadership.
	   Fears of continued recession in Japan, coupled with deep-seated
problems in its banking sector, have prompted fears in financial
markets that China may be forced to devalue its currency, the yuan,
to counter the impact of a weakening yen.

	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The body of a Cuban doctor
missing since Sunday was found floating in a dam, with his hands
tied and two bullet wounds in his chest, police said.
	   Dr. Pedro Orestes Rodriques Sanchez' body was retrieved from the
dam near the Free State provincial capital of Bloemfontein on
Thursday.
	   Police Superintendent Charles Johnson said Friday police
believed Sanchez was killed by robbers.
	   ``We have good leads and hope to make arrests soon,'' Johnson
said.
	   On Tuesday, Sanchez' burnt out car was found in Bloemfontein's
South Park cemetery.
	   Sanchez and his wife, who is also a medical doctor, came to
South Africa after the health ministry recruited several hundred
Cuban medical professionals to boost its under manned services.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A top government politician was allowed
to pay 1,200 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 67) as ``admission of guilt''
fines for beating up court officials seeking to retrieve debts he
owed.
	   Court officials went to Midlands Provincial Governor Herbert
Mahlaba's home in October and December to seize property to offset
outstanding debts, but were assaulted by him using a baton,
according to records of the case. .
	   He retrieved items that had been seized under orders from a
magistrate.
	   There were demands for Mahlaba to face more serious charges of
contempt of court, carrying a prison sentence that would have
resulted in his automatic expulsion from the 150-seat parliament in
Harare.
	   Human rights groups say political figures often behave as if
above the law and receive lenient treatment from the authorities.
	   Police said Thursday Mahlaba had accepted an offer from
prosecutors to pay admission of guilt fines on two counts of
assaulting court messengers and one of violating the Magistrates'
Courts Act.
	   ------
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Cameroon's government is looking for
buyers for its national telecommunications company, Intelcam, and
Camtel, the state-owned mobile telephone network.
	   The government is planning to grant a 15-year concession to
operate the country's cellular telephone network and to sell off
the network jointly operated by Intelcam and the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications, a government statement said.
	   The statement late Thursday did not say when the process would
be completed.
	   Intelcam was among twelve prominent state-owned companies the
government promised last November would be privatized in the next
three years.
	   The government statement said the new concession holder for its
mobile telephone network would have to hold at least 30 percent of
the capital of the newly-privatized company.
	   It said the concession was open to both national and
international investors.
	   Among international investors likely to be interested in the
sale is France-Telecom, France's national telecommunications
company.
	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Five former Cabinet ministers detained in
a government residence since being fired last month for involvement
in alleged financial irregularities have been transferred to a
prison in the capital, Congolese officials said Friday.
	   Former ministers Raphael Ghenda, Pierre Lokombe Kitete, Etienne
Richard M'Baya, Biselele Kanumutambi and Kambale Kabila Mututulo
were taken to Kinshasa's Makala Central Prison on Wednesday
following a special military decree, an official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Ghenda, a former information minister and close confidante of
President Laurent Kabila, was accused of syphoning off dlrs 600,000
set aside to purchase supplies for state-controlled broadcasters.
	   Mututulo, former home affairs minister, was accused of taking
bribes to privatize several unnamed state-owned organizations. None
of the accused have appeared in court.
	   Kabila's government, which captured power in a rebellion against
the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in what was then Zaire, has
summarily jailed political opponents and journalists in a crackdown
against what the president has termed ``enemies of the state.''
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A wealthy businessman denied he help
bankroll a failed attempt by junior military officers to overthrow
the government last year, court officials said.
	   Rajan Mathani appeared in the High Court on Thursday accused of
forgery and treason, joining 77 soldiers and two politicians being
tried for alleged involvement in a coup attempt on Oct. 28.
	   Mathani was arrested last month on suspicion of forging
financial documents.
	   Treason carries a possible death sentence under Zambian law.
	   Appearing in court Thursday, Mathani accused president Frederick
Chiluba of trying to discredit him after he became critical of the
government.
	   Mathani, a Zambian of Asian descent, said he helped fund
Chiluba's 1996 election campaign by donating dlrs 2 million to the
ruling party.

Humor is nothing to joke about for researchers at conference 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Put 115 jokesters together in the same room
and what do you get?
	   Seriousness.
	   The humor mavens gathered this week in the west coast city of
Bergen aren't comedians, but academics interested in the uses and
implications of jokes.
	   ``Everyone here is concerned with taking humor seriously,'' said
Sven Svebak, chairman of the 10th International Society for Humor
Studies annual conference that ends Saturday. ``But there is a lot
of fun during the breaks.''
	   The society, founded in 1976, includes professors in disciplines
ranging from medicine and psychology to religion and philosophy.
What they have in common is an interest in what tickles human
funnybones and why.
	   Svebak, a professor of medicine at the University of Trondheim,
Norway, said humor is among the most complex activities of the
human brain.
	   Svebak said there is no specific theme for the conference and
that the experts have picked their own topics, including humor _ or
lack of it _ in religions, schools, jails and many nation's legal
systems.
	   On Friday, Christie Davies, a British sociologist, addressed a
universal form of humor: The ethnic joke.
	   All over the world, people tell jokes about neighbors in other
countries or regions. And Christie said the jokes are remarkably
similar, despite cultural differences, and are almost always about
how stupid the other side it.
	   ``In Syria, I found jokes that are very similar to those the
British tell about the Irish,'' he said by telephone from Bergen.
``What we see is that the pattern is universal, but the jokes are
not copies.''
	   Davies, of the University of Reading, has kept score in joke
wars raging in about 50 countries or regions.
	   ``The stupidity joke is a measure of dominance,'' he said. And
it is always the dominant, richer or more influential culture that
wins over smaller regions on their periphery, he said.
	   England is leading Ireland, France is beating Belgium, Canada
over Newfoundland, Australia over Tasmania, and so on, he said.
	   Christie said Norway and Sweden, engaged in a long-running joke
war, are a problem, since they appear to be tied.
	   ``Norway is on the periphery of Scandinavia, and is smaller than
Sweden,'' he said. That should mean the Swedes would win the joke
war, but Norway, a major oil exporter, is richer.
	   A typical joke told by both sides in the Swedish-Norwegian war?
	   Why does it take two Swedes (or Norwegians) to wash a car? One
to hold the sponge and the other to drive the car back and forth.

California community finally buries wrath toward native son Steinbeck 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALINAS, California (AP) _ As his extraordinary life was coming
to an end, there was no question in John Steinbeck's mind about
where he wanted to be laid to rest.
	   And dead is about the only way this American author could go
home again.
	   The literary giant was despised in the community where he was
born for his unflattering but award-winning depictions of class
divisions and labor feuds between farmers and migrant workers
during the Depression.
	   His desire to be buried here despite the hostility won over a
few of the locals, and was the first small step toward
reconciliation. In fact, nearly 30 years after his death, Salinas
will officially embrace Steinbeck as a favorite son on Saturday,
opening the National Steinbeck Center in the heart of historic
downtown.
	   The nearly dlrs 12 million center opens its doors with heavy
backing from the families of farmers who felt Steinbeck had
betrayed them.
	   ``He's withstood the test of time,'' said contributor Bill
Ramsey, whose family-owned Mann Packing Inc. has a 60-year history
in the Salinas Valley. ``He's made Salinas very proud.''
	   Steinbeck told his wife, Elaine, days before he died Dec. 20,
1968 in New York City: ``No man should be buried in alien soil.''
	   Of course, there's more than sentiment at work here. The area
would like to capitalize on Steinbeck's commercial value to both
tourism and ongoing urban renewal efforts.
	   Still, many residents, including the farming donors, say the
younger generation is more open-minded, and has come to accept and
respect Steinbeck's stinging words as visionary and truthful.
	   In any case, everyone agrees that before any significant
turnaround could begin, a lot of Steinbeck's enemies had to die.
	   ``We've had a lot of funerals,'' said 72-year-old Pauline
Freeman Pearson, whose interviews with dozens of bitter farmers are
part of the center's archive collection. ``So many of them who
absolutely hated him are gone.''
	   The hatred towards Steinbeck began in earnest with ``The Grapes
of Wrath.'' The bestseller and winner of the 1940 Pulitzer Prize
chronicles the migration of sharecroppers from the Dust Bowl to
California by illusions of a better life.
	   President Hoover called Steinbeck a dangerous subversive. And
the farmers who ruled an industry now worth dlrs 2 billion annually
to the Salinas Valley were enraged that Steinbeck was sympathetic
to the plight of underdog migrant workers.
	   ``He was considered a traitor,'' said Dick Haymon, a local
Steinbeck expert. ``If the conditions were so poor for the
immigrant workers, if they were really living like that, then who
was responsible? The growers. This is a growers' town.''
	   Steinbeck added to the furor in 1952 with ``East of Eden.'' Set
in Salinas, the book is built around the biblical allegory of Cain
and Abel, tracking two American families from the turn of the
century through World War II.
	   Old-timers recall how it was referred to as ``that dirty book,''
and how many townsfolk called each other up to gossip about who the
characters were based on.
	   Betty Bingaman Hillman said her parents were horrified by the
strong language Steinbeck used and his elaborate descriptions of
flop houses and ``things ladies at the bridge club wouldn't even
talk about.''
	   ``They couldn't understand how someone with such nice parents
could write such awful things,'' she said. ``I knew a woman who
used it as a door stop.''
	   Steinbeck's books were banned and burned. His life was
threatened. There are tales of how he would only visit friends
after dark, once to retrieve a copy of the lyrics of ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic'' used to introduce ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
	   The bitterness simmered even after he received the Nobel Prize
in 1962. At Salinas High School, where Steinbeck graduated as
president in 1919, a class devoted to the works of its most famous
student was finally allowed as part of the curriculum for seniors
in 1971.
	   As a result, the progress of the Steinbeck center _ conceived
more than 20 years ago _ has been fitful.
	   The idea picked up steam after a 1979 stamp dedication gave the
community a glimpse of Steinbeck's drawing power.
	   Several buildings were named after him. Then, in 1983, a
collector donated an original manuscript of ``The Pearl,'' and more
scholars visited.
	   The city's redevelopment agency provided a big spark in 1994
with a dlrs 3.5 million grant and land where the center now sits.
	   The following year, the agricultural community joined the
campaign.
	   ``What Steinbeck wrote about at the time was very divisive,''
said Jim Gattis, director of fund raising for the foundation. ``Two
or three generations down, we've taken another look. Was it the
truth? Yes, it was.''

Bridge joy to some, woe to others in Bangladesh

	   ARICHA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of Bangladeshis are pouring
from across the country every day not to cross, but just to gaze
upon the engineering marvel at Bhuapur, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
north of Dhaka.
	   The longest bridge in the region has united Bangladesh, cut a
day-long journey by half and has helped ensure the arrival of fresh
produce to the capital's markets.
	   Less pleased are the thousands of people who run hotels,
restaurants and other small businesses that catered to ferry-goers.
	   Nurul Islam, who had run a 10-room hotel near the ferry terminal
for 30 years, closed his business this week.
	   ``For others the bridge is a joy. For me it's a curse,'' Islam
said.
	   Before the bridge, at least 230 vehicles a day passed through
the ferry terminal at Aricha on the way to Dhaka from 16 northern
districts. Days after the bridge opened, daily traffic was down to
about 50 vehicles.
	   The restaurant where Mofazzal Huq worked closed at Aricha, 25
kilometers from the bridge, two days after the 4.8-kilometer
(three-mile) bridge opened Tuesday.
	   ``I'll have to look for a new job,'' said the 25-year-old father
of three, dressed in a torn sarong.
	   Owners of cars, buses and trucks had at first grumbled at paying
one-way tolls of 400 takas (dlrs 9), 800 takas (dlrs 18) and 1,200
takas (dlrs 26) respectively to cross the bridge.
	   But complaints dissipated in the excitement following the
bridge's opening, and the government has promised to review the
tolls.
	   Munir Hossain, a businessman from Bogra, 100 miles (160
kilometers) to the north, is one of the bridge's fans. Before it
was opened, it took him at least 12 hours to reach Dhaka.
	   ``I can't believe it. I came to Dhaka in less than six hours,''
he said Friday.
	   The price of mangoes grown in the north has doubled to 80 takas
a kilogram (about 90 U.S. cents a pound) because they're in better
shape when they reach market because of the bridge, Dhaka's
Independent newspaper reported.
	   The bridge connects 30 million people in 16 underdeveloped
northern and western districts separated by the river from rest of
Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 120 million.
	   The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Japanese
government each issued interest-free loans of dlrs 200 million to
help build the bridge. Bangladesh, which spent another dlrs 300
million from its own, will have to repay the loans in 50 years.
	   Basing estimates on the first three days of toll revenue, bridge
authorities hope to earn up to 60 million takas (dlrs 1.3 million)
a month, higher than the initial target.

World Cup: Familiar face awaits Dutch coach in second round 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ A familiar face is awaiting Dutch coach
Guus Hiddink when the Netherlands takes on Yugoslavia Monday:
Predrag Mijatovic, who Hiddink bought from Partisan Belgrade when
he was Valencia coach.
	   ``He is a very skillful player,'' Hiddink said Friday, a day
after hearing the Dutch would meet Yugoslavia in the World Cup's
round of 16.
	   ``I needed a second striker and I saw him on tape playing for
Partisan. Buying him was a bit of a gamble because he cost a few
million dollars, but we got it back tenfold when he moved to Real
Madrid,'' Hiddink said.
	   Mijatovic, 29, repaid Madrid this season, scoring the only goal
as Real beat favorite Juventus 1-0 to win the European Cup final.
He moved to Real two seasons ago from Valencia.
	   Mijatovic has scored just once for Yugoslavia so far in the
World Cup.
	   The Netherlands' 2-2 draw with Mexico in Saint-Etienne Thursday
guaranteed it top spot in Group E and a confrontation with Group F
runner-up Yugoslavia.
	   The Dutch avoided arch-rival Germany in the second round, but
Yugoslavia will be just as tough an opponent, Hiddink said.
	   ``I know the team. As a group, they have a lot of individually
very strong players. They are clever and cunning,'' the Dutch coach
added.
	   Hiddink said he planned to watch a video tape of his team's
performance against Mexico to analyze how the match could slip out
of their grasp.
	   After racing into a 2-0 lead and controlling the match for an
hour, the Dutch sat back and allowed Mexico back into the game.
	   Substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored for Mexico in the 75th minute
and then ``El Matador,'' Luis Hernandez, equalized in the fifth
minute of injury time to send Mexico into the second round.
	   ``We're happy we're in the second round,'' Hiddink said. ``But
the whole of the Netherlands wants us to qualify in style and we
also want to do it in style.''
	   Instead, the Dutch went through with a record of one win and two
draws. The only team they managed to beat, in what was considered a
relatively easy qualifying group, was South Korea.
	   On Friday, the starters from Thursday's match went through a
light workout in training, while the Dutch reserves worked hard for
two hours.
	   Hiddink gave his players the afternoon off and scheduled a
closed training session for Saturday afternoon.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters slashed more telephone
cables in Puerto Rico on Friday, cutting service to hundreds more
people even as managers working on repairs threatened to join a
strike against privatizing the state telephone company.
	   ``Many of them (managers) have indicated that if things continue
as they are, they are not going to work and will join the
picketers,'' said Angel Solis, president of the Bonafide
Association of Telephone Management Employees.
	   Managers were against selling the company, too, he said. They
also fear losing jobs. The company has about 6,400 workers and
1,500 managers.
	   On Thursday, strikers attacked on a new front with a boycott of
Banco Popular, the island's largest bank and part of a consortium
buying the telephone utility.
	   The Federation of Teachers closed its dlrs 100 million in
accounts. The General Workers' Council withdrew its dlrs 40 million
and said it was encouraging affiliated unions and their 50,000
members to do the same.
	   Police reported several hoax bomb threats Friday, the day after
a homemade bomb planted at a branch of Banco Popular exploded in a
police officer's hands, tearing off a finger and wounding his other
hand and leg.
	   Dozens of fiber optic cables were slashed overnight and early
Friday, police reported. That was less sabotage than on Thursday,
when protesters planted bombs, smashed automated bank machines and
severed and burned cables.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's parliament adopted a new plan
on refugee returns Friday that envisages the unimpeded return of
tens of thousands of Serbs.
	   The plan passed the 127-member House of Deputies, dominated by
the ruling party of President Franjo Tudjman, with 75 votes in
favor. Four deputies voted against the plan and three abstained.
	   Earlier Friday, Foreign Minister Mate Granic urged parliament to
support the new plan, which was drafted after Europe bluntly told
Croatia that previous schemes were not good enough.
	   He said Croatia could take ``a big step'' toward the European
Union and other institutions by voting for the plan, clearly aware
that Croatia's acceptance by Europe hinges on the vote.

	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The body of a Cuban doctor
missing since Sunday was found floating in a dam, with his hands
tied and two bullet wounds in his chest, police said.
	   Dr. Pedro Orestes Rodriques Sanchez' body was retrieved from the
dam near the Free State provincial capital of Bloemfontein on
Thursday.
	   Police Superintendent Charles Johnson said Friday police
believed Sanchez was killed by robbers.
	   ``We have good leads and hope to make arrests soon,'' Johnson
said.
	   On Tuesday, Sanchez' burnt out car was found in Bloemfontein's
South Park cemetery.
	   Sanchez and his wife, who is also a medical doctor, came to
South Africa after the health ministry recruited several hundred
Cuban medical professionals to boost its under manned services.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of striking Ukrainian miners blocked
Kiev's main street Friday, accusing the government of failing to
pay overdue wages and violating agreements with workers.
	   The protesters sat on the pavement of Khreshchatik Street,
banging their helmets in a rhythm that has become common in the
Ukrainian capital in recent weeks.
	   Police watched, but did not intervene in the seven-hour
demonstration, which created traffic jams across central Kiev. Two
miners were taken in for questioning but later released.
	   ``This action is a gesture of despair,'' said Volodymyr
Martynov, a leader of the Coal Industry Workers' Union, the largest
miners' group.
	   The former Soviet republic's coal industry is plagued by lack of
funds and a huge backlog in unpaid wages that has led to scattered
strikes.
	   Miners at one company in eastern Ukraine marched to Kiev and
besieged government buildings earlier this month, but returned to
their homes when some money was paid.
	   Protesters on Friday accused the government of violating a
general accord with the coal workers signed in late May and
denounced plans to close old mines and purchase cheap coal abroad.
	   The parliament, the Verhkovna Rada, debated industry problems on
Friday, while union leaders met with Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko. The demonstrators dispersed after working out some
thorny details of a separate deal that the authorities signed with
their union Thursday.
	   President Leonid Kuchma fired four deputy coal industry
ministers and the government named former union boss Viktor Derzhak
as head of the new state-run coal company Ugol Ukrainy, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Derzhak immediately called for reducing the number of
intermediaries selling coal, which he said amounted to ``34 various
organizations with 836 people'' within the Coal Industry Ministry
alone.
	   Besides funding problems, Ukraine's mines are known for outdated
equipment and accidents caused by poor safety measures.
	   The pattern continued this week with three more miners killed in
job-related accidents in eastern Ukraine, according to the
Emergency Situations Ministry. The deaths Wednesday brought the
total of coal industry fatalities to about 180 this year.

Authorities rule out terrorist motive in Paris explosion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities have ruled out any terrorist
motive in Thursday's apartment explosion in eastern Paris, which
killed two people, officials said.
	   Officials close to the city's chief prosecutor, who requested
anonymity, said the explosion, which killed a 45-year-old Yugoslav
woman and her boyfriend, was almost certainly a result of a
non-political crime.
	   The two died after the woman opened a package which contained a
powerful explosive device, police said.
	   Witnesses said they heard a loud blast which was followed by
thick black smoke, and fires in the three-story building in the
Bastille neighborhood.
	   The device contained scrap metal and ball bearings, police said
Thursday.
	   Authorities made no link between the blast and the World Cup.
French authorities have stepped up security around the soccer
championship, fearing possible attacks by extremists.
	   Anti-terrorist police inspected the scene of the explosion
Thursday night, but later were taken off the case, the officials
said.

Greek Archbishop opposes Iraq embargo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Vocal Orthodox Archbishop Christodoulos
said Friday he will lend his support to a group of politicians
fighting the eight-year embargo against Iraq, local media reported.
	   ``Our brothers in Iraq are tormented and exhausted,''
Christodoulos said.
	   He will join a bipartisan group of about 70 Greek parliamentary
deputies who want the United Nations to lift the embargo against
Iraq. They claim the embargo doesn't affect Iraqi policy but harms
the country's citizens, especially children.
	   The Greek Aid Commission wants to send a shipment of medical and
humanitarian aid to Iraq and bring children in need of urgent
medical attention to Greece.
	   Orthodoxy is the state religion of Greece. The head of the
church has no political powers but is considered an influential
figure. Christodoulos has come under fire for frequently making
stinging criticisms of government policy since being elected in
April.

Russian markets fall despite IMF decision to release loan installment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES government raising interest rates, closing stocks.
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday a decision by the
International Monetary Fund to release a delayed installment of a
dlrs 9 billion loan, seeing it as a vote of confidence in Russia's
struggling economy.
	   But investors apparently disagreed.
	   The stock market closed 4.97 percent lower, with traders citing
fears that an IMF bailout is moving too slowly. Heavy selling on
the treasury market prompted the Central Bank to raise key interest
rates to 80 percent from 60 percent.
	   The markets have been keeping a close eye on Russia's talks with
the IMF over disbursement of its current dlrs 9.2 billion loan and
negotiations over a new loan the government hopes will top dlrs 10
billion.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's liaison
with international lenders, praised the IMF's decision on Thursday
to release the delayed dlrs 670 million installment as ``quite
natural and logical.''
	   ``It is important in principle that IMF board members ... regard
the ailments of the Russian economy as quite curable,'' Chubais
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The fund decided last week to hold up the installment, saying
Russia had to do more to balance the federal budget and reform key
areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax collection
system.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan
to the IMF earlier this week that officials said appeared to meet
many of the fund's criteria.
	   The fund was to begin deliberations Friday on whether to lend
Russia even more money. Russia is seeking an additional dlrs 10
billion to dlrs 15 billion loan to help shore up Central Bank
reserves and foster economic recovery.
	   Chubais said he was optimistic that the negotiations could be
completed within a month.
	   ``There is no super-difficult problem with the IMF,'' Chubais
said. ``That is why we will try to speed up the process, not in the
two months as was announced before, but in one month.''
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy speaker of parliament, said the
legislature may delay its summer recess to debate the government's
austerity plan and vote on the necessary legislation, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency. The summer recess was scheduled to begin
July 3.
	   Traders said investors fear the aid may come too late to prop up
the state finances. Russia's stock market has lost about half its
value since the beginning of the year, with investors worried about
falling oil prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the
Asian financial crisis.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.

Russia may strip Latvia of most-favored-nation status 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may revoke Latvia's most-favored-nation
trade status, a news agency reported Friday.
	   ``Riga's position on the Russian-speaking population in Latvia
can only cause a negative reaction on the part of Russia,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Relations between Latvia and Russia have worsened since Latvia
decided in 1991 to grant automatic citizenship only to those who
lived in the country before World War II and their descendants.
Though Latvia has eased this policy somewhat, many Soviet-era
immigrants and their children are stateless.
	   The Kremlin has accused Latvia of using citizenship laws to
permanently disenfranchise Russian-speakers who cannot vote in
national elections or hold certain jobs without citizenship.
	   Denial of most-favored-nation trade status would probably mean
that tariffs on Latvian goods in Russia would rise, making them
less competitive in the Russian market, Interfax said, citing the
Latvian Economics Ministry.

	   NICE, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann are
scoring their goals and Germany is marching on. It may not be
pretty, but the Germans are where they want to be.
	   But, there are sign of tension within the team, with some
players unhappy with being demoted to the bench.
	   ``We wanted to be first in the group and we achieved our
objective,'' said coach Berti Vogts after his team's 2-0 victory
over Iran in Montpellier on Thursday.
	   The win put Germany atop Group F, to face Mexico in the second
round Monday, also in Montpellier.
	   The Germans have played Mexico twice in the World Cup, winning
6-0 in 1978 in Argentina and 4-1 on penalties after a goalless
quarterfinal clash on Mexican soil in 1986.
	   Bierhoff, who like Klinsmann has scored two goals so far for
Germany, conceded Friday that the European champion has not
provided much entertainment.
	   ``Yes, it's correct to a certain extent to say that we've been
playing for results so far,'' Bierhoff said. ``But we don't go into
a match like that, we go in trying to score as many as we can. But
what good is a 6-1 if you go home?''
	   Spain beat Bulgaria 6-1 but still failed to advance to the
second round.
	   ``We try to score as many goals as we can to please the fans,
but I must say we haven't done that in the first three games. We
were not convincing.''
	   ``There have been many surprises here. We finished the group
with seven points, more than Brazil or the Netherlands,'' Bierhoff
said, whose goal against Iran brought his international tally to 19
in 29 games.
	   Germany also beat the United States 2-0 and had a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia, finishing first on goal difference.
	   ``We are a typical tournament team. We can improve a lot and I
am sure we will,'' said Bierhoff, who topped the Italian league
with 27 goals this season.
	   Speaking about Mexico, Bierhoff said, ``On paper, they look like
an easier rival for us.''
	   ``I thought they were finished after going down 2-0, but they
came back and they played with a lot of heart,'' Bierhoff said.
``We have to be on alert for 90 or 95 minutes and we have to keep
them under pressure.''
	   Mexico trailed the Netherlands 2-0 before coming back and
clinching a draw with a last-second goal, after achieving a similar
comeback against Belgium.
	   Two Germans who played against Mexico in 1986 are still in the
team _ Lothar Matthaeus and Olaf Thon.
	   And it is precisely these two who are in the center of a storm
brewing in the German ranks.
	   Thon came into the World Cup as No. 1 libero, with Matthaeus as
his understudy.
	   But Matthaeus, the 37-year-old veteran in his fifth World Cup,
wasn't going to be happy on the bench forever. Against Iran, both
were starters, Thon as libero, Matthaeus in midfield.
	   At halftime, Thon was left in the locker room, Matthaeus moved
into libero and Dietmar Hamann came into midfield. That helped
Germany score two quick goals and secure the victory.
	   ``I wasn't very pleased, I was angry'' Thon said of his
substitution. ``I was surprised and disappointed and I didn't
understand the substitution.''
	   Matthaeus, who scored one goal in the penalty shootout against
Mexico in 1986, looks set to remain as libero and is quickly
assuming the role of leader on the field, something Germany
appeared to be lacking in early games.
	   ``Olaf was upset and I can understand him,'' Matthaeus said.
``But he has to have respect for other players. He must also
understand how I feel.''
	   Meanwhile, midfielder Thomas Haessler missed Friday's practice
because of a sore Achilles' tendon. But he is expected to be fit
for Mexico.
	   After training Friday mid-morning, the Germans were given off
until Saturday 10 a.m.

Japan says photo film market practices are fair
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission on Friday announced
that a two-year probe into the country's photo film business found
no unfair trade practices hindering foreign access to the market, a
news report said.
	   The FTC said some business practices targeted for criticism have
been voluntarily abolished by photo makers such as Fuji Photo Film
Co., the nation's top maker of photosensitive materials, Kyodo News
agency said.
	   Such practices included subsidies paid by Fuji to distributors
for handling only Fuji Photo products, the report said. The FTC
could not be reached for comment late Friday.
	   The findings are in line with the report released in April by a
World Trade Organization panel, which rejected U.S. complaints
about discrimination against foreign producers of photographic
films and papers.
	   The dispute dates back to June 1996, when the United States took
its case to the world trade watchdog saying that Japan was engaged
in noncompetitive practices which favored Fuji Photo over Eastman
Kodak Co. of the United States and other foreign makers.

WIMBLEDON: third-round match. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Graf, making her 13th appearance at Wimbledon, was competing in
only her fifth tournament of the year due to knee and hamstring
injuries.
	   Her lack of match play showed as she struggled from the outset
in the rain-delayed Centre Court match.
	   Graf double faulted six times, had trouble returning serve and
was kept off balance by Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice in the last seven years.
	   There has been speculation that this would be Graf's last
Wimbledon. The 29-year-old revealed this week that she considered
retirement two months ago after continued problems with injuries.
	   Graf broke down in tears at a news conference on Monday, saying
she was overcome just to be back at Wimbledon again.
	   She showed little emotion Wednesday, offering a quick wave with
her left hand as she walked off Centre Court.

Ex-heavyweight champion Seldon sentenced 
</HEADLINE>
By MELANIE BURNEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAMDEN, New Jersey (AP) _ Former WBA heavyweight champion Bruce
Seldon was sentenced today to five years probation plus 364 days in
jail for smoking pot with a 15-year-old girl and taking part in
``sexual activity'' with her last year.
	   The jail sentence was stayed until Wednesday to allow Seldon's
attorney to apply for house arrest or a work-release program for
his client in place of the jail term.
	   Seldon pleaded guilty in May to two counts of endangering the
welfare of a child. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to
dismiss a more serious charge of sexual assault as well as drug and
weapons offenses.
	   The fighter faced a maximum five-year prison sentence on each of
the endangerment counts. Judge Stephen W. Thompson said that as a
sex offender, Seldon will have to register his whereabouts with
police.
	   Seldon had remained free on dlrs 50,000 pending sentencing.
	   Seldon, 31, admitted picking the girl up in Atlantic City on
Nov. 17 and taking her to his house in Gloucester Township. There,
the girl smoked a marijuana joint and he took sexually provocative
photographs of her, he said at his plea.
	   Following the sentencing, Seldon was contrite. ``I'm terribly
sorry for everything that happened. I'm not a bad person. I didn't
mean for any of this to happen,'' he said.
	   The prosecutor agreed with the defense lawyer there were no
indications that force was used. The sexual assault charges were
filed after the girl went to police headquarters several days after
the incident and said Seldon had raped her.
	   Seldon, the WBA's eighth-ranked heavyweight, has not fought
since losing his title to Mike Tyson on Sept. 7, 1996, in Las
Vegas. That fight lasted 109 seconds.

Nippon Ham beats Orix 6-1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Pacific League front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters beat the cellar-dwelling Orix Bluewave 6-1 in a marathon
12-inning game on Friday to extend their winning streak to seven.
	   Nippon Ham infielder Hiroshi Narahashi batted in two runs in the
bottom of the twelfth to break a 1-1 tie.
	   Orix reliever, Edwin Hurtado, formerly with the Seattle
Mariners, took the loss, his second of the year against six wins.
	   In Fukuoka, Domingo Martinez hit a two-run homer in the 2nd
inning as the Seibu Lions rolled past the Fukoka Daiei Hawks 13-7.
It was the 15th homer of the year for Martinez, who formerly played
for a Triple-A team in Rochester.
	   Seibu's Kazuo Matsui scored four runs and Taisei Takagi knocked
in three runs on four hits to lead the Lions.
	   Starter Brian Williams, formerly of the Baltimore Orioles, took
the loss, dropping to 1-4.
	   The Hawks have lost five straight and seven of their last eight
games.
	   In another extra-inning game, the Kintetsu Buffaloes defeated
the Lotte Marines 3-1 at Chiba Marine Stadium.
	   Kintetsu infielder Takashi Yoshida batted in the winning run in
the top of the eleventh.
	   In the Central League, Yakult Swallows' hurler Tomohito Ito
struck out nine to lead the Swallows past the Hanshin Tigers 1-0.
	   Yakult's Shinya Miyamoto drove in the game's only run with a
seventh-inning single.
	   In Nagoya, Hiroshima Carp starter Nathan Minchey allowed only
five hits over eight innings as the Carp broke an eight-game losing
streak with a 2-1 victory over the Chunichi Dragons. Minchey,
formerly of the Boston Red Sox, improved to 6-6.
	   Hiroshima catcher Terunobu Seto drove both of the Carp's runs
with a double in the seventh.

Protests mount as challenge launched against Togo government 
</HEADLINE>
By COMBIETE COMBEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Opposition activists in the West African
country of Togo marched through the streets for a third straight
day Friday, despite threats of a clampdown by President Gnassigbe
Eyadema's newly-reinstalled government.
	   Demonstrators, many wearing red scarfs and bandanas, shouted
opposition slogans and called for the ouster of Eyadema, who was
proclaimed winner of Togo's widely-disputed presidential elections
after the chief electoral officer resigned.
	   Eyadema has ruled this tiny French-speaking country for 31 years
since taker power as a military dictator.
	   ``Eyadema _ thief! Gilchrist _ president!'' the protesters
chanted, referring to the country's best-known opposition
candidate, Gilchrist Olympio, the son of Togo's first president.
	   According to figures released by the ruling party, Olympio came
in second in the Sunday elections with 34 percent of the vote,
behind Eyadema's 52 percent. Olympio's supporters had earlier
claimed a majority.
	   Friday's demonstrations were dispersed after more than three
hours by heavily-armed police and military troops who wielded clubs
and threw teargas grenades. There were no reports of injuries.
	   On Wednesday at least one person was severely beaten by police
during the first day of protests.
	   Thursday night, Interior Minister Seyi Memene announced a
sweeping ban on public protests, but the next morning rescinded the
decision without giving reasons as Friday's protests were
beginning, state-controlled radio reported.
	   Two opposition candidates _ Yaouvi Agboyibo and Zarifou Ayeva _
said Friday they had lodged a legal challenge to Eyadema's
presidency in the country's Constitutional Court.
	   The challengers said the Monday resignation of elections
commission president Awa Nana and four other officials had
essentially nullified the results announced by Eyadema's camp.
	   The United States and European Union have both criticized the
elections as flawed, with EU observers saying the vote counting had
been stopped before a clear winner could be determined.

Eds: UPDATES with Russia-Argentina to install hot line.
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and visiting
Argentine President Carlos Menem agreed Friday to set up a hot line
between their two countries.
	   Details of the hot line were not made public.
	   Menem is the first Argentine president to make a state visit to
Russia.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Friday that Argentina is a
trading partner ``of major importance.''
	   He called Argentina ``an independent economic and political
center in a multi-polar world,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kiriyenko praised talks between Menem and President Boris
Yeltsin on Thursday as ``fruitful,'' saying that Yeltsin was
``highly pleased'' with trade and general cooperation agreements
signed between the two countries,
	   Officials from Russia and Argentina signed several other
agreements on air traffic, illegal drugs and weapons trafficking,
and a program of cultural and educational exchanges for 1998 and
1999.
	   Menem also had lunch Friday with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who
said the city was interested in buying more meat from Argentina,
ITAR-Tass said. Menem invited Luzhkov to visit Argentina.

Motorcycles vroooom onto New York's high art scene

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Some wore Brooks Brothers, others wore leather.
	   Hundreds of motorcyclists roared up Park Avenue to the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum for a rare meeting between high culture and
chrome fenders, handlebars, tailpipes and kickstands.
	   The museum's famous circular ramp was lined with 114 motorcycles
_ from 19th century bicycles with engines to roaring metallic
monsters, including the most famous of all: a replica of the Harley
Davidson Chopper straddled by Peter Fonda in ``Easy Rider.''
	   ``We thought the motorcycle was the perfect metaphor for the
20th century,'' Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim
Foundation, told the crowd of about 1,000 gathered for a preview of
the exhibit.
	   ``It embodies so many themes of this century _ technology,
speed, rebellion, transformation.''
	   The new exhibit, which runs through Sept. 20, examines the
motorcycle's societal impact, its advancement as technology changed
and its role as modern art.
	   A young Marlon Brando in leather, pictured on a bike in the 1954
film ``The Wild One,'' represents youth alienation in the 1950s and
was adopted as a symbol by the counterculture of the 1960s. A
classic Triumph Twenty-One 350 along with other bikes of the time
are displayed on an undulating white wooden floor _ a
representation of a turbulent time.
	   Big, flashy, fast and expensive motorcycles, such as the
monstrous Yamaha Vmax built in 1989, represent the me-me-me decade,
the 1980s.
	   For the 1990s, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic Terminator
atop a monstrous motorcycle that combined retro and revolutionary
elements, such as a classic motorcycle frame covered in Kevlar and
carbon fiber.
	   The Guggenheim was founded in 1937, and its landmark building
was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It opened a downtown branch in
1992.
	   Jeffrey Carpenter, 28, drove all the way from Boston on his 1995
BMW R1100R to get one of the first looks at the museum's
collection.
	   ``Can you imagine riding one of those?'' he said of a
turn-of-the-century steam-powered bike. ``The person who built that
was either brilliant or crazy.''
	   Standing at the exhibit's start at the bottom of the ramp,
Carpenter said: ``I'll be honest. I'm just praying somebody left a
set of keys in one of these babies.''

	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
one-sided in tennis. Their first match was the most memorable, when
Graf humiliated Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in just over 30 minutes in the
1988 French Open final.
	   Shattered by that defeat, Zvereva has never reached a Grand Slam
singles final since then, although she has excelled in doubles.
	   But on Friday, Zvereva thoroughly outplayed Graf.
	   She broke serve in the first game, saved the only break point of
the set against her in the next game and never let Graf get into
her groove.
	   The two stayed on serve in the second set until the 11th game
when Zvereva got the decisive break for a 6-5 lead.
	   With Zvereva serving for the match, Graf failed to convert two
break points at 15-40 and the match ended with a backhand return
into the net.

	   Showers delayed the start of Friday's play by 3 hours, 50
minutes, and there was the threat of more rain later in the
afternoon and in the next few days.
	   Friday was the third rain-affected day of the tournament so far.
	   Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport were among the women
scheduled to play third-round matches Friday.
	   On the men's side, defending champion Pete Sampras faced a
potentially trick third-round match Friday against Sweden's Thomas
Enqvist.
	   Venus Williams, meanwhile, is gearing up for a Wimbledon
showdown against the ``juggernaut'' _ otherwise known as her best
friend and kid sister, Serena.
	   The Williams sisters crushed their second-round opponents in
straight sets Thursday _ each conceding only three games _ and are
on course for a high-powered meeting in the fourth round.
	   Venus routed Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2, a victory that featured
the fastest serve ever recorded in women's tennis. Serena trounced
fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Venus watched the first set of her sister's match on Centre
Court, then walked over to Court 1 to play her own.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' she said. ``I guess you
have to become the nemesis.''
	   Venus, who turned 18 last week and is the No. 6 seed, is playing
in her second Wimbledon, while the unseeded Serena is appearing in
her first.
	   When the draw was made, it appeared unlikely the sisters would
meet because Serena had Anna Kournikova looming as a second-round
opponent. But Kournikova pulled out with a thumb injury, clearing
the path for an all-Williams clash.
	   There are just two remaining hurdles. Serena next plays Virginia
Ruano-Pascual, while Venus faces Chanda Rubin or Tara Snyder.
	   The sisters have met twice before in tournament play, at this
year's Australian Open and Italian Open. Venus won both times.
	   The men's field has been decimated, with half of the 16 seeds
eliminated in the first two rounds.
	   The latest to go were Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13
seed, and French Open champion Carlos Moya, No. 5.
	   Previous casualties were No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg
Rusedski, No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Cedric Pioline, No. 10
Alex Corretja and No. 15 Karol Kucera.

PRECEDE Copenhagen Danish haute couture designer Erik Mortensen dead at 72 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with further detail
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Erik Mortensen, a leading fashion designer who
worked for the houses of Pierre Balmain and Jean-Louis Scherrer,
has died, the Scherrer house said Friday. He was 72.
	   The Danish-born Mortensen, who had been suffering from skin
cancer for many years, died early Tuesday morning in Paris, a
Scherrer spokeswoman said.
	   He was best known for his elegant, classic approach to clothes
with a feminine accent. He liked working with opulent fabrics such
as silk taffeta and ruffles, and believed that clothes should be
lady-like.
	   ``He loved to make women beautiful,'' Danish writer and friend
Lise Noergaard told Danish radio. `` He worked to the very end,
even in his bed, creating very beautiful things on his drawing
board.''
	   At times, though, Mortensen's touch could be bold. In 1982, he
shocked the staid fashion world when he introduced bermuda shorts
into his first haute couture collection at Balmain following Pierre
Balmain's death.
	   In a statement, the Scherrer house praised Mortensen for his
``great talent and moral integrity. We are very saddened by his
death,'' the house said.
	   Danish radio described Mortensen's life as a ``fairy tale.'' He
was born into a modest family and began working as a seamstress in
his native Frederikshavn, a northern Danish port town.
	   He left home for Copenhagen at the age of 16 and trained under
Denmark's most prominent fahsion designer, Holger Blum.
	   In 1948, he moved to Paris where he was hired by Balmain as an
assistant. He was only 22.
	   He was chief designer there from 1982 to 1990, when he left to
work for rival house Jean-Louis Scherrer.
	   He was awarded the prestigious Golden Thimble in 1983, 1987 and
1994 and was a Knight of the prestigious Order of Arts and Letters.
	   In the mid-80s, Mortensen created new uniforms for the French
police, replacing the famed ``kepi'' hats with a flat cap inspired
by American police.
	   In 1994, Mortensen retired to southern France but led an active
life, designing gowns for royalty and wealthy customers. A
gracious, polite, man, he was known be an avid collector of
antiques.
	   He also created theater costumes for plays in Denmark and wrote
two books in Danish, including one autobiography that became a
best-seller at home.
	   No details were available concerning funeral arrangements or
survivors.

Dodi's father says Diana's brother wrong about love affair 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed said Friday that Princess Diana
and his son, Dodi, had entered into ``the love of their short
lives'' _ and it was ``truly monstrous'' of Diana's brother to
imply that their relationship was just a casual fling.
	   In a BBC Television interview broadcast Thursday night, Earl
Spencer did not say the relationship was casual but that his
sister's relationship with Dodi had not gone past the ``exciting''
and ``heady stage.'' And he dismissed Al Fayed's claims that they
were set to marry when they were killed in a Paris car crash on
Aug. 31.
	   Nobody in Diana's family knew of any marriage plans, Spencer
said. ``It is speculation as to what might have happened or what
might not have happened. It is completely ridiculous.''
	   Writing in The Mirror newspaper, Al Fayed said he was sure that
if Diana and Dodi had lived, she would have discussed Dodi's
marriage proposal with her elder son, Prince William, when she
returned to London.
	   ``Had Prince William given his approval _ and I feel sure that,
like any loving son in such a situation, he would have replied:
`Whatever makes you happy, mummy' _ I believe that an announcement
of an engagement would have followed,'' Al Fayed said.
	   Al Fayed said the earl's ``courageous and historic eulogy'' at
Diana's funeral had noted that she had at last found joy in her
private life.
	   ``Now he seeks to contradict himself for the ignoble purpose of
attacking me,'' Al Fayed said.
	   ``What is truly monstrous is the earl's implication that his
sister's relationship with my son was just a casual thing of no
real significance to either party,'' he said. ``... I know that
Dodi and Diana had entered into the love of their short lives. It
only adds to the anguish of all concerned that the earl should seek
to deny their evident happiness.''
	   Al Fayed said it was understandable that Diana's family was not
aware of her marriage plans.
	   ``The princess was hardly on speaking terms with most members of
her immediate family,'' he said.
	   Al Fayed said Diana was devastated when her brother broke an
agreement for her to use a house on the family's estate. Although
they patched up their relationship when Diana visited Spencer in
South Africa in the spring of 1997, they ``were not on good terms''
and had not spoken for some time before her death, he said.
	   In his interview, the earl denied that Diana spoke before her
death. Al Fayed stood by his earlier statements that he was told
Diana's dying words and said a policeman on the scene soon after
the crash ``contradicts that arrogant assertion.''
	   According to excerpts from a new book, ``Investigation on the
Death of Diana,'' published Thursday in a French news magazine, a
policeman and pedestrian at the crash scene found the critically
injured princess moaning ``My God, My God'' while photographers
snapped away.

Graf ousted by Zvereva
Eds: combines previous; will be updated with quotes
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf's bid for an eighth
Wimbledon title ended Friday with a stunning defeat to a player she
had beaten 17 straight times.
	   Natasha Zvereva, a doubles specialist who had won only three
sets against Graf in all their previous meetings, beat the
fourth-seeed German 6-4, 7-5 in a third-round match.
	   Graf, making her 13th appearance at Wimbledon, was competing in
only her fifth tournament of the year due to knee and hamstring
injuries.
	   Her lack of match play showed as she struggled from the outset
in the rain-delayed Centre Court match.
	   Graf double faulted six times, had trouble returning serve and
was kept off balance by Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice in the last seven years.
	   There has been speculation that this would be Graf's last
Wimbledon. The 29-year-old revealed this week that she considered
retirement two months ago after continued problems with injuries.
	   Graf broke down in tears at a news conference on Monday, saying
she was overcome just to be back at Wimbledon again.
	   She showed little emotion Wednesday, offering a quick wave with
her left hand as she walked off Centre Court.
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
one-sided in tennis. Their first match was the most memorable, when
Graf humiliated Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in just over 30 minutes in the
1988 French Open final.
	   Shattered by that defeat, Zvereva has never reached a Grand Slam
singles final since then, although she has excelled in doubles.
	   But on Friday, Zvereva thoroughly outplayed Graf.
	   She broke serve in the first game, saved the only break point of
the set against her in the next game and never let Graf get into
her groove.
	   The two stayed on serve in the second set until the 11th game
when Zvereva got the decisive break for a 6-5 lead.
	   With Zvereva serving for the match, Graf failed to convert two
break points at 15-40 and the match ended with a backhand return
into the net.
	   Showers delayed the start of Friday's play by 3 hours, 50

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Mostly clear skies with just a few passing clouds prevailed
across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico during the overnight
hours. Widely scattered showers were noted mainly across the
coastal waters. Low temperatures ranged from 65 to 75 degrees,

Italian premier visiting Iran, taking the lead among EU allies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi will visit Iran next week,
making the first trip to that country by a Western leader in six
years.
	   The three-day visit, prepared during a stop in Tehran in March
by Prodi's foreign minister, was a clear sign that Italy intends to
take the lead among its EU allies in bolstering relations with the
Iranians.
	   ``It is exclusively a political trip, to understand'' the
changes taking place, Prodi's spokesman, Ricardo Franco Levi, said
Friday.
	   Although Prodi will be accompanied by his foreign trade
minister, Levi denied that Italian officials are making the visit
to drum up business.
	   In March, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for better
ties with Italy.
	   The last Western head of goverment to visit Tehran was Greek
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, who traveled there in 1992.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was the first Western
Cabinet official to travel to Iran since the European Union lifted
a ban in March on high-level visits.
	   The EU ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed last year after a
German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Relations were
already strained by Iran's 1989 death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie.
	   Until recently, U.S. policy has depicted Iran as a rogue state
that must be isolated.
	   But the Clinton administration has been opening cautiously to
Khatami, a moderate who has been seeking to reform society while
keeping conservatives at bay.
	   Prodi will leave for Tehran Tuesday and is scheduled to meet
with Khatami and other top government leaders.

	   ASSEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Four-time world champion Michael
``Mick'' Doohan of Australia raced to pole position in Friday's
second qualifying session ahead of Saturday's Dutch motorcycle
Grand Prix.
	   Riding a Honda, Doohan captured the No. 1 starting position in
the 500cc race with a time of 2 minutes 2.092 seconds for the lap.
	   In the 250cc class, Loris Capirossi of Italy, riding an Aprilia,

	   Japan's Kazuto Sakata, also riding an Aprilia, came in first in
the 125cc class with 2:13.411.
	   Doohan's time beat the circuit record lap of 2:02.443, set in
1991 by Kevin Schwantz.
	   In the overall standings, Doohan, the 32-year-old defending
world champion, comes to Saturday's race with 90 points, trailing
in fourth place. Spain's Alex Criville leads the overall standings
with 103 points.

PRECEDE Copenhagen Danish haute couture designer Erik Mortensen dead at 72 points 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with further detail. RETRANSMITTING: new to some
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Erik Mortensen, a leading fashion designer who
worked for the houses of Pierre Balmain and Jean-Louis Scherrer,
has died, the Scherrer house said Friday. He was 72.
	   The Danish-born Mortensen, who had been suffering from skin
cancer for many years, died early Tuesday morning in Paris, a
Scherrer spokeswoman said.
	   He was best known for his elegant, classic approach to clothes
with a feminine accent. He liked working with opulent fabrics such
as silk taffeta and ruffles, and believed that clothes should be
lady-like.
	   ``He loved to make women beautiful,'' Danish writer and friend
Lise Noergaard told Danish radio. `` He worked to the very end,
even in his bed, creating very beautiful things on his drawing
board.''
	   At times, though, Mortensen's touch could be bold. In 1982, he
shocked the staid fashion world when he introduced bermuda shorts
into his first haute couture collection at Balmain following Pierre
Balmain's death.
	   In a statement, the Scherrer house praised Mortensen for his
``great talent and moral integrity. We are very saddened by his
death,'' the house said.
	   Danish radio described Mortensen's life as a ``fairy tale.'' He
was born into a modest family and began working as a seamstress in
his native Frederikshavn, a northern Danish port town.
	   He left home for Copenhagen at the age of 16 and trained under
Denmark's most prominent fahsion designer, Holger Blum.
	   In 1948, he moved to Paris where he was hired by Balmain as an
assistant. He was only 22.
	   He was chief designer there from 1982 to 1990, when he left to
work for rival house Jean-Louis Scherrer.
	   He was awarded the prestigious Golden Thimble in 1983, 1987 and
1994 and was a Knight of the prestigious Order of Arts and Letters.
	   In the mid-80s, Mortensen created new uniforms for the French
police, replacing the famed ``kepi'' hats with a flat cap inspired
by American police.
	   In 1994, Mortensen retired to southern France but led an active
life, designing gowns for royalty and wealthy customers. A
gracious, polite, man, he was known be an avid collector of
antiques.
	   He also created theater costumes for plays in Denmark and wrote
two books in Danish, including one autobiography that became a
best-seller at home.
	   No details were available concerning funeral arrangements or
survivors.

World Cup: Jamaica gets first-ever victory AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ The Reggae Boyz got their first-ever World
Cup victory Friday, with Theodore Whitmore scoring twice to give
Jamaica a 2-1 victory over Japan.
	   In a farewell battle of tournament newcomers already eliminated
from second-round contention, Whitmore scored in the 40th and 54th
minutes in the first World Cup victory by a Caribbean nation since
Cuba beat Romania 2-1 in 1938, also in France.
	   The loss ended a hard-luck tournament for Japan, which proved in
all three games that it can do everything except score. Once again,
the Japanese play on defense and in midfield was competent and
sometimes masterful, but the 2002 Cup co-hosts lacked the quality
striker who could finish off the chances and left France 98 with
only one goal _ Masashi Nakayama's strike in the 74th minute.
	   Whitmore opened the scoring by capitalizing when teammate
Stephen Malcolm and Japanese defender Yutaka Akita collided while
trying to play the ball in the penalty area. Whitmore then drove
his 12-meter shot past defender Naoki Soma and to the right of
goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   Whitmore added his second when the Japanese defense gave him
space to take Fitzroy Simpson's pass down the right wing. The
midfielder spun defender Noria Omura around and nailed a
left-footed drive from 15 meters.
	   Japan hit the post and forced goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence to make
several solid saves in the second half, and finally broke through
when Naoki Soma's long ball was headed by Wagner Lopes to Nakayama,
whose one-timer from 8 meters easily beat Lawrence.
	   Jamaica was content to play a long-ball strategy in the early
minutes, then stepped up the attack when the Japanese grew
frustrated. Whitmore's second goal came immediately after a missed
Japan scoring opportunity, and its deflated defenders were caught
off guard.
	   Jamaica also had a goal disallowed in the 15th minute when Ian
Goodison, who headed in a well-laid corner kick from Simpson, was
apparently whistled for pushing by Austrian referee Gunter Benko.
	   The spirited blue-clad Japanese fans overwhelmed the black,
green and gold contingent from Jamaica on another rainy day at the
Stade de Gerland. Japan wanted a win to help justify its role as
co-host of the 2002 World Cup.

World Cup: Argentina beats Croatia 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Argentina kept a perfect World Cup
record Friday, beating Croatia 1-0 to win Group H and its stifling
defense remained the only one not to concede a single goal in the
first round.
	   On top of that, a defender made the difference up front too.
	   In the 36th minute, a deep pass from Daniel Ortega was deflected
into the path of defender Hector Pineda on the left, and with the
Croatian defense all over the place, Pineda took his time to put
the ball past Drazen Ladic.
	   The best chance in the lackluster Croatian performance came in
the 63rd minute when substitute Goran Vlaovic unleashed a 27-meter
drive that crashed onto the post, with Carlos Roa well beaten.
	   For most of the match it was Argentina that provided the action.
	   On the stroke of half time Marcelo Gallardo almost added a
second, when he hit a freekick into the wall and was allowed to
line up the rebound from 12 meters, forcing a great save from
Ladic.
	   In the 71st minute, defender Roberto Ayala, who had a great
game, slalomed through the Croatian defense and his curling
right-foot shot just went the wrong side of the post.
	   Gabriel Batistuta, the co-top scorer in the competition with
four goals had a mediocre game, easily held in control by the
Croatian defense.
	   At the other end, Croatia's Davor Suker was limited to a
long-range header, but little else.
	   The Argentines were quicker of the ball and it showed after the
goal, with Croatia being forced to commit several fouls to keep the
South Americans at bay.
	   In the 21st minute, Croatian defender Slaven Bilic was given a
yellow card for pulling down Batistuta close to the penalty area.
	   Two minutes later, Ortega committed a similar foul in the
midfield area on his marker Dario Simic and Moroccan referee Said
Belqula showed him yellow for shoving.
	   Argentina's Ayala then got a yellow card for a late tackle on
Aljosa Asanovic in the 35th minute.
	   And in the 44th minute, Zvonimir Soldo got one for a body check
on Ortega and it will suspend him for the second-round game. It
almost led to the second goal, when Gallardo took the freekick.
	   Immediately after halftime, captain Zvonimir Boban got another
yellow for a late tackle on midfielder Juan Veron. And in the 59th
minute, Robert Jarni got yet another for protesting a referee's
decision.
	   Both teams were already assured a place in the second round so
the battle centered on who would take first place in Group H.
	   Croatia was boosted by the return of Boban, who sat out the
Japan game with a pulled leg muscle. Veteran defender Igor Stimac,
suffering from blistered feet, was the only regular starter missing
but came on as a substitute.
	   After routing Jamaica 5-0 and defeating Japan 1-0, the South
Americans only needed a draw to finish atop the group and set up a
second-round game with the Group G runner-up _ most likely England
or Colombia.
	   Croatia, which beat Jamaica only 3-1, can expect to face Romania
unless it wins on Friday.
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella replaced AC Parma's Roberto
Sensini, who has a pulled leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. He also
rested Jose Chamot, who was facing the threat of suspension because
he already received a yellow card in an earlier game.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Pablo Paz, Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala,
Javier Zanetti (68, Diegi Simeone), Hector Pineda; Juan Veron,
Marcelo Gallardo (81, Sergio Berti), Matias Almeyda; Ariel Ortega
(53, Claudio Lopez), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Dario
Simic, Slaven Bilic, Silvio Maric (46, Goran Vlaovic), Aljosa
Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban, Robert Prosinecki (68, Igor Stimac);
Mario Stanic, Davor Suker.
	   Referee : Said Belqola, Morocca.

Japanese auto exports drop for 1st time in two years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell in
May for the first time in two years because of plunging shipments
to recession-plagued Asia, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association said Friday.
	   Overall exports fell 3 percent to 337,794 units. May exports
were down 11.1 percent compared with April. The 3 percent drop in
May follows a 4.9 percent rise in April and a 13.0 percent increase
in March.
	   By type of vehicle, exports of passenger cars edged up 1.5
percent to 275,613. Exports of trucks, however, tumbled 17.6
percent to 58,129 and buses plunged 34.4 percent to 4,052.
	   Passenger car exports rose for the 21st straight month while
trucks fell for the fifth straight month.
	   By region, Asia exports plunged 59.5 percent to 21,444.
Asia-bound exports fell for the eighth straight month as the
financial crisis in the region continued to hit auto demand.
U.S.-bound exports fell 1.2 percent to 90,714, falling for the
first time in five months.
	   Hiroki Mochida, a spokesman for the auto association, said that
although the U.S. market remains strong, efforts by some
automakers, such as Nissan Motor Co., to adjust high inventory
inventories in the United States slowed overall exports to that
market.
	   Mochida and analysts said exports are likely to drop for the
full fiscal year ending March 31, 1999, because of the
bigger-than-expected drop in shipments to Asia.
	   However, he said the overall drop is unlikely to be very large
because exports to other markets, such as Europe and Latin America,
remain favorable.

German man dead in chair in front of TV more than four years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ The mummified body of a man sitting in a
chair before a television set was found in the eastern German town
of Brandenburg an der Havel, police said Friday. He had apparently
died more than four years ago.
	   No one reported the 51-year-old man was missing, because he
apparently had no relatives and lived in an attic apartment of a
house that no one else lived in, police said.
	   Police said the body was found on June 17 when a real estate
dealer went to inspect the house for someone who inherited it from
the previous owner.
	   Investigation showed the man was unemployed so he would not have
been missed at work. Police said an autopsy showed he died of
natural causes.
	   The owner of house declared it empty in 1994 after getting no
response on several warnings to pay the rent, police said.
Electricity was also cut off then because the bills hadn't been
paid, but apparently no one had bothered to check the apartment.

Graf ousted by Zvereva
Eds: Updates with Graf quotes
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf's bid for an eighth
Wimbledon title ended Friday with a stunning defeat to a player she
had beaten 17 straight times.
	   Natasha Zvereva, a doubles specialist from Belarus who had won
only three sets against Graf in all their previous meetings, beat
the fourth-seeed German 6-4, 7-5 in a third-round match.
	   Graf, making her 13th appearance at Wimbledon, was competing in
only her fifth tournament of the year due to knee and hamstring
injuries.
	   Her lack of match play showed as she struggled from the outset
in the rain-delayed Centre Court match.
	   Graf double faulted six times, had trouble returning serve and
was kept off balance by Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   ``Every time I go on the court I start playing nervously in the
beginning. Clearly it's a lack of matches. Every time it was
important I didn't play the points well at all.''
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   There has been speculation that this would be Graf's last
Wimbledon. The 29-year-old revealed this week that she considered
retirement two months ago after continued problems with injuries.
	   She was non-committal Friday about whether she would be back at
Wimbledon next year.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' she said. ``I definitely
couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play again. Hopefully,
I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy myself. But I've
learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   Graf broke, 8th graf

World Cup: Favored teams avoid each other in chase for quarterfinal AP Sports Writer

Eds: will be updated with Friday's matches
Eds: UPDATES after Argentina winning Group H
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup quarterfinals beckon and the fancied
teams are all avoiding each other.
	   Brazil and Italy both won their groups to make sure there won't
be a repeat of the 1994 final in the second round. Now they won't
meet again unless they both make it the final once more.
	   If the Brazilians beat South American rival Chile at the Parc
des Princes in round two on Saturday they will face the winner of
Sunday's game at Saint-Denis between Olympic champion Nigeria, the
only one of five African nations to make it to the last 16, and
1992 European titlist Denmark.
	   A Brazil-Nigeria quarterfinal would bring together two teams
with hugely talented attacks but suspect defenses.
	   Brazil has quality players like Ronaldo, Bebeto, Denilson up
front with Leonardo, Rivaldo, Cafu and Roberto Carlos attacking
from deep. The Nigerians, who downed a very strong Brazilian team
in the Olympic semifinal two years ago, have Nwankwo Kanu, Victor
Ikpeba, Augustine ``Jay Jay'' Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Tijana
Babangida and Rasheed Yekini among their attacking lineup.
	   Provided the Italians down Norway at Marseille Saturday, Cesare
Maldini's improving team goes to Saint-Denis in the quarterfinal to
meet either host France or Paraguay, who meet Sunday at Lens.
	   An Italy-France quarterfinal looks most likely from those
matchups and that would mean the freescoring French welcoming back
star forward Zinedine Zidane from a two-match suspension against
some of his Juventus colleagues, including fit-again Alessandro Del
Piero.
	   In the other half of the second round draw, Germany topped Group
F to meet Mexico for a place in the last eight and second place
Yugoslavia must face the Netherlands in a matchup of two teams who
have a lot of talent but lack consistency.
	   Banned from the last World Cup as well as two European
Championships because of the nation's involvement in the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, the Yugoslavs made the quarterfinal on their
last appearance in 1990 before going out to the eventual losing
finalist Argentina in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie.
	   Germany, a three-time winner and European champion which still
has many of the players who won the title eight years ago, should
have too much experience for the Mexicans, who only made the last
16 Thursday thanks to a goal in the final seconds of injury time in
a 2-2 tie with the Dutch.
	   The last two second round matchups were finalised Friday.
	   Argentina edged Croatia 1-0 in Bordeaux to finish top of Group H
and will meet the runner up in Group G while the Croatians will
face the Group G winner, which was decided later Friday.
	   Romania has already made it to the second round but didn't know
whether it would go into the last 16 as Group G winner.
	   The Romanians, with a three-point advantage, looked favorites to
finish top and faced already eliminated Tunisia at Saint-Denis
Friday while England and Colombia, both with three points, met at
Lens to fight over the other second round place.
	   If the standings positions remained the same, Argentina would
meet England in round two, thus avoiding Germany in the
quarterfinal, but facing the winner of Netherlands-Yugoslavia.
	   Romania would meet debutant Croatia to set up a likely
quarterfinal against the Germans.

German parliamentary panel recommends spy official's temporary removal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A parliamentary committee has recommended
that the interior security chief for Germany's spy agency be
temporarily removed.
	   The daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported Friday that
the official, Volkmar Foertsch, was rumored to have been a double
agent for Russia but that prosecutors found no evidence of that
after bugging Foertsch's office and keeping him under surveillance.
	   The parliament's oversight committee for espionage agencies
discussed Foertsch at a closed meeting Thursday and then said in a
brief statement that it would be ``appropriate'' for the
63-year-old Foertsch to temporarily retire. But the panel declined
to release any details on the issue.
	   The committee made its recommendation to German President Roman
Herzog, who has the final say on the matter. The panel did not say
under what conditions the temporary measure should be lifted.
	   The spy agency declined to comment on the committee's
recommendation.

	   LENS (AP) _ The Prince of Wales and Prince Harry sent a ``good
luck'' message to Glenn Hoddle and his England team Friday.
	   The two princes are traveling to France for the vital England
versus Colombia World Cup clash, and will be supporting the
national side from the stands.
	   The written message, addressed to the England coach and his
players, was passed around the squad members during lunch at
England's hotel, near Lens in northern France.
	   ``It was handed to all the players and was very much
appreciated,'' said Football Association spokesman David Davies.
	   ``We receive messages from the prime minister regularly, but
it's the first time I can remember receiving a good luck message
from members of the royal family.''
	   ``The message said the princes would be supporting England from
the stands and willing them on,'' Davies said. ``The royals'
message reflects the national support we are receiving.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham will feel the price of fame
regardless of England's World Cup result against Colombia Friday
when his team mates reunite with wives and girlfriends at a posh
hotel in France.
	   The wives and girlfriends of England's soccer players traveled
to Lens early Friday minus Beckham's significant other _ Posh Spice
_ who is on tour in America.
	   Heading the group of England's proudest female supporters were
Claire Ince, wife of midfielder Paul Ince, David Seaman's fiance
Debbie Rogers, and TV presenter Dani Behr, girlfriend of striker
Les Ferdinand.
	   The all-female party travel home Saturday afternoon, hopefully
leaving their men to fight on in the World Cup.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair will make it his
priority to cheer for England in Friday's must-win World Cup match
against Colombia.
	   Blair, who will be watching the match with friends at the
Trimdon Labor Club, said he was fully behind England coach Glenn
Hoddle and the team he selected for the match.
	   ``Glenn Hoddle has got a difficult enough job to do without me
offering advice,'' the Prime Minister said regarding the selection
of teenage striker Michael Owen.
	   Blair, an avid Newcastle United fan, said he would focus special
attention on the efforts of Newcastle striker and England captain
Alan Shearer.
	   ``He is one of the world's greatest strikers and we will be
hoping he is successful and scores a goal or goals,'' he said.
	   ``If he gets the ball enough, he will do well.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ About the only people not talking about the
referees at the World Cup are the referees themselves. They are
strictly forbidden to give interviews about matches and FIFA said
Friday that would not change despite several hotly debated calls in
the tournament.
	   Federation spokesman Keith Cooper also said that there were no
plans to have referees issue brief statements regarding
controversial decisions, as is done by umpires and refs in
baseball, the NFL and the NBA.
	   ``We don't think they have to explain their decisions,'' Cooper
said. ``It's there and it's gone. How do you determine the
decisions that have to be explained and those that don't? The
referees take the decisions. We stand by the referees.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ With his bright red hair, defender Javier Margas of
Chile will certainly stand out in Saturday's second-round match
against Brazil.
	   Margas dyed his hair fire-engine red Thursday as a payoff to a
friendly wager.
	   ``I made a bet that if we got past the first round I would dye
my hair red,'' Margas said. ``If we beat Brazil, I'll do it again,
but with another color.''
	   Margas shouldn't be running out to get the dye just yet. Brazil
leads the series 38-6-12.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CALVIA, Spain (AP) _ The mayor of this resort town in the
Balearic Islands has banned the sale of alcohol from liquor stores
and bars an hour before Friday's World Cup game in which England
plays its future in the competition against Colombia, news reports
said.
	   Mayor Margarita Nejera took the action in an attempt avoid a
repeat Monday's incidents in the nearby town of Magaluff after
England's game against Rumania, the national news agency EFE.
	   English fans were photographed jumping up and down on cars.
	   Both towns are located on the island of Mallorca _ one of the
Balearic chain off Spain's eastern coast _ and are popular holiday
destinations for English tourists with a reputation for heavy
drinking.
	   Justifying the measure councilor Miguel Cristobal said
``prevention is better than cure.''

Court hears witnesses in Polish president's lawsuit against paper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A security agent testified Friday that he
saw President Aleksander Kwasniewski vacationing at a Baltic resort
at the same time as a top Russian spy, confirming part of a
newspaper report denied by the president.
	   But the agent, identified in court only as Jerzy G., did not say
he saw Kwasniewski meet with the Russian in August 1994 as was
reported in the right-wing Zycie newspaper. The alleged meeting was
before Kwasniewski was elected president in 1995.
	   Kwasniewski has denied the report, and filed a lawsuit demanding
that the newspaper apologize and pay him dlrs 715,000 in damages.
	   The Warsaw Provincial Court heard three witnesses in Friday's
hearing, the second since the trial opened in April, and then
adjourned proceedings until September. Kwasniewski did not attend.
	   Zycie reported last August that Kwasniewski met privately for
lunch with Russian diplomat Vladimir Alganov while vacationing at
the Baltic resort of Cetniewo. The newspaper did not provide any
details about their alleged conversation nor did it allege any
wrongdoing on Kwasniewski's part.
	   Kwasniewski, who was then-leader of the ex-communists' party,
has said he left the resort Aug. 2, 1994, before the Russian agent
arrived.
	   But Jerzy G. testified that he saw Kwasniewski playing tennis at
the resort as late as Aug. 8, after Alganov arrived.
	   Another of Friday's witnesses was Zycie reporter Piotr
Pytlakowski, who said that sources told him they saw Kwasniewski
playing tennis with Alganov. But Pytlakowski declined to name the
sources.

Angola's former rebels say sanctions jeopardize peace accord 
</HEADLINE>
Eds:APW pls edit and send to our lines
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Threatened United Nations sanctions would
derail the implementation of UNITA's 1994 peace pact with the
government, the former rebel movement warned Friday.
	   The U.N. Security Council has given UNITA until June 30 to
comply with the outstanding stipulations of the peace accord, which
ended a two-decade civil war in the southwest African nation.
	   The council will freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and ban
its diamond exports unless the movement relinquishes its central
highland strongholds and takes major steps to demobilize the
remnants of its armed forces.
	   The proposed sanctions were ``excessive, unfair, illegal and
illegitimate'' and would ``definitively jeopardize'' the peace
agreement, UNITA said in a written statement.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said his movement's
four strongholds would be handed over only after July 10. He blamed
police harrassment of UNITA supporters for the movement's
reluctance to hand over the areas.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government.
	   U.N. officials in Luanda were unavailable for comment.
	   The U.N. special envoy to Angola left Luanda on Friday for a
tour of five African countries to win support for his efforts to
push the peace process towards its conclusion.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye was due to visit Togo, Ivory Coast, Gabon,
Sao Tome and Principe and Burkina Faso.

Humor is nothing to joke about for researchers at conference 
</HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Put 115 humor experts together in the same
room and what do you get?
	   Seriousness.
	   The humor mavens gathered this week in Bergen on Norway's west
coast aren't comedians, but academics interested in the uses and
implications of jokes.
	   ``Everyone here is concerned with taking humor seriously,'' said
Sven Svebak, chairman of the 10th International Society for Humor
Studies annual conference that ends Saturday. ``But there is a lot
of fun during the breaks.''
	   The society, founded in 1976, includes professors in disciplines
ranging from medicine and psychology to religion and philosophy.
What they have in common is an interest in what tickles human
funnybones and why.
	   There is no specific theme for the conference. Experts have
picked their own topics, including humor _ or lack of it _ in
religions, schools, jails and many nation's legal systems.
	   On Friday, Christie Davies, a British sociologist, addressed the
ethnic joke, a universal form of himor.
	   Christie said ethnic and regional jokes all over the world are
remarkably similar, despite cultural differences, and are almost
always about how stupid the other side it.
	   ``In Syria, I found jokes that are very similar to those the
British tell about the Irish,'' he said by telephone from Bergen.
	   Davies, of the University of Reading, has kept score in joke
wars raging in about 50 countries or regions.
	   ``The stupidity joke is a measure of dominance,'' he said. And
it is always the dominant, richer or more influential culture that
wins over smaller regions on their periphery, he said.
	   For instance, he said that England leads Ireland, France leads
Belgium, Canada leads Newfoundland and Australia leads Tasmania.
	   One exception: Norway and Sweden, engaged in a long-running joke
war, appear to be tied.
	   Norway is on the periphery of Scandinavia, and smaller than
Sweden _ but it also a major oil exporter, and wealthier.
	   A typical joke told by both sides in the Swedish-Norwegian war?
	   Why does it take two Swedes (or Norwegians) to wash a car? One
to hold the sponge and the other to drive the car back and forth.

South Korea's Shin, Taiwan's Huang share lead in Japan Women's Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NISHIKAMOGUN, Japan (AP) _ South Korea's Shin Sora shot a
1-under-par 71 on Friday to grab a share of the lead with Taiwan's
Huang Yu-chen after the second round of the 70 million yen (dlrs
496,000) Japan Women's Open Golf Championship.
	   Shin sank two birdies against one bogey over the 6,320-yard,
par-72 Miyoshi Country Club west course. The 25-year-old South
Korean, who hasn't won a JLPGA title in two years, moved to a
2-under 142 total after 36 holes.
	   Overnight co-leader Huang, fresh from her first victory in Japan
last week in the Dunlop Ladies Open, held on to a share of the lead
despite suffering two bogeys without sinking a birdie.
	   New Zealand's Marnie McGuire vaulted ahead in the standings with
the day's best round of 3-under 69. McGuire moved into a three-way
tie for third at 1-under 143 with veteran Michiko Okada and
overnight co-leader Natsuko Noro.
	   A total of 61 players who scored 8-over 152 or better advanced
to the final two rounds of the 72-hole event.
	   The winner will receive 14 million yen (dlrs 99,000).

Nefteyugansk mayor killed amid allegations of contract killing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen killed the mayor of a major oil-producing
city in central Russia on Friday, and his wife said she was certain
it was a contract killing, news agencies reported.
	   Nefteyugansk Mayor Vladimir Petukhov died in a hospital after
sustaining point-blank gunshot wounds to the head and chest. His
bodyguard was in critical condition, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Police later detained two men matching descriptions given by the
bodyguard.
	   Nefteyugansk, a city 2,000 kilometers (1,400 miles) east of
Moscow, is a rich oil-producing city in the Tyumen region.
	   Most of its residents work for Yuganskneftegas, a subsidiary of
Yukos, Russia's largest oil company.
	   Petukhov recently led rallies of oil workers demanding months of
back wages from the oil company. In late May, he and a number of
picketers blocked Yuganskneftegas leaders inside the company
building for 12 hours when they convened for a shareholders
meeting.
	   Petukhov's wife said she was confident the killing was ordered,
though she did not say by whom, Interfax reported.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom and a tumultuous welcome from thousands
of people in southern Lebanon Friday.
	   The release completed a swap between Israel and Lebanon. On
Thursday, Lebanon exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier for
the bodies of 40 guerrillas.
	   Lebanese soldiers distributed refreshments to the freed men as
their convoy inched past the border toward thousands of relatives
and well wishers.
	   Prisoners smiled and waved to the crowd. Some people broke into
tears and showered rice on the buses in a traditional Arab welcome.
	   Soldiers tried to keep order as activists swarmed around the
buses and on their roofs, shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is
Great.''
	   The three buses and an ambulance bearing signs of the
International Committee of the Red Cross arrived at a Lebanese army
checkpoint at Kfar Falous on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone
in southern Lebanon at 1:00 p.m. (1000GMT).
	   Among the prisoners released was Hussein Mikdad, who was
crippled when a bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel
room two years ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to
blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   His wife and mother rushed to join him in a special Red Cross
ambulance.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel handed 60 Lebanese prisoners over to the
Red Cross in the second stage of a deal between Lebanon and Israel.
	   Four chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone and one
decided to stay in Israel, ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard said.
	   ``It's their choice,'' Fresard said at the crossing.
	   Some of the prisoners have been held for as long as 13 years and
most were held without trial on suspicion of aiding guerrillas
fighting Israeli forces.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese prisoners released by
Israel crossed to freedom and a tumultuous welcome from thousands
in southern Lebanon Friday.
	   The release completed a swap launched Thursday, when Lebanon
exchanged the remains of an Israeli soldier for the bodies of 40
guerrillas.
	   The rare exchange prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to urge Lebanon to negotiate an agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
	   ``I very much hope that the Lebanese ... will move forward with
the initiative in order to change the situation in Lebanon,''
Mordechai said, adding that he hoped the Syrians would give their
blessings to such negotiations.
	   Lebanon has informed Israel that it will not conduct any
negotiations until Israel has reached agreement with the
Palestinians on the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal, the
Haaretz daily quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
	   At the Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous on the edge of
the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, government troops
distributed refreshments to the freed men.
	   A convoy of three buses and an ambulance bearing signs of the
International Committee of the Red Cross inched past the border
toward thousands of relatives and well wishers.
	   Prisoners smiled and waved to the crowd. Some people broke into
tears and showered rice on the buses in a traditional Arab welcome.
	   Soldiers tried to keep order as activists swarmed around the
buses and on their roofs, shouting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is

bomb exploded prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel room two years
ago. Israeli reports said he had been planning to blow up an
Israeli airliner.
	   His wife and mother rushed to join him in the ambulance.
	   Ten of the prisoners had been held in Israeli jails and 50 were
held in the Khiam detention camp in the occupied zone in southern
Lebanon. Lebanese officials said 167 prisoners remain in Khiam or
in Israel.
	   Four prisoners chose to stay in their homes in the occupied zone
and one decided to stay in Israel, ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques
Fresard said.
	   Some of the prisoners have been held for as long as 13 years and

World Cup: Favored teams avoid each other in chase for quarterfinal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Argentina winning Group H
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup quarterfinals beckon and the fancied
teams are all avoiding each other.
	   Brazil and Italy both won their groups to make sure there won't
be a repeat of the 1994 final in the second round. Now they won't
meet again unless they both make it the final once more.
	   If the Brazilians beat South American rival Chile at the Parc
des Princes in round two on Saturday they will face the winner of
Sunday's game at Saint-Denis between Olympic champion Nigeria, the
only one of five African nations to make it to the last 16, and
1992 European titlist Denmark.
	   A Brazil-Nigeria quarterfinal would bring together two teams
with hugely talented attacks but suspect defenses.
	   Brazil has quality players like Ronaldo, Bebeto, Denilson up
front with Leonardo, Rivaldo, Cafu and Roberto Carlos attacking
from deep. The Nigerians, who downed a very strong Brazilian team
in the Olympic semifinal two years ago, have Nwankwo Kanu, Victor
Ikpeba, Augustine ``Jay Jay'' Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Tijana
Babangida and Rasheed Yekini among their attacking lineup.
	   Provided the Italians down Norway at Marseille Saturday, Cesare
Maldini's improving team goes to Saint-Denis in the quarterfinal to
meet either host France or Paraguay, who meet Sunday at Lens.
	   An Italy-France quarterfinal looks most likely from those
matchups and that would mean the freescoring French welcoming back
star forward Zinedine Zidane from a two-match suspension against
some of his Juventus colleagues, including fit-again Alessandro Del
Piero.
	   In the other half of the second round draw, Germany topped Group
F to meet Mexico for a place in the last eight and second place
Yugoslavia must face the Netherlands in a matchup of two teams who
have a lot of talent but lack consistency.
	   Banned from the last World Cup as well as two European
Championships because of the nation's involvement in the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, the Yugoslavs made the quarterfinal on their
last appearance in 1990 before going out to the eventual losing
finalist Argentina in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie.
	   Germany, a three-time winner and European champion which still
has many of the players who won the title eight years ago, should
have too much experience for the Mexicans, who only made the last
16 Thursday thanks to a goal in the final seconds of injury time in
a 2-2 tie with the Dutch.
	   The last two second round matchups were finalised Friday.
	   Argentina edged Croatia 1-0 in Bordeaux to finish top of Group H
and will meet the runner up in Group G while the Croatians will
face the Group G winner, which was decided later Friday.
	   Romania has already made it to the second round but didn't know
whether it would go into the last 16 as Group G winner.
	   The Romanians, with a three-point advantage, looked favorites to
finish top and faced already eliminated Tunisia at Saint-Denis
Friday while England and Colombia, both with three points, met at
Lens to fight over the other second round place.
	   If the standings positions remained the same, Argentina would
meet England in round two, thus avoiding Germany in the
quarterfinal, but facing the winner of Netherlands-Yugoslavia.
	   Romania would meet debutant Croatia to set up a likely
quarterfinal against the Germans.

Macedonian officials report border incidents 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonian officials Friday accused
neighboring Yugoslavia of violating its air space and reported five
border incidents involving arms smuggling for ethnic Albanian
fighters in the volatile Kosovo province.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Petar Atanasov said Yugoslav army
jets violated Macedonia's air space twice, on June 19 and again
Tuesday, only days after NATO jets flew in Macedonia in a warning
to Yugoslavia to end the fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``The Ministry of Defense considers this a grave violation of
Macedonia's air space,'' Atanasov said. Macedonia has filed a
protest with the Yugoslav authorities.
	   Atanasov also reported five incidents on the border with Albania
in which armed Albanians tried to smuggle in weapons and opened
fire on Macedonian border guards. No one was injured.
	   ``The Macedonian army is trying to prevent attempts to use
Macedonian territory for smuggling arms whose final destination
probably doesn't even have to be mentioned,'' he said, apparently
referring to widespread arms smuggling from Albania to ethnic
Albanians fighting for secession from Yugoslavia.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo clashes this year.
There are fears that the conflict could spread to Macedonia, which
has its own restive ethnic Albanian minority.
	   International efforts to bring about a negotiated solution to
the crisis have so far failed, increasing the possibility of NATO
intervention to end the fighting that officials fear could engulf
the whole region.

Religious, civic leaders call for talks to end northern rebellion Museveni; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with quotes from President Yoweri
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GULU, Uganda (AP) _ Fed up with the government's inability to
crush an 12-year rebellion in northern Uganda, religious and civic
leaders on Friday called for negotiations to end the violence and
rebel abductions of the region's children.
	   ``We should sit down and see what we can do, because we have
waited for government to solve the problem, but it is still in
vain. Now we have to write the president to talk peace with the
rebels,'' Roman Catholic priest Remigion Christopher Obol told a
packed conference hall in this northern Ugandan town.
	   But President Yoweri Museveni once again ruled out talks with
those he called bandits without a political agenda and said the
army will solve the problem once it is reorganized.
	   Rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army have abducted hundreds of
people in the past 10 days, apparently to beef up their forces
after some 500 child soldiers escaped to the government side,
officials said.
	   In a separate interview with The Associated Press in the Ugandan
capital, Kampala, Museveni blamed disorganization within the army
for the failure to end the rebellion.
	   ``The question is how the army will solve its reorganization
problems and finish with the bandits,'' he said, adding that he
feared negotiations would offer the rebels ``an escape route when
they are facing extermination by the army.''
	   Several hundred people are attending the three-day conference in
Gulu, 360 kilometers (223 miles) north of Kampala.
	   ``Religious leaders have decided to sit down and discuss the
war, which has lasted for 12 years and why it has not ended,''
Anglican archbishop Onene Onwene told the forum.
	   Museveni, himself a former rebel leader who took power in 1986,
said the LRA was made up of remnants of previous armed groups loyal
to former dictators Milton Obote and Idi Amin and backed by the
hostile government in Sudan.
	   More than 300,000 people have been forced by the rebels to flee
their homes in the northern districts of Gulu, Kitgum and Lira
inhabited mainly by members of the Acholi tribe.
	   In contrast to the first 25 years of Uganda's independence from
Britain when government leaders were mostly Acholi or from other
northern tribes, Museveni and most members of his government are
from the south. People in the north feel they are marginalized.
	   Many of the displaced people have been herded into camps where
the army is supposed to protect them, but the LRA attacks with near
impunity.
	   Anglican minister Ben Ocan told The Associated Press his
daughter was abducted Wednesday from Gulu Primary School just
outside town.
	   ``The rebels have a stronger intelligence network than that of
the government,'' he said. ``I am praying that my daughter comes
back.
	   The rebels, who by some accounts have abducted as many as 10,000
children and young people, force them to take up arms or serve as
bearers or sex slaves.
	   Although the LRA has no clearly articulated political agenda, it
does play on Northerners' belief that the government is neglecting
them and that they are missing out on Uganda's new-found
prosperity.
	   ``It is like we are in an ocean which is not stable,'' said Gulu
resident Andrew Adimola, a member of the opposition Democratic
Party. ``Gulu appears surrounded, and the government must talk
peace with the rebels. I myself have offered to go right to where
(rebel leader Joseph) Kony is in Sudan and talk with him.''
	   Gulu District Commissioner Peter Odek Wo'Cheng told The
Associated Press a military solution is the only realistic one.
	   ``The government is defending the people by use of arms. People
accuse the government for nothing. You cannot defend people without
the use of guns,'' he said.
	   But Museveni himself has said his 40,000-strong Uganda People's
Defense Force _ his former rebel army _ suffers from indiscipline,
drunkeness and laziness.
	   ``We are in a dilemma,'' said resident Ferdinand Ochola. ``Last
week alone, the rebels have staged six attacks around the town. We
hope government becomes more serious.''

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The former chief of police in Poland, who
resigned in January after only a year in office, has been found
shot to death outside his apartment, police said Friday.
	   The body of Marek Papala, 39, was found in his car, parked near
his Warsaw apartment, said Slawomir Cisowski, spokesman at the
general police headquarters. He had been shot in the head late
Thursday.
	   Cisowski refused to comment on a possible motive, but said a
special investigating team has been appointed and a 15,000 zloty
(dlrs 4,400) reward posted for information about the crime.
	   Police refused further details, but one of the policeman's
neighbors told private Radio Zet that Papala was found by his wife.
	   The neighbor, who was not identified, said he did not hear any
shots, but he was alarmed by a woman's cry and looked out of the
window to see what was happening.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek promised that the government will
make every effort to find those responsible for the shooting, which
he called ``very depressing.''
	   Leszek Miller, a former interior minister who had worked with
Papala, suggested the shooting may have been vengeance by a
criminal gang dealing in drugs, stolen cars or counterfeit money.
Papala had led police actions against such gangs.
	   The Warsaw Provincial Prosecutor's Office ordered an
investigation to be carried out by a unit dealing with organized
crime, office spokesman Ryszard Kucinski said.
	   Papala had served as Poland's police chief from January 1997
until Jan. 29. Although he resigned without giving any reasons,
Papala had been faulted for inadequate security during sports
events and a lack of success in combating organized crime, which
has burgeoned since Poland launched democratic reforms in 1989.
	   Post-communist Poland has seen a rapid increase in organized
crime building easy fortunes on car thefts, alcohol smuggling,
currency exchange and drug trafficking.
	   Over the last two years, police arrested dozens of mobsters and
three gangs are currently on trial charged with numerous counts of
car theft, extortion, arson and illegal possession of arms.
	   Commenting on Papala's death, leftist deputy Jerzy Dziewulski, a
retired policeman, said Friday that it was an execution by the
mafia trying to terrorize police officials.
	   This is a signal for police and society that the police
crackdown against criminals can can bring such effects, he said.

Defiant Mugabe says he won't back down on land seizures 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe vowed Friday he
will not back down on the seizure of white-owned farms despite
international pressure to modify a controversial land reform
program.
	   Mugabe told ruling party officials the invasion over the past 10
days of four white farms by hundreds of landless black peasants
strengthened the government's determination to hasten the
confiscation of white land.
	   Blacks fought for land in the bush war that led to independence
from British rule in 1980 and would not be deterred by diplomatic
pressure, Mugabe told the central committee of his ruling party.
	   ``What are we afraid of? Do we fear the British, the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, and not our own
people?'' he said.
	   Last November, the government released a list of about 1,500
mostly white owned farms targeted for seizure, but more than 600
owners were later told their properties had been struck from the
list.
	   Britain, donors and Western financial institutions have demanded
full compensation for farm owners and insist farm production and
investor confidence is not harmed by hasty, poorly-planned
takeovers.
	   Mugabe said on Friday he rejected the ``delisting'' of the 600
productive white farms and those properties would be referred back
to the provincial land committees who drew up the original
controversial schedules of land intended for confiscation.
	   ``Let us not continue to lag behind the people's expectations
lest we invite anarchy into a process which so far has been going
smoothly and systematically,'' he said.
	   For the past 10 days squatters vowing allegiance to Mugabe and
the ruling party have occupied farms in the Marondera area, 80
kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Harare, vowing not to move until
given written title to former white land.
	   Mugabe on Thursday broke prolonged silence on the standoff,
saying force would not be used to evict the squatters.
	   Mugabe maintains no compensation should be paid to the
descendants of British settlers for land seized without payment by
the settlers during the colonial era.
	   About 4,000 white farmers own about of third of Zimbabwe's land.
	   Since 1980, some 70,000 black families have been resettled on
former white-owned farms, but the program has been plagued by
delays, mismanagement and corruption, with some properties going to
politicians and their cronies.

World Cup: Argentina beats Croatia 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes coaches, player
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Argentina kept a perfect World Cup
record Friday, beating Croatia 1-0 to win Group H and its stifling
defense remained the only one not to concede a single goal in the
first round.
	   On top of that, a defender made the difference up front too.
	   In the 36th minute, a deep pass from Daniel Ortega was deflected
into the path of defender Hector Pineda on the left, and with the
Croatian defense all over the place, Pineda took his time to put
the ball past Drazen Ladic.
	   ``This was a well-deserved victory against the toughest team in
the group,'' said Argentina's coach Daniel Passarella.
	   The best chance in the lackluster Croatian performance came in
the 63rd minute when substitute Goran Vlaovic unleashed a 27-meter
drive that crashed onto the post, with Carlos Roa well beaten.
	   ``They deserved victory and Argentina confirmed their big
ambitions,'' said Croatia's coach Miroslav Blazevic. ``But we come
out of this with our heads held high and hope we will have more
luck next time.''
	   For most of the match it was Argentina that provided the action.
	   On the stroke of half time Marcelo Gallardo almost added a
second, when he hit a freekick into the wall and was allowed to
line up the rebound from 12 meters, forcing a great save from
Ladic.
	   In the 71st minute, defender Roberto Ayala, who had a great
game, slalomed through the Croatian defense and his curling
right-foot shot just went the wrong side of the post.
	   Gabriel Batistuta, the co-top scorer in the competition with
four goals had a mediocre game, easily held in control by the
Croatian defense.
	   At the other end, Croatia's Davor Suker was limited to a
long-range header, but little else.
	   Argentina's rock-solid defense did its work again.
	   ``It was difficult because the Argentinians knew our play well,
they made sure to close off all open spaces up front,'' said
Croatia's midfielder Robert Jarni.
	   The Argentines were quicker of the ball and it showed after the
goal, with Croatia being forced to commit several fouls to keep the
South Americans at bay.
	   In the 21st minute, Croatian defender Slaven Bilic was given a
yellow card for pulling down Batistuta close to the penalty area.
	   Two minutes later, Ortega committed a similar foul in the
midfield area on his marker Dario Simic and Moroccan referee Said
Belqula showed him yellow for shoving.
	   Argentina's Ayala then got a yellow card for a late tackle on
Aljosa Asanovic in the 35th minute.
	   And in the 44th minute, Zvonimir Soldo got one for a body check
on Ortega and it will suspend him for the second-round game. It
almost led to the second goal, when Gallardo took the freekick.
	   Immediately after halftime, captain Zvonimir Boban got another
yellow for a late tackle on midfielder Juan Veron. And in the 59th
minute, Jarni got yet another for protesting a referee's decision.
	   Both teams were already assured a place in the second round so
the battle centered on who would take first place in Group H.
	   Croatia was boosted by the return of Boban, who sat out the
Japan game with a pulled leg muscle. Veteran defender Igor Stimac,
suffering from blistered feet, was the only regular starter missing
but came on as a substitute.
	   After routing Jamaica 5-0 and defeating Japan 1-0, the South
Americans only needed a draw to finish atop the group and set up a
second-round game with the Group G runner-up _ most likely England
or Colombia.
	   Croatia, which beat Jamaica only 3-1, can expect to face Romania
unless it wins on Friday.
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella replaced AC Parma's Roberto
Sensini, who has a pulled leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. He also
rested Jose Chamot, who was facing the threat of suspension because
he already received a yellow card in an earlier game.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Pablo Paz, Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala,
Javier Zanetti (68, Diegi Simeone), Hector Pineda; Juan Veron,
Marcelo Gallardo (81, Sergio Berti), Matias Almeyda; Ariel Ortega
(53, Claudio Lopez), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Dario
Simic, Slaven Bilic, Silvio Maric (46, Goran Vlaovic), Aljosa
Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban, Robert Prosinecki (68, Igor Stimac);
Mario Stanic, Davor Suker.
	   Referee : Said Belqola, Morocca.

	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Albino koala hits the limelight
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Ghost Boy, a rare albino koala, made his debut
at the San Diego Zoo to oohs and aahs from adoring animal lovers.
	   The only known albino koala in captivity, the tiny marsupial
clung to his mother's back in his first public display Friday,
showing off snow-white fur, a cute pink nose and matching eyes as
it munched eucalyptus leaves.
	   The koala _ named Onya-Birri in Aborigine because of his unusual
lack of pigment _ was born in September, roughly the size of a
jelly bean. Now about 2 pounds (1 kilo), he will reach 18 pounds (8
kilos) when full-grown.
	   Ghost Boy spent his first six months of life tucked safely
inside his mother's pouch. When he first poked his nose out in
March, zookeepers couldn't believe their eyes.
	   ``There were three of us, and no one would believe it on their
own, so we'd go and get the other one just to make sure,'' said
keeper Chris Hamlin.
	   Visitors to the zoo _ young and old _ gushed as Ghost Boy
crawled atop his mother's head, using her ears as steps. As the
mother, named Banjeeri, navigated a branch, the crowd gasped as one
when Ghost Boy slipped briefly from her neck before latching onto
her stomach.
	   Two-year-old Abigail Shrader loved the show.
	   ``He was holding onto mommy!'' she exclaimed.
	   ``That's exactly the way she sleeps on top of my wife, so I
think she appreciates that,'' said the girl's father, Tom Shrader.
	   Albinism, or a lack of pigmentation, can be present in genes but
not show up for generations, Hamlin said. Ghost Boy's mother has
had other offspring _ a koala baby is called a joey _ but all had
normal light gray fur.
	   The animals native to Australia are known worldwide as the cute,
fuzzy symbol of the country.
	   Ghost Boy will spend his life at the zoo. Koalas usually stay
with their mothers until they are about a year old, becoming
solitary animals when full-grown.
	   He will eventually be allowed in some of the outdoor enclosures,
but only on overcast days. He's perfectly healthy, keepers said,
but because he has no pigment his eyes are extremely sensitive to
light and his skin could burn easily.
	   ``We'll just have to keep him inside on sunny Southern
California days,'' Hamlin said.
	   ___ &QC;

	   8. Why do you think that visitors of all ages enjoyed watching
the koala baby and his mother?
	   9. The cute, fuzzy creature is known worldwide as a symbol of
what country?
	   10. If you had been asked to name the tiny marsupial, what would
you have called him? Why?
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Answer Key: (Wording will vary)
	   1. In the article, the word pigment refers to coloring.
	   2. The rare animal can be seen at the San Diego Zoo in
California.

	   4. Onya-Birri was born in September 1998. At birth, he was the
size of a jelly bean.
	   5. At first, the keepers didn't know that the koala was albino
because he stayed inside his mother's pouch.
	   6. The albino koala must be protected from bright light because
it can damage his sensitive eyes and skin.
	   7. Ghost Boy will spend his entire life at the zoo.
	   8. Answers will vary.
	   9. The koala is a symbol of Australia, its native country.
	   10. Answers will vary.

Yeltsin, Kuchma meeting called off 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A planned meeting in the Crimea between Presidents
Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine has been
called off, Yeltsin's spokesman said Friday.
	   The two presidents were supposed to hold informal talks in June,
but Yeltsin asked that they meet in July instead. Now the talks on
Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have been canceled, spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   No reason was given, and no new date was set.
	   Outstanding issues between the two neighbors include the
division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and the status of
Crimea, which is populated mostly by ethnic Russians.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. and the
debt-plagued Long-Term Credit Bank announced Friday that they were
working on a merger that would create Japan's second-largest bank.
	   The banks said that the agreement would help them compete in an
age of increased foreign competition as Japan introduces its
much-vaunted ``big bang'' deregulation measures.
	   ``We made this decision aiming to become a global player and a
more powerful bank,'' Sumitomo Trust President Atsushi Takahashi
told reporters in Tokyo.
	   Though bank officials referred to the deal as a merger, the
scant details of the plan released Friday indicated Sumitomo would
buy out LTCB's sound loans and leave the problem debts to be
handled by the government.
	   Analysts saw the move more as a litmus test of Japan's ability
to stabilize its financial system than as an example of
entrepreneurial savvy.
	   For the past two weeks, LTCB has been rumored to be on the verge
of collapse. It is saddled with more than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in bad loans and its share prices have become virtually
worthless overnight.
	   ``The Finance Ministry has to act to prevent a crisis of
confidence and we are in somewhat of a crisis of confidence now,''
said James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings.
	   The deal is seen as an opportunity for Japan to prove that it is
serious about its recent pledge to clean up 76 trillion yen (dlrs
550 billion) in bad debt from bank balance sheets.
	   The soured loans have been blamed as a major cause for Japan's
deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Sumitomo's Takahashi said that his bank would take over only
LTCB's performing loans and would wash its hands of the bank's bad
loans.
	   ``I don't know who's going to take them, but we certainly
won't,'' Takahashi said. He gave no deadline for the deal, but said
the banks aimed for a merger within one year.
	   Japan's government has been scrambling to set up a ``bridge
bank'' to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out in the
cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them more money.
	   ``We have to work towards making a strong and more competitive
bank,'' LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told reporters Friday night.
	   NLTCB ews reports earlier Friday said the merger would take
place in April next year, and the ``bridge bank'' would take over
much of LTCB's bad debt.
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports of the merger
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank. Japan's
trust banks specialize in managing funds for large institutional
investors.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution was foundering.
	   The reports sparked late rallies on Tokyo financial markets. The
yen _ weakened recently by concerns over Japan's economic doldrums
_ rose to 141.94 yen to the dollar from an intraday low of 143.00
yen.

Graf ousted by Zvereva
Eds: Updates with Zvereva quotes, Davenport, Rafter, Ivanisevic
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf's bid for an eighth
Wimbledon title ended Friday with a stunning defeat to a player she
had beaten 17 straight times.
	   Natasha Zvereva, a doubles specialist from Belarus who had won
only three sets against Graf in all their previous meetings, beat
the fourth-seeed German 6-4, 7-5 in a third-round match.
	   Graf, making her 13th appearance at Wimbledon, was non-committal
Friday about whether she would be back next year.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' she said. ``I definitely
couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play again. Hopefully,
I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy myself. But I've
learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   Graf was competing in only her fifth tournament of the year due
to knee and hamstring injuries.
	   Her lack of match play showed as she struggled from the outset
in the rain-delayed Centre Court match.
	   Graf double faulted six times, had trouble returning serve and
was kept off balance by Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   ``Every time I go on the court I start playing nervously in the
beginning. Clearly it's a lack of matches. Every time it was
important I didn't play the points well at all.''
	   Zvereva did almost everything right.
	   ``It's by far the best match of my life,'' she said. ``I was
mentally tough on every point. I dont think that's ever happned
before. I can drift in and drift out of matches easily. This time I
stayed with it.''
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   There has been speculation that this would be Graf's last
Wimbledon. The 29-year-old revealed this week that she considered
retirement two months ago after continued problems with injuries.
	   Graf broke down in tears at a news conference Monday, saying she
was overcome just to be back at Wimbledon again.
	   She showed little emotion Wednesday, offering a quick wave with
her left hand as she walked off Centre Court.
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
one-sided in tennis. Their first match was the most memorable, when
Graf humiliated Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in just over 30 minutes in the
1988 French Open final.
	   Recalling that match Friday, Zvereva said, ``I was so nervous
you couldn't even describe it.'' She said she was so embarrassed
after the wipeout that she crawled on her knees into her locker
room cubicle.
	   Shattered by the 1988 defeat, Zvereva never has reached a Grand
Slam singles final since then, although she has excelled in
doubles.
	   But Friday, Zvereva thoroughly outplayed Graf.
	   She broke serve in the first game, saved the only break point of
the set against her in the next game and never let Graf get into a
groove.
	   The two stayed on serve in the second set until the 11th game
when Zvereva got the decisive break for a 6-5 lead.
	   With Zvereva serving for the match, Graf failed to convert two
break points at 15-40 and the match ended with a backhand return
into the net.
	   Zvereva said Graf congratulated her with the words ``By the way,
very nice match.''
	   ``Coming from her right away from the match, it was very
important,'' she said. ``Plus she looked into my eyes which is even
better. That meant a lot to me.''
	   Showers delayed the start of Friday's play by 3 hours, 50
minutes, and there was the threat of more rain later in the
afternoon and in the next few days.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1; while No.
14 Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0
third-round win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion Pete Sampras faced a potentially tricky
third-round match against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.
	   Venus Williams, meanwhile, is gearing up for a Wimbledon
showdown against the ``juggernaut'' _ her best friend and kid
sister, Serena.
	   The Williams sisters beat their second-round opponents in
straight sets Thursday _ each conceding only three games _ and are
on course for a high-powered meeting in the fourth round.
	   Venus downed Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2, a victory that featured
the fastest serve ever recorded in women's tennis. Serena defeated
fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Venus watched the first set of her sister's match on Centre
Court, then walked over to Court 1 to play her own.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' she said. ``I guess you
have to become the nemesis.''
	   Venus, who turned 18 last week and is the No. 6 seed, is playing
in her second Wimbledon, while the unseeded Serena is appearing in
her first.
	   When the draw was made, it appeared unlikely the sisters would
meet because Serena had Anna Kournikova looming as a second-round
opponent. But Kournikova withdrew because of a thumb injury,
clearing the path for an all-Williams match.
	   There are only two remaining hurdles. Serena next plays Virginia
Ruano-Pascual, while Venus faces Chanda Rubin or Tara Snyder.
	   The sisters have met twice in tournament play, at this year's
Australian Open and Italian Open. Venus won both times.
	   The men's field has been decimated, with half of the 16 seeds
eliminated in the first two rounds.
	   The latest to go were Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13
seed, and French Open champion Carlos Moya, No. 5.
	   Previous losers were No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski,
No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Cedric Pioline, No. 10 Alex
Corretja and No. 15 Karol Kucera.

Russia confident of agreement on new IMF loan of IMF loan agreement, government firmly opposed to ruble devaluation, changes byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with market close, Chubais confident
By JOHN IAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is confident it will obtain a new
International Monetary Fund loan and that negotiations can be
wrapped up in a month, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said
Friday.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion from
international lenders to shore up its struggling economy and
restore confidence in the stock market.
	   The release Thursday of a delayed installment of an existing
dlrs 9 billion IMF loan failed to boost the jittery market, which
closed 4.97 percent lower.
	   Heavy selling on the treasury market prompted the Central Bank
to raise key interest rates to 80 percent from 60 percent.
	   Chubais said he was not troubled by the market drop and was
confident that talks with IMF officials, expected to arrive in
Moscow on Saturday, would produce an agreement.
	   ``Such fluctuations are inevitable, and one should not think
that once talks with the IMF get under way, all indicators will
start to rise,'' Chubais said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``We need an end result, and when it is achieved, it will bring
stability to the market,'' he said.
	   Chubais said he was confident that international aid would
arrive in time to prevent serious market turmoil.
	   ``There is no super-difficult problem with the IMF,'' Chubais
said. ``That is why we will try to speed up the process, not in two
months as was announced before, but in one month.''
	   Chubais said Russia was hoping for help from institutions other
than the IMF, including the World Bank, other countries and private
banks. The bulk of the money, he said, was needed to boost the
Central Bank's reserves, not for government spending.
	   The IMF held up the dlrs 670 loan installment, saying Russia had
to do more to balance the budget and reform key areas of the
economy, especially the ineffective tax collection system.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan
to parliament earlier this week that officials said appeared to
meet many of the fund's criteria, but markets failed to bounce back
when the Duma delayed debate on the plan.
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy speaker of parliament, said the
legislature may put off its summer recess to debate the plan and
vote on the necessary legislation, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. The summer recess was scheduled to begin July 3.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, with investors worried about falling oil
prices, labor unrest, and spill-over effects from the Asian
financial crisis.
	   Chubais said the Russian government remains firmly opposed to a
devaluation of the ruble, which closed slightly higher against the
dollar Friday with support from the Central Bank.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.

Turkish court sentences three leftist terrorists to death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish court sentenced three leftist
terrorists to death on Friday for killing 12 people in the early
1990s in a campaign to ovethrow the government.
	   A retired army general, a prosecutor and several police officers
were among the victims of the three, members of the now defunct
leftist extremist group Dev Sol, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Despite issuing death penalties, Turkey has not carried out
executions since 1984.
	   Dev Sol, which claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist

Edwards back at London Broncos 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British rugby league's most prolific try scorer
concluded one of the most turbulent weeks of his career Friday by
re-signing with the London Broncos.
	   Shaun Edwards was a star at Wigan for 13 seasons. He was also
one of Broncos best players in his six-month stint in London before
he joined reigning Super League Champions Bradford last October.
	   But the former Britain scrum-half, who has 36 test caps and 287
tries to his credit, was put on the transfer list Tuesday by
Bradford after only eight months of a two-year contract.
	   Edwards said his departure from Bradford was mutual and conceded
he had not been able to play his own style of game with the Bulls.
	   The 31-year-old was snapped up by Broncos, the team he left on
good terms because he wanted to return to the north of England, in
a three-year deal.
	   A sternum injury will keep him out of Broncos match against
Halifax Saturday but he is expected to return at the Stoop in
London colors next week against Hull.
	   London has slumped to 10th place in Super League after just four
wins in the first half of the season and is in search of an upturn
in fortunes.
	   London chief executive Tony Rea said Edwards had been a catalyst
for many of the Broncos wins last year.
	   ``He really misses the place and I think he realises that what
he had with us was very good and important to him,'' Rae said.
	   The length of Edwards' new contract will ensure that he ends his
career in London and the Broncos hope to eventually bring him onto
the club's coaching staff.

Eds: UPDATES with Argentina-Croatia and Japan-Jamaica, 15th-16th
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nineteen minutes changed the fortunes of three
World Cup teams. All the time in the world couldn't help the
hapless, dissension-riddled squad from the United States.
	   Mexico and the Netherlands advanced to the second round, and
Belgium was knocked out of the tournament, on the strength of three
second-half goals Thursday _ two by the Mexicans, one by South
Korea.
	   Germany beat Iran 2-0, dominating a game the Iranians hoped
would produce an upset and a second-round spot.
	   And for the United States, one game seemed just like the last in
its utter flop of a World Cup. The Americans hit another goalpost
with a shot, lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia and did more finger-pointing.
	   ``I don't think we got the best out of the talent we had here,''
Tab Ramos said. ``From the beginning, this whole World Cup has been
a mess. I blame the coaches for the losses. I have no problem
saying that.''
	   On Friday, as the team left France, coach Steve Sampson
announced ``significant fines'' against American players who
criticized the U.S. Soccer Federation ``as a way of directing a
message to younger players that this is not professional
behavior.''
	   Mexico had no such problems after its second straight comeback
victory.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Luis
Hernandez, whose goal in the fifth minute of injury time produced a
2-2 draw with the Netherlands. ``It was a fantastic game for us, a
triumph for Mexico and the Mexican people.''
	   Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 75th minute, starting Mexico's
rally.
	   Tied with the Dutch in points entering the match, and ahead of
Belgium by two points, Mexico supposedly had the toughest task of
reaching the second round. Belgium, after all, played against South
Korea, winless in five World Cups.
	   With the Netherlands leading 2-0 in Saint-Etienne, and the
Belgians up 1-0 in Paris, that forecast seemed right.
	   But Yoo Sang-chul tied it for South Korea in the 71st minute for
a 1-1 tie. And the two late-developing draws meant Mexico will get
Germany on Monday in Montpellier, while the Netherlands will face
off against Yugoslavia in Toulouse.
	   Belgium goes home.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' Mexican coach Manuel
Lapuente said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big
heart and they displayed that all over the field.''
	   The second-round pairings were to be completed Friday when
Romania faced Tunisia and England took on Colombia in Group G.
Earlier Friday, Argentina won Group H by beating Croatia 1-0; both
teams already were in the second round.
	   Jamaica registered its first World Cup victory, beating Japan
2-1.
	   The England-Columbia match in Lens drew added attention because
of the violent reputation of English fans. Some 100 people, most of
them supporters from England, were arrested overnight in northern
France and across the border in Belgium, and Lens braced for
trouble.
	   In Montpellier, Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored
early in the second half and Germany ended Iranian hopes.
	   ``We tried hard in the first half, but it didn't work,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow
score.''
	   At Nantes, the Yugoslavs scored less than four minutes after
kickoff, then struggled to hold off the Americans.
	   The U.S. team, which lost all three games by a combined 5-1
scored and was humiliated in a 2-1 loss to Iran, hit the post after
only 24 seconds. The Americans came away frustrated when Slobodan
Komljenovic headed in a rebound off a free kick.
	   ``We wanted to win and end the qualifications with a victory,
and that was our only aim,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``The game was not flamboyant, I know, but that is how you play
good matches.''
	   Sampson was stung by the criticism of his coaching.
	   ``You select 22 players, you give players the opportunity to
participate in a World Cup or at least be selected and enjoy the
World Cup,'' he said. ``You stick by your players, even during hard
times, and you hope they appreciate that. That's all you can do as
a coach. Some have done a great job of showing that appreciation.
Some have not.''
	   In the midst of a tournament filled with officiating
controversies, FIFA defended its referees.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' said David Will, a Scottish lawyer who has run FIFA's
referee office for eight years. ``The overall standard remains high
_ higher than in the United States, to be sure.''
	   It did little to appease the African Football Confederation,
which accused FIFA of a conspiracy against African nations. Only
one of five African teams advanced past the first round.

Sumitomo Trust working on merger with troubled Long-Term Credit Bank

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. and the
debt-plagued Long-Term Credit Bank announced Friday that they were
working on a merger that would create Japan's second-largest bank.
	   The banks said that the agreement would help them compete in an
age of increased foreign competition as Japan introduces its
much-vaunted ``big bang'' deregulation measures.
	   ``We made this decision aiming to become a global player and a
more powerful bank,'' Sumitomo Trust President Atsushi Takahashi
told reporters in Tokyo.
	   Though bank officials referred to the deal as a merger, the
scant details of the plan released Friday indicated Sumitomo would
buy out LTCB's sound loans and leave the problem debts to be
handled by the government.
	   Analysts saw the move more as a litmus test of Japan's ability
to stabilize its financial system than as an example of
entrepreneurial savvy.
	   For the past two weeks, LTCB has been rumored to be on the verge
of collapse. It is saddled with more than 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in bad loans and its share prices have become virtually
worthless overnight.
	   ``The Finance Ministry has to act to prevent a crisis of
confidence and we are in somewhat of a crisis of confidence now,''
said James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings.
	   The deal is seen as an opportunity for Japan to prove that it is
serious about its recent pledge to clean up 76 trillion yen (dlrs
550 billion) in bad debt from bank balance sheets.
	   The soured loans have been blamed as a major cause for Japan's
deepest recession in 50 years.
	   Sumitomo's Takahashi said that his bank would take over only
LTCB's performing loans and would wash its hands of the bank's bad
loans.
	   ``I don't know who's going to take them, but we certainly
won't,'' Takahashi said. He gave no deadline for the deal, but said
the banks aimed for a merger within one year.
	   Japan's government has been scrambling to set up a ``bridge
bank'' to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out in the
cold by private banks now unwilling to loan them more money.
	   ``We have to work towards making a strong and more competitive
bank,'' LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told reporters Friday night.
	   News reports earlier Friday said the merger would take place in
April next year, and the ``bridge bank'' would take over much of
LTCB's bad debt.
	   Trading in shares of both Sumitomo Trust and LTCB were suspended
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soon after the reports of the merger
appeared Friday afternoon.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   Sumitomo Trust is Japan's second-largest trust bank. Japan's
trust banks specialize in managing funds for large institutional
investors.
	   Shares in the LTCB plummeted Thursday when executives spelled
out a drastic restructuring plan and hinted at a possible merger _
adding to fears the institution was foundering.
	   The reports sparked late rallies on Tokyo financial markets. The
yen _ weakened recently by concerns over Japan's economic doldrums
_ rose to 141.94 yen to the dollar from an intraday low of 143.00
yen.

Prisoners freed by Israel receive tumultuous welcome quotes, color, ADDS Israeli and Lebanese comment on peace.

	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon gave a tumultuous welcome
Friday to 55 prisoners released by Israel, some of them held for 13
years, in a swap that revived talk of peace between the two foes.
	   Thousands of men and women surged forward to greet them,
showering them with rice and rose water in a traditional Arab
welcome. Others blew kisses and shouted ``God is great.''
	   Some of the prisoners, who were held without trial on suspicion
of aiding guerrillas fighting Israel, broke down in tears as they
crossed over from the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   ``It's great to be free,'' said Abdel Ghareeb Beydoun, who was
18 when Israeli troops detained him in the occupied zone in 1985,
making him the longest-held prisoner released.
	   Asked whether he would fight against Israel, a weary Beydoun
answered: ``I am too tired to talk about it now.''
	   The journey to freedom began earlier in the day when Israel
handed 60 Lebanese prisoners _ 10 held in Israel and 50 detained in
the occupied zone _ over to the International Committee of the Red
Cross. Their release came a day after Lebanon exchanged the remains
of an Israeli soldier for the bodies of 40 guerrillas in a deal
that followed 10 months of tortuous negotiations.
	   Four of those released chose to stay in their homes in the
occupied zone and one decided to remain in Israel, ICRC delegate
Jean-Jacques Fresard said. The name of that man was not released,
nor did Red Cross officials say why he stayed behind.
	   An Israeli government statement said none of the prisoners had
``blood on their hands.''
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri greeted the returnees, a telling
sign of the popularity of the guerrilla campaign against Israel's
occupation. Hariri shook the men's hands and gave them lunch at his
own mansion in the southern city of Sidon.
	   He pledged to win the freedom of the 167 others still in Israeli
captivity. ``The government will do its utmost effort to liberate
all the prisoners and Lebanese soil,'' Hariri said.
	   The prisoners returned home aboard three buses and a Red Cross
ambulance through a Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar Falous, on the
edge of the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Flags from the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah and Amal guerrilla
groups, the Lebanese Communist Party and the national flag hung
from light poles and trees, reflecting the loyalties of those
freed.
	   Hezbollah supporters shouted ``Death to Israel'' and some
communist activists wore T-shirts with portraits of South American
communist revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara.
	   Among those released was Hussein Mikdad, who lost both legs,
suffered hearing loss and was blinded when a bomb exploded
prematurely in his Jerusalem hotel room two years ago. Israeli
reports said he was planning to blow up an Israeli airliner.
	   His wife and mother rushed toward the ambulance carrying him.
	   The swap, the biggest of its kind in two years, prompted Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to urge Lebanon to negotiate an
agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
	   ``I very much hope the Lebanese ... will move forward with the
initiative in order to change the situation in Lebanon,'' he said.
	   He added that he hoped that Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, would give its blessings to such negotiations.
	   Hariri called on Israel to leave Lebanon and the Golan Heights,
which was captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   ``Lebanon and Syria are ready for peace, but if Israel wants to
impose its hegemony over the region, nobody is going to live in
peace,'' Hariri told the crowd at his house.

Croatian budget re-balanced due to new tax surplus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Parliament approved a re-balance of the
national budget Friday, following an unexpected surplus in revenue
generated by a newly introduced tax on goods and services.
	   The lion's share of the extra 6.2 billion kuna (dlrs 984
million) will go towards reducing the envisioned 1998 budget
deficit of 2 billion kuna (dlrs 33 million) and paying state
pensions, employees, and health funds.
	   In January, the government levied a 22 percent value added tax
on all goods and services in an effort to introduce fiscal
discipline and combat a prominent shadow economy.
	   The readjustment of the budget was approved by 68 members of
parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by President Franjo
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Opposition parties, who had most of their amendment proposals
rejected, boycotted the vote.
	   The 1998 planned budget was 36.8 billion kuna (dlrs 6.4
billion).

Security Council condemns fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With reports of renewed clashes between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Security Council demanded Friday that
both sides halt the fighting and endorsed efforts by African
leaders to end the border conflict peacefully.
	   The council unanimously approved a U.S.-drafted resolution which
urged Secretary-General Kofi Annan to ``use his good offices'' as a
possible mediator and offered services of the United Nations to
help define and mark the border if the two sides can reach an
agreement.
	   The resolution commended efforts by the Organization of African
Unity to mediate in the conflict and ``condemns the use of force
and demands that both parties immediately cease hostilities and
refrain from further use of force.''
	   It welcomed an agreement by the Eritreans and Ethiopians to
refrain from airstrikes and called on them to cooperate fully with
OAU mediation.
	   The conflict escalated with a May 6 skirmish over disputed
border territory between the two countries, located in the Horn of
Africa. Ethiopia insists that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas
before peace talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory under new boundaries established when
Eritrea regained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
insurgents overthrow a 17-year military regime in Addis Ababa in
July 1991.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11. On Wednesday,
however, Ethiopia called its troops exchanged artillery fire with
the Eritreans, ending a 12-day lull in fighting.
	   Eritrea denied any new fighting had taken place, but residents
in Adigrat, 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Addis Ababa, said
they heard shelling for several hours in the morning.

Croatian budget re-balanced due to new tax surplus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Parliament approved a re-balance of the
national budget Friday, following an unexpected surplus in revenue
generated by a new tax on goods and services.
	   Most of the extra 6.2 billion kuna (dlrs 984 million) will go
towards reducing the forecast 1998 deficit of 2 billion kuna (dlrs
33 million) and paying state pensions, employees, and health funds.
	   In January, the government levied a 22 percent value-added tax
on all goods and services in an effort to introduce fiscal
discipline and combat a prominent shadow economy.
	   The readjustment of the budget was approved by 68 members of
parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by President Franjo
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Opposition parties, who saw most of their amendment proposals
rejected, boycotted the vote.
	   The 1998 budget is 36.8 billion kuna (dlrs 6.4 billion).

Retiree looks forward to life in the forest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Parting was much too hard after 50 years
working together, so Anarakali the elephant and her keeper, Soney
Lal, will live out their retirement together as well.
	   The cake read ``happy retired life,'' and Anarkali was painted
in bright colors for the retirement party last week, Chief
Conservator of Forests R.L. Singh said Friday. She was was treated
to a meal of sugarcane, bananas and her favorite _ candy.
	   ``Anarkali was well-behaved elephant with a fine temperament,''
Singh said. ``She was particularly fond of chocolates. She was a
favorite with tourists since she used to take them to spots very
near tigers.''
	   The 80-year-old elephant will remain in the forest with Lal, who
has been her ``mahout'' for 50 of the 62 years she has ferried
tourists in a government forest eight hours a day.
	   Lal, 68, will stay with Anarkali in the forest, feeding her,
scrubbing her down in the river every day, and attending to minor
ailments
	   At age 80, Anarkali _ one of the seven elephants in the Dudhwa
National Park in northern India _ is too old and weak to be
carrying six to eight tourists on her back through the dense
forests, Singh said .
	   ``Anarkali seemed to understand that it was a last day at
work,'' he said. ``She looked sad.''
	   Anarkali will continue to stay in the forest in the state of
Uttar Pradesh and will be cared for at government expense.
	   Every year, the forest department traps one or two wild
elephants to train them to carry tourists in nature reserves.

A year after fatal eruption, Montserrat considers limited resettlement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Montserrat (AP) _ The government is considering the
resettlement of the community of Salem on this volcano-ravaged
island, a government spokesman said Friday, one day after a
memorial service marking the anniversary of the volcano's deadliest
eruption.
	   Herman Sergeant, spokesman for the Office of the Chief Minister,
said the government will make a decision about allowing people to
return to Salem, a community on the west-central part of the
39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) Caribbean island after
scientists finish a report on the activity at the Soufriere Hills
volcano.
	   Sargeant said decisions about returning to the evacauated areas
of the island are now made with far more caution because of events
of a year ago.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of residents overflowed the Brades
Pentecostal Church for a memorial service for more than a dozen
people swept to their deaths by a sudden eruption last year.
	   ``What happened on June 25 of last year is still very vivid,''
said Sargeant. ``It has made a lasting impression, I think, on how
we live our lives.
	   ``It taught us not to take nature lightly. I believe many people
died because they didn't think the volcano would affect them.''
	   When the volcano erupted without warning a year ago, many people
were in the official exclusion zone, checking on their property or
tending to livestock or crops left behind. Many were killed
instantly by pyroclastic flows, the waves of 900-degree gas, ash
and rocks that sweep down the mountainside at speeds of 100 mph
(160 kph).
	   Two thirds of the island remains uninhabitable and most of the
original 11,000 residents have left. But the volcano has not had a
significant eruption since December and has been especially quiet
for the last two months, with no significant earthquakes, rock
falls or growth in its dome, said Sergeant.
	   The government is likely to allow residents to return
temporarily to Salem to begin a cleanup in preparation for
resettlement, Sergeant said.
	   The former capital of Plymouth, the main settlement on the
island, was destroyed by the volcano. Most of the buildings burned
to the ground and the town is buried by several feet (meters) of
ash.

Second man confesses to his part in destroying refugee home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT/ODER, Germany (AP) _ A second man charged in the 1992
arson fire of a refugee home in an eastern German village confessed
to his role in the crime in a Brandenburg state court Friday.
	   The confession comes after Thomas Oste, 41, a florist in the
village of Dolgenbrodt just southeast of Berlin, admitted in court
Tuesday he paid 11,000 marks (dlrs 6,000) to have a neo-Nazi set
the blaze and keep quiet about it.
	   Gerd Graefen, a 50-year-old electrician and neighbor of Oste,
said Friday he gave Oste 300 marks (dlrs 165) to help pay for the
arson.
	   ``The burning of the home was a criminal thing,'' Graefen said
remorsefully. ``I was aware of that from the beginning. I am deeply
ashamed.''
	   The house, in the eastern lakeside resort of Dolgenbrodt, burned
to the ground on Nov. 1, 1992, the day before 86 Africans would
have moved in.
	   Oste had testified that he feared for his children and his
property, and that the number of refugees were ``way too many'' for
a village of 250 people.
	   Residents tried to stop the project by protesting at town
meetings and by sending a letter to district and state officials.
Those efforts failed, Oste said, so he resorted to arson.
	   Soon after the crime, authorities caught and convicted Silvio
Jaskowski, 18 at the time and a neo-Nazi.
	   A friend of Jaskowski's, Renato Paschke, 27, allegedly helped
him set the fire.
	   Hans-Juergen Schmidt, 49, allegedly supplied heating oil for the
Molotov cocktails. His stepson, Marco Schmidt, 25, allegedly drove
Jaskowski to pick up his money.
	   Based on information from Jaskowski, prosecutors uncovered what
they say was a conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but
also otherwise upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the
asylum-seekers out.
	   The case being heard in the Brandenburg state count in
Frankfurt/Oder, has revealed just how deeply anti-foreigner
sentiments are in Germany.
	   Four men are charged with complicity in the arson and a fifth
with being an accessory at the trial that continues next week.

World Cup: Heat could be a big problem for Norway AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Like most Scandinavians, the
Norwegians love their short summers more than any other season of
the year.
	   Playing soccer in the heat is something else, though. One of
them, Liverpool midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen, fears the late
afternoon heat perhaps even more than Italy in their second-round
encounter Saturday.
	   ``I think the heat will make it a very difficult match,''
Leonhardsen said. ``It's a big difference playing at night.''
	   Leonhardsen has a good reason to be worried. He's runs more than
any other Norwegian in a match. But he's also the mostly
physicially fit, according to a pre-tournament test that checked
the players ability to process oxygen _ an important measure of
physical condition.
	   The second-round opener at Marseille's Stade Velodrome kicks off
4:30 p.m. with an expected temperature of at least 30 degrees
Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) on Saturday. When Norway played Brazil
Tuesday in the final Group A match at the same venue, the
temperature was 26 Celsius (78 Fahrenheit) at kickoff 4 1-2 hours
later. Norway scored two late goals and upset the defending
champions 2-1.
	   The Italian midfield, of course, also features hard-running
players ``who also will feel the heat,'' Leonhardsen said.
	   Bjorn Hansen, assistant to head coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen,
said he didn't expect the heat to be as much of a problem as it was
four years ago in the United States. Then, Norway was eliminated
after the first round.
	   ``The joy of playing in second round overshadows the effects of
the heat,'' Hansen said. ``And the players will get even more
tanned in their faces. They've been so busy doing that''
	   Olsen said it's important to get ready for the heat.
	   ``You can't do much about it,'' he said. ``You have to drink a
lot and prepare well.''
	   Another Liverpool player, defender Stig Inge Bjornebye, said ``I
will walk around with a bottle all day tomorrow.''
	   On the eve of the game, Olsen made just one change from the team
that beat Brazil. Erik Mykland, a creative midfielder who entered
the game as a substitute Tuesday, will replace Roar Strand in the
starting 11.
	   ``It's always easier to pick your lineup after a good game,''
said Olsen, who has never used the same team in two straight games
since taking over as Norway's coach in 1990.
	   ``I expect an even match and our chances are about 50-50,''
Olsen said. ``It won't be easier to beat Italy (than Brazil).
Brazil was already safe in the second round. For us, as well as
Italy, winning is everything.''
	   Saturday's match _ the most important of his career _ will be
Olsen's 88th and possibly last at the helm of Norway. He's retiring
after the World Cup and has been linked to the vacant manager's job
at Glasgow's Celtic.
	   Mykland might also play his last game for Norway. He announced
his retirement from the national team earlier this week.
	   ``I hope it's not my last game,'' said Mykland, who plays for
Panathinaikos of Greece. ``But Italy will be very tough to beat.''

US fails to head off Security Council meeting on Jerusalem; set for Tuesday 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite U.S. efforts, the Security Council
decided Friday to meet next week to hear Arab demands that Israel
reverse its decision to extend municipal services from Jerusalem to
Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
	   Council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said the meeting
would be held Tuesday at the request of Arab envoys to the United
Nations.
	   The United States sought to delay the meeting until next month,
saying any council action on the issue would enflame passions and
hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the Middle East peace
process.
	   But Bahrain, the only Arab country on the 15-member council,
insisted on the meeting as soon as possible. As a rule, the
Security Council accepts all such requests from its members.
	   On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Jerusalem is ``one of the most sensitive issues in the peace
process'' and any Security Council discussion ``would be
counterproductive to the success of our discussions with the
Palestinians and the Israelis.''
	   Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved a plan
Sunday to put Jewish settlements under Jerusalem municipal
authority for certain services, notably building and planning.
	   Settlements normally have to get approval from the defense
ministry for any construction. The United States has called for a
``time-out'' on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to
help restart the stalled peace talks.
	   The Arab League has condemned the Israeli plan, calling it an
attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem'' and
``destroy the peace process.''
	   The meeting will likely take up a draft resolution, informally
circulated last week by Arab ambassadors to the United Nations,
which condemns the expansion plan and demands that it be rescinded.
	   It also calls on Israel ``to refrain from all actions of
measures, including settlement activities, which are illegal'' and
could interfere with future talks on the status of Jerusalem.
	   Monteiro said it was unlikely that the resolution would be voted
on Tuesday.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But having to resort to the veto is
considered a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent
member is unable to muster majority support.
	   In a separate action, the Arabs have also asked the General
Assembly to consider a proposal to upgrade the status of the
Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations, granting it
most of the privileges of a member state except for voting rights.
	   At the urging of Washington, the Arabs agreed to postpone the
General Assembly debate until July 7.

	   Demirel said at a news conference that Turkey was ready to
release a dlrs 35 million loan promised to Moldova four years ago,
the Interfax news agency said.

Prada's plans for Gucci still a mystery AP Fashion Writer 
</HEADLINE>

By DANIELA PETROFF
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There is no doubt that Prada's plans for Gucci are _
for the moment _ a well-kept secret. That may change after next
week's menswear preview in Milan.
	   When the radical chic fashion company bought 5 percent of its
glitzy rival in early June, the hottest rumor was of an imminent
merger.
	   The following week Paolo Bertelli, Prada's chief executive
officer, and husband of designer Miuccia Prada, went out and bought
another 4.5 percent, making a total investment of dlrs 260 million
and making Prada one of the single most powerful shareholders.
	   Tongues wagged about a takeover.
	   The mysterious Bertelli's next move was not to appear at the
Gucci annual shareholders meeting in Amsterdam on Wednesday.
	   ``I have no idea what their intentions are,'' said Domenico de
Sole president and chief executive of Gucci.
	   The move by Prada on Gucci is only the latest business venture
in the Italian fashion world, which in the past 20 years has moved
from mom-and-pop shops to a tycoon industry.
	   Last year the Italian group Hdp (Holding di partecipazioni) paid
dlrs 300 million for the Valentino company, whose perennially
tanned designer has been the fashion darling of the rich and famous
for more than 30 years.
	   Shortly before he was shot to death last July, Gianni Versace
had made moves to go public. Now, according to brother Santo, plans
are on the back burner until after the execution of the late
designer's will.
	   Giorgio Armani says he is considering making his company public,
but won't say when.
	   ``A lot of what is going on has more to do with marketing than
with style,'' said Bepe Modenese, honorary president of the Italian
chamber of fashion and the man whose goal of wedding fashion and
industry put the ``moda Milanese'' on the international fashion
calendar.
	   Led by Armani and Versace, the Milanese designers who emerged in
the 1980s became household names through clever public relations
and ad campaigns. Top models such as Claudia Schiffer and Naomi
Campbell were treated like movie stars.
	   Both Tom Ford for Gucci and Miuccia Prada sharpened these
promotional skills.
	   While in sharp contrast on one level _ Miuccia is minimalist
(just short of prudish), and Ford is maximalist (towering spike
heels with a glittering rhinestone double ``G'' logo) _ they are
both into essentials.
	   Moreover, both can claim turning a boringly staid fashion house
(Prada) or a no-longer-able-to-live-on-past-glory leather company
(Gucci) into multimillion dollar fashion empires.
	   Next week's menswear preview collections in Milan may offer some
insight into the Prada-Gucci future. At separate shows, both
Miuccia and Ford will be presenting their spring-summer 1999 looks.
	   If, for example, Ford were to button up those sexy see-through
shirts he likes open to the waist, then we'd have a pretty good
idea of who's calling the shots.

Angola's former rebels say sanctions jeopardize peace accord 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITS to drop extraneous ed's note
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Threatened United Nations sanctions would
derail the implementation of UNITA's 1994 peace pact with the
government, the former rebel movement warned Friday.
	   The U.N. Security Council has given UNITA until June 30 to
comply with the outstanding stipulations of the peace accord, which
ended a two-decade civil war in the southwest African nation.
	   The council will freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and ban
its diamond exports unless the movement relinquishes its central
highland strongholds and takes major steps to demobilize the
remnants of its armed forces.
	   The proposed sanctions were ``excessive, unfair, illegal and
illegitimate'' and would ``definitively jeopardize'' the peace
agreement, UNITA said in a written statement.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said his movement's
four strongholds would be handed over only after July 10. He blamed
police harrassment of UNITA supporters for the movement's
reluctance to hand over the areas.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government.
	   U.N. officials in Luanda were unavailable for comment.
	   The U.N. special envoy to Angola left Luanda on Friday for a
tour of five African countries to win support for his efforts to
push the peace process towards its conclusion.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye was due to visit Togo, Ivory Coast, Gabon,
Sao Tome and Principe and Burkina Faso.

World Cup: Jamaica gets first-ever victory optional; ADDS quotes, UPDATES with Japan coach quitting AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Fitzroy Simpson didn't want to leave the
field. It was Jamaica's first World Cup victory, and he and the
rest of the Reggae Boyz were enjoying themselves too much.
	   ``Did the road really have to end that quick?'' Simpson said.
``I'm really ecstatic at the moment. I'm over the moon that we can
actually leave the tournament on a high.''
	   Theodore Whitmore scored in the 40th and 54th minutes to create
some island joy at the rainswept Stade de Gerland in Friday's 2-1
victory over fellow newcomer Japan, the first World Cup victory by
a Caribbean nation since Cuba beat Romania 2-1 in 1938, also in
France.
	   ``I am very proud of them,'' said coach Rene Simoes, a Brazilian
who controversially cobbled together a team with several foreign
residents who claimed Jamaican ancestry. ``And I'm sure Jamaica
must be. We don't have to be ashamed of anything. Let's go for the
future and 2002.''
	   Simpson, one of Simoes' oversees recruits who plays for
Portsmouth in England, was nevertheless quick to gauge the
victory's impact back in Kingston.
	   ``It gives hope for all of Jamaican football,'' Simpson said.
``As I said from the start, we weren't playing just for the team
here, we were playing for the whole of Jamaican football, and we're
hopeful we've laid a fantastic foundation for the younger players
coming through.''
	   The loss ended a hard-luck tournament for Japan, which lost all
three of its games by one goal and proved each time it can do
everything except score. Leaving the field, goalkeeper Yoshikatsu
Kawaguchi tried his best to smile through his tears as he accepted
the cheers of thousands of Japanese fans.
	   ``We lost, but it was a good game,'' striker Wagner Lopes said.
``Japanese soccer will get even better in the future.''
	   Once again, the Japanese play on defense and in midfield was
competent and sometimes masterful, but the 2002 Cup co-hosts lacked
the quality striker who could finish off the chances and left
France 98 with only one goal _ Masashi Nakayama's strike in the
74th minute.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada took the blame, and immediately resigned.
	   ``I will quit as professional coach,'' Okada said. ``When a
coach fails to achieve what he sets out to do, he should quit. It
is my responsibility. I was not able to draw the best out of the
players in this match.''
	   The opening goal came after teammate Stephen Malcolm and
Japanese defender Yutaka Akita collided while trying to play the
ball in the penalty area. The ball fell to Whitmore, who drove his
12-meter shot past defender Naoki Soma and to the right of
Kawaguchi.
	   Whitmore added his second when the Japanese defense gave him
space to take Fitzroy Simpson's pass down the right wing. The
midfielder spun defender Noria Omura around and nailed a
left-footed drive from 15 meters.
	   Japan hit the post and forced goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence to make
several solid saves in the second half, and finally broke through
when Naoki Soma's long ball was headed by Lopes to Nakayama, whose
one-timer from 8 meters easily beat Lawrence.
	   Jamaica also had a goal disallowed in the 15th minute when Ian
Goodison, who headed in a well-laid corner kick from Simpson, was
apparently whistled for pushing by Austrian referee Gunter Benko.

EU: Lack of enthusiasm for union's enlargement, says Santer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CRANS MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) _ European Union members and
candidate countries share a lack of enthusiasm for the enlargement
of the union, E.U. Commission President Jacques Santer said Friday.
	   Speaking at a meeting of European and African business and
political leaders in this Alpine ski resort, Santer said
politicians should refute those who tend to look only at the
problems.
	   The E.U. began membership negotiations with six applicant
countries at the end of March, but the first new member is not
expected to join until 2004 or 2005. Five other candidates are
waiting to begin negotiations.
	   ``If I have one concern it is that I sometimes notice a lack of
enthusiasm for enlargement,'' Santer said.
	   Enlargement of the EU will require reform of its own
institutions, including voting procedures among its members, the
overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy and the way in which
regional aid is allocated.
	   Applicant countries will have to bring their legislation into
line with EU norms, while their infrastructure will have to be
upgraded costing billions of dollars.
	   Countries wanting to join the European Union believe enlargement
of the 15-nation bloc is not its main priority, and want a more
inclusive approach to negotiations.
	   Czech Prime Minister Josef Tosovsky said enlargement lagged
behind European Monetary Union, reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy, and high rates of unemployment among members' concerns.
	   Tosovsky said applicant countries should demonstrate they
weren't a potential burden on tax payers, but prospective assets.
	   The Czech Republic is one of five Eastern European countries
that officially began membership talks last month.
	   Lithuania is one of a second group of five yet to begin
negotiations.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gedeminas Vagnorious said it was
dangerous to exclude his own and other countries from the
negotiation process.
	   Albania is not among the ten applicant countries that have
either started negotiations, or for which negotiations are a
realistic prospect in the medium term.
	   ``Will the new Europe be built according to the model of a
skyscraper, with a vertical hierarchy, or will it be a pagoda-like
common space?'' he said.
	   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said the so-called
``sewer war'' that led to the departure of diplomats from the U.S.,
Britain, Germany, France, Greece, Italy, and Japan earlier this
week is a U.S.-inspired provocation.
	   However, he said the ambassadors were welcome to return to the
country ``any time'' and would find ``comfortable new residences
waiting for them'' on the outskirts of Minsk.
	   Lukashenko's government has been trying for weeks to oust the
ambassadors from their homes on the wooded outskirts of Minsk.
Officials say the houses need urgent sewer and plumbing repairs,
and Lukashenko says the compound belongs to him.

New train to Heathrow Airport is fast _ but expensive and inconvenient 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with comments from former U.S. senator
With AP PHOTOS LON102-103

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some travelers are thrilled that they can hop a
train in London and arrive at Heathrow Airport in 15 minutes.
Others like the speed but not the cost _ and complain that it takes
too long to get to the station.
	   A week after The Heathrow Express started service, a few taxi
drivers are even predicting that the combination of expensive
tickets and an inconvenient location may lead to its fast demise.
	   Traveling to Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, is a
headache for Londoners and tourists alike.
	   The subway ride takes about 45 minutes from central London, and
often means standing and juggling luggage in crowded carriages.
	   The roads are often jammed, and getting to the airport by car,
bus or taxi can take 25 minutes or more than 1 1/2 hours. The taxi
ride will cost about 25 pounds (dlrs 42), or more in bad traffic.
	   The Heathrow Express' main advantage is that it avoids the
traffic and covers the 17 miles (27 kms) between Paddington station
and the airport in a quarter of an hour.
	   ``It's comfortable. It's quick. There's no traffic,'' said
lawyer Bob Wolfe. ``My only complaint is that there is not enough
time to read the newspaper.''
	   Former U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler, who arrived in London from
Singapore on Thursday night, said he was pushing his baggage cart
to the taxi rank when someone told him that he could take a train
and be in London in 15 minutes.
	   ``I said that's impossible,'' said the former South Dakota
Republican who now practices law in Washington. ``But I did it, and
I was at the hotel 45 minutes after I got off the plane. It was
much faster, and I'll never travel any other way when I come to
London. We don't have anything like this in the U.S., but we'd
better get it.''

India says no to U.N mediatory efforts on Kashmir 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with De Soto flying into Bangladesh, details
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A United Nations peace envoy has dropped
New Delhi from his itinerary, apparently because Indian officials
feared he would try to mediate in their territorial dispute with
neighboring Pakistan, news reports said Friday.
	   The United Nations had planned to have Alvaro de Soto, the
assistant U.N. secretary-general, visit Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan to discuss controlling nuclear weapons following a series
of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   De Soto was also to have discussed what many believe to be the
root of regional tensions _ the dispute between India and Pakistan
over Kashmir.
	   Friday night, De Soto flew into bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. He
will continue to Pakistan, but he ``is not going to India as New
Delhi had indicated that It is not ready to receive him,'' Press
Trust of India news agency quoted U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard as
saying in New York.
	   ``The purpose of my visit is not any mediation (between India
and Pakistan) but to hand over messages from the
secretary-general,'' he said.
	   In New Delhi, PTI quoted Indian foreign ministry officials as
saying India would welcome de Soto only to discuss global nuclear
disarmament.
	   ``There is no scope for third-party involvement of any nature in
respect of India's relations with Pakistan,'' K.C. Singh, the
Indian foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in New Delhi on
Thursday. ``India-Pakistan issues are purely bilateral, to be
resolved through bilateral dialogue.''
	   Pakistan has been eager for international mediation in the
Kashmiri dispute, believing it is at a disadvantage in one-on-one
talks with its much larger neighbor. India adamantly resists any
outside pressure.
	   Kashmir will be on the agenda when the prime ministers of India
and Pakistan meet next month in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo
on the sidelines of a regional summit.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of the
Himalayan territory, leaving two thirds of it in India and the rest
in Pakistan. A separatist movement in Indian-controlled Kashmir
that New Delhi says is supported by Islamabad has killed more than
15,000 people since 1989.

Saddam Hussein orders crackdown on antiquity smugglers 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered his
government to take firm action against antiquity smugglers to stem
what officials see as a growing problem.
	   Thousands of guards may be hired to protect the country's 30,000
archaeological sites, which contain some of the world's greatest
antiquities.
	   In what was a first for the president, Saddam convened a Cabinet
meeting this week to discuss the traffic in Iraq's ancient
sculptures and treasures.
	   ``Antiquities are among the most vital possession of the state
and occupy the highest priority on the agenda of national
security,'' Saddam told the Cabinet.
	   His move appears to have been prompted at least in part by the
case of Hikmet Hajou, the Iraqi charge d'affaires who was
assassinated in Amman, Jordan, in April.
	   After his death, Iraq's ruling Baath Party investigated Hajou
and found he had taken part in the smuggling of a Babylonian
antiquity depicting the goddess Ishtar that was stolen from the
Baghdad Museum last year, the newspaper Al-Quds al-Arabi reported
in Cairo.
	   The Baath Party issued a statement saying that Hajou had been
posthumously dismissed from all positions and that his pension and
property would be confiscated, the newspaper reported.
	   The London-published Al-Quds is not distributed in Iraq, where
no newspaper has published the party's findings about Hajou.
	   Officials say the Cabinet decided Sunday to grant governors and
provincial security chiefs the funds to recruit and pay respectable
salaries to thousands of antiquity guards. The authorities will
also be entitled to pay generous rewards for information about
smuggling.
	   ``Trafficking in archaeological objects is on the rise. Some
bandits even use bulldozers to pilfer ancient sites,'' Behnam Abu
al-Souf, a former director of Iraq's Antiquities Department, told
The Associated Press.
	   No figures are available on the number of missing pieces, but
the department says those stolen in the past few years could fill
the shelves of a huge museum.
	   ``It could be much more. We have ancient sites that have been
destroyed and emptied by smugglers. Where the artifacts go nobody
knows,'' said the assistant head of the department, Dony Youkhanna.
	   Officials say at least 12 people have been executed for
smuggling in recent years and hundreds of smugglers have been
imprisoned.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered his
government to take firm action against antiquity smugglers to stem
what officials see as a growing problem.
	   Thousands of guards may be hired to protect the country's 30,000
archaeological sites, which contain some of the world's greatest
antiquities.
	   In what was a first for the president, Saddam convened a Cabinet
meeting this week to discuss the traffic in Iraq's ancient
sculptures and treasures.
	   ``Antiquities are among the most vital possession of the state
and occupy the highest priority on the agenda of national
security,'' Saddam told the Cabinet.
	   His move appears to have been prompted at least in part by the
case of Hikmet Hajou, the Iraqi charge d'affaires assassinated in
Amman, Jordan, in April.
	   After his death, Iraq's ruling Baath Party investigated Hajou
and found he had taken part in the smuggling of a Babylonian
antiquity depicting the goddess Ishtar that was stolen from the
Baghdad Museum last year, the newspaper Al-Quds al-Arabi reported
in Cairo.
	   The Baath Party issued a statement saying that Hajou had been
posthumously dismissed from all positions and that his pension and
property would be confiscated, the newspaper reported.
	   The London-published Al-Quds is not distributed in Iraq, where
no newspaper has published the party's findings about Hajou.
	   Officials say the Cabinet decided Sunday to grant governors and
provincial security chiefs the funds to recruit and pay respectable
salaries to thousands of antiquity guards. The authorities will
also be entitled to pay generous rewards for information about
smuggling.
	   ``Trafficking in archaeological objects is on the rise. Some
bandits even use bulldozers to pilfer ancient sites,'' Behnam Abu
al-Souf, a former director of Iraq's Antiquities Department, told
The Associated Press.
	   No figures are available on the number of missing pieces, but
the department says those stolen in the past few years could fill
the shelves of a huge museum.
	   ``It could be much more,'' said the assistant head of the
department, Dony Youkhanna. ``We have ancient sites that have been
destroyed and emptied by smugglers. Where the artifacts go nobody
knows.''
	   Officials say at least 12 people have been executed for
smuggling in recent years and hundreds of smugglers have been
imprisoned.

Scattered clashes, tension around England-Colombia match 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new clashes, CHANGES byline
By JEAN-MARIE GODARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this tense northern town that was
under a tight security clampdown around the evening's
England-Colombia match.
	   Shops closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were taken
down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000 police
stood ready for a new round of World Cup violence. English police
helped spot known hooligans.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train in
Lens or nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed.
Many brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. The
standoff eased, but the high number of drunken fans in this town of
30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.) match.
	   ``No screen to watch the match, no beer, police everywhere. What
do you French take us for?'' asked John, a fan in a wig with the
red, white and blue of the English flag, who refused to give his
last name. ``People just came here to have fun, not to be
savages.''
	   One hundred Colombian fans arrived by train Friday afternoon,
carrying their national flag with the word ``peace'' written over
it.
	   But most locals were lying low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in overnight clashes in northern France
and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   As many as 30,000 English fans were expected _ many without
tickets _ to cheer their team on. England needs at least a point to
advance to the second round.
	   Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were to attend the
match.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday. A
French policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a
coma.
	   Authorities feared more of the same, or even worse.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   As of early Friday evening, however, Germans were not visible in
the city. German authorities had stepped up border checks of
France-bound travelers, turning back some suspected hooligans.
	   Lens officials have banned the sale or possession of alcohol on
the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday. But the ban does
not extend to surrounding towns.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes.
	   A known English soccer hooligan, Paul Dodd, from Carlisle, was
detained for questioning Friday as he was about to board a ferry in
Dover, police said.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

World Cup: The knives are out after Belgium sinks 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Belgium is no longer a small country doing great in
the World Cup. It is a small country down and out without a single
victory, without a single blaze of glory.
	   It doesn't bode well for 2000, when it organizes the European
Championships together with its stylish soccer neighbor, the
Netherlands.
	   ``They lacked dynamism, speed and motivation,'' said Belgian
coach Georges Leekens in a stinging indictment of his own players.
Belgium drew its three Group E games against the Netherlands,
Mexico and South Korea and were on their way home as the Dutch and
Mexicans advanced.
	   It was the fifth time in a row Belgium qualified but it was the
first time it was eliminated in the first round. Previously, the
Red Devils had built a reputation as giant killers.
	   Now, the knives were out among them.
	   Veteran playmaker Enzo Scifo came back after a long fight with
Leekens and the coach didn't exactly go out of his way to laud
Scifo's swan song after he ended his fourth World Cup in disarray.
	   ``It's not Enzo Scifo's fault that we lost, despite his lack of
success and numerous errors,'' said Leekens, who was known as Mack
the Knife in his playing days as a ruthless tackler.
	   Scifo was far from happy after being substituted in the second
half against South Korea with qualification still on the line.
	   ``When I walked off the field I felt like breaking everything in
sight,'' he said, but refused to comment on Leekens. ``I'd just say
things I will only regret later on.''
	   Despite widespread calls in the media for his dismissal,
Leekens' job seemed secure for the moment.
	   ``He already qualified us, against all expectations,'' said
Belgian federation president Michel D'Hooghe, insisting he would
stick with him through the 2000 European Championships.
	   ``Now I will build a strong team for Euro 2000,'' said Leekens.
``For the World Cup here, we just didn't have the quality.''
	   And very little is in sight to replace the aging generation.
	   Scifo, 32, captain Franky Van der Elst, 37, defenders Lorenzo
Staelens, 34, and Vital Borkelmans, 35, and perhaps even striker
Luc Nilis, 31, are all likely to retire from the international
scene.
	   Not a single glimmer of hope from a prodigy appeared at the
World Cup.
	   Still, midfield stalwart and scorer of two of Belgium's three
goals Marc Wilmots, was looking for hopeful signs.
	   ``I suppose the big name Red Devils will say goodbye. Let's make
haste and create a new squad ahead of the European Championships in
2000. This is soccer. After the heaviest blow you need to make a
fresh start,'' he said.

Turk star begins NBA journey 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Turkish basketball star Mirsad Turkcan is getting
a taste of life in the NBA and likes it already.
	   ``I'm very happy to be in Houston,'' Turkcan said Friday, making
his first appearance in Houston after being selected one of the
Rockets' three first-round choices in this week's NBA draft.
	   ``Orlando, Indiana and Seattle also contacted me, but I thank
God I am in Houston,'' he told reporters. ``I am ready for hard
work, the NBA life and everything that goes with it.''
	   The 6-foot-8 6 (2.1 meters) Turkcan, 22, is the first Turkish
player to get a chance to play in the NBA. He had been playing for
Turkey's Istanbul-based Efes Pilsen team.
	   ``The people in my country are very excited,'' he said. ``This
morning, seven or eight television stations called to talk to me
and today I am on the front page of the paper. I am so happy.''
	   He said he was familiar with Houston stars Charles Barkley and
Hakeem Olajuwon.
	   ``This is a very big player,'' he said of Barkley. ``I've heard
of Charles and they say he's a good guy and so is Hakeem. He may be
my favorite player.''
	   Turkcan said he would be heading to New York for a few days,
then head back home to Turkey before returning to Texas for the
Rockets' training camp.
	   ``I know the NBA is a tougher league, but I have played in
Europe in the top league and I feel sure when I come back I can
contribute to the success of the Rockets,'' he said.

Armenian foreign minister calls for unconditional talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said
Friday that Armenia was prepared for unconditional talks with
Azerbaijan on resolving the dispute over the territory of Nagorno
Karabakh.
	   ``Armenia is not imposing any conditions,'' Oskanian said at a
news conference. ``If Azerbaijan does not either, we can start
talks on a comprehensive solution of the Karabakh problem to break
the deadlock.''
	   Oskanian sought to tone down the ``fuss in the media'' created
when he said Nagorno-Karabakh could become part of Armenia if
Azerbaijan refused to change its stance on the disputed territory.
	   Some interpreted Oskanian's remarks to mean that Armenia is
planning to annex Nagorno-Karabakh if Azerbaijan refuses to budge.
	   He said the uproar was caused by Azerbaijan to divert attention
from Armenia's proposals on resolving the conflict and that his
remarks were misinterpreted.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in early 1988
and drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Azerbaijan still claims Nagorno-Karabakh as its own, although
the territory largely conducts its affairs as if it were
independent.
	   A European Parliament delegation meeting with lawmakers in the
Armenian parliament said Friday it was necessary to resolve the
Nagorno-Karabakh problem.
	   They released a statement calling on Armenia to ``find a just
and realistic solution to the problem,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.

Scattered clashes, tension around England-Colombia match 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with clashes in Lille; ADDS background

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this tense northern town that was
under a tight security clampdown around the evening's
England-Colombia match.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, clashes between Lens-bound English
fans and local youths raised tensions there. Police were boosting
their forces in Lille to face crowds after the match, seen as among
the highest risk games of a World Cup struck repeatedly by
violence.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready for a new round of World Cup violence. English
police helped spot known hooligans.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train in
Lens or nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed.
Many brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. No
injuries were reported.
	   The standoff eased, but the high number of drunken fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.)
match.
	   ``No screen to watch the match, no beer, police everywhere. What
do you French take us for?'' asked John, a fan in a wig with the
red, white and blue of the English flag, who refused to give his
last name. ``People just came here to have fun, not to be
savages.''
	   One hundred Colombian fans arrived by train Friday afternoon,
carrying their national flag with the word ``peace'' written over
it.
	   But most locals were lying low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in overnight clashes in northern France
and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   As many as 30,000 English fans were expected _ many without
tickets _ to cheer their team on. England needs at least a point to
advance to the second round.
	   Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were to attend the
match.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday. A
French policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a
coma.
	   Authorities feared more of the same, or even worse.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   As of early Friday evening, however, Germans were not visible in
the city. German authorities had stepped up border checks of
France-bound travelers, turning back some suspected hooligans.
	   Lens officials have banned the sale or possession of alcohol on
the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday. But the ban does
not extend to surrounding towns.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes.
	   A known English soccer hooligan, Paul Dodd, from Carlisle, was
detained for questioning Friday as he was about to board a ferry in
Dover, police said.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured. English
fans have clashed with, or were attacked by, French North African
youths from poor suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

World Cup: Lens braces for English invasion AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Ticketless English fans, desperate to see a
do-or-die World Cup match with Colombia on Friday, heaved bottles
at riot police who moved them back from the stadium and tried in
vain to confiscate their vast reserves of beer.
	   Police charged repeatedly, wrestling three men to the ground and
arresting them. A tense calm fell over this little northern
industrial town, whose 35,000 inhabitants were nearly outnumbered
by Englishmen.
	   Lens, with its bars and businesses closed, took on the air of
the West Bank on a bad day. Helmeted riot troops lined streets,
carrying plastic shields and tear gas guns. A column of police vans
and an armored truck parked by the train station.
	   In nearby Lille, where the channel tunnel train from London
stops, fans scuffled with local thugs, and at least three
Englishmen were arrested. Hundreds were turned back at the border
as suspected troublemakers.
	   But most of the English fans seemed ready for a good time and
serious football. Young couples in gaily painted faces and fluffy
red and white wigs seemed incongruous against the dark blue riot
troopers' uniforms.
	   ``I don't think the police had to do this,'' said Jason Paul,
28, an electrician from Finchley, near a wall of riot troops.
``It's a provocation. We came here as supporters, not hooligans.
Football comes from England, and we love it.''
	   To make his point, he approached the police line in a huge
papier mache red-and-white mask and sang at the top of his lungs:
``Keep St. George in my heart, I am English.'' Hundreds more behind
him took up the song.
	   Others bellowed, ``No surrender,'' and one demanded to know why
they couldn't have a peaceful party in the streets. ``We're
English, not German,'' the man yelled. Police listened impassively.
	   Security forces have been especially tense since last Sunday
when a band of German neo-Nazis wracked havoc on Lens. They beat
one policeman on the head with a metal pipe, and he is near death
at a hospital in Lille.
	   Earlier this month in Marseille, several hundred Englishmen
fought running street battles with French-Tunisian youths and
police, leaving scores injured.
	   ``It's a shame, since 99 percent of English supporters are
well-behaved,'' said Kevin Miles, of the volunteer Fans' Embassy,
which helps fans abroad. ``Most of them could not get tickets, and
they're doing the best they can.''
	   Organizers allotted only 4,500 tickets to England, which is a
few hours away. Tens of thousands came anyway in hopes of finding
scalpers. Town authorities had planned to set up a huge video
screen, but changed their minds after violence in Marseille.
	   Matt Lowry, an Englishman who works for Intel in Portland,
Oregon, flew to France to watch England play but could not find
tickets. The going rate was nearly dlrs. 700, if a scalper could be
found.
	   He sought refuge on a back street and plotted with a friend how
best to see the match. Since local bars were shut, they would have
to drive miles away to the nearest TV set. But that meant they
would miss their chance for cheaper last-minute tickets.
	   Nearly, Michel Sikona stood in the doorway of his video game
store, Devil's Games. He was among a scant merchants to stay open
in the deserted town.
	   ``This megaphobia, this stupid fear among townspeople makes me
ashamed of Lens,'' he said. ``This should be a party, and look
around. It's a ghost town. Not every Englishman is a hooligan. They
should stop the bad ones and leave the rest alone.''
	   Lens is known across France for its passion for football. Its
team just won the France championship.
	   ``This is the capital of football, and it is always happy
here,'' Sikona said. ``There are never any incidents. Okay, take
precautions, but not all of this. Give the English a chance.''

	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured. English
fans have clashed with, or were attacked by, French North African
youths from poor suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

Davenport into fourth round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A semifinalist last year,
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport got into the fourth round Friday _
mostly unnoticed.
	   With one eye on the darkening sky, Davenport turned aside No.
31-ranked Maria Alejandra Vento of Venuzuela 6-3, 1-6, 6-2.
	   After dominating the opening set, Davenport ran into trouble _
struggling to reach her opponent's well-placed shots as Vento
leveled in the second.
	   ``She was running everything down,'' Davenport said. ``And I
haven't played anyone here who doesn't have a slice. The balls were
coming a lot harder and a lot earlier. Luckily I got off to a good
lead in the third and just got more balls in.''
	   ``But it was awful out there,'' she said of the on-and-off
showers. ``I'd won the first set and looked up and the darkest
cloud I've ever seen was there. I think it was very lucky we even
got out there and got through.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONICA's BEAU: &LR;  London's Evening Standard is reporting that
Monica Seles has a new boyfriend.
	   The newspaper said she befriended a young Australian who stopped
and asked her for directions at the London underground station in
Piccadily Circus. He apparently did not know who she was.
	   ``I gather the conversation went so well that telephone numbers
were exchanged, and the two have since enjoyed dinner together,''
the gossip column said.
	   The paper ran a blurry photo of Seles and the man, who was
wearing a corked hat and was described as looking like Paul Hogan,
star of the film ``Crocodile Dundee.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   AHOY, MATE: &LR;  Sue Mott, writing in The Daily Telegraph, described
why Spain's Carlos Moya committed so many foot-faults in his
second-round loss: His shorts were too long.
	   ``His foot-faulting was ridiculous and probably owed everything
to the fact that he could not see his shoes,'' she wrote. ``He had
so much billowing sail in his knee-length shorts that he only
needed a bit of rigging and he could have competed in the Whitbread
Round the World yacht race.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REPLAY GORAN: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic, twice runner-up at Wimbledon,
on Thursday watched his 1992 final with Andre Agassi _ apparenlty
expecting a different result.
	   ``Yesterday killed me,'' he said. ``Yesterday during the rain
delay they showed the '92 finals.
	   ``I was watching the whole last set and I thought maybe I'm
going to win... I thought maybe I would do something different, but
nothing.''
	   Ivanisevic reached the third round Friday with a four-set win
over Andrei Medvedev, calling it his best match since 1994 when he
lost the final to Pete Sampras.
	   ``The last six months... it's been my worst six months ever in
my career,'' he said. ``I say, `OK,' the first half of the year is
gone.
	   ``Now it's the second part of the year, Wimbledon's come, and I
just felt like I should play... It doesn't mean that I'm going to
do well here, but I just feel some way this year is going to break
through.''

World Cup: Argentina downs Croatia 1-0 to keep perfect record 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional. CORRECTS first name Ortega
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ It used to be Diego Maradona's dazzle
that powered Argentina. This year, a tight defense got the two-time
champion into the World Cup's second round with a perfect record.
	   Even a defender scored the goal Friday that lifted Argentina
past Croatia 1-0.
	   After Ariel Ortega split Croatia's defense with a deep pass
deflected off libero Zvonimir Soldo, Hector Pineda connected in the
36th minute with a left-footed drive from inside the penalty area.
	   With both teams already sure of second-round berths, the game
decided the winner of their qualifying group.
	   And Argentina had the edge in speed, punch and precision against
Croatia's aging stars, who rarely threatened Carlos Roa's goal. The
South Americans notched their third victory in three games and
their defense remained the only one not to concede a goal.
	   ``This was a well-deserved victory against the toughest team in
the group,'' said Argentina's coach Daniel Passarella. ``It wasn't
easy, but our game was more organized.''
	   The best chance for the lackluster Croatians _ who are making
their World Cup debut _ came in the 63rd minute when substitute
Goran Vlaovic unleashed a 27-meter drive that crashed onto the
post, with Roa well beaten.
	   ``They deserved victory and Argentina confirmed their big
ambitions,'' said Croatia's coach Miroslav Blazevic. ``But we come
out of this with our heads held high and hope we will have more
luck next time.''
	   Next time, though, Croatia will be deprived of key central
defender Zvonimir Soldo, who will be suspended after getting his
second booking of the tournament.
	   Argentina defeated Japan 1-0 and Jamaica 5-0 in earlier games.
Croatia beat Jamaica 3-1 and Japan 1-0.
	   For much of Friday's game, the teams locked horns in midfield.
	   Croatian star Davor Suker gave Argentina a quick scare in the
second minute with an arching header onto the top of Carlos Roa's
net. Soon, though, the Real Madrid striker was angrily berating his
teammates for failing to set up chances against a disciplined
Argentine defense.
	   Argentina replied in the sixth minute with a free kick into the
box from playmaker Marcelo Gallardo, but Gabriel Batistuta got only
a glancing header on the ball.
	   But the first half remained agonizingly slow until the
Argentines, backed by some 10,000 fans in the soldout 37,000 Parc
Lescure, came to life with Pineda's goal.
	   They quickly threatened again as star striker Gabriel Batistuta
lunged for a header near the penalty spot and forced Croatian
striker Mario Stanic to clean up in his own area.
	   Croatian goalkeeper Drazen Ladic save his side from going two
goals down seconds before halftime, tipping away a blast from
Gallardo off a free kick that bounced off the Croatian wall.
	   Just before, Soldo got a yellow card for a body check on Ortega.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic threw in Vlaovic as a fresh
attacker after the break, replacing disappointing midfielder Silvio
Maric.
	   But Argentina remained more dangerous, especially after Claudio
Lopez came in for Ortega shortly after halftime. He added pressure
with speedy runs down the left side.
	   Gallardo left the Croatian defense flatfooted in the 71st,
stalking past several defenders to put a tightly angled shot just
wide of the far goalpost.
	   Substitute Diego Simeone was denied by Ladic's foot in the 77th
after Juan Veron duped Igor Stimac in the area and set up the shot.
	   Pushing for the tying goal, Suker remained luckless as time
slipped away, bouncing a header over the crossbar and drilling a
shot into the spectators from the edge of the area.
	   Even playmaker Zvonimir Boban, returning after sitting out the
last game with a pulled leg muscle, failed to make a difference for
Croatia. Veteran defender Igor Stimac, suffering from blistered
feet, was the only regular missing but came on as a substitute.
	   Passarella replaced AC Parma's Roberto Sensini, who has a pulled
leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. He also rested Jose Chamot, who was
facing the threat of suspension because he already received a
yellow card in an earlier game.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Pablo Paz, Nelson Vivas, Roberto Ayala,
Javier Zanetti (68, Diegi Simeone), Hector Pineda; Juan Veron,
Marcelo Gallardo (81, Sergio Berti), Matias Almeyda; Ariel Ortega
(53, Claudio Lopez), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Dario
Simic, Slaven Bilic, Silvio Maric (46, Goran Vlaovic), Aljosa
Asanovic, Zvonimir Boban, Robert Prosinecki (68, Igor Stimac);
Mario Stanic, Davor Suker.
	   Referee : Said Belqola, Morocca.

Guinea-Bissau president says he's open to talks other details. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with president's press conference,
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's besieged president
said Friday that he was open to negotiations to end the conflict
that has been tearing at the capital of this West African country
for the last two weeks.
	   While President Joao Bernardo Vieira did not specifically say he
would sit down with the renegade soldiers his forces have been
fighting, he indicated that such talks were possible.
	   ``We are open to dialogue on the condition that the rebels lay
down their arms,'' he told reporters at a press conference. ``We're
open for any dialogue wherever it comes from to end this
conflict.''
	   The rebels have said they will stop fighting when Vieira, who
they accuse of corruption, leaves the country.
	   Despite efforts by religious leaders to negotiate an end to the
clashes, Friday fighting pounded the northern outskirts of Bissau,
where the breakaway military is locked in a standoff with loyalist
troops and their Senegalese allies.
	   The nearby town of Cumere, which is just next to a key rebel
base, also came under intense shelling Friday from a ship stationed
offshore. The rebels later returned fire on government positions in
Bissau from their main garrison.
	   Religious leaders, meanwhile, failed Friday to meet with Vieira.
	   Bissau's Roman Catholic Bishop Setinio Artur Franzetti said he
was unable to meet with Vieira a day after meeting with his
representatives.
	   ``We simply are looking to have both sides talks and stop the
fighting,'' Franzetti said.
	   He would not elaborate on the talks.
	   Earlier in the week, Franzetti met with rebel leader and former
army chief of staff Ansumane Mane and appealed for a cessation of
hostilities.
	   The capital has been shattered by almost three weeks of
fighting, after Mane launched a coup attempt against Vieira.
	   But Vieira insists he still leads a functioning government, with
a working judiciary and national assembly.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau will not become another Liberia,'' he insisted,
referring to the seven-year civil war that tore at the West African
country.
	   Almost the entire Bissau population of 300,000 has fled to
nearby towns, prompting what could become a major humanitarian
crisis without an influx of food and medical relief, aid workers
say.

World Cup: ItalybafD Norway battle for quarterfinal berth starting, Maldini comment on Cannavaro's height 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Albertini returning to midfield, Del Piero
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Italy tests its newly discovered
offensive punch against Norway's tough defense in the first battle
for a quarterfinal berth.
	   The match at Stade Velodrome on Saturday afternoon (1430 GMT)
begins the knockout second phase of the World Cup, in which lapses
mean elimination. The winner will play either France or Paraguay in
the quarterfinals at Saint-Denis next Friday.
	   Twice a winner against the Norwegians in previous World Cup
matches, Italy is aiming to cause Norway's second-consecutive
elimination, but it's meeting a better team than in 1994.
	   ``We are prepared to play a tough team, physically very strong,
accustomed to defend itself with 10 players and launch sudden,
dangerous counterattacks,'' Italy's coach Cesare Maldini said. ``We
must overcome a difficult hurdle.''
	   Norway coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said he was looking ahead,
not to the past, after leading Norway to its first-ever
qualification for the second round of the World Cup.
	   ``I believe we have a 50 percent chance of reaching the
quarters. I expect Italy to take the initiative and attack. We will
be there waiting for them and ready to strike back,'' Olsen said.
	   The Norwegian team, including several players from the English
Premier League, is especially dangerous in aerial play. This may
ring an alarm bell for the Italian defense which has been allowing
goals on high crosses _ two by Chile and one in a previous warmup
against Sweden.
	   Maldini was pondering the best tactic for overcoming the
physical Norwegians without taking undue risks.
	   He suggested a continuation of the successful rotation between
team stars Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio, with Del Piero
starting in a pair with top World Cup striker Christian Vieri.
	   Vieri, a strongly built center forward, scored four goals in
three matches to boost Italy's first-round total to seven. This is
Italy's highest scoring rate since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina,
when the team had six goals in the three first games.
	   Italy was also expected to field a reinforced midfield to
counter Norway's cautious 4-5-1 formation.
	   Maldini said after the late afternoon training in Marseille that
Demetrio Albertini, benched in the previous match against Austria,
was returning to midfield to team with Dino Baggio, Luigi Di Biagio
and Francesco Moriero.
	   This meant the exclusion of defender Gianluca Pessotto and a
defense line made with veteran sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi, Alessandro
Costacurta, Paolo Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro.
	   Cannavaro, with a height of only 1.75 meters, can be considered
a short player in comparison with the Norwegian ``giants.''
	   However Maldini said he was not worried because ``Fabio is an
excellent jumper and in the Italian league has been marking such
tall players as (George) Weah and (Gabriel) Batistuta.''
	   ``I can't change a well-tested defense because of height
problems,'' he said.
	   Chelsea's striker Tore Andre Flo is Norway's only but impressive
forward. He used his height (1.93 meters) and mobility to cause big
problems for defending champion Brazil in Tuesday's Group A match.
	   Flo scored one goal and earned the penalty which gave his team a
last-minute 2-1 victory and qualification for the second round.
	   Italian players are especially impressed with Norway's unbeaten
streak of 17 matches, and with the two wins in a year over Brazil.
Tuesday's World Cup upset followed Norway's 4-2 victory in an
exhibition game last year.
	   ``It's consecutive wins against Brazil are alarming,'' said
Baggio. ``Norway is a team which must not be underestimated. They
are physically strong and determined.''
	   Baggio, who scored two goals in the first round, played only a
little of the match against Norway at the '94 World Cup in the
United States. He was taken off by then-coach Arrigo Sacchi to make
room for No. 2 goalie Luca Marcheggiani, following the expulsion of
starting keeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Playing 10 against 11, Italy still won 1-0 and moved to the
quarterfinals on its way to the final.
	   In 1938 in France, Italy beat Norway 2-1 in the first round
before clinching the second of its three world titles.

A year after fatal eruption, Montserrat considers limited resettlement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Montserrat (AP) _ The government is considering the
resettlement of a community on this volcano-ravaged island, a
spokesman said Friday, a day after a memorial service marking the
anniversary of the deadliest eruption.
	   Herman Sergeant, spokesman for the Office of the Chief Minister,
said the government will make a decision about allowing people to
return to Salem, a community on the west-central part of the
39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) Caribbean island after
scientists finish a report on the activity at the Soufriere Hills
volcano.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of residents overflowed the Brades
Pentecostal Church for a memorial service for more than a dozen
people swept to their deaths by a sudden eruption last year.
	   ``What happened on June 25 of last year is still very vivid,''
said Sargeant. ``It has made a lasting impression, I think, on how
we live our lives. It taught us not to take nature lightly.''
	   When the volcano erupted without warning, many people were in an
exclusion zone _ an area designated unsafe by the government _
checking on their property or tending to livestock or crops left
behind.
	   Many were killed instantly by pyroclastic flows, the waves of
900-degree Farenheit (480 Celsius) gas, ash and rocks that sweep
down the mountainside at speeds of 100 mph (160 kph).
	   Two thirds of the island remains uninhabitable and most of the
original 11,000 residents have left. But the volcano has not had a
significant eruption since December and has been especially quiet
for the last two months, said Sergeant.

American woman completes around-the-world solo sail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HILO, Hawaii (AP) _ An almost 2-year solo journey around the
world in a sailboat ended Thursday when Karen Thorndike entered
Hilo Bay in Hawaii.
	   Thorndike, 55, was greeted by family and friends at the spot
where she began her 30,000-mile odyssey in October 1996.
	   After hugging her mother, Eva Scholl, who kept in touch with her
by e-mail and also met her at most ports of call, Thorndike said
she was looking forward to a shower and some sleep, having not
slept the final two days of her last leg from Tahiti to Hawaii.
	   ``It's wonderful to complete this,'' Thorndike said. ``Even
better to be in Hilo. I left here for the southern ocean. This ties
the knot.''
	   Thorndike had to be rescued by a British naval vessel off the
Falkland Islands in February 1997 and then caught the flu and had
to rest for two months.
	   Nonetheless, she said she was elated to achieve her goal.
	   ``If there's something you want to do, and you truly want to do
it, it's in your grasp,'' she said as workers around Hilo Harbor
honked horns and cheered her arrival.
	   Friends will help repair the 36-foot (10-meter) sailboat
``Amelia'' so she can continue to San Diego and then to her home
state, Washington.
	   Thorndike says she is the first woman to sail solo around the
world. Another woman makes the same claim, but she crossed from
ocean to ocean via canals, while Thorndike sailed around the major
capes.

Hamas founder said money raised abroad is for social services, not bombings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas
said Friday the money he raised in a recent tour of the Muslim
world was for for a network of social services and not bombings.
	   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who returned to Gaza this week after a
four-month fund-raising tour in the Middle East, said he had raised
billions of dollars, not for terror attacks as Israeli officials
have charged, but for the social welfare programs Hamas runs in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``We do not bring money in to hurt others but to serve the
people under occupation,'' Yassin told Channel Two in an interview.
	   The quadriplegic 62-year-old Yassin is Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's most formidable political rival. Hamas' power has grown
considerably since Yassin was released from an Israeli jail in
October.
	   During his tour of nearly a dozen capitals in the Muslim world,
Yassin was often treated like a head of state and raised millions
of dollars for Hamas. The group has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 to scuttle the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.

South African currency plunges to fresh low 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African currency
plunged nearly 6 percent against the U.S. dollar Friday, recording
its biggest single-day drop.
	   By the close of most business in Johannesburg, the rand was
quoted at 5.96 to the U.S. dollar, from 5.58 on Thursday. The rand
began the year at 4.86 to the U.S. dollar. It was a new ``Black
Friday'' on the South African currency market.
	   Analysts said the currency was under heavy attack from
international speculators Friday and the South African central bank
appeared to have insufficient reserves to intervene.
	   Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, attending a state dinner for
visiting French President Jacques Chirac, refused to comment on
reports that the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had
been asked to intervene in favor of the rand.
	   Traders in Johannesburg, London and New York insisted that the
British and U.S. central banks had been in the market, briefly
stabilizing the rand until speculators stepped up their onslaught
on the weakened currency.
	   The largest previous single-day drop in the rand was in 1996,
when it lost 21 South African cents to the U.S. dollar.
	   The rand plunged by 22 percent in 1996 after two years of
stability following South Africa's first all-race elections.
	   Currency analysts said the new crisis called for the government
of President Nelson Mandela to tighten fiscal policies, accelerate
privatization and liberalize labor markets.
	   It was unlikely new action would be announced over the weekend
or early next week.
	   By turning to other central banks, the South African Reserve
Bank gave ``the impression it has no reserves,'' said Andrew
Kinsey, a Johannesburg dealer. ``It's sort of the last straw type
of move.''

Iraq to cooperate with inspectors despite row over nerve gas 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to insert new quotes from party newspaper grafs 5-7
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep cooperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with dismantling its weapons programs, a top
Iraqi official said Friday, despite mounting tension over a report
that it fit missile warheads with nerve gas.
	   In conciliatory remarks, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a presidential
adviser and father of Iraq's chemical warfare program, said Iraq
did not want to create a crisis over the inspections.
	   ``Iraq will go on meeting commitments vis-a-vis the (U.N.)
Special Commission. It will not stop cooperation with it,''
al-Saadi said in an interview on state-run television.
	   He added that any new crisis would be the fault of U.N.
inspectors, because they are pressing the nerve gas issue.
	   The mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Party urged the government
Friday to consider breaking off cooperation with the U.N.
inspectorate.
	   Iraq ``can no longer tolerate'' the behavior of the U.N.
inspectors, Al-Thawrah newspaper said, in what seemed to be a
display of ``good cop, bad cop'' tactics towards the United
Nations.
	   Iraq would not allow such a vital issue as the lifting of the
international blockade to ``remain captive to the evil designs of
the United States and to a repulsive puppet like (chief U.N.
inspector) Richard Butler,'' the newspaper said.
	   Iraq's relations with the United Nations worsened after Butler
said tests by a U.S. Army laboratory left ``no doubt'' that Iraq
had put deadly VX gas in missile warheads.
	   Baghdad denied it did so.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the Security
Council does not move to end sanctions soon, and the Iraqi
government has repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   In recent months, Iraq had convinced some council members _
notably Russia, France and China _ that it had made significant
progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   The report by the U.S. Army laboratory raised doubts about
Iraq's claims and could set back efforts to complete inspections.

Holbrooke warns war in Kosovo could spread 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Tension in Kosovo could easily erupt into
an international war and spread to neighboring countries, U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke warned Friday.
	   ``If a peaceful solution is not found, the fighting that has
already occurred could easily escalate into an international war
that could easily cross borders and spread to Albania, Greece, and
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,'' Holbrooke told a rowdy
crowd during a university commencement address.
	   Holbrooke's comments came hours after he left Kosovo following
four days of meetings with Serbian leaders and Albanians seeking
independence in the southern province. The talks failed to produce
any settlement.
	   Another major clash between Serbian military forces and
Albanians could have tragic consequences, he warned, reiterating
statements he made in Pristina earlier Friday. NATO has stepped up
plans for intervention in the region, he said.
	   ``We seek a peaceful solution to an explosive situation,''
Holbrooke said. Fighting around the town of Kijevo provides a
dangerous flashpoint, he added.
	   During his talk Holbrooke discussed other conflicts in the
region. Disputes between Greece and Turkey and continuing
negotiations over the divided island of Cyprus should top the
region's agenda, he said.
	   ``We need to work more effectively here in this region,'' he
said. ``Far worse and more deadly conflicts have been resolved in
the recent past.''
	   Speaking over the boos and catcalls of students, Holbrooke said
Greece and Turkey should take their territorial disagreements over
Aegean islets before the European Court of Justice.
	   ``There is no inherent reason why Greece and Turkey should not
have a lasting peace and thriving relations,'' he said.
	   Turkey's unreasonable preconditions, including its demand of
recognition for the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus, brought the recent Cyprus talks to a standstill, Holbrooke
said.
	   He reiterated U.S. support for Cyprus' bid to join the European
Union. But he drew loud boos from the crowd when he said the U.S.
also supports Turkey's eventual EU accession.
	   Turkey has repeatedly said it would consider using force to stop
Cyprus from deploying a Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft system.
	   ``Any use of force would be a disaster to both countries,''
Holbrooke said.

U.N. health agency urges tightening-up of lab rules 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Health Organization is urging its 191
member countries to adopt an action plan to stop polio viruses
stored in laboratories spreading after the disease is eliminated,
the U.N. agency said Friday.
	   When the disease is eradicated and immunization eventually
stops, the entire global population will still face the risk of the
virus escaping from a laboratory unless regulations are tightened
up, the WHO said in a statement.
	   Reported numbers of cases of polio have plummeted from 35,000
annually ten years ago to around 4,000 a year now and the WHO is
hoping to eradicate the virus by the year 2000, the WHO said in a
statement.
	   But even after diseases like polio are eliminated, the viruses
may be kept in laboratories for research, vaccine manufacturing or
other purposes.
	   In 1977, less than a year after the last case was found of
smallpox, a death occurred in Britain as a result of a smallpox
virus escaping from a laboratory, the WHO statement said.
	   ``We have to avoid a replay of what happened when smallpox was
eradicated,'' said Dr. Bruce Aylward of the WHO's polio eradication
program.
	   ``Polio is not a highly visible disease like smallpox, so it
could spread silently.''
	   This week, the WHO asked member countries and health
organizations to comment on the proposed global plan for
high-security containment of polio viruses. The plan is proposed to
go into effect January 1 next year.
	   The strategy calls on governments to draw up a list of
laboratories where viruses might be present.
	   Laboratories with materials containing or likely to contain
polio virus will then need to decide between transferring them to
high security facilities or inactivating or destroying them.

World Cup: Japan coach quits after third loss WITH Sports-Soccer-Japan-Jamaica AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Though he gained respect by leading his team
to three one-goal losses in his nation's World Cup debut, Japan
coach Takeshi Okada considered his effort a failure and resigned
Friday.
	   Okada quit following a 2-1 loss to Jamaica which left Japan
without a point despite gritty earlier efforts in 1-0 losses to
powerhouses Argentina and Croatia.
	   ``I will quit as a professional coach,'' Okada said. ``When a
coach fails to achieve what he sets out to do, he should quit. It
is my responsibility. I was not able to draw the best out of the
players in this match.''
	   Japan was hoping for at least one victory to help justify its
role as co-host with South Korea of the 2002 tournament. It didn't
help that the rival Koreans did manage a point, tying Belgium in
their final game.
	   Japan was not embarrassed on the field by any means. Okada's
team proved in all three games that it can do everything except put
the ball in the net.
	   Japanese play on defense and in midfield was technically
competent and sometimes masterful, but the team lacked the quality
striker who could finish off the chances and left France '98 with
only one goal _ Masashi Nakayama's strike in the 74th minute
against Jamaica.
	   ``Today the team was much too slow in attacking the Jamaican
goal and made too many needless passes,'' Okada said. ``Even though
they put 100 percent effort into it.''
	   Jamaica coach Rene Simoes said Okada had nothing to be ashamed
of.
	   ``I think Japan should feel very proud as well,'' Simoes said.
``They played three wonderful games _ as Jamaica did.''

Clinton, at Chinese archeological find, ponders immortality With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix slug to remove US
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Making his way among the terra cotta
warriors buried two millennia ago to protect a Chinese emperor in
the afterlife, U.S. President Bill Clinton wondered aloud about
mortality.
	   He reached out and touched the face of one clay bodyguard, whose
fierce expression was unlike all the others. Each of the roughly
7,000 ancient soldiers and officers _ life-size and so carefully
crafted they appear ready for battle _ were modeled after real
warriors, according to legend.
	   ``Whenever I experience something like this I feel a little more
humble,'' Clinton said Friday while touring the excavation site.
``And I also feel reminded that you have this limited amount of
time on Earth and you have to do what you can to try to help people
make the most of it.
	   After a day of sightseeing in and around Xi'an, the president
went to Beijing on Friday night to prepare for a meeting Saturday
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Clinton's nine-day tour of
China is the first visit to the nation by an American president
this decade.
	   The gray clay soldiers, representing Emperor Qin Shi Huang's
imperial guards, were buried with an array of real bronze weapons,
chariots and terra cotta horses to carry them to war. Earlier
practices called for human sacrifices when emperors died.
	   Qin, by 221 BC, had founded the first unified feudal empire in
Chinese history, creating a central government, a code of law and
formalizing the written language. China is named after him.
	   ``We ... don't imagine as he did that we could preserve whatever
earthly power we have after death,'' Clinton said.
	   The Clinton family, including wife Hillary, daughter Chelsea and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham, were allowed into the excavation pit
for a close look that few tourists are allowed.
	   Later, in a museum gift shop, Clinton and Chelsea couldn't
resist buying a replica warrior head, but only after bargaining
down the price from about dlrs 225 to dlrs 45.

Reggae Boyz dance for real 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECASTS with Friday's games; WILL be UPDATED.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Reggae Boyz finally had reason to dance.
	   Getting a pair of goals from Theodore Whitmore, World Cup cult
favorite Jamaica scored its first World Cup victory Friday, beating
hard-luck Japan 2-1 in the final match for both teams.
	   Argentina toppled Croatia 1-0 to win Group H, but it was the
match between the World Cup debutantes in Lyon that had many
captivated.
	   ``Did the road really have to end that quick?'' midfielder
Fitzroy Simpson said. ``I'm really ecstatic at the moment. I'm over
the moon that we can actually leave the tournament on a high.''
	   The road also ended for Japanese coach Takeshi Okada, who
resigned after the third loss.
	   Argentina's victory sent the South Americans into the second
round next Tuesday against most likely Colombia or England in
Saint-Etienne. Croatia will travel to Bordeaux on Tuesday and
likely face Romania.
	   The final pairings were to be set Friday night when England
played Colombia in Lens and Romania took on Tunisia in Saint-Denis.
	   Security officials in Lens were on heightened alert, wary of the
riots that surrounded England's opening match in Marseille.
	   Ever since they qualified in November as only the third
Caribbean team to reach the finals, Jamaica's ``Reggae Boyz'' were
nearly the longest of longshots but also a fascination among many
fans.
	   ``I am very proud of them,'' said coach Rene Simoes, a Brazilian
who controversially cobbled together a team with several foreign
residents who claimed Jamaican ancestry. ``And I'm sure Jamaica
must be. We don't have to be ashamed of anything. Let's go for the
future and 2002.''
	   Their 3-1 loss to Croatia in their opener and 5-0 drubbing by
Argentina ended their second-round aspirations, and dimmed slightly
their following.
	   But Friday's victory gave them only the Caribbean's second
victory in the World Cup, 60 years after Cuba's 2-1 victory over
Romania in Toulouse, France in the 1938 World Cup.
	   Whitmore scored in the 40th and 54th minutes, keeping the
Jamaicans from finishing last in the 32-team field.
	   Whitmore scored from 12 meters, seizing on a loose ball created
when teammate Stephen Malcolm and Japanese defender Yutaka Akita
collided in the penalty area.
	   He scored his second after taking a ball from Simpson down the
right wing, cutting inside defender Noria Omura and driving a low
15-meter shot inside the right post.
	   Japan, which lost 1-0 to both Argentina and Croatia, hit the
post and forced goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence into several saves in the
second half. It finally scored when Naoki Soma's long ball was
headed by Wagner Lopes to Nakayama, whose one-timer from 8 meters
easily beat Lawrence.
	   The goal saved Japan some face, avoiding a possible last-place
finish. It wasn't enough to stop Okada from throwing himself on
soccer's metaphorical sword.
	   ``I will quit as professional coach,'' Okada said. ``When a
coach fails to achieve what he sets out to do, he should quit. It
is my responsibility. I was not able to draw the best out of the
players in this match.''
	   Okada was the fourth coach to lose his job at the end of the
World Cup campaign.
	   In Bordeaux, the Argentines made it to the second round as the
only team not to concede a goal, and even counted on one of their
defenders for some offense.
	   Mauricio Hector Pineda ran onto a deflected ball from Ariel
Ortega in the 36th minute and paused before beating goalkeeper
Drazen Ladic.
	   ``This was a well-deserved victory against the toughest team in
the group,'' Argentina's coach Daniel Passarella said.
	   Argentina controlled the possession and had the better of play.
	   Marcelo Gallardo forced Ladic into a dramatic save in the 45th
minute, blasting a free kick into the wall before chasing down the
rebound and getting another shot at goal.
	   Defender Roberto Ayala slalomed through the defense in the 71st
and curled a right-footer just wide of the post.

World Cup: Lens braces for English invasion AP Special Correspondent

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Ticketless English fans, desperate to see a
do-or-die World Cup match with Colombia on Friday, heaved bottles
at riot police who moved them back from the stadium and tried in
vain to confiscate their vast reserves of beer.
	   Police charged repeatedly, wrestling three men to the ground and
arresting them. A tense calm fell over this little northern
industrial town, whose 35,000 inhabitants were nearly outnumbered
by Englishmen.
	   Lens, with its bars and businesses closed, took on the air of
the West Bank on a bad day. Helmeted riot troops lined streets,
carrying plastic shields and tear gas guns. A column of police vans
and an armored truck parked by the train station.
	   In nearby Lille, where the channel tunnel train from London
stops, fans scuffled with local thugs, and at least three
Englishmen were arrested. Hundreds were turned back at the border
as suspected troublemakers.
	   As the start of the match in Lens approached, police and fans
clashed in hit-and-run skirmishes with slight injuries and about a
dozen arrests. Riot police used dogs to help subdue some of the
most violent visitors.

Iraq to cooperate with inspectors despite row over nerve gas remarks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to CLARIFY in 10th graf that al-Saadi made the
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep cooperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with dismantling its weapons programs, a top
Iraqi official said Friday, despite mounting tension over a report
that it fit missile warheads with nerve gas.
	   In conciliatory remarks, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a presidential
adviser and father of Iraq's chemical warfare program, said Iraq
did not want to create a crisis over the inspections.
	   ``Iraq will go on meeting commitments vis-a-vis the (U.N.)
Special Commission. It will not stop cooperation with it,''
al-Saadi said in an interview on state-run television.
	   Other official outlets for government opinion maintained a hard
line.
	   Iraq's ruling Arab Socialist Ba'th Party official newspaper said
Friday Iraq ``can no longer tolerate'' the behavior of UN arms
inspectors.
	   Iraq had not come to a final decision about whether to
``continue contact'', it said, but this would be made ``at the
appropriate time'' .
	   Al-Thawrah said Iraq would not allow such a vital issue as the
lifting of the international blockade to ``remain captive to the
evil designs of the United States and to a repulsive puppet like
Richard Butler,'' the chief U.N. weapons inspector.
	   Iraq's relations with the United Nations worsened after Butler
said tests by a U.S. Army laboratory left ``no doubt'' that Iraq
had put deadly VX gas in missile warheads. Baghdad denied it did
so.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the Security
Council does not move to end sanctions soon, and the Iraqi
government has repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action.
	   Al-Saadi added that any new crisis, however, would be the fault
of U.N. inspectors, because they are pressing the nerve gas issue.

Prince Charles takes Harry to France for World Cup soccer

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles took the royal family's major
soccer fan _ Prince Harry _ to France on Friday to cheer for the
England team in its World Cup game against Colombia at Sens.
	   Charles and his 13-year-old son boarded a Eurostar train at
London's Waterloo Station for their first trip through the Channel
Tunnel.
	   The princes traveled to Lille in a first class car with other
travelers, but were accompanied by police bodyguards and three
staff members. They finished the journey to Sens by car.
	   They had earlier sent the team a message saying, ``We will be
cheering you on from the stands,'' and it was passed around the
team during lunch at a Lens hotel.
	   ``It was handed to all the players and was very much
appreciated,'' said Football Association spokesman, David Davies.
``We receive messages from the prime minister regularly, but it's
the first time I can remember receiving a good luck message from
members of the royal family _ and it was very well received,'' he
said.
	   The princes are spending the night with freinds in France after
the game. Charles flies to Portugal on Saturday for a brief
official visit and Harry returns to England.
	   Other royals have already ventured to France to cheer on England
and Scotland. Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, watched Scotland tie Norway, his older brother Prince Andrew
watched England defeat Tunisia, and Prince Philip and his grandson
Peter Phillips, son of Princess Anne, watched Brazil defeat
Scotland.

Angry youths riot over Algerian singer's slaying; thousands view body 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; UPDATES with more details on rioting, color
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Youths rioted in the regional Berber
capital of Tizi-Ouzou on Friday, smashing windows, damaging cars
and writing anti-government graffiti after the slaying of popular
Berber singer Lounes Matoub.
	   The slaying Thursday of Matoub, blamed on Muslim militants,
sparked a widespread outpouring of emotion in the eastern
mountainous region that has been critical both of the insurgency
and the military-backed government in Algiers.
	   Matoub's assassination also generated stronger opposition to a
law that takes effect next week, making Arabic the only official
language and banning the official use of French and Berber.
	   It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist during the
6-year-old insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   Thousands of Berbers, many of them sobbing, viewed the body of
the 42-year-old singer wrapped in a blood-spattered cloth at a
hospital morgue in Tizi-Ouzou, about 100 kms (60 miles) east of
Algiers.
	   Several mourners fainted before the body of Matoub, his head
pierced by three bullets.
	   As a few army troops stood by, hundreds of enraged youths ran
through the streets of the regional capital, smashing windows and
windshields and writing hostile slogans on the wall against
President Liamine Zeroual and Prime Minister Ahmed Ouayahia. They
tore down Arabic-language signs to protest the language law.
	   The youths dispersed by late afternoon and no arrests were
reported.
	   Reacting to the death of Matoub, an impassioned defender of
Berber culture, the opposition Socialist Forces Front called on the
public to reject the so-called ``Arabization law.''
	   A general strike in the Berber region was called by the Berber
Cultural Movement for Sunday, the same day Matoub is to be buried
in his native village of Beni Douala.
	   The government sent its ministers of health, communication and
culture to give their condolences to the Matoub's family. ``It's
too little, too late!'' cried protesters who stoned a state-owned
gas station in Tizi-Ouzou.
	   Matoub was killed at a fake roadblock outside the nearby town of
Oued Aissi. Witnesses said his wife and two sisters-in-law were
also wounded in the attack and were hospitalized.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   Matoub went to France after his release and remained a vocal
opponent of both the Algerian government and the militants. He
returned to Algeria earlier this month.
	   Amnesty International and the French human rights group MRAP on
Friday expressed their ``profound emotion and indignation'' at the
``odious assassination'' and called for a rally near the Eiffel
Tower on Sunday.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government in the
former French colony scrapped second-round parliamentary elections
in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win
the balloting.

Holbrooke leaves Kosovo without peace formula Albanians; ADDS Macedonia border incidents. 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: AMs. UPDATES with Afanasyevsky quotes, KLA kidnapping three
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said
Friday his four days of diplomacy in Yugoslavia yielded no magic
peace formula and warned that NATO stepped up plans for
intervention in secessionist Kosovo.
	   Both Serbian security forces and Albanian militants fighting for
independence in the southern province should be aware that their
next major clash could have ``tragic consequences,'' Holbrooke said
in Pristina as Yugoslav fighter jets screamed overhead.
	   Arriving in Kosovo following talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Holbrooke held Friday a lengthy meeting with
Adem Demaci, an Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for
advocating Kosovo's independence.
	   Unlike the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, Demaci advocates armed struggle for independence. Demaci
declined to comment on his talks with Holbrooke.
	   Still, Holbrooke said he does not consider Demaci a link to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist fighters who increasingly
threaten the Serbian security forces' hold on the restive province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   More than 300 people have been killed since March, when Serbian
police began a crackdown against the KLA separatists. Foreign
powers fear the increasingly violent conflict could flare into a
wider Balkan war involving neighboring Macedonia and Albania.
	   Holbrooke also saw Rugova before departing today for Athens,
Greece.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke told reporters.
	   He said a diplomatic corps from dozens of countries will likely
arrive in Kosovo in the next few days to help ensure peace in the
region.
	   In Belgrade, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky told Russian journalists that Milosevic agreed to
accept an international observer force. He said the force would aim
at restarting dialogue between Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Afanasyevsky, who left for Moscow Friday after meeting
Milosevic, criticized NATO member countries for sending ``an
incorrect message to the Albanian terrorists that they can do as
they please'' with their demonstration of air power.
	   Serbs have sharply criticized Holbrooke for appearing for photos
Wednesday with KLA fighters in the western Kosovo town of Junik,
surrounded by Serb security forces.
	   On Friday, Macedonian Defence Ministry spokesman Petar Atanasov
accused Yugoslav fight jets of violating Macedonian air space twice
on June 19 and once Tuesday.
	   Atanasov also said five groups of Albanians were caught trying
to smuggle weapons from Albania to Kosovo, passing through
Macedonia.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of Kosovo. Road
travel is increasingly dangerous, with KLA and Serb police
checkpoints blocking normal routes. Daily gun battles are waged for
control of key arteries.
	   The Serbs' Media Center said Friday Albanian militants kidnapped
three ethnic Albanians, who told colleagues that the Yugoslav army
would increase safety in Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, reported Serb
forces shelling three villages in the Decane area Friday. One
Albanian wounded in the fighting.
	   Holbrooke noted that fighting between the KLA and Serbian
security forces is escalating around Kijevo, a key crossroads on
the main east-west road between Pristina and the western,
Serb-dominated town of Pec. The village is surrounded by KLA
fighters who are themselves surrounded by Serb police checkpoints.
	   ``There is no question that the Serb security forces with their
overwhelming preponderance of power could force open the (KLA)
checkpoint in the road'' to Kijevo, said Holbrooke. ``There is
equally no question that such an action would have tragic
consequences.''

U.N. health agency urges tightening-up of lab rules 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Health Organization is urging its 191
member countries to adopt an action plan to stop polio viruses
stored in laboratories from spreading after the disease is
eliminated, the U.N. agency said Friday.
	   When the disease is eradicated and immunization eventually
stops, the entire global population will still face the risk of the
virus escaping from a laboratory unless regulations are tightened
up, the WHO said in a statement.
	   Reported numbers of cases of polio have plummeted from 35,000
annually ten years ago to around 4,000 a year now and the WHO is
hoping to eradicate the virus by the year 2000, the WHO said in a
statement.
	   But even after diseases like polio are eliminated, the viruses
may be kept in laboratories for research, vaccine manufacturing or
other purposes.
	   In 1977, less than a year after the last case was found of
smallpox, a death occurred in Britain as a result of a smallpox
virus escaping from a laboratory, the WHO statement said.
	   ``We have to avoid a replay of what happened when smallpox was
eradicated,'' said Dr. Bruce Aylward of the WHO's polio eradication
program.
	   ``Polio is not a highly visible disease like smallpox, so it
could spread silently.''
	   This week, the WHO asked member countries and health
organizations to comment on the proposed global plan for
high-security containment of polio viruses. The plan, proposed to
go into effect in 1999, asks governments to draw up a list of
laboratories where viruses might be.
	   Laboratories with materials containing or likely to contain
polio virus will then need to decide between transferring them to
high security facilities, inactivating them or destroying them.

Scattered clashes, tension around England-Colombia match 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with 12 Lille arrests, five Englanders deported

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this tense northern town that was
under a tight security clampdown around the evening's
England-Colombia match.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, clashes between Lens-bound English
fans and local youths raised tensions there. Police were boosting
their forces in Lille to face crowds after the match, seen as among
the highest risk games of a World Cup struck repeatedly by
violence.
	   Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were to attend the
make-or-break match, in which England needs at least a point to
advance to the second round.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready for a new round of World Cup violence. English
police helped spot known hooligans.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train in
Lens or nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed.
Many brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. No
injuries were reported.
	   The standoff eased, but the high number of drunken fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.)
match.
	   ``No screen to watch the match, no beer, police everywhere. What
do you French take us for?'' asked John, a fan in a wig with the
red, white and blue of the English flag, who refused to give his
last name. ``People just came here to have fun, not to be
savages.''
	   One hundred Colombian fans arrived by train Friday afternoon,
carrying their national flag with the word ``peace'' written over
it.
	   But most locals were lying low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   In Lille a dozen people, six English fans and the rest local
youths, were arrested in clashes there. Five English nationals
arrested Thursday were deported, officials said.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in overnight clashes in northern France
and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   As many as 30,000 English fans were expected _ many without
tickets _ to cheer their team on.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday. A
French policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a
coma.
	   Authorities feared more of the same, or even worse.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   As of early Friday evening, however, Germans were not visible in
the city. German authorities had stepped up border checks of
France-bound travelers, turning back some suspected hooligans.
	   Lens officials have banned the sale or possession of alcohol on
the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday. But the ban does
not extend to surrounding towns.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes.
	   A known English soccer hooligan, Paul Dodd, from Carlisle, was
detained for questioning Friday as he was about to board a ferry in
Dover, police said.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured. English
fans have clashed with, or were attacked by, French North African
youths from poor suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

Relatives meet freed prisoners with feelings of joy, sorrow 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Israel-Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ For the relatives of the Lebanese
prisoners released here Friday, the long-awaited reunions were a
matter of joy and sorrow.
	   The fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts
of the 55 prisoners were overjoyed to see their loved ones.
	   But they were also sad that their beloveds had lost such large
chunks of their lives in fruitless detention. Some of those freed
had spent up to 13 years in prison on suspicion of supporting
guerrilla attacks against Israeli forces.
	   ``I feel like I was born again today for seeing my son freed
after 12 years in jail,'' said a mother in her 50s who declined to
be named.
	   Thousands turned out to welcome the prisoners as they crossed
from Israeli-occupied south Lebanon into Lebanon proper in buses
provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Such was
the crowd and traffic that it took the convoy an hour to travel
what is normally a 10-minute drive to the mansion of Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri in the port of Sidon.
	   ``We will do whatever we can to blend the freed prisoners into
society and help them in recognition of what they offered to the
nation,'' Hariri told the relatives.
	   The prime minister hosted a meal for the prisoners, in sharp
contrast to previous releases when the returning detainees have
been met by official indifference.
	   One bearded prisoner was overcome by the heat and fainted. A
woman weeping with her son also required medical help.
	   The prisoners belonged to the two main Shiite Muslim groups,
Hezbollah and Amal, and to the communist party and other leftist
factions.
	   Several said their political committment were as strong as ever,
if not stronger.
	   Hussein Murad was 20 when he was captured fighting for Amal in
1990. He said interrogators tortured him in the Israeli-controlled
detention center of Khiam in the occupied zone. But he still wants
to fight.
	   Jaafar Deeb, 28, said his eight years in detention drove him to
want to join the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, the most active group.
	   ``I was not a Hezbollah fighter before my arrest. But now I want
to be one because they are sincere about liberating the country,''
he said.

Hamas founder said money raised abroad is for social services, not bombings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas
said Friday the money he raised in a recent tour of the Muslim
world was for a network of social services and not bombings.
	   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who returned to Gaza this week after a
four-month fund-raising tour in the Middle East, said he had raised
billions of dollars, not for terror attacks as Israeli officials
have charged, but for social welfare programs Hamas runs in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``We do not bring money in to hurt others but to serve the
people under occupation,'' Yassin told Channel Two in an interview.
	   The 62-year-old quadriplegic sheikh is Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's most formidable political rival. Hamas' power has grown
considerably since Yassin was released from an Israeli jail in
October.
	   During his tour of nearly a dozen capitals in the Muslim world,
Yassin often was treated like a head of state and raised millions
of dollars for Hamas. The group has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 to scuttle the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.

U.N. health agency urges tightening lab rules 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Health Organization is urging its 191
member countries to adopt an action plan to keep polio viruses
stored in laboratories from spreading after the disease is
eliminated, the U.N. agency said Friday.
	   When the disease is eradicated and immunization eventually
stops, the entire global population will still face the risk of the
virus escaping from a laboratory unless regulations are tightened,
according to a statement by the WHO.
	   The number of reported cases of polio has plummeted from 35,000
annually 10 years ago to around 4,000 a year now, and the WHO is
hoping to eradicate the virus by the year 2000, the statement said.
	   But even after diseases like polio are eliminated, the viruses
may be kept in laboratories for research, vaccine manufacturing or
other purposes.
	   In 1977, less than a year after the last case was found of
smallpox, a death occurred in Britain as a result of a smallpox
virus escaping from a laboratory, according to the statement.
	   ``We have to avoid a replay of what happened when smallpox was
eradicated,'' Dr. Bruce Aylward said of the WHO's polio eradication
program. ``Polio is not a highly visible disease like smallpox, so
it could spread silently.''
	   This week, the WHO asked member countries and health
organizations to comment on the proposed global plan for
high-security containment of polio viruses. The plan is proposed to
go into effect Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The strategy calls on governments to draw up a list of
laboratories where viruses might be present. Laboratories with
materials containing or likely to contain polio virus would then
need to decide between transferring them to high security
facilities or inactivating or destroying them.

Catholics unite, Protestants feud in Northern Ireland election With NIreland-Results 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout for AMs 
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Election returns for Northern
Ireland's new cross-community Assembly, the cornerstone of the
Belfast peace agreement, showed Friday that enough
compromise-minded Protestant politicians would be elected to make
it work.
	   With only a third of the 108 seats in the new Belfast Assembly
declared as darkness fell, political analysts projected that the
major Protestant party in the pro-agreement camp, the Ulster
Unionists, would win the most seats in Thursday's election.
	   Projections suggested that the Ulster Unionists should hold 30
or 31 seats when final results are declared Saturday, despite
seeing their share of first-preference votes fall to an
unprecedented low of 21.3 percent.
	   Achieving 30 seats or more will be crucial in an Assembly where
Protestants overall are likely to hold at least 60 seats. Majority
support from both Protestant and Catholic blocs will be required
for the passage of key decisions.
	   And the balance of power on the Protestant side of the house
looks uncomfortably narrow. At several count centers, supporters of
the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party taunted and
heckled Ulster Unionists in public displays of how bitterly the
Protestant divisions run.
	   Paisley, who has led opposition to the agreement, insisted that
his party and other Protestants opposed to compromise _ including a
few dissidents elected under the Ulster Unionist banner _ would
make life impossible for Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the
figure most likely to lead the Assembly.
	   ``They thought they had us hamstrung and buried,'' Paisley
crowed in his rural North Antrim power base, where he topped the
poll with 10,590 _ and his son, Ian Jr, won a second seat right
behind him.
	   ``They thought they had us hamstrung and buried,'' Paisley
crowed in his North Antrim power base, where he topped the poll
with 10,590 _ and his son, Ian Jr, won a second seat right behind
him.
	   Paisley's party was projected to win about 22 seats _ too few on
its own to block anything.
	   In a symbolic side development, the north's major
Catholic-supported party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party,
appeared likely to attract more first-preference votes than the
Ulster Unionists to finish on top of the popular vote for the first
time in Northern Ireland history.
	   However the SDLP was considered likely to win just 22 seats,
while the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, its militant rival for
Catholic votes, would hold its ground with about 17 percent of
first-preference votes and 17 to 18 seats. The ``proportional
representation'' system allows voters to list their second, third
and lower choices on the ballot paper.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was swamped by journalists in
Belfast City Hall when he became the first politician elected in
the city, topping the poll in his Catholic west Belfast power base.
Sinn Fein was expected to take four of the six seats there.
	   But John Hume, the SDLP leader credited with bringing Adams in
from the political wilderness five years ago, saw his moderate
Catholic party fare more strongly elsewhere. He topped the poll in
his native Londonderry with 12,582 votes.
	   Hume reacted angrily to the possibility that anti-agreement
Protestants would try to obstruct the Assembly's most important
first function _ the appointment of a 12-member administration from
several parties.
	   The agreement specifies that this administration, called the
Executive, must be appointed quickly and decide by October how to
cooperate formally with the neighboring Irish Republic. That
element is essential to both Hume and Adams, who sold the agreement
to their supporters as a stepping stone to eventual Irish unity.
	   Hume said Paisley and his allies were ``in extreme danger of
undermining completely the rights of the unionist people as a
whole.''

Head of U.S. ticket agency placed under formal investigation 
</HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation Friday _ one step short of
being charged _ for alleged fraud, judicial sources said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, faced an investigation for fraud, falsely reporting
a crime and ``deception over quality and quantity of an offer.''
	   Knittle was placed under judicial controls, preventing him from
leaving the country, the sources said on customary anonymity.
	   The legal action came after the PSI reported the theft of up to
15,000 World Cup tickets on the night of June 17 at its office in
the upscale 16th district of western Paris.
	   World Cup officials later reported seeing the tickets' owners
attending a match.
	   During questioning, Knittle contended he forgot to tell
authorities that not all the tickets at the office were stolen.
	   Three other PSI employees arrested in the case were released
without charges.
	   PSI had already been under investigation after South American
customers complained they did not received tickets they paid for.

Patriarch says now not the time to restore Russian monarchy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It would be premature to restore the Russian
monarchy now, the Russian Orthodox church patriarch said Friday.
	   ``Russia's people are not ready for it now,'' Alexy II said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Polls indicate a majority of Russians agree with him.
	   Alexy said he did not rule out that ``after a while Russia might
come to it.''
	   But during the Soviet era, three generations grew up denouncing
the monarchy and those memories have not yet faded, he said.
	   The Bolsheviks executed Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, on July
17, 1918, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.
	   Nicholas, his family and servants are to be buried in St.
Petersburg next month, six years after their remains were found
near the house in which they were shot.

World Cup: Lalas and Agoos join mutiny against U.S. coach, fines planned tighten AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with new material, recasts, edits to
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   PORNIC, France (AP) _ Team turmoil quickly followed America's
debacle in the World Cup, with more shots at coach Steve Sampson
and promises of fines for the most outspoken players.
	   Alexi Lalas and Jeff Agoos joined Tab Ramos Friday in saying
they wouldn't play for the national team again as long as Sampson
remains as coach. Sampson, in turn, said he deserved to stay on and
launched into an attack on Ramos.
	   ``Here is in an individual I essentially held a spot open for
eight, nine months,'' Sampson said. ``I played Tab in the most
critical match, against Iran. Tab was responsible for the first
goal against us.''
	   Players began heading out early Friday, just hours after the
United States completed an 0-3 performance with a 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia.
	   Lalas, looking worn, was among those who left shortly after
dawn.
	   ``For me, the disappointment didn't hit until after yesterday's
game, 'til it was over. It was over too soon,'' he said.
	   Lalas, a star for the team during the 1994 World Cup, was one of
three players on the 22-man roster who didn't see a minute this
time. Agoos was another.
	   ``I'm definitely not coming back,'' Lalas said.
	   Following the opening 2-0 loss to Germany, veterans on the team
complained Sampson used too many World Cup rookies. The dissension
grew after Iran eliminated the Americans with a 2-1 victory.
	   ``The basic corps of players did a tremendous amount of work on
and off the field for many, many years,'' Lalas said. ``The payoff
was the World Cup. So I think there's definitely a sense that some
off us were let down.''
	   Agoos, who saw the most action among U.S. players in World Cup
qualifying, also went on the attack against Sampson.
	   ``My viewpoints and his viewpoints are at polar opposites on how
a players should be treated,'' he said.
	   Asked to give an example of how Sampson let him down, Agoos
cited the Yugoslavia game.
	   ``Yesterday, he told me I 'was in his mind' to go into the game
... Again, everything was the opposite,'' he said.
	   Sampson noted that everyone had been told their World Cup roles
more than a month before the tournament. He said Lalas knew he
would play only if there was an injury to Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope
or David Regis, the three starting defenders.
	   ``Maybe there's a sense of frustration that international
careers are coming to an end and they needed a scapegoat,'' Sampson
said. ``It's unfair it was pointed at me, the individual who stuck
with them for a long time.''
	   Without identifying individuals or amounts, Sampson said players
will be penalized for ``bringing the federation in disrepute.''
	   ``There will be fines imposed against those individuals who
spoke out against the federation as a way of directing a message to
younger players that this is not professional behavior,'' Sampson
said.
	   Sampson said part of the problem was the same group of players
had been on the team for a lengthy time.
	   ``You earn the right to represent your country every time you
step on the field,'' he said. ``No one should feel they have the
right to represent their country.''
	   Lalas said he had no regrets about his actions.
	   ``I feel completely at ease with what I've said and the way I've
handled myself,'' Lalas said. ``That's part of being a leader, and
I believe in American soccer.''
	   U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg said after
Thursday's game he will decide Sampson's fate by mid-August.
	   The coach said he's comfortable with the job he's done, but also
said the USSF's new job as director of its 2010 project _ to win
the World Cup by then _ was intriguing.

Graf ousted by Zvereva
Eds: UPDATES with play called off for the day, Seles leading after
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf had beaten Natasha Zvereva
17 straight times, starting with a 6-0, 6-0 wipeout in the 1988
French Open final.
	   Zvereva ended the jinx Friday with a stunning upset that may
also have ended Graf's Wimbledon career.
	   Zvereva, a doubles specialist from Belarus who had won only
three sets against Graf in all their previous meetings, beat the
fourth-seeed German 6-4, 7-5 in a third-round match.
	   Graf, a seven-time Wimbledon champion who was making her 13th
appearance at the All England Club, was non-committal Friday about
whether she would be back next year.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' she said. ``I definitely
couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play again. Hopefully,
I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy myself. But I've
learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   The 29-year-old Graf revealed this week that she considered
retirement two months ago after continued problems with injuries.
	   She broke down in tears at a news conference Monday, saying she
was overcome just to be back at Wimbledon again.
	   She showed little emotion Wednesday, offering a quick wave with
her left hand as she walked off Centre Court.
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   Graf was competing in only her fifth tournament of the year due
to knee and hamstring injuries.
	   Her lack of match play showed as she struggled from the outset
in the rain-delayed Centre Court match.
	   Graf double faulted six times, had trouble returning serve and
was kept off balance by Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   ``Every time I go on the court I start playing nervously in the
beginning. Clearly it's a lack of matches. Every time it was
important I didn't play the points well at all.''
	   Zvereva did almost everything right.
	   ``It's by far the best match of my life,'' she said. ``I was
mentally tough on every point. I dont think that's ever happened
before. I can drift in and drift out of matches easily. This time I
stayed with it.''
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
one-sided in tennis.
	   ``I don't know if this was the 18th or 20 or 25, but I've done
it,'' Zvereva said. ``Wow! I don't know how, but I've done it.''
	   Recalling the 1988 French Open humiliation, Zvereva said, ``I
was so nervous you couldn't even describe it. ... I beat myself to
it, before she even did.''
	   Shattered by that defeat, Zvereva never has reached a Grand Slam
singles final since, although she has excelled in doubles.
	   After Friday's victory, she said players teased her in the
locker room about holding her concentration throughout the match.
	   ``I had to go down on my knees and crawl into (my cubicle)
because they were giving me so much funny looks and stuff,'' she
said. ``It was really quite embarrassing.''
	   Zvereva broke serve in the first game, saved the only break
point of the set against her in the next game and never let Graf
get into a groove.
	   The two stayed on serve in the second set until the 11th game
when Zvereva got the decisive break for a 6-5 lead.
	   With Zvereva serving for the match, Graf failed to convert two
break points at 15-40 and the match ended with a backhand return
into the net.
	   Zvereva said Graf congratulated her with the words ``By the way,
very nice match.''
	   ``Coming from her right away from the match, it was very
important,'' she said. ``Plus she looked into my eyes which is even
better. That meant a lot to me.''
	   Showers delayed the start of Friday's play by 3 hours, 50
minutes, and there were several more rain delays later in the day.
Only eight of 21 scheduled singles matches were completed.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento, while No. 6 Monica Seles was leading Yayuk Basuki 6-2 when
the match was suspended.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1; while No.
14 Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0
third-round win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion Pete Sampras never got on court for his
potentially tricky third-round match against Sweden's Thomas
Enqvist.
	   Venus Williams, meanwhile, is gearing up for a Wimbledon
showdown against the ``juggernaut'' _ her best friend and kid
sister, Serena.
	   The Williams sisters beat their second-round opponents in
straight sets Thursday _ each conceding only three games _ and are
on course for a high-powered meeting in the fourth round.
	   Venus downed Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2, a victory that featured
the fastest serve ever recorded in women's tennis. Serena defeated
fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Venus watched the first set of her sister's match on Centre
Court, then walked over to Court 1 to play her own.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' she said. ``I guess you
have to become the nemesis.''

Death toll from Russian stadium collapse rises to 26 of mourning.

Eds: RAISES death toll to 26 from 23; UPDATES with details on day
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a stadium accident in southern
Russia rose to 26 on Friday, when four more people died from
injuries received when a concrete balcony collapsed onto a crowded
stadium floor.
	   Thirty-eight others were injured Thursday when the 50-meter
(160-foot) long balcony packed with more than 100 people _ mostly
children _ fell 5 meters (16 feet) onto the floor at the Russian
National Freestyle Wrestling Competition in the city of Nalchik.
	   The balcony was a standing-room-only area for non-paying
spectators, which meant most of those on the balcony were children
who couldn't afford tickets.
	   A 12-year-old boy was among those killed and two children were
in a hospital intensive care unit.
	   A commission from the Federal Security Service was investigating
the incident, said a duty officer at the regional branch of the
Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   So far, authorities believe the collapse was caused by a fault
in the construction of the stadium, which was completed four years
ago, the officer said.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers (850 miles) south of
Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkariya republic. About 2,500 people were
watching the competition.
	   The republic observed a day of mourning Friday and buried the
victims. State flags were lowered and all entertainment events were
canceled.
	   The government planned to pay 20,000 rubles (about dlrs 3,000)
each to the families of the dead, the republic's premier Khusein
Chechenov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Parliament approved a plan Friday to
reduce the budget deficit and increase spending, following an
unexpected surplus in revenue generated by a newly introduced tax
on goods and services.
	   The lion's share of the extra 6.2 billion kuna (dlrs 984
million) will go towards reducing the envisioned 1998 budget
deficit of 2 billion kuna (dlrs 33 million) and paying state
pensions, employees, and health funds.
	   In January, the government levied a 22 percent value added tax
on all goods and services, causing the increase in revenue to the
planned 1998 budget of 36.8 billion kuna (dlrs 6.4 billion).
	   The readjustment of the budget was approved by 68 members of
127-seat parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by President
Franjo Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Opposition parties, who had most of their amendment proposals
rejected, boycotted the vote.

Scattered clashes, tension around England-Colombia match Prince Harry attending, TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new arrest figures, confirms Prince Charles and
By JEAN-MARIE GODARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this northern town under a tight
security clampdown around an England-Colombia match attended by
Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local French North African youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match, seen as among the highest
risk games of a World Cup struck repeatedly by violence.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready. English police helped spot known hooligans.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train
from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed. Many
brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. No
injuries were reported. By Friday night, 11 people remained in
custody for violence and 11 others for public drunkenness.
	   The high number of drunken English fans in this town of 30,000
kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.) match.
	   ``No screen to watch the match, no beer, police everywhere. What
do you French take us for?'' asked John, a fan in a wig with the
red, white and blue of the English flag, who refused to give his
last name. ``People just came here to have fun, not to be
savages.''
	   One hundred Colombian fans arrived by train Friday afternoon,
carrying their national flag with the word ``peace'' written over
it.
	   But most locals were lying low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   In Lille a dozen people, six English fans and the rest local
youths, were arrested in clashes there. Five English nationals
arrested Thursday were deported, officials said.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in overnight clashes in northern France
and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   As many as 30,000 English fans were expected _ many without
tickets _ to cheer their team on.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday. A
French policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a
coma.
	   Authorities feared more of the same, or even worse.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   As of early Friday evening, however, Germans were not visible in
the city. German authorities had stepped up border checks of
France-bound travelers, turning back some suspected hooligans.
	   A known English soccer hooligan, Paul Dodd, from Carlisle, was
detained for questioning Friday as he was about to board a ferry in
Dover, police said.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured. English
fans have clashed with, or were attacked by, French North African
youths from poor suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

Summer, uncertainty push down Cyprus share prices 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Share prices in Cyprus raked up more
losses as a summer lull and continuing political uncertainty
combined to push the exchange's all-share index down by 1.47
percent week-on-week, traders said Friday.
	   The index closed down 0.37 percent Friday at 83.64 points,
recording the fourth successive drop. It closed up 0.58 percent on
Monday.
	   ``It is what you might call a summer phenomenon coupled with the
political uncertainty hanging over us,'' said Stavros Agrotis, a
senior broker with CISCO, the securities arm of the Bank of Cyprus.
``There is really no specific reason for the market to go up, but
it is not crashing.''
	   After gains of 20 percent in the first four months of the year,
share prices have shed nearly 12 percent since May 4, when U.S.
presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke told a news conference in
Nicosia that he had failed to persuade the island's Turkish and
Greek communities to resume reunification talks.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean island
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Market sentiment took a turn for the worse last week when
tension rose between Greece and Turkey, the main backers of the
island's two communities, over Cyprus. Share prices slipped by more
than two percent.
	   The Cyprus Stock Exchange deals in about 50 securities and was
capitalized at 1.24 billion pounds (dlrs 2.35 billion) at the end
of last month.

Cold, wet Wimbledon slowed again by showers AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Carol Shroades and Angela Boykins got
the feel of Wimbledon on Friday.
	   ``It's cold and wet,'' said Shroades, huddled in the food court
over an order of fish and chips. ``They say this is summer. I call
my friends and family back home and they say it's 95 degrees (35C).
I have no sympathy for them.''
	   ``And to think we skipped school for this,'' said Boykins, who _
like her friend _ is studying law at Northern Ohio University and
taking classes this summer in London.
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon _ and the third wet one.
Rain delayed the start of play four hours. Twice it was held up by
showers, with only eight singles matches completed.
	   ``Just another day here in London,'' said U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter, who killed time playing indoor cricket.
	   ``Timmy Henman has a cricket bat,'' he explained. ``We had a
game of indoor cricket. I don't think the members of the club were
too happy.''
	   Almost three full days were wiped out last year in the wettest
Wimbledon in history. This year the showers have been of the
nuisance variety, but no less annoying.
	   And there's more rain in the forecast.
	   The London Weather Center called for a chance of heavy showers
Saturday _ with the possibility of hail. Sunday could be slightly
better with more rain early next week.
	   ``It looks fairly unsettled into early next week,'' a duty
forecaster said Friday. ``It's not particularly unusual June
weather here.''
	   ``I feel so sorry for the people who buy tickets and come and
sit in the rain,'' said Charlotte Johnston, selling ice cream
outside the food court. ``It's so demoralizing.''
	   The 21-year-old student-vendor sheltered under a plastic rain
poncho and crossed her arms over her chest for warmth.
	   ``I've sold two in an hour,'' she said. ``I'd be all right if I
were selling tea.''
	   Susie Green, from England's western city of Bristol, is used to
the foul-weather tradition at Wimbledon.
	   ``This is the fifth time I've come and I've only seen two
matches,'' she said. ``We British are very resilient. The last time
I saw a match? Maybe in the '70s with Borg.''
	   Briton Steve Biucchi also took it with the predictable stiff
upper lip _ and a stiff drink. He was among hundreds who ignored
light showers to picnic on the terrace behind Court No. 1, warming
with champagne, wine or _ like Biucchi _ the traditional Wimbledon
elixir, pimms.
	   ``We haven't had that many just yet,'' he said. ``But we could
be in trouble if it keeps raining.''
	   Contrary to popular belief, Wimbledon Marketing Director Robert
McCowen said the rain hurts _ not helps _ Wimbledon's pricey gift
shops and food concessions.
	   ``We find people go in to stay warm, but just mill around,'' he
said. ``When the weather's nice they stay later and spend.''
	   Few stayed late Friday. Most left early to watch England's
crucial World Cup game in France against Colombia.

Marchers protest slaying of Basque councilor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of people marched for
peace Friday, hours after the funeral of a Spanish town councilor
killed in a bomb explosion blamed on Basque separatists.
	   Spanish government ministers and Popular Party representatives
joined Manuel Zamarreno's family to bury the town councilor from
Spain's ruling party.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar also visited Zamrarreno's widow
and four sons early in the afternoon before heading to Luxor,
Egypt, to start a five-day visit to the Middle East.
	   ``We need peace,'' read the Basque-language slogan on the banner
at the front of the 3-kilometer (2-mile) march through the northern
coastal city of San Sebastian.
	   National and regional leaders led the procession, which came a
day after Zamarreno was killed and his bodyguard was injured when a
bomb exploded as they walked past a parked motorcycle. The slaying
occurred six months after his predecessor, Jose Luis Caso, was shot
dead in a bar by an ETA gunman on Dec. 11. Both men's lives had
been threatened in graffiti.
	   Although no group claimed responsibility for Zamrarreno's death,
authorities immediately blamed ETA, the armed Basque separatist
group that has killed nearly 800 since 1968 in its campaign for the
independence of the Spanish Basque country.
	   Millions of Spaniards marched in July to protest ETA's
kidnapping and killing of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel
Blanco. Aznar's government refuses to deal with ETA, a Basque
language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, until it lays
down arms.

Rafter has sex appeal, but can he win Wimbledon? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ From the baseline, Patrick Rafter
swings with a grunt that sounds like ``Bam!'' Then he rushes the
net, sprinting head-on into shots from opponents and leaping or
lunging to finish off another exciting point.
	   Rafter can thrill fans during a changeover, too. He removed his
undershirt three games into Friday's victory at Wimbledon, drawing
whistles from girls in the crowd.
	   He's an Australian Agassi, delighting spectators with frenzied
play and sex appeal. Rafter is already a cover boy for the ATP
Tour, and by winning Wimbledon, he would provide a badly needed
boost for the popularity of the men's game.
	   ``We're in a bit of a low patch,'' he said. ``I would like to be
someone who could help start that back up again.''
	   Rafter took a step forward Friday, advancing to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1. It's his
best showing in a Grand Slam since winning the U.S. Open last
September.
	   The stunning success in New York made Rafter an international
celebrity, but the Aussie heartthrob then slipped into a slump. He
lost in the third round at the Australian Open, lost in the second
round at the French Open and lost a crucial Davis Cup match to
Byron Black when Zimbabwe upset the Aussies in April.
	   Like other recent Grand Slam finalists, the 26-year-old Rafter
has been a one-hit wonder, compounding the doldrums in a sport
starved for stars.
	   ``I hope that the men's game isn't really going that flat,'' he
said. ``It's important for some of us to have consistent results
and stay up there. Unfortunately I haven't had consistent results
lately.''
	   The past six months will be forgotten if Rafter wins Wimbledon.
His difficult path includes England's Tim Henman or a rematch with
Black in the fourth round, followed by potential matches against
Australian Open champion Petr Korda, four-time Wimbledon champ Pete
Sampras and 1996 Wimbledon champ Richard Krajicek.
	   ``If I can get more rhythm on my serve, I think my chances are
as good as anyone else's,'' Rafter said. ``I've got myself in
another good situation to have a crack at it.''
	   Because of rain delays, only two other men's matches were
completed Friday. Two-time Wimbledon runnerup Goran Ivanisevic
advanced to the third round by beating Andrei Medvedev 6-3, 7-6
(7-4), 4-6, 6-0, and Daniel Vacek eliminated Marc-Kevin Goellner
6-4, 7-5, 6-3.
	   Although Rafter has yet to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals,
his serve-and-volley game is perfectly suited to grass, and he
smothered Gustafsson on another damp, gray afternoon at the All
England Club.
	   The condition of Court 1 suggested that few players had ventured
inside the service lines this week, but Rafter wore a path. He won
33 points at the net while the Swede won three.
	   Both players struggled with their service toss in the windy
weather. Rafter stopped several times in mid-motion as he shouted
``Sorry, mate!'' to Gustafsson.
	   ``I'm a bad ball-tosser,'' Rafter later explained ruefully.
	   But the rest of his game showed polish. Rafter pulled away in
the final two sets, and after winning match point, he thrust his
fist into the arm and smacked a ball into the stands.
	   ``It's encouraging for me, because I'm winning the big points,
and I've been able to lift myself when I need to,'' he said. ``I'm
playing well.''
	   Fans are pleased, too. Rafter smiled when it was noted that much
of his enthusiastic following at Wimbledon is female.
	   ``Female, is it?'' he said. ``That's not a bad thing.''
	   In fact, it's good for the game.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this northern town under a tight
security clampdown around an England-Colombia match attended by
Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local French North African youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match, seen as among the highest
risk games of a World Cup struck repeatedly by violence.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready. English police helped spot known hooligans.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train
from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed. Many
brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. No
injuries were reported. By Friday night, 11 people remained in
custody for violence and 11 others for public drunkenness.
	   The high number of drunken English fans in this town of 30,000
kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.) match. Prince
Charles and Prince Harry were seen in a VIP box at the stadium as
it began.

World Cup: Tenth-minute penalty gives North Africans 1-0 lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Skander Souayah converted a
10th-minute penalty kick and Tunisia led an outplayed Romania 1-0
at halftime Friday night, a match that meant second-round seeding
to the Europeans and only pride to the North Africans.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   Sellimi got the ball in the top corner of the penalty area, and
pivoted inward to get between Dulca and Anton Dobos. Looking to
recover, Dulca, whose arms were intertwined with the Tunisian
forward, grabbed Sellimi around the left shoulder before he went
down.
	   The goal came as Tunisia was by far the more dangerous team
through the first 45 minutes. The game was only two minutes old
before Mehdi Ben Slimane slalomed through the Romanian defense,
forcing keeper Bogdan Stelea off his line for a sliding block.
	   Stelea was forced into several key saves, intercepting a low
cross from Sellimi in the 19th and grabbing a volley by Kaies
Ghodbane a minute later.
	   Romania's best chance came in the 42nd minute when Marius
Lacatus broke down the right side and crossed into an onrushing
Ilie Dumitrescu.
	   Dumitrescu touched the ball over Tunisian keeper Chokri el Ouaer
at the top of the penalty area but was falling away from the play
and collided with the sliding keeper, who did not touch the ball.
The Romanians pleaded for a penalty but Australian referee Edward
Lennie gestured for Dumistrescu to get up.
	   Having already clinched a second-round berth, Romania was
playing to win Group G and avoid a Tuesday meeting with Argentina
in Saint-Etienne.
	   With two victories already, Romania needed only a draw with
Tunisia to secure a Tuesday clash with Group H runner-up Croatia in
Bordeaux.
	   Tunisia entered the match with two losses and had no chance of
advancing regardless of the result.
	   After pledging to dye their hair if they won their group, the
entire Romanian squad arrived with blond manes while coach Anghel
Iordanescu shaved his head, but wore a white baseball cap to hide
the evidence.

World Cup: England leads 2-0 at half time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Power-packed shots by Darren Anderton and
David Beckham gave England a 2-0 half time lead over Colombia
Friday in the race to get a second round spot in the World Cup.
	   Although England needed only a tie to guarantee a place in the
final 16, watched from the stands by Prince Charles and Prince
Harry, Anderton drove home a fiercely-struck angled drive in the
20th minute and Beckham curled in a 30-meter free kick nine minutes
later to delight a huge following of English fans at the Felix
Bollaert stadium.
	   England put together a slick four-man move which ended with a
tame side-footed shot from Graeme Le Saux in the 19th minute before
taking the lead with a far more impressive finish.
	   The Colombian defense struggled to clear a right wing cross and
the ball dropped to the unmarked Anderton, just inside the right
side of the penalty box.
	   The Tottenham winger, who has barely played during the last two
seasons because of a series of injuries, hammered the ball first
time into the roof of the net from an acute angle with Mondragon
powerless.
	   The second goal came in the 29th minute in spectacular style.
	   Paul Ince was brought down 30 meters from goal and Beckham
produced one of his speciality free kicks, curling the ball round
the wall past the despairing dive of 'keeper Mondragon and inside
the left hand post.
	   Colombia came up with its first on-target shot four minutes
before half time, Leider Preciado forcing David Seaman to make a
difficult save at the foot of the near post.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton, David Beckham, Paul Ince, Paul Scholes, Graeme Le
Saux; Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.
	   Colombia _ Farid Mondragon; Everth Palacios, Jorge Bermudez,
Wilmer Cabrera, Antonio Moreno; Mauricio Serna, Harold Lozano,
Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincon; Anthony De Avila, Leider
Preciado.
	   Referee _ Arturo Brizio, Mexico.

returns indicated Friday.
	   With only a third of the 108 seats in the new Belfast Assembly
declared as darkness fell, political analysts projected that the
major Protestant party supporting the agreement, the Ulster
Unionists, would win the most seats in Thursday's election.
	   Projections suggested that the Ulster Unionists should hold 30
or 31 seats when final results are declared Saturday, despite their
share of first-preference votes falling to an unprecedented low of
21.3 percent.
	   The north's major Catholic-supported party, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, appeared likely to attract more
first-preference votes than the Ulster Unionists to finish on top
of the popular vote for the first time in Northern Ireland history.
	   Achieving 30 seats or more will be crucial in an Assembly where
Protestants overall are likely to hold at least 60 seats. Majority
support from both Protestant and Catholic blocs will be required
for the passage of key decisions.
	   And the balance of power on the Protestant side of the house
looks uncomfortably narrow. At several count centers, supporters of
the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party taunted and
heckled Ulster Unionists in public displays of bitter Protestant
divisions.
	   Paisley, who has led opposition to the agreement, insisted that
his party and other Protestants opposed to compromise _ including a
few dissidents elected under the Ulster Unionist banner _ would
make life impossible for Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the
man most likely to lead the Assembly.
	   ``They thought they had us hamstrung and buried,'' Paisley
crowed in his rural North Antrim power base, where he topped the
poll with 10,590 _ and his son, Ian Jr, won a second seat right
behind him.
	   ``And all over Ulster today the DUP is topping the poll! Dublin
is sick! Mr. Tony Blair is sick!'' he said in reference to the
British prime minister. ``And the sickest man of all is David
Trimble!''
	   Paisley, whose party was projected to win about 22 seats _ too
few on its own to block anything _ predicted that Trimble soon
would be toppled as Ulster Unionist leader.
	   ``There have been problems, no doubt about it,'' Trimble said
outside the count center in his Upper Bann constituency, where he
topped the poll with 12,338 votes _ but his three party running
mates were facing likely elimination.
	   ``We have not had the decisive result I would liked to have
seen. But it's a positive result,'' he said, as Democratic
Unionists shouted ``Rubbish!'' in the background.
	   Despite registering 22 percent of votes, the SDLP was considered
likely to win just 22 seats. The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, its
militant rival for Catholic votes, was expected to win 17 to 18
seats after scoring a new high in its electoral fortunes, 17.6
percent of votes.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was swamped by journalists in
Belfast City Hall when he became the first politician elected in
the city, topping the poll in his Catholic west Belfast power base.
Sinn Fein was expected to take four of the six seats there.
	   But John Hume, the SDLP leader credited with bringing Adams in
from the political wilderness five years ago, saw his moderate
Catholic party fare strongly elsewhere. He topped the poll in his
native Londonderry.
	   Both Catholic parties back the agreement, struck in April among
eight parties and the British and Irish governments.
	   Hume reacted angrily to the possibility that anti-agreement
Protestants would try to obstruct the Assembly's first major task _
the appointment of a 12-member Executive from several parties.
	   The agreement specifies that this administration must be
appointed quickly and decide by October how to cooperate formally
with the neighboring Irish Republic. That element is essential to
both Hume and Adams, who promoted the agreement as a stepping stone
to Irish unity.
	   ``The whole world is in favor of this agreement,'' Hume said,
adding that the Paisleyites would be exposed ``as fascists if they
try to wreck this agreement.''

Grains, soybeans fall sharply on weather prospects 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices retreated Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions that hot, humid
Midwestern weather will benefit young crops before a cooling trend
next week.
	   Temperatures in the 90s F (30s C) this week in the key growing
states of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa are expected to result in
growth spurts for crops that hindered by cooler than normal
temperatures and excessive rainfall. Market participants said they
expect the U.S. Agriculture Department next week to report improved
crop ratings after two weeks of declines.
	   But after initially advancing on lingering concern about the
possibility of sustained hot weather, prices turned lower on midday
weather forecasts calling for temperatures to cool into the 80s F
(20s C), with good chances for rain in both the Midwest and Delta.
	   Wheat futures were pressured by news that Iraq had purchased
wheat from U.S. competitors and ahead of active harvesting this
weekend of the winter wheat crop.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 6 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.09 1-4 a
bushel; December corn fell 2 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.64 1-2 a bushel;
December oats rose 3-4 cent to dlrs 1.44 1-4 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 6 cents to dlrs 6.36 a bushel.

BC-Russia-Stadium Collapse
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a stadium accident in southern
Russia rose to 26 on Friday, when four more people died from
injuries received when a concrete balcony collapsed onto a crowded
stadium floor.
	   Thirty-eight others were injured Thursday when the 50-meter
(160-foot) long balcony packed with more than 100 people _ mostly
children _ fell 5 meters (16 feet) onto the floor at the Russian
National Freestyle Wrestling Competition in the city of Nalchik.
	   The balcony was a standing-room-only area for non-paying
spectators, which meant most of those on the balcony were children
who couldn't afford tickets.
	   A 12-year-old boy was among those killed and two children were
in a hospital intensive care unit.
	   A commission from the Federal Security Service was investigating
the incident, said a duty officer at the regional branch of the
Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   So far, authorities believe the collapse was caused by a fault
in the construction of the stadium, which was completed four years
ago, the officer said.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers (850 miles) south of
Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkariya republic. About 2,500 people were
watching the competition.
	   The republic observed a day of mourning Friday and buried the
victims. State flags were lowered and all entertainment events were
canceled.
	   The government planned to pay 20,000 rubles (about dlrs 3,000)
each to the families of the dead, the republic's premier Khusein
Chechenov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Nigerian military ruler meets British envoy 
</HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ In a sign that years of Nigerian isolation
is eroding, a British envoy met Friday with this West African
country's new military leader, with the men possible ways for
Nigeria to return to the world community, officials said.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, ``said he would do everything possible
to end the unfavorable view of Nigeria,'' the general's press
secretary, David Attah, said in a statement, adding Abubakar
``renewed his appeal to the international community generally to
focus greater attention on the opportunities in Nigeria than on
problems.''
	   For years, those problems have dominated headlines about
Nigeria, which became an international pariah during the five-year
rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died earlier in June. The oil-rich
country, which was once known for its comparative wealth amid the
poverty of West and Central Africa, instead became known for its
abysmal human rights record and its rampant corruption.
	   Abubakar, though, appears intent on changing that, freeing
dozens of political prisoners and meeting with opposition figures
and diplomats.
	   On Friday he met with a European Union delegation led by British
Foreign Office envoy Tony Lloyd, who has said he planned to discuss
the EU's trade sanctions against Nigeria _ a former British colony
_ and a flight ban on officials and family members of the junta.
	   No immediate comment was available from Lloyd. But Attah said
the British envoy told Abubakar ``his country was anxious to
improve relations with Nigeria and promised assistance in any way
possible to move Nigeria forward.''
	   An American delegation is also expected in Nigeria soon, lead by
Thomas Pickering, the State Department's third-ranking official and
a former ambassador to Nigeria.
	   On Thursday, 17 prisoners were granted amnesty by military
authorities, although Moshood Abiola, 60, a former
multi-millionaire and apparent winner of 1993's presidential
elections, was not among them.
	   Nigerian officials say, though, that he will probably be
released in the coming weeks.

Tyson could fight in October, adviser says AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson will begin his comeback with a fight
as early as October if Nevada boxing authorities agree to give him
a new boxing license, a Tyson adviser said Friday.
	   Shelly Finkel said Tyson will apply next month for the license,
which was taken away after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield twice on the
ears during their WBA heavyweight title fight last June.
	   Finkel said Tyson would have his first comeback fight either in
October or November if the commission looks favorably on his
application.
	   ``I've got to believe the chances of him getting a license are
good,'' Finkel said. ``He has behaved in the last year.''
	   Tyson is eligible to apply for a new license July 9, a year
after the Nevada State Athletic Commission revoked his license and
fined him dlrs 3 million for the infamous biting in the rematch of
their first heavyweight title fight.
	   Tyson was disqualified in the third round by referee Mills Lane
after he bit a chunk out of Holyfield's left ear, then bit his
right ear after the fight was resumed.
	   Finkel, who said he will represent the former heavyweight
champion in his dealings with Nevada boxing authorities, is one of
several people who Tyson has aligned himself with after splitting
from promoter Don King and his former co-managers, John Horne and
Rory Holloway.
	   Tyson has filed suits in New York and California in efforts to
get out of contracts with King and Horne and Holloway.
	   Finkel hasn't talked to King recently about a possible
settlement of the contractual dispute, but said Tyson's attorneys
believe he can go ahead and fight without a settlement.
	   ``We don't believe he's under that contract,'' Finkel said.
	   Tyson, who split from King in February, reportedly owes millions
in taxes and has encountered cash flow problems in the months since
he has not been in the ring.
	   Tyson made dlrs 140 million in purses in six fights since his
release from prison in 1995, but half of that money went to his
co-managers and King, according to contracts contained in court
records.
	   While under suspension, he earned dlrs 3.5 million to play the
role of enforcer for the World Wrestling Federation in its
Wrestlemania matches in March.
	   If Tyson gets his license back, he is expected to take a fight
against a mediocre opponent, much as he did when he fought Peter
McNeeley after his release from prison on a rape conviction in
1995.
	   The big fight awaiting Tyson, though, is a possible third match
with Holyfield, which could rival the grossing power of the first
two fights.
	   Holyfield has indicated interest in such a fight, but said it
would have to work into a timetable he has of unifying the
heavyweight titles, then retiring in 2000.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Scores of English World Cup fans pelted
police with beer cans Friday in this northern town under a tight
security clampdown around an England-Colombia match attended by
Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local French North African youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match, seen as among the highest
risk games of a World Cup struck repeatedly by violence.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready. English police helped spot known hooligans, and
border police turned away hundreds of suspected troublemakers.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train
from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed. Many
brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   About 400 English fans gathered on a corner about 200 meters
(yards) from the stadium on Friday afternoon. Some in the crowd
threw bottles and cans when press photographers and cameramen began
filming them, prompting riot police to move in with police dogs.
	   Pelted by the crowd, the police arrested about 50 fans. No
injuries were reported. By Friday night, 11 people remained in
custody for violence and 11 others for public drunkenness.
	   Many suspect English nationals never made it to Lens. French
authorities reported turning away 400 of them who arrived in France
on Friday at Calais, Lille airport and train station, and at the
Belgian border.
	   Nevertheless, the high number of drunken English fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.)
match. Prince Charles and Prince Harry were seen in a VIP box at
the heavily guarded stadium packed with 41,000 fans.

Belgian border.
	   Nevertheless, the high number of drunken English fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the 1900 GMT (9 p.m.)
match. Prince Charles and Prince Harry were seen in a VIP box at
the heavily guarded stadium packed with 41,000 fans.

Dramatic advances against AIDS leaving millions behind 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, EDITS to trim.
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Only 5 percent of people living with the AIDS
virus _ those in Western Europe and North America _ are reaping the
full benefits of the dramatic advances in treatment, a leader of
the World AIDS Conference says.
	   Of the 30.6 million people infected with the virus worldwide,
only about 1.3 million can afford and obtain the new drug
combinations that have proved so effective in combating it,
conference chairman Dr. Bernard Hirschel said.
	   The conference, which opens Sunday, will bring together 12,000
of the world's top experts in the global campaign against AIDS.
Convening for the first time in 2 1/2 years, it has set the
challenge of finding low-cost ways to stop the spread of AIDS and
help people afflicted with it in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
	   Hirschel and other experts say there is hope because many
measures do not require expensive technology, among them preaching
the need to practice safe sex.
	   The conference will review 5,000 reports on research around the
world, from laboratory advances to work with prostitutes in Africa.
It will look at the new drug combinations that have slowed the
progress of the disease in Europe and North America, review new
combinations in the pipeline and consider what can be done to
reduce their cost.
	   Robin Gorna, executive director of the Australian Federation of
AIDS organizations and a conference organizer, said another problem
with current treatment is it is complicated.
	   ``We need simpler treatment, ever more effective, easier to take
with fewer side effects,'' Gorna said.
	   Several major drug companies are planning to announce at the
conference that they will cut their prices on AIDS drugs by 75
percent to developing countries, a U.N. official said this week in
New York.
	   Still, most of the latest drugs remain out-of-reach for many
people with HIV, experts said, adding that researchers are looking
at whether lower-cost products, such as vitamins, offer any hope.
	   Some reports are also expected on the development of vaccines,
with scientists turning toward human testing.
	   One report will look at why some prostitutes in Africa have
shown immunity to the disease and what that means for finding ways
to help others. Others will consider developments in male or female
condoms that can help women protect themselves.
	   Another major area of research is preventing transmission of
AIDS from mothers to babies, not only during birth but also through
breast milk.
	   UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, noted in a
report this week that HIV-infected women in industrialized
countries largely stopped breast feeding when research showed the
virus can be transmitted in breast milk.
	   But in the developing world, where many mothers may not know
they are HIV positive since testing is unavailable, it is difficult
to enforce.

Britain gives money to Kosovo refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain gave 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.64 million)
Friday to help refugees displaced in Kosovo and reiterated its
commitment to maintain fighter aircraft in the Balkans.
	   The British moves came as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
that NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in the troubled
Serbian province where Serb security forces have been fighting
Albanian militants seeking independence.
	   Thousands of people from Kosovo, mainly Albanians, have been
forced to flee their homes as a result of the fighting.
	   The International Development Department said the aid money will
be divided between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   The UNHCR will use the money for relief work among refugees in
Albania including accommodation, water supplies and sanitation. The
Red Cross will provide relief in both Kosovo and Albania.
	   Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense said four Harrier GR7 jets
would replace six Jaguar aircraft deployed in Italy, to continue
support for NATO forces.
	   The aircraft, based in Germany, will fly to Gioia del Colle next
week. Four other Harriers _ designed for ground attack _ will
remain on standby for deployment at 48 hours notice, the ministry
said.
	   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, who
just returned from the region, told BBC radio on Friday that it was
time for Holbrooke to make clear to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that failure to stop the violence will lead to military
action by NATO.
	   He said Holbrooke also must urge the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
to give up their claims to independence and accept increased
autonomy.
	   ``We are now coming to the point where continued inaction will
launch the events that will widen the Balkan war,'' Ashdown said.

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen tentatively set for just before ceremony AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Ceremony begins Saturday at 0100 GMT; Clinton-Jiang statements
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a symbolic ceremony, U.S. President Bill
Clinton was opening his state visit Saturday in Tiananmen Square,
site of China's crackdown against democratic protesters nine years
ago.
	   White House officials promised that Clinton, in talks with
Chinese leaders, would protest ``thoroughly unacceptable'' the
latest arrests of dissidents. In unusually blunt terms, Clinton's
national security director called China's human rights record
``terrible.''
	   The welcoming ceremony, in which Clinton was to review a
regiment of the People's Liberation Army, stirred protests in
America and a congressional resolution urging Clinton not to step
foot in the plaza.
	   To Americans, the square is a reminder of the military's 1989
killings of hundreds _ if not thousands _ of democracy advocates.
But to China, it is the country's spiritual and political heart,
where Mao Tse-tung declared victory in the communist revolution of
October 1949.
	   No remarks were scheduled at the ceremony outside the Maoist-era
Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will confer inside the Great Hall and also meet with reporters.
	   Clinton's arrival in the capital marks the end of America's
diplomatic isolation of China since the crackdown. It is a personal
victory for Jiang, who made it a priority to improve U.S.-Chinese
relations and bolster his diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation.''
	   But he softened his criticism by saying the action against
dissidents was not as harsh as in the past.
	   White House officials made clear that Clinton was not prepared
to punish China or limit cooperation. ``I have come to China to
strengthen the ties between our two nations,'' the president said
Friday in the village of Xiahe after criticizing the arrests.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Rep.
Christopher Smith asserted that Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism was
not enough. He said, ``The tortures are not gentle.''
	   Berger said Clinton still hoped for an agreement in which the
United States and China would no longer target nuclear missiles at
each other _ a symbolic step since missiles could be retargeted
within minutes. China has insisted that the United States renounce
the first use of nuclear weapons _ which Clinton refuses to do.
	   Berger indicated it was more likely that China would agree to
restrictions on missile technology exports.
	   He said the United States also hoped for progress on energy,
pollution control, science and technology issues and a process for
improving China's legal and judicial system. On human rights,
Berger said it was unlikely any change would be apparent
immediately but he noted that some prominent dissidents were
released after Jiang's visit to Washington last October.
	   Trade is a contentious issue between the two countries, and
Berger said it would be discussed but ``I don't expect anything
concrete to come out of that.''
	   Clinton made clear that the United States would not alter its
Taiwan policy _ the ``one China'' policy by which the United States
supports neither the independence of Taiwan nor a one China-one
Taiwan system.
	   Saturday was to be the busiest day of Clinton's nine-day visit.
The talks with Jiang were expected to focus on Asia's economic
crisis and the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan as well
as U.S.-Chinese differences over human rights, trade and arms
control. The two leaders also will dine Sunday.
	   The president will confer separately with Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji, the troubleshooter known for fighting conservative
opposition to privatization of China's ailing state enterprises.
	   White House officials said they still did not know if China
would broadcast live across China Clinton's remarks Sunday or his
address Monday to students at Beijing University. ``We'd like the
most exposure for the president that we can get,'' Berger said.
	   The president arrived in Beijing from Xi'an and a tour of one of
the world's most remarkable archaeological discoveries, thousands
of life-size clay horses and armored warriors buried near the tomb
of Emperor Qin Shi Huang more than 2,000 years ago.
	   He said that the experience of walking through the vast ruins
was ``a good argument for a little humility.''

Predators choose 26 in National Hockey League expansion draft AP Hockey Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By KEN RAPPOPORT
<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Starting with Mike Richter of the New
York Rangers, the Nashville Predators made goaltenders a priority
for more than one reason at Friday's National Hockey League
expansion draft.
	   The Predators did not expect to keep all of the 26 players
picked, particularly Richter, who is expected to re-sign with the
Rangers.
	   ``I firmly think the Rangers will try to sign him and will sign
him. Our whole intention there was to get the compensatory draft
pick,'' Nashville general manager David Poile said of the
soon-to-be free agent. ``Uwe Krupp was in the same situation.''
	   Krupp, a defenseman with the Colorado Avalanche, also was taken
for compensation, Poile said.
	   Among the other goalies taken were Mikhail Shtalkenov of the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Mike Dunham of the New Jersey Devils, Tomas
Vokoun of the Montreal Canadiens and Frederic Chabot of the Los
Angeles Kings.
	   Dunham, a highly regarded backup behind New Jersey's Martin
Brodeur, was introduced at Friday's news conference wearing a
Predators' jersey. He's one of the goaltenders the Predators figure
to keep.
	   The Predators took one player from each of the other 26 NHL
teams. Along with the five goalies, the Predators took 13 forwards
and eight defensemen.
	   Other defensemen taken by the Predators were Bob Boughner of
Buffalo, Joel Bouchard of Calgary, Chris Armstrong of Florida, J.J.
Daigneault of the New York Islanders, John Slaney of Phoenix, Al
Iafrate of San Jose and Rob Zettler of Toronto.
	   The forwards: Mike Sullivan of Boston, Jeff Daniels of Carolina,
Greg Johnson of Chicago, Patrick Cote of Dallas, Doug Brown of
Detroit, Doug Friedman of Edmonton, Dennyl Lambert of Ottawa, Craig
Darby of Philadelphia, Tony Hrkac of Pittsburgh, Blair Atcheynum of
St. Louis, Paul Brousseau of Tampa Bay, Scott Walker of Vancouver
and Andrew Brunette of Washingon.
	   The Predators will continue their hunt for talent in Saturday's
NHL Entry Draft of amateurs. Nashville has the third pick behind
Tampa Bay and San Jose. By that time, Vincent Lecavalier figures to
be gone. He's the consensus No. 1 pick from the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League and is tabbed as the ``next Mario Lemieux.''
	   ``I look at that as more like three or four years away,'' Poile
said of the entry draft players. ``Positionally, it means taking
the best player.
	   The Predators are the 21st expansion team since the NHL broke
the six-team mold in 1967, with more to come. The league will fill
out to 30 teams by the year 2000 with the additions of Atlanta;
Columbus, Ohio, and St. Paul, Minnesota.

Cold, wet Wimbledon slowed again by showers AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS to a dozen singles matches completed in 4th graf
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Carol Shroades and Angela Boykins got
the feel of Wimbledon on Friday.
	   ``It's cold and wet,'' said Shroades, huddled in the food court
over an order of fish and chips. ``They say this is summer. I call
my friends and family back home and they say it's 95 degrees (35C).
I have no sympathy for them.''
	   ``And to think we skipped school for this,'' said Boykins, who _
like her friend _ is studying law at Northern Ohio University and
taking classes this summer in London.
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon _ and the third wet one.
Rain delayed the start of play four hours. Twice it was held up by
showers, with only a dozen singles matches completed.
	   ``Just another day here in London,'' said U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter, who killed time playing indoor cricket.
	   ``Timmy Henman has a cricket bat,'' he explained. ``We had a
game of indoor cricket. I don't think the members of the club were
too happy.''
	   Almost three full days were wiped out last year in the wettest
Wimbledon in history. This year the showers have been of the
nuisance variety, but no less annoying.
	   And there's more rain in the forecast.
	   The London Weather Center called for a chance of heavy showers
Saturday _ with the possibility of hail. Sunday could be slightly
better with more rain early next week.
	   ``It looks fairly unsettled into early next week,'' a duty
forecaster said Friday. ``It's not particularly unusual June
weather here.''
	   ``I feel so sorry for the people who buy tickets and come and
sit in the rain,'' said Charlotte Johnston, selling ice cream
outside the food court. ``It's so demoralizing.''
	   The 21-year-old student-vendor sheltered under a plastic rain
poncho and crossed her arms over her chest for warmth.
	   ``I've sold two in an hour,'' she said. ``I'd be all right if I
were selling tea.''
	   Susie Green, from England's western city of Bristol, is used to
the foul-weather tradition at Wimbledon.
	   ``This is the fifth time I've come and I've only seen two
matches,'' she said. ``We British are very resilient. The last time
I saw a match? Maybe in the '70s with Borg.''
	   Briton Steve Biucchi also took it with the predictable stiff
upper lip _ and a stiff drink. He was among hundreds who ignored
light showers to picnic on the terrace behind Court No. 1, warming
with champagne, wine or _ like Biucchi _ the traditional Wimbledon
elixir, pimms.
	   ``We haven't had that many just yet,'' he said. ``But we could
be in trouble if it keeps raining.''
	   Contrary to popular belief, Wimbledon Marketing Director Robert
McCowen said the rain hurts _ not helps _ Wimbledon's pricey gift
shops and food concessions.
	   ``We find people go in to stay warm, but just mill around,'' he
said. ``When the weather's nice they stay later and spend.''
	   Few stayed late Friday. Most left early to watch England's
crucial World Cup game in France against Colombia.

Leafs hire Pat Quinn as coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pat Quinn returned to coaching on Friday when he
was hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   The move had been anticipated since the National Hockey League
club fired Mike Murphy earlier this week.
	   ``It's an important day for me and I feel a great sense of pride
that I'm able to say I am the coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs,''
said Quinn, who began his NHL career in 1968 with Toronto.
	   President and general manager Ken Dryden was effusive in his
praise of Quinn, whom he faced as a goalie with the Montreal
Canadiens in the 1970s.
	   ``As a player on legs that didn't move very fast, he found a way
to play for nine years,'' said Dryden.
	   ``As coach in Philadelphia, L.A. and Vancouver, he found a way
to make his players, his teams, everyone around him better.''
	   The 55-year old Quinn was president-general manager of the
Vancouver Canucks for 11 years until last fall. He was coach of the
year with Vancouver and with Philadelphia.
	   ``When you do this as long as I have, you miss it,'' Quinn said
earlier this week. ``Each is a different job. It (coaching) is a
great occupation. It has its faults, but there are so many
pleasureable things about it.''
	   Quinn is still owed dlrs 1.2 million from his contract with the
Canucks. He would be paid the difference between that figure and
his salary as a head coach for another organization.

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Opposition activists in the West African
country of Togo marched through the streets for a third straight
day Friday, while security forces attacked the offices of an
opposition candidate and attacked one of his aides, witnesses said.
	   Demonstrators, many wearing red scarfs and bandanas, shouted
opposition slogans and called for the ouster of President Gnassigbe
Eyadema, who was proclaimed winner of Togo's widely-disputed
presidential elections after the chief electoral officer resigned.
	   ``Eyadema _ thief! Gilchrist _ president!'' the protesters
chanted.
	   Security forces retaliated by burning the campaign offices of
Gilchrist Olympio, the country's main opposition leader, who was
declared the runner-up to Eyadema in the elections last Sunday.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
soldiers and police officers attacked Bob Akitani, the vice
president of Olympio's party. Akitani was said to have been
hospitalized with serious injuries, though no further details were
available.
	   One person was also reported killed when violent anti-Eyadema
demonstrations rocked the central town of Afagnan.
	   Eyadema has ruled this tiny French-speaking country for 31 years
since taker power as a military dictator.
	   According to figures released by the ruling party, Olympio came
in second in the Sunday elections with 34 percent of the vote,
behind Eyadema's 52 percent. Olympio's supporters had earlier
claimed a majority.

Jane's: India to build nuclear submarine by 2004 with Russian aid 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; ADDING details.
By RAMOLA TALWAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ With Russian help, India plans to build its
first nuclear-powered submarine by 2004 and eventually fit it with
missiles carrying nuclear warheads, an Indian researcher said
Friday.
	   The work would be in line with expectations that, following last
month's series of nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan, the
South Asian arms race would shift to developing means to deliver
the weapons.
	   Two reports in the latest issue of the British-based Jane's
Intelligence Review focused on a key element of India's planned
delivery system. The reports were by Bombay-based science writer
Gopi Rethinaraj and Andrew Koch, a senior research analyst at the
Center for Defense Information in Washington.
	   India has said it needs a nuclear defense to counter the nuclear
capability of neighbors China and Pakistan, with which it has
fought a total of four wars in the last 50 years. India accuses
China of supporting Pakistan's nuclear program.
	   Discussing his research in an interview, Rethinaraj said he
believed India would have the submarine's hull and reactor in place
by the end of this year and would complete integration of the
components by 2004.
	   A fleet of five Indian submarines is planned, Jane's said,
making India the only country outside the five official nuclear
weapons states _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States _ to operate nuclear submarines.
	   Since conventional submarines need to surface at least once a
week to draw oxygen to run diesel generators, they can be easily
detected. Nuclear submarines, however, can stay submerged for more
than three months, and it is considered safer for them to carry
nuclear weapons because they are harder to detect.
	   Rethinaraj said India would arm its subs with nuclear warhead
missiles, but not immediately. Analysts estimated production of
Sagarika missiles, which can be fired underwater, would begin by
2005.
	   India's nuclear submarines are to be propelled by a pressurized
water reactor burning enriched uranium fuel. A land-based prototype
of the submarine's engine has been tested at Kalpakkam in southern
India, according to Rethinaraj and Koch.
	   Russian assistance to the Indian project is mainly in
non-nuclear areas such as hull design and underwater navigation,
the report said. It said Russia is also helping India develop the
Sagarika missiles and supplying a limited amount of turbojet and
guidance technology.
	   Jane's said Russia was given a dlrs 2.6 billion contract to
build two nuclear power reactors in southern India in exchange for
its help on the submarine project. The contract was signed five
days ago.
	   The United States maintained the reactor deal sent ``the wrong
signal at the wrong time,'' coming soon after international
sanctions were imposed to punish India for its nuclear tests. But
Russia assured India it would brook no outside interference in
their economic relationship.
	   Russia sees India as a prime source of revenue, and India is
keen to improve its power generating capacity.

World Cup: Prince Charles and son attend England-Colombia match With Sports-Soccer-England-Colombia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more details on royals
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry
turned soccer fans Friday night, attending the Felix Bollaert
stadium to see England's make-or-break World Cup match against
Colombia.
	   It is the first time a member of the English royal family has
traveled overseas to see the World Cup. Queen Elizabeth presented
the trophy to the England players in 1966 when the host-country won
the competition.
	   The royals had plenty to cheer about when England scored two
first half goals to go ahead 2-0. The English needed at least a
draw Friday night to qualify for the second round.
	   Security was tight in and around the stadium, which was filled
to capacity of 41,000 fans for the evening match. Police clashed
with English spectators outside, and made about 50 arrests in the
afternoon before the royals arrived.
	   Prince Charles and Prince Harry were driven into the stadium in
an escorted car. They sat in a VIP loge at midfield. The royals
travel with their own security personnel, and French police also
provided protection.
	   A French television broadcast from the stadium showed the royals
standing in the loge for the teams' national anthems before
kickoff. Their presence was not announced to stadium spectators.

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Opposition activists in the West African
country of Togo marched through the streets for a third straight
day Friday, while security forces attacked the offices of an
opposition candidate and attacked one of his aides, witnesses said.
	   Demonstrators, many wearing red scarfs and bandanas, shouted
opposition slogans and called for the ouster of President Gnassigbe
Eyadema, who was proclaimed winner of Togo's widely-disputed
presidential elections after the chief electoral officer resigned.
	   ``Eyadema _ thief! Gilchrist _ president!'' the protesters
chanted.
	   Security forces retaliated by burning the campaign offices of
Gilchrist Olympio, the country's main opposition leader, who was
declared the runner-up to Eyadema in the elections last Sunday.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
soldiers and police officers attacked Bob Akitani, the vice
president of Olympio's party. Akitani was said to have been
hospitalized with serious injuries, though no further details were
available.
	   One person was also reported killed when violent anti-Eyadema
demonstrations rocked the central town of Afagnan.
	   Eyadema has ruled this tiny French-speaking country for 31 years
since taker power as a military dictator.
	   According to figures released by the ruling party, Olympio came
in second in the Sunday elections with 34 percent of the vote,
behind Eyadema's 52 percent. Olympio's supporters had earlier
claimed a majority.

RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas
said Friday the money he raised in a recent tour of the Muslim
world was for a network of social services and not bombings.
	   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who returned to Gaza this week after a
four-month fund-raising tour in the Middle East, said he had raised
billions of dollars, not for terror attacks as Israeli officials
have charged, but for social welfare programs Hamas runs in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   ``We do not bring money in to hurt others but to serve the
people under occupation,'' Yassin told Channel Two in an interview.
	   The 62-year-old quadriplegic sheikh is Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's most formidable political rival. Hamas' power has grown
considerably since Yassin was released from an Israeli jail in
October.
	   During his tour of nearly a dozen capitals in the Muslim world,
Yassin often was treated like a head of state and raised millions
of dollars for Hamas. The group has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 to scuttle the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.

World Cup: Second-half goal by trio of subs gives Romania draw, Group G title 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Second-half substitute Viorel
Moldovan buried a loose ball in the penalty area in the 72nd minute
and Romania drew 1-1 with Tunisia Friday night to earn a
second-round World Cup clash with Croatia.
	   The draw gave Romania a 2-1-0 record, seven points and the Group
G title, avoiding a meeting with Argentina. Instead, Romania will
play Croatia in Bordeaux on Tuesday.
	   Moldovan, who replaced Ilie Dumitrescu only five minutes
earlier, finished a play that started when Gheorge Popescu sent a
free kick from midfield into the Romanian end. Adrian Ilie, who
appeared to be offside, chased it down and chipped the ball over
Tunisian keeper Chorki el Ouaer.
	   Tunisian defender Ferid Chouchane headed the ball away, but not
far enough. The ball bounded to Moldovan, who volleyed the ball
into the goal. All three players involved in the goal were
substitutes.
	   The goal came after 10 minutes of sustained possession and
pressure by Romania, its first consistent offensive effort of the
match.
	   El Ouaer was called on three times to make saves or come way off
his line to clear dangerous balls midway through the second half.
	   The draw still salvaged some pride for the Tunisians, who
despite losses to England and Colombia avoided a last-place finish.
	   The Romanians entered the game a bit over confident.
	   After pledging to dye their hair if they won their group, the
entire Romanian squad arrived with blond manes while coach Anghel
Iordanescu shaved his head, but wore a white baseball cap to hide
the evidence.
	   For most of the game the Tunisians were in control and led from
the 10th minute, when Skander Souayah converted a 10th-minute
penalty kick.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   Sellimi got the ball in the top corner of the penalty area, and
pivoted inward to get between Dulca and Anton Dobos. Looking to
recover, Dulca, whose arms were intertwined with the Tunisian
forward, grabbed Sellimi around the left shoulder before he went
down.
	   The goal came as Tunisia was by far the more dangerous team
through the first 45 minutes. The game was only two minutes old
before Mehdi Ben Slimane slalomed through the Romanian defense,
forcing keeper Bogdan Stelea off his line for a sliding block.
	   Stelea was forced into several key saves, intercepting a low
cross from Sellimi in the 19th and grabbing a volley by Kaies
Ghodbane a minute later.
	   ___ &QC;

World Cup: England wins 2-0 to gain second round, Colombia out early again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Shooting stars Darren Anderton and David
Beckham put England into the second round of the World Cup Friday
in a one-sided 2-0 victory over Colombia that left the South
Americans first round losers again.
	   Although England needed only a tie to guarantee a place in the
final 16, watched from the stands by Prince Charles and Prince
Harry, Anderton drove home a fiercely-struck angled drive in the
20th minute and Beckham curled in a 30-meter free kick nine minutes
later to delight a huge following of English fans at the Felix
Bollaert stadium.
	   The result meant that England finished second behind Romania in
the Group G standings and will meet old foe Argentina in
Saint-Etienne for a place in the last eight.
	   The Colombians go home early for the second time in a row. Their
disastrous 1994 performance led to the shooting to death of Andres
Escobar, who scored an own goal in a loss to the United States, and
was gunned down in his home town of Medellin.
	   Glenn Hoddle's players, beaten by a late goal by Romania in the
previous game, looked impressive against a low-quality Colombian
team whose goalkeeper, Farid Mondragon, prevented a crushing loss
with seven second half saves.
	   England's first shot on goal was less than two minutes into the
game when the power of Alan Shearer in the air, even when
challenged by two Colombian defenders, set up the opportunity for
Paul Scholes.
	   Allowed room 25 meters from goal, the Manchester United forward
hit the ball with plenty of power and 'keeper Mondragon saved
awkwardly, moving slightly the wrong way.
	   England put together a slick four-man move which ended with a
tame side-footed shot from Graeme Le Saux in the 19th minute before
taking the lead with a far more impressive finish.
	   The Colombian defense struggled to clear a right wing cross and
the ball dropped to the unmarked Anderton, just inside the right
side of the penalty box.
	   The Tottenham winger, who has barely played during the last two
seasons because of a series of injuries, hammered the ball first
time into the roof of the net from an acute angle with Mondragon
powerless.
	   It should have been 2-0 four minutes later when another
well-constructed move involving David Beckham and Anderton saw
Scholes go close and the ball fell to the unmarked Michael Owen who
fired over the top from 12 meters.
	   But the second goal came in the 29th minute in spectacular
style.
	   Paul Ince was brought down 30 meters from goal and Beckham
produced one of his speciality free kicks, curling the ball round
the wall past the despairing dive of 'keeper Mondragon and inside
the left hand post.
	   Jorge Bermudez rescued Colombia with an expertly-time tackle on
Owen as the 18-year-old striker headed for goal after being
released by Shearer's pass.
	   Then Colombia came up with its first on-target shot four minutes
before half time, Leider Preciado forcing David Seaman to make a
difficult save at the foot of the near post.
	   The Colombians made three substitutions at half time, including
bringing on a replacement strikeforce of Hamilton Ricard and Adolfo
Valencia with Victor Aristizabal going to operate behind them.
	   But it was still England making the running and Mondragon did
well to make four good saves in the first eight minutes of the
second half.
	   The Colombian 'keeper arched his back to palm over a shot from
Scholes, keep out a header and shot from Shearer and then block
another close-range effort from Owen after defender Sol Campbell
had run through the defense on a 30-meter run.
	   The Colombians had plenty of possession in deep positions but
did little to worry the English defense. They clearly missed star
striker Faustino Asprilla, who was dropped from the squad after
criticizing coach Hernan Gomez in a radio interview.
	   Freddy Rincon moved into a good shooting position 30 meters from
goal but the alert Campbell moved in quickly with a block that took
the sting out of the shot long before it reached Seaman.
	   Then Owen burrowed through the Colombian defense again only for
Everth Palacios to get back with a well-timed tackle just as the
youngster was primed to shoot.
	   Ricard, who plays in England for Middlesbrough, curled a
speculative 20-meter volley just wide of the post as Colombia made
a rare threat with 11 minutes to go.
	   But Owen should have made it 3-0 with seven minutes to go when
he shot straight at Mondragon after Shearer had put him clear. In
the final few minutes, the 'keeper threw himself to his left and
right to keep out more shots from Le Saux and Shearer.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton (Robert Lee, 80th), David Beckham, Paul Ince (David
Batty, 83rd), Paul Scholes (Steve McManaman, 74th), Graeme Le Saux;
Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.
	   Colombia _ Farid Mondragon; Everth Palacios, Jorge Bermudez,
Wilmer Cabrera, Antonio Moreno; Mauricio Serna (Victor Aristizabal,
46th), Harold Lozano, Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincon; Anthony De
Avila (Hamilton Ricard, 46th) Leider Preciado (Adolfo Valencia,
46th).
	   Referee _ Arturo Brizio, Mexico.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters slashed more telephone
cables in Puerto Rico on Friday, cutting service to hundreds more
people even as managers working on repairs threatened to join a
strike against privatizing the state telephone company.
	   ``Many of them (managers) have indicated that if things continue
as they are, they are not going to work and will join the
picketers,'' Angel Solis, president of the Bonafide Association of
Telephone Management Employees, said on the ninth day of the
strike.
	   Managers were against selling the company, too, he said. They
also fear losing jobs in the inefficient company that has about
6,400 workers and 1,500 managers.
	   Telephone company president Carmen Ana Culpeper denied that
managers were considering striking. She praised the dedication of
about 300 people who have been sleeping in their offices, held
virtual prisoner by picketers.
	   Police reported several hoax bomb threats Friday, the day after
a homemade bomb planted at a branch of Banco Popular exploded in a
police officer's hands, tearing off one of his fingers and wounding
his other hand and leg.
	   Dozens of fiber optic cables were slashed overnight and early
Friday, police reported. That was less sabotage than on Thursday,
when protesters planted bombs, smashed automated bank machines and
severed and burned cables.
	   However, Culpeper said they had restored service to more than
two-thirds of 345,000 customers.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello vowed Thursday not to go back on his
commitment to sell the company.
	   ``The credibility of the island is at risk'' if it pulls out of
the deal, said Rossello, who signed a law Wednesday allowing the
sale of a controlling interest in the company to a consortium led
by the U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.
	   Strikers looked like they were making themselves comfortable for
the long haul, setting up makeshift kitchens at picket lines,
bringing TV sets, umbrellas and tarpaulins for shade and even, at
one, a portable swimming pool.
	   A festive atmosphere reigned, with blaring salsa music and
strikers slowing traffic as they sashayed along picket lines.
	   On Thursday, strikers attacked on a new front with a boycott of
Banco Popular, the island's largest bank and part of the
consortium.
	   The Federation of Teachers closed its dlrs 100 million in
accounts. The General Workers' Council withdrew its dlrs 40 million
and said it was encouraging affiliated unions and their 50,000
members to do the same.
	   Meanwhile, the two unions representing telephone company workers
planned to meet Saturday to plot strategy and an umbrella
organization for groups opposed to privatization planned a meeting
for Sunday to consider calling a one-day general strike Monday.
	   Electric and water utility workers joined the strike for a
couple of days this week but services were not much affected.

Dominicans say Puerto Rico farm owners cheat them of pay 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Dominican consulate in Puerto
Rico announced Friday it will investigate complaints by immigrants
from the Dominican Republic that farm owners cheated them of
thousands of dollars in wages.
	   Some Dominicans, especially those who entered Puerto Rico
illegally, have said that some farm owners owe them dlrs 5,000 to
dlrs 6,000 in unpaid wages. Instead of paying them, the owners
report the workers to immigration officials so they are deported,
said Cesar Santana, the Dominican representative in Puerto Rico.
	   Santana said in a statement that the complaints reminded him of
the slavery era and he said he would investigate the reports and
file legal actions against any farm owners who were implicated in
the practice.
	   He urged Dominican farm workers not to allow themselves to be
cheated and said his consulate could provide legal services donated
by Dominican and Puerto Rican lawyers who donate their time.
	   Each month, dozens of Dominicans make the dangerous journey in
small boats across the Mona Passage that separates the two islands
in an attempt to enter the United States illegally. Thousands of
Dominicans also live in Puerto Rico legally.

Marchers protest slaying of Basque councilor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Zamarreno in 3rd and 6th grafs
<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of people marched for
peace Friday, hours after the funeral of a Spanish town councilor
killed in a bomb explosion blamed on Basque separatists.
	   Spanish government ministers and Popular Party representatives
joined Manuel Zamarreno's family to bury the town councilor from
Spain's ruling party.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar also visited Zamarreno's widow
and four sons early in the afternoon before heading to Luxor,
Egypt, to start a five-day visit to the Middle East.
	   ``We need peace,'' read the Basque-language slogan on the banner
at the front of the 3-kilometer (2-mile) march through the northern
coastal city of San Sebastian.
	   National and regional leaders led the procession, which came a
day after Zamarreno was killed and his bodyguard was injured when a
bomb exploded as they walked past a parked motorcycle. The slaying
occurred six months after his predecessor, Jose Luis Caso, was shot
dead in a bar by an ETA gunman on Dec. 11. Both men's lives had
been threatened in graffiti.
	   Although no group claimed responsibility for Zamarreno's death,
authorities immediately blamed ETA, the armed Basque separatist
group that has killed nearly 800 since 1968 in its campaign for the
independence of the Spanish Basque country.
	   Millions of Spaniards marched in July to protest ETA's
kidnapping and killing of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel
Blanco. Aznar's government refuses to deal with ETA, a Basque
language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, until it lays
down arms.

Graf weighs end of Wimbledon career
Eds: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf cracked the thinnest of
smiles and shed no tears, though the hurt was plain on her face as
she weighed whether her loss Friday _ the first in 18 matches
against Natasha Zvereva _ marked the end of her luminous Wimbledon
career.
	   ``I definitely couldn't say right now,'' the seven-time champion
said after falling 6-4, 7-5 in the third round on an ominously
bleak and gusty afternoon that gutted the schedule once again.
	   No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, the only other women's seed to finish a
match, advanced to the fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory
over Maria Alejandra Vento.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter reached the round of 16 by
beating Magnus Gustafsson in four sets, and No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic
completed a four-set, third-round win over Andre Medvedev.
	   Graf will hit the big three-oh a couple of weeks before
Wimbledon next year, a time in life to consider whether she wants
to start a family. A year from now, her surgically repaired knee
will be that much older, and the new wave of players will seem that
much younger.
	   ``It would be nice to play again and, hopefully, be in different
shape and enjoy myself,'' said Graf, who offered a quick wave with
her left hand as she walked off Centre Court. ``But I've learned
enough to take what's coming up next (as it comes). So I don't
know.''
	   She had come back, she said, for one more bowl of strawberries,
one more chance to hold the silver salver aloft as champion. Only
two other players have won Wimbledon more _ Martina Navratilova (9)
and the late Helen Wills Moody (8) _ and Graf knew her time was
running out to catch them.
	   Graf was so emotional over this return that she wept at a news
conference after her first match Monday as she recounted how close
she had been recently to retiring.
	   She had missed a year and played only four other tournaments
this season, but was given a No. 4 seed. Yet no one could discount
her chances after seeing her drop only two matches at Wimbledon
since 1988. ``Fraulein Forehand,'' as she came to be called here,
had been playing Wimbledon nearly half her life since the age of
15, and she knew Centre Court better than anyone.
	   And if anyone was going to run her out, the last person who
figured to do it was Zvereva, the zany Belarussian who splashed
through the puddles on Centre Court last year, who took doubles
more seriously than singles, and who had never forgotten her first
humiliation against Graf _ 6-0, 6-0 in the 1988 French Open final.
	   Blessed with talent and athleticism, Zvereva is famous for
letting her mind and game wander in matches. She doesn't bother
with a coach, sticks a few pins in her untamed hair before going
out on court, fools around more than she practices and goes out to
have fun. She may be the most popular player on the women's tour,
and everyone knows that on any given day she can beat anyone except
Graf. Until now.
	   ``I don't know if this was the 18th or 20th or 25th, but I've
done it,'' Zvereva bubbled. ``Wow! I don't know how, but I've done
it.''
	   She did it by keeping her concentration throughout the match for
a change, keeping the pressure on Graf and never yielding on serve.
In the locker room afterward, the other players teased her
mercilessly about how she finally kept her focus from start to
finish.
	   ``I had to go down on my knees and crawl into (my cubicle)
because they were giving me so much funny looks and stuff,'' she
said. ``It was quite embarrassing.''
	   Graf came out on this gray, drizzily day feeling tight and
nervous. Rain delayed the match about an hour and 45 minutes, and
the warmup was shortened because of the threat of more rain.
Zvereva won the toss and elected to receive, a wise choice since
Graf obviously wasn't quite loose yet.
	   Zvereva broke Graf right away and held serve throughout the rest
of the set as Graf sprayed returns long, wide and into the net.
	   ``In the first set, my return of serve was terrible,'' Graf
said. ``The first few games, I didn't even get one inside.''
	   They played on serve in the second set until Zvereva broke again
for a 6-5 lead and a chance to serve out the match. If ever Zvereva
was going to falter, this was the time. She'd done it before, and
Graf had dug her way out of similar jams.
	   Graf drilled a backhand that Zvereva netted for 15-40, but there
was still no sense that Zvereva was folding. She had a confident
look in her eyes, and Graf still seemed edgy. Graf then slugged a
return long to waste one break point, and Zvereva saved the next
with an overhead.
	   Zvereva ripped a passing shot for match point, but couldn't
capitalize on it. But she got another right away with a volley at
the end of a brilliant rally and closed out the match with a
service winner to Graf's backhand.
	   ``She didn't let down at all at any stage,'' Graf said. ``There
weren't many easy mistakes off of her, like sometimes there are.''
	   Graf's lack of matches coming into Wimbledon are ``probably one
of the reasons why I've been quite nervous and anxious to be out
there,'' she said. ``I have played so little, and for some reason I
cannot find the confidence ... I wish I could have relaxed a little
more.''

World Cup: Most favored teams avoid each other in chase for quarterfinal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with late games
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup quarterfinals beckon and the fancied
teams are avoiding each other. Except Argentina and England that
is.
	   England and Argentina, who fought the Falklands War in 1982,
make up the grudge match of the second round, with only the clash
between mercurial Yugoslavia and the Netherlands getting close in
appeal.
	   In the top half of the draw, Brazil and Italy both won their
groups to make sure there won't be a repeat of the 1994 final in
the second round. Now they won't meet again unless they both make
it the final once more.
	   If the Brazilians beat South American rival Chile at the Parc
des Princes in round two on Saturday they will face the winner of
Sunday's game at Saint-Denis between Olympic champion Nigeria, the
only one of five African nations to make it to the last 16, and
1992 European titlist Denmark.
	   A Brazil-Nigeria quarterfinal would bring together two teams
with hugely talented attacks but suspect defenses.
	   Brazil has quality players like Ronaldo, Bebeto, Denilson up
front with Leonardo, Rivaldo, Cafu and Roberto Carlos attacking
from deep. The Nigerians, who downed a very strong Brazilian team
in the Olympic semifinal two years ago, have Nwankwo Kanu, Victor
Ikpeba, Augustine ``Jay'' Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Tijana Babangida
and Rasheed Yekini among their attacking lineup.
	   Provided the Italians down Norway at Marseille Saturday, Cesare
Maldini's improving team goes to Saint-Denis in the quarterfinal to
meet either host France or Paraguay, who meet Sunday at Lens.
	   An Italy-France quarterfinal looks most likely and that would
mean the freescoring French welcoming back star forward Zinedine
Zidane from a two-match suspension against some of his Juventus
colleagues, including fit-again Alessandro Del Piero.
	   In the other half of the second round draw, Germany topped Group
F to meet Mexico for a place in the last eight and second place
Yugoslavia must face the Netherlands in a matchup of two teams who
have a lot of talent but lack consistency.
	   Banned from the last World Cup as well as two European
Championships because of the nation's involvement in the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, the Yugoslavs made the quarterfinal on their
last appearance in 1990 before going out to Argentina in a penalty
shootout after a 0-0 tie.
	   Germany, a three-time winner and European champion which still
has many of the players who won the title eight years ago, should
have too much experience for the Mexicans.
	   Argentina edged Croatia 1-0 in Bordeaux to finish top of Group H
and force a match against England, which beat Colombia 2-0. Then
follows a tough quarterfinal against the survivor of the
Yugoslavia-Nehterlands match.
	   Romania, which drew 1-1 with Tunisia to clinch group G, will
play Croatia in an all-Balkan clash with the winner getting a
likely quarterfinal match against Germany.

World Cup: England wins 2-0 to gain second round, Colombia out early again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes, trims detail
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Shooting stars Darren Anderton and David
Beckham put England into the second round of the World Cup Friday
in a one-sided 2-0 victory over Colombia that left the South
Americans first round losers again.
	   Although England needed only a tie to guarantee a place in the
final 16, watched from the stands by Prince Charles and Prince
Harry, Anderton drove home a fiercely-struck angled drive in the
20th minute and Beckham curled in a 30-meter free kick nine minutes
later to delight a huge following of English fans at the Felix
Bollaert stadium.
	   The result meant that England finished second behind Romania in
the Group G standings and will meet old foe Argentina in
Saint-Etienne for a place in the last eight.
	   The Colombians go home early for the second time in a row. Their
disastrous 1994 performance led to the shooting to death of Andres
Escobar, who scored an own goal in a loss to the United States, and
was gunned down in his home town of Medellin.
	   Glenn Hoddle's players, beaten by a late goal by Romania in the
previous game, looked impressive against a low-quality Colombian
team whose goalkeeper, Farid Mondragon, prevented a crushing loss
with seven second half saves. Mondragon left the field in tears,
consoled by his colleagues and England goalkeeper David Seaman.
	   ``If we had taken our chances we would have won by four or
five,'' coach Glenn Hoddle said.
	   ``It was a great performance from them. There were positive in
the (locker) room so I did not really expect any other result.
	   ``Overall it was a terrific performance against a side who can
cause you problems but we nullified that,'' the England coach said.
	   ``England were the better team tonight, especially in terms of
their attack,'' said Colombian coach Hernan Gomez. ``Colombia
didn't have much firepower tonight, even when we changed the
tactics. We were't able to open up spaces and England were also
very effective in shutting down our play.''
	   England put together a slick four-man move which ended with a
tame side-footed shot from Graeme Le Saux in the 19th minute before
taking the lead with a far more impressive finish.
	   The Colombian defense struggled to clear a right wing cross and
the ball dropped to the unmarked Anderton, just inside the right
side of the penalty box.
	   The Tottenham winger, who has barely played during the last two
seasons because of a series of injuries, hammered the ball first
time into the roof of the net from an acute angle with Mondragon
powerless.
	   It should have been 2-0 four minutes later when another
well-constructed move involving David Beckham and Anderton saw
Scholes go close and the ball fell to the unmarked Michael Owen who
fired over the top from 12 meters.
	   But the second goal came in the 29th minute in spectacular
style.
	   Paul Ince was brought down 30 meters from goal and Beckham
produced one of his speciality free kicks, curling the ball round
the wall past the despairing dive of 'keeper Mondragon and inside
the left hand post.
	   Colombia came up with its first on-target shot four minutes
before half time, Leider Preciado forcing David Seaman to make a
difficult save at the foot of the near post.
	   The Colombians made three substitutions at half time, including
bringing on a replacement strikeforce of Hamilton Ricard and Adolfo
Valencia with Victor Aristizabal going to operate behind them.
	   But it was still England making the running and Mondragon did
well to make four good saves in the first eight minutes of the
second half.
	   The Colombian 'keeper arched his back to palm over a shot from
Scholes, keep out a header and shot from Shearer and then block
another close-range effort from Owen after defender Sol Campbell
had run through the defense on a 30-meter run.
	   The Colombians had plenty of possession in deep positions but
did little to worry the English defense. They clearly missed star
striker Faustino Asprilla, who was dropped from the squad after
criticizing coach Gomez in a radio interview.
	   Ricard, who plays in England for Middlesbrough, curled a
speculative 20-meter volley just wide of the post as Colombia made
a rare threat with 11 minutes to go.
	   But Owen should have made it 3-0 with seven minutes to go when
he shot straight at Mondragon after Shearer had put him clear. In
the final few minutes, the 'keeper threw himself to his left and
right to keep out more shots from Le Saux and Shearer.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton (Robert Lee, 80th), David Beckham, Paul Ince (David
Batty, 83rd), Paul Scholes (Steve McManaman, 74th), Graeme Le Saux;
Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.
	   Colombia _ Farid Mondragon; Everth Palacios, Jorge Bermudez,
Wilmer Cabrera, Antonio Moreno; Mauricio Serna (Victor Aristizabal,
46th), Harold Lozano, Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincon; Anthony De
Avila (Hamilton Ricard, 46th) Leider Preciado (Adolfo Valencia,
46th).
	   Referee _ Arturo Brizio, Mexico.

Torrance maintains two-stroke lead; Montgomerie launches fightback 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN PAGE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GUYANCOURT, France (AP) _ European tour veteran Sam Torrance
maintained his two-stroke lead in the dollars 800,000 French Open
Friday, firing a second-round two-under-par 70.
	   The round leaves Torrance ten-under par at 134.
	   Italy's Massimo Florioli birdied the 18th to snatch second slot,
after a round of 67 left him eight-under-par at 136.
	   South African Michael Campbell, coming back to form after a
two-year eclipse, shot 67 to share third place at 137.
	   He was joined on 137 by Frenchman Marc Farry, who birdied five
of the last six holes for a score of 67.
	   ``My game is right in the slot,'' a confident Torrance said
after the round. ``I love this course and I was swinging even
better today which is tremendous for my chances this weekend.''
	   The 44-year-old Scot, who has recently shed 28 pounds in weight,
is gunning for a top three finish at Guyancourt which would give
him an exemption into the British Open.
	   Torrance picked up four birdies and two bogeys Friday, and had
four other birdie chances.
	   While Torrance compiled his uneventful round of 70, the
five-time European number one Colin Montgomerie launched himself
into hot pursuit.
	   Starting at the tenth, Montgomerie made seven birdies in 15
holes and dropped only one shot when he three-putted the 17th.
	   On the seventh, a bad bounce on hard ground on the fringe of the
green sent his ball into deep rough, and the frustrated Scot took
two thrashes to get out for a double-bogey six.
	   As he left the green he poked the ground disgustedly with his
putter.
	   The putter-head dropped off and the irascible Montgomerie putted
with his eight-iron to par the two remaining holes for a 68, and a
two-under total of 142.
	   Montgomerie escaped sanction.
	   ``Breaking a putter in anger would be sanctioned under `general
etiquette,''' said tournament director David Garland. ``But
according to witnesses this was not the case.''
	   ``It apparently was the third putter of this type that he has
broken this year,'' Garland added.
	   Montgomerie, eight shots off the pace, hopes to repeat his
performance at the 1996 European Open, when he made up eight shots
on leader Torrance to win.
	   ``I need two 64s. And the way I'm playing I can do that,''
Montgomerie said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Friday that NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in
secessionist Kosovo and said his four days of shuttle diplomacy in
Yugoslavia yielded no magic formula for peace.
	   Fighting intensified in the independence-seeking Yugoslav
province, with Yugoslav forces shelling three villages in western
Kosovo, the ethnic-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported. The
Serbs' Media Center said three people disappeared after making
remarks supporting the Yugoslav army
	   Neighboring Macedonia, meanwhile, accused Yugoslav warplanes of
violating its territory. Defense Ministry spokesman Petar Atanasov
claimed the jets crossed into Macedonia twice on June 19 and once
Tuesday.
	   Fears that Kosovo's war would spread beyond its borders have
been a key impetus of Western mediation attempts.
	   The increasing pressure came as Holbrooke warned both Serbian
security forces and ethnic Albanian militants that their next major
clash could have ``tragic consequences.'' Holbrooke spoke to
reporters at Pristina airport, while fighter jets soared above.
	   Arriving in Kosovo after talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, Holbrooke talked at length Friday with Adem Demaci, an
Albanian who spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for advocating
Kosovo's independence.
	   Unlike the Kosovo Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, Demaci advocates armed struggle for independence. Demaci
declined to comment after the talks.
	   Still, Holbrooke said he does not consider Demaci a link to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist fighters who increasingly
threaten the Serbian security forces' hold on the restive province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   More than 300 people have been killed since March, when Serbian
police began a crackdown against the KLA separatists.
	   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke said.
	   He said a diplomatic corps from dozens of countries would likely
arrive in Kosovo in the next few days to travel the region and
learn what it can.
	   Holbrooke later traveled to Greece, where he repeated concerns
that tension in Kosovo could spread to neighboring countries.
	   ``If a peaceful solution is not found, the fighting that has
already occurred could easily escalate into an international war
that could easily cross borders and spread to Albania, Greece, and
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,'' Holbrooke told a rowdy
crowd during a university commencement address.
	   In Belgrade, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky told Russian journalists that Milosevic agreed to
accept an international observer force. He said the force would try
to revive dialogue between Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders. It is
unclear how large the force would be.
	   Afanasyevsky criticized NATO member countries for sending ``an
incorrect message to the Albanian terrorists that they can do as
they please'' with their demonstration of air power. The NATO
flights over Albania and Macedonia last week were intended to prod
Serbia to scale down its forces in Kosovo so that negotiations
could resume.
	   Serbs have also sharply criticized Holbrooke for appearing for
photos Wednesday with KLA fighters in the western Kosovo town of
Junik.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of Kosovo. Road
travel is increasingly dangerous, with KLA and Serb police
checkpoints blocking normal routes. Daily gun battles are waged for
control of key arteries.

Three share lead in storm-interrupted ShopRite LPGA Classic AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be UPDATED if play is resumed after Sorenstam finishes
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Alicia Dibos, Tina Barrett and
Caroline McMillan beat the thunderstorms around the Bay Course at
the Seaview Marriott Resort Friday and shot 5-under-par 66 to take
the first-round lead at the ShopRite LPGA Classic.
	   Half the field had completed play when violent storms with high
wind and driving rain chased players and spectators from the course
just miles from the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Julie Inkster, Rosie Jones and Tammie Green were one stroke off
the lead at 67, while Jenny Lidback, Barb Mucha, Penny Hammel and
Marianne Morris were at 68 on the links-style layout.
	   Annika Sorenstam was tied for the lead at 5-under-par with three
holes left when play was suspended at 3:53 p.m. (1953 GMT).
	   Donna Andrews, the leading money winner on the tour who has
finished second in her last four starts, was 4-under with two holes
to play.
	   Those with morning starting times not only had the advantage of
getting their rounds in before the storm, but also escaped the
worst of shirt-soaking humidity on a day when the temperature
climbed into the 90s.
	   ``I think I was lucky to tee it up at 8 in the morning when it
was cooler,'' Dibos said after concluding her bogey-free round with
a sand wedge from 107 yards (97 meters) to 20 feet (6 meters) on
No. 18 and making the putt for her fifth birdie.
	   ``I putted well,'' she said. ``I was just comfortable today.''
	   Barrett got her round going with a chip-in for birdie on No. 10
_ her first hole of the day _ and followed that with a another
birdie on the 11th.
	   She could have had the lead outright but three-putted from 30
feet on the final hole for a bogey.
	   ``I miss-read the first putt and just didn't hit the second
one,'' she said.
	   McMillian _ who was Carolyn Pierce when she won the JAL LPGA
Classic in 1996 _ also started her round on No. 10 and also got her
round off the ground with a chip-in, hers coming on No. 13.
	   That was the first of four birdies in six holes by McMillian.
	   ``It was hot but it's hotter now,'' she said. ``There were
pockets of heat out there that were incredible.''
	   The ShopRite is the last stop before the U.S. Open next week.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's Parliament approved an adjusted
budget Friday to account for additional revenue generated by a new
tax on goods and services.
	   Most of the 6.2 billion kuna (dlrs 984 million) windfall will go
toward reducing the 1998 budget deficit of 2 billion kuna (dlrs 33
million) and paying state pensions, employees, and health costs.
	   No breakdown was provided. Details were to be released on
Monday.
	   The budget of 36.8 billion kuna (dlrs 6.4 billion) approved in
November, included revenues of 15.6 billion kuna (dlrs 2.48
billion) from the new 22 percent value-added tax on all goods and
services, which was levied in January. But the tax has actually
generated 21.8 billion kuna (dlrs 3.46 billion) to date.
	   The adjustment was approved by 68 members of the 127-seat
parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by President Franjo
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Opposition parties, who saw most of their amendment proposals
rejected, boycotted the vote.

	   THETFORD-MINES, Quebec (AP) _ Angry asbestos miners jeered and
jostled Canada's human resources minister Friday after he announced
a limited aid package for some of them who had lost their jobs.
	   The laid-off miners pushed Pierre Pettigrew and tried to prevent
him from getting into his car. After he was shoved into the vehicle
by security officials, the miners surrounded the car and rocked it
for several minutes.
	   More than 300 miners lost their jobs when their employer, LAB
Chrysotile, closed its British Canadian asbestos mine in November
after France banned the import of the fire-retardant fiber.
	   Union president Andre Laliberte said the dlrs 1-million (dlrs
680,000 U.S.) aid package will help only 100 of the miners.
	   Asbestos has been under attack for years as a health hazard and
suspected cause of lung cancer. The French government claimed

Mexican stocks, peso end down 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks closed lower Friday,
undermined by weak oil prices and other negative news at home and
abroad. The peso fell to a midrate of below nine to the dollar for
the third time this month.
	   The market's key IPC index closed down 1.8 percent or 76.11
points at 4,157.81 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at
5,229.35.
	   Traded were 53.9 million shares worth 854.7 million pesos
compared to Thursday's volume of 54.8 million shares worth 862.3
million pesos.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent or 8.22 points
to 8,943.80.
	   Depressed oil prices are making another a round of budget cuts
appear more likely, and the possibility of a hike in the price of
electricity and gasoline has increased. Investors worried about the
economies of Asia and Russia.
	   The peso also weakened Friday, despite the Bank of Mexico's move
to a tighter monetary policy, which pushed up interest rates.
	   On 48-hour spot markets in Mexico City, banking leader Banamex
quoted the peso closing at a midrate of 9.038 to dlrs 1, weaker
from both its open of 9.005 and its close of 8.955 Thursday.
	   The peso also had closed below nine to the dollar on June 11 and
June 15.
	   In futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
September contract ended at 9.3985 after closing Thursday at
9.3262. The December contract moved to 9.8328 from 9.7347; March
1999 moved to 10.2459 from 10.1497; June 1999 moved to 10.6157 from
10.5125 and September 1999 moved to 11.0895 from 10.9769.

World Cup: England wins 2-0 to gain second round, Colombia out early again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional. Recasts, adds more quotes
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Was that really England out there?
	   Darren Anderton powered an angled shot that almost took the roof
off the net. And David Beckham bent a 30-meter free kick round the
Colombian wall and inside the left hand post.
	   No, it wasn't Ronaldo or Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Anderton and Beckham were members of a team once ridiculed for
its lack of flair and finesse. Now they're in second round of the
World Cup and in the mood to stop Argentina making it to the last
eight.
	   Although England needed only a tie to guarantee a place in the
final 16, watched from the stands by royal fans Prince Charles and
Prince Harry, Anderton and Beckham delighted a huge following of
English fans at the Felix Bollaert stadium with two first half
spectaculars.
	   The result meant that England finished second behind Romania in
the Group G standings and will meet old foe Argentina in
Saint-Etienne for a place in the quarterfinal.
	   The Colombians go home early for the second time in a row. Their
disastrous 1994 performance led to the shooting to death of Andres
Escobar, who scored an own goal in a loss to the United States, and
was gunned down in his home town of Medellin.
	   If it hadn't been for acrobatic goalkeeper Farid Mondragon, the
Colombians would have lost by an embarrassing scoreline.
	   After making at least seven second half saves, Mondragon left
the field in tears, consoled by his colleagues and England
goalkeeper David Seaman.
	   ``If we had taken our chances we would have won by four or
five,'' coach Glenn Hoddle said.
	   ``It was a great performance from them. There were positive in
the (locker) room so I did not really expect any other result. All
our players got 8-plus out of 10 tonight. We passed the ball
extremely well and we defended the game well.
	   ``Overall it was a terrific performance against a side who can
cause you problems but we nullified that,'' the England coach said.
	   ``England were the better team tonight, especially in terms of
their attack,'' said Colombian coach Hernan Gomez. ``Colombia
didn't have much firepower tonight, even when we changed the
tactics. We were't able to open up spaces and England were also
very effective in shutting down our play.''
	   England put together a slick four-man move which ended with a
tame side-footed shot from Graeme Le Saux in the 19th minute before
taking the lead with a far more impressive finish.
	   The Colombian defense struggled to clear a right wing cross and
the ball dropped to the unmarked Anderton, just inside the right
side of the penalty box.
	   The Tottenham winger, who has barely played during the last two
seasons because of a series of injuries, hammered the ball into the
roof of the net from an acute angle with Mondragon powerless.
	   It should have been 2-0 four minutes later when another
well-constructed move involving Beckham and Anderton saw, Paul
Scholes go close and the ball fell to the unmarked Michael Owen who
fired over the top from 12 meters.
	   But the second goal came in the 29th minute in spectacular
style.
	   Paul Ince was brought down 30 meters from goal and Beckham
produced one of his speciality free kicks, curling the ball round
the wall past the despairing dive of 'keeper Mondragon and inside
the left hand post.
	   Colombia came up with its first on-target shot four minutes
before half time, Leider Preciado forcing David Seaman to make a
difficult save at the foot of the near post.
	   The Colombians made three substitutions at half time, including
bringing on a replacement strikeforce of Hamilton Ricard and Adolfo
Valencia with Victor Aristizabal going to operate behind them.
	   But it was still England making the running and Mondragon did
well to make four good saves in the first eight minutes of the
second half.
	   The Colombian 'keeper arched his back to palm over a shot from
Scholes, keep out a header and shot from Shearer and then block
another close-range effort from Owen after defender Sol Campbell
had run through the defense on a 30-meter run.
	   Ricard, who plays in England for Middlesbrough, curled a
speculative 20-meter volley just wide of the post as Colombia made
a rare threat with 11 minutes to go.
	   But Owen should have made it 3-0 with seven minutes to go when
he shot straight at Mondragon after Shearer had put him clear. In
the final few minutes, the 'keeper threw himself to his left and
right to keep out more shots from Le Saux and Shearer.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell;
Darren Anderton (Robert Lee, 80th), David Beckham, Paul Ince (David
Batty, 83rd), Paul Scholes (Steve McManaman, 74th), Graeme Le Saux;
Alan Shearer, Michael Owen.
	   Colombia _ Farid Mondragon; Everth Palacios, Jorge Bermudez,
Wilmer Cabrera, Antonio Moreno; Mauricio Serna (Victor Aristizabal,
46th), Harold Lozano, Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincon; Anthony De
Avila (Hamilton Ricard, 46th) Leider Preciado (Adolfo Valencia,
46th).
	   Referee _ Arturo Brizio, Mexico.

Holbrooke warns war in Kosovo could spread With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ After four days of meetings with Serbian
and ethnic Albanian leaders, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Friday
repeated his concern that tension in the Serbian province of Kosovo
could spread to neighboring countries.
	   ``If a peaceful solution is not found, the fighting that has
already occurred could easily escalate into an international war
that could easily cross borders and spread to Albania, Greece, and
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,'' Holbrooke told a rowdy
crowd during a university commencement address at the American
College of Greece in Athens.
	   Holbrooke's comments came hours after he left Kosovo following
four days of meetings with Serbian leaders and ethnic Albanians
seeking independence in the southern province. The talks failed to
produce any settlement.
	   Another major clash between Serbian military forces and ethnic
Albanians could have tragic consequences, he said, reiterating
statements he made in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, earlier Friday.
NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in the region, he said.
	   ``We seek a peaceful solution to an explosive situation,''
Holbrooke said.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to sign a peace settlement that ended the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian war, has taken on a diplomacy mission many see as a
last-ditch attempt to stop the Kosovo conflict before NATO acts.
	   Holbrooke also discussed other conflicts in the region. Disputes
between Greece and Turkey and continuing negotiations over the
divided island of Cyprus should top the region's agenda, he said.
	   ``We need to work more effectively here in this region,'' he
said. ``Far worse and more deadly conflicts have been resolved in
the recent past.''
	   Speaking over the boos and catcalls of students, Holbrooke said
Greece and Turkey should take their territorial disagreements over
Aegean islets before the European Court of Justice.
	   ``There is no inherent reason why Greece and Turkey should not
have a lasting peace and thriving relations,'' he said.
	   Turkey's preconditions, including its demand of recognition for
the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, brought
the recent Cyprus talks to a standstill, Holbrooke said.
	   Until his recent nomination to the post of U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, Holbrooke was U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy for Cyprus.
	   He reiterated U.S. support for Cyprus' bid to join the European
Union on Friday. But he drew loud boos from the crowd when he said
the United States also supports Turkey's eventual EU accession.
Turkey repeatedly has said it would consider using force to stop
Cyprus from deploying a Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft system.
	   ``Any use of force would be a disaster to both countries,''
Holbrooke said.

Head of U.S. ticket agency placed under formal investigation

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation Friday _ one step short of
being charged _ for alleged fraud, judicial sources said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, faced an investigation for fraud, falsely reporting
a crime and ``deception over quality and quantity of an offer.''
	   Knittle, 41, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said on customary anonymity.
	   The legal action came after PSI reported the theft of up to
15,000 World Cup tickets on the night of June 17 at its office in
the upscale 16th district of western Paris.
	   World Cup officials later reported seeing the tickets' owners
attending matches.
	   During questioning, Knittle denied the allegations against him,
contending he forgot to tell authorities that not all the tickets
at the office were stolen, the judicial sources said.
	   Three other PSI employees arrested in the case were released
without charges.
	   PSI, an officially sanctioned distributor the World Cup sold
tickets to, had already been under investigation after South
American customers complained they did not receive tickets they
paid for.
	   The World Cup's French organizing committee (CFO) still had yet
to receive a list of the owners or numbers of the tickets that were
allegedly stolen, said CFO spokesman Bruno Travade on Friday.
	   The CFO had filed a complaint June 12 on ``all criminal actions
surrounding ticketing'' of the World Cup, including those alleged
against PSI, Travade noted.
	   ``We know the numbers match-by-match. We were thus able to
observe that the seats sold to PSI were occupied during the
matches,'' he said.

World Cup: Much went wrong for Americans at World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   PORNIC, France (AP) _ They came to the World Cup seeking the
respect of Europe. They left trying to salvage it back home.
	   Soccer in the United States is at its lowest point since 1985,
when America failed for the ninth straight time in World Cup
qualifying. As angry, finger-pointing players left U.S. camp early
Friday, finishing dead last in the 32-nation field, it appeared the
American goal of winning the tournament by 2010 is ludicrous.
	   ``We aren't going to have a world championship, competitive team
for some time to come,'' said U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg, who launched the 2010 project last month.
	   What went wrong for the United States at the World Cup?
	   What didn't?
	   There was no offense and sloppy defense, plus bad attitudes and
TV ratings. Players started whining the moment they reached their
12th century chateau, and kept up the complaints through the 2-0
loss to Germany, 2-1 defeat to Iran and 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia.
	   Veterans, stung by coach Steve Sampson's decision to cut captain
John Harkes in April and angered by their lack of playing time,
saved their best shots for their coach.
	   Now it's unclear whether Sampson will be back, or whether
Rothenberg will replace him before Aug. 23, when he steps down as
president.
	   ``In the rest of the world, you live, you eat, you breathe
soccer,'' Sampson said Friday, ``and that is the only way to be
able to compete with the rest of the world.''
	   Goal scorers are the key, he said. The Americans have just 15
goals in 15 games this year, and just one at the World Cup, against
Iran.
	   ``One message that has to be sent to the national team program
is we need players who are more accurate in front of the goal,''
Sampson said. ``We need star athletes with greater technical speed,
physical speed and great speed of thought. ... These things do not
come easily.''
	   In other words: The current crop isn't doing the job.
	   ``One goal in three games isn't good enough,'' midfielder
Joe-Max Moore said. ``It's not going to get you out of the first
round of the World Cup.''
	   After not qualifying for the World Cup from 1950-90, the
Americans have made it three straight times. They're playing a much
better brand of soccer _ more attacking, less defensive,
maintaining possession more often _ but that hasn't translated into
success.
	   Sampson said the solution for scoring is with youth, that it's
too late for this bunch.
	   ``Those are things that are taught when you are younger,'' he
said.
	   In an effort to improve what the Americans do have, Sampson is
encouraging the top players to leave Major League Soccer and go to
Europe. D.C. United defender Eddie Pope is the most sought-after
American player, and two German teams appear willing to pay a
multimillion-dollar transfer fee to get him. McBride and Cobi Jones
are others who have attracted interest.
	   ``If they have the opportunity,'' Sampson said, ``they should
grasp it and take advantage of it.''
	   Slowly, soccer is starting to grow in America. But Sampson's job
still is different from that of any other World Cup coach, and not
just because of the players. The U.S. leader must be a salesman.
	   ``I'm sure Glenn Hoddle could care less about talking to a state
association president, or taking to a regional director, or an
Olympic program coordinator on how to improve to sport,'' Sampson
said. ``But the U.S. national team coach has to do these things.''
	   Eric Wynalda saw one speck of brightness amidst all the gloom.
	   ``As players, we have to face the fact that we went out on the
field and we lost games and we let people down. ... A lot of people
care now, and that's going to drive us in the future.'' he said.
``It will inspire us that this is the last thing we want to happen
again.''

Grains, soybeans fall sharply on forecasts for hot, humid weather AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CLIFF EDWARDS
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices retreated Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions that hot, humid
Midwestern weather will benefit young crops before a cooling trend
next week.
	   On other markets, natural gas and sugar futures prices advanced.
	   Temperatures in the 90s F (30s C) this week in the key growing
states of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa are expected to result in
growth spurts for crops that had been hindered by cooler than
normal temperatures and excessive rainfall. Traders said they
expect the U.S. Agriculture Department next week to report improved
crop ratings after two weeks of declines.
	   Wheat futures were pressured by news that Iraq had purchased
wheat from U.S. competitors and ahead of active harvesting this
weekend of the winter wheat crop.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 6 1/2 cents to dlrs 3.09 1/4 a
bushel; December corn fell 2 3/4 cents to dlrs 2.64 1/2 a bushel;
December oats rose 3/4 cent to dlrs 1.44 1/4 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 6 cents to dlrs 6.36 a bushel.
	   Natural gas futures contract rose on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid strong demand from utilities needing to power
turbines that generate electricity for air conditioners.
	   With temperatures soaring into the 90s F (30s C) in the key
Midwest and Northeastern consuming regions, and utilities straining
under the demand, natural gas investors expected consumption rates
to rise sharply. Investors said the gains could be short-lived;
temperatures are expected to return to normal next week, greatly
easing demand.
	   August natural gas rose 2.9 cents to dlrs 2.423 for each 1,000
cubic feet.
	   Sugar prices rose sharply on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange in New York as importers took advantage of prices that
recently fell to 10-year lows for bargain shopping.
	   With many sugar producers predicting record harvests and
declining demand in Asia, sugar prices have fallen rapidly this
year. But several countries, including the Ukraine, have reported
declining inventories and are taking advantage of low prices to
stock up.
	   October sugar rose .41 cent to 8.81 cents a pound.

Catholics unite, Protestants feud in Northern Ireland election party's likely share of seats based on latest projections; ADDS expert's attribution and context grafs 5-6 With NIreland-Results 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with half of seats determined graf 2, revises each
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Compromise-minded Protestant
politicians have won barely enough seats in Northern Ireland's new
Assembly to underpin a good start for the Belfast peace agreement,
election returns indicated Friday.
	   With about half of the 108 seats in the new Belfast Assembly
declared, political analysts projected that the major Protestant
party supporting the agreement, the Ulster Unionists, would win the
most seats in Thursday's election.
	   Various experts forecast that the Ulster Unionists should hold
28 to 30 seats when final results are declared Saturday, despite
their share of first-preference votes falling to an unprecedented
low of 21.3 percent.
	   The north's major Catholic-supported party, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, appeared likely to attract more
first-preference votes than the Ulster Unionists to finish on top
of the popular vote for the first time in Northern Ireland history.
	   Projections by electoral expert Sydney Elliott of Queen's
University predicted that the Ulster Unionists would achieve 29
seats _ and would face a 27-strong bloc of anti-agreement
Protestants.
	   Two other Protestant parties that back the deal would bolster
the Ulster Unionists by winning a few other seats, giving the
Assembly the majority support from both Protestant and Catholic
blocs it will require for the passage of key decisions.
	   At several count centers, supporters of the Rev. Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party taunted and heckled Ulster Unionists in
public displays of bitter Protestant divisions.
	   Paisley, who has led opposition to the agreement, insisted that
his party and other Protestants opposed to compromise _ including a
few dissidents elected under the Ulster Unionist banner _ would
make life impossible for Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the
man most likely to lead the Assembly.
	   ``They thought they had us hamstrung and buried,'' Paisley
crowed in his rural North Antrim power base, where he topped the
poll with 10,590 _ and his son, Ian Jr, won a second seat right
behind him.
	   ``And all over Ulster today the DUP is topping the poll! Dublin
is sick! Mr. Tony Blair is sick!'' he said in reference to the
British prime minister. ``And the sickest man of all is David
Trimble!''
	   Paisley, whose party was projected to win 21 or 22 seats _ too
few on its own to block anything, but with likely support from five
members of the stubborn United Kingdom Unionist Party _ predicted
that Trimble soon would be toppled as Ulster Unionist leader.
	   ``There have been problems, no doubt about it,'' Trimble said
outside the count center in his Upper Bann constituency, where he
topped the poll with 12,338 votes _ but his three party running
mates were facing likely elimination.
	   ``We have not had the decisive result I would liked to have
seen. But it's a positive result,'' he said, as Democratic
Unionists shouted ``Rubbish!'' in the background.
	   Despite registering 22 percent of votes, the SDLP was considered
likely to win just 24 seats. The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, its
militant rival for Catholic votes, was expected to win 17 seats
after scoring a new high in its electoral fortunes, 17.6 percent of
votes.

World Cup: Second-half goal by trio of subs gives Romania draw, Group G title 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with coaches' quotes.
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Second-half substitute Viorel
Moldovan buried a loose ball in the penalty area in the 72nd minute
and Romania drew 1-1 with Tunisia Friday night to earn a
second-round World Cup clash with Croatia.
	   The draw gave Romania a 2-1-0 record, seven points and the Group
G title, avoiding a meeting with Argentina. Instead, Romania will
play Croatia in Bordeaux on Tuesday.
	   Moldovan, who replaced Ilie Dumitrescu only five minutes
earlier, finished a play that started when Gheorge Popescu sent a
free kick from midfield into the Romanian end. Adrian Ilie, who
appeared to be offside, chased it down and chipped the ball over
Tunisian keeper Chorki el Ouaer.
	   Tunisian defender Ferid Chouchane headed the ball away, but not
far enough. The ball bounded to Moldovan, who volleyed the ball
into the goal. All three Romanian players involved in the goal were
substitutes.
	   The goal came after 10 minutes of sustained possession and
pressure by Romania, its first consistent offensive effort of the
match.
	   El Ouaer was called on three times to make saves or come way off
his line to clear dangerous balls midway through the second half.
	   The Romanians entered the game perhaps a bit over confident.
	   After pledging to dye their hair if they won their group, the
entire Romanian squad arrived with blond manes while coach Anghel
Iordanescu shaved his head, but wore a white baseball cap to hide
the evidence.
	   ``We had a bad first half and our defense made many marking
errors,'' Iordanescu said. ``Then we started to panic. I'm
responbible for the poor game organization because we tried to rest
some of our standout players.
	   ``Those who replaced them lacked ambition and freshness, they
didn't show they were worthy to play in our team. But we attained
our purpose to finish first and will play Croatia in Bordeaux, a
team which we know very well.''
	   The draw still salvaged some pride for the Tunisians, who
despite losses to England and Colombia avoided a last-place finish.
	   ``We were better organized than the Romanians in the first
half,'' Tunisian coach Ali Selmi said. ``In the second half when
they played offensively we had trouble to stop them. It's good for
us to get back home with one point.''
	   For most of the game the Tunisians were in control and led from
the 10th minute, when Skander Souayah converted a 10th-minute
penalty kick.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   Sellimi got the ball in the top corner of the penalty area, and
pivoted inward to get between Dulca and Anton Dobos. Looking to
recover, Dulca, whose arms were intertwined with the Tunisian
forward, grabbed Sellimi around the left shoulder before he went
down.
	   The goal came as Tunisia was by far the more dangerous team
through the first 45 minutes. The game was only two minutes old
before Mehdi Ben Slimane slalomed through the Romanian defense,
forcing keeper Bogdan Stelea off his line for a sliding block.
	   Stelea was forced into several key saves, intercepting a low
cross from Sellimi in the 19th and grabbing a volley by Kaies
Ghodbane a minute later.

Clinton, at Chinese archeological find, ponders immortality With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix slug.
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Making his way among the terra cotta
warriors buried two millennia ago to protect a Chinese emperor in
the afterlife, U.S. President Bill Clinton wondered aloud about
mortality.
	   He reached out and touched the face of one clay bodyguard, whose
fierce expression was unlike all the others. Each of the roughly
7,000 ancient soldiers and officers _ life-size and so carefully
crafted they appear ready for battle _ were modeled after real
warriors, according to legend.
	   ``Whenever I experience something like this I feel a little more
humble,'' Clinton said Friday while touring the excavation site.
``And I also feel reminded that you have this limited amount of
time on Earth and you have to do what you can to try to help people
make the most of it.
	   After a day of sightseeing in and around Xi'an, the president
went to Beijing on Friday night to prepare for a meeting Saturday
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Clinton's nine-day tour of
China is the first visit to the nation by an American president
this decade.
	   The gray clay soldiers, representing Emperor Qin Shi Huang's
imperial guards, were buried with an array of real bronze weapons,
chariots and terra cotta horses to carry them to war. Earlier
practices called for human sacrifices when emperors died.
	   Qin, by 221 BC, had founded the first unified feudal empire in
Chinese history, creating a central government, a code of law and
formalizing the written language. China is named after him.
	   ``We ... don't imagine as he did that we could preserve whatever
earthly power we have after death,'' Clinton said.
	   The Clinton family, including wife Hillary, daughter Chelsea and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham, were allowed into the excavation pit
for a close look that few tourists are allowed.
	   Later, in a museum gift shop, Clinton and Chelsea couldn't
resist buying a replica warrior head, but only after bargaining
down the price from about dlrs 225 to dlrs 45.

World Cup: Maradona pleased with Argentina's play 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's legendary star Diego
Maradona said Friday he is pleased with his former team's World Cup
play, adding the games had him nostalgic.
	   ``Argentina has rounded out (the first round) with a nice
performance,'' Maradona told a local radio station, refering to the
team's 1-0 victory over Croatia. ``Although the second half was not
what everyone had hoped.''
	   On the team's chances in the second round, the former star said
Argentina ``has a slight edge'' over the tournament's remaining
teams.
	   ``This is not a World Cup rich in individual skill or strong
teams,'' he said.
	   For the first time in four World Cups, Maradona isn't directing
traffic in Argentina's midfield. His number 10 jersey is now worn
by the team's other playmaker, Ariel Ortega.
	   Watching the team's first-round games has made him nostalgic,
Maradona said. His mother, too.
	   ``My mom told me `I'm looking for you on the field','' he said.
	   The presence of a few other World Cup veterans hasn't helped.
	   ``I see Matthaus and Valderrama and I say `why am I not there?''
Maradoda commented.
	   The 37-year-old is expected to travel to France next week where
he will be a commentator for Argentine and Mexican television
stations.

Makers of chemical sterilization pellets halt production 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SISSELN, Switzerland (AP) _ Sipharm Sisseln AG is halting
production of chemical pellets used in the irreversible
sterilizations of more than 100,000 women in poor countries.
	   Executives of Sipharm Sisseln AG, based in Sisseln, Switzerland,
said Friday they took the step because of the controversy that
erupted after the Wall Street Journal reported last week on how the
drug was being used.
	   The drug, called quinacrine, originally was intended to fight
malaria. Inserted into the uterus, it prevents pregnancies by
scarring the fallopian tubes.
	   Quinacrine isn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for use in the United States because of the possible
dangers, including a suggested link to cancer.
	   Nearly all major family-planning organizations, many foreign
governments and the World Health Organization also oppose its use
for sterilization.
	   Sipharm Sisseln Vice President Fritz Schneiter said his company
had nothing to do with the actual use of the pellets. He also said
it hadn't been warned by the WHO about the way the drug was being
used.
	   Sipharm said it has produced around 2 million of the pellets for
the Center for Research on Population and Security and another
organization in the United States, the International Federation for
Family Health. It has also produced one million pellets for the
International Association for Maternal and Neonatal Health in
Switzerland.
	   The U.S. center is run by contraceptive researcher Stephen D.
Mumford, 55, of North Carolina, and his colleague, Dr. Elton
Kessel, 79, of Oregon.
	   They paid for the pellets' manufacture in Switzerland and
arrange for its free distribution in poor nations through a network
of doctors, nurses and midwives. Mumford claims women in Asia
prefer it to surgical sterilization and that it is cheap and safe.
	   Operating on a tiny budget out of Mumford's home, the two hope
to use the drug to curb population growth and limit the flow of
immigrants to the United States.
	   Their primary goal, Mumford said, is to improve the lives and
protect the health of Third World women, almost 600,000 of whom die
each year from pregnancy-related complications.

Kofi Annan says UN prepared for grave responsibility in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: Incorportates LONDON-dated Britain-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday that the
United Nations would carry out its ``grave responsibility'' in
Kosovo if the present intense international efforts to halt the
violence there should fail.
	   ``All our professions of regret, all our expressions of
determination to never again permit another Bosnia, all our hopes
for a peaceful future for the Balkans will be cruelly mocked if we
allow Kosovo to become another killing field,'' Annan told a think
tank in Oxfordshire county.
	   U.N. envoy Richard Holbrooke had just completed four days of
diplomatic efforts in Yugoslavia, but said they had yielded no
magic peace formula and warned that NATO stepped up plans for
intervention in secessionist Kosovo province, where Serb security
forces have been fighting Albanian militants. More than 300 people
have been killed since March.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky also
concluded his diplomatic efforts in Belgrade where he met with
Slobodan Milosevic
	   If international efforts failed to stop the killing, Annan told
the Ditchley Foundation, the Security Council ``will not be slow to
assume its grave responsibility.''
	   He encouraged all steps by the international community to stop
the ethnic repression and the violence by both sides.
	   The Security Council plans to discuss Kosovo on Monday.
Diplomats there said they are awaiting the results of the Holbrooke
and Russian efforts before deciding what to do.
	   Ten days ago, the Security Council approved a one-year extension
for the 34,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the
separate U.N. civilian mission there. Last month, NATO agreed to
maintain its troops in Bosnia for another year. Security Council
approval provides a legal basis for the operation under
international law.
	   Earlier in the day, Britain announced it was giving 1 million
pounds (dlrs 1.64 million) to help refugees displaced in Kosovo and
reiterated its commitment to maintain fighter aircraft in the
Balkans.
	   The International Development Department said the aid money will
be divided between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   The UNHCR will use the money for relief work among refugees in
Albania including accommodation, water supplies and sanitation. The
Red Cross will provide relief in both Kosovo and Albania.
	   The Ministry of Defense said four Harrier GR7 jets would replace
six Jaguar aircraft deployed in Italy, to continue support for NATO
forces. The aircraft, based in Germany, will fly to Gioia del Colle
next week. Four other Harriers _ designed for ground attack _ will
remain on standby for deployment at 48 hours notice, the ministry
said.

Reggae Boyz dance for real 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with late games.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Reggae Boyz finally had reason to dance and
Romanians had justification for a coif correction.
	   A pair of goals from Theodore Whitmore gave World Cup cult
favorite Jamaica its first World Cup victory Friday, beating
hard-luck Japan 2-1 in the final match for both teams.
	   Argentina toppled Croatia 1-0 to win Group H, but it was the
match between the World Cup debutantes in Lyon that had many
captivated.
	   ``Did the road really have to end that quick?'' midfielder
Fitzroy Simpson said. ``I'm really ecstatic at the moment. I'm over
the moon that we can actually leave the tournament on a high.''
	   Elsewhere, Romania showed up for their match with Tunisia
already sporting bleached heads _ fulfilling their pledge to go
blond if they won their group, but before they had done so.
	   They trailed and struggled until the 72nd minute, when Viorel
Moldovan's goal gave them the 1-1 draw they needed to avoid
Argentina in the second round _ and the embarrassment of appearing
overconfident.
	   England advanced to the second round with a 2-0 victory over
Colombia, disappointing the South Americans, who were the only
entrants from their continent not to advance.
	   The road also ended for Japanese coach Takeshi Okada, who
resigned after the third loss.
	   Friday's results completed the second-round pairings, pitting
Argentina against England in Saint-Etienne on Tuesday _ the first
World Cup meeting between the two since the Argentines' ``Hand of
God'' victory in the 1986 quarterfinals. Also on Tuesday, Romania
will face Croatia in Bordeaux.
	   Security officials in Lens, where England played Colombia, were
on heightened alert, wary of the riots that surrounded England's
opening match in Marseille.
	   England had designs on the Group G title until Moldovan combined
with two of his fellow substitutes and volleyed a loose ball in the
penalty area.
	   In Saint-Denis, Moldovan, who replaced Ilie Dumitrescu only five
minutes earlier, finished a play that started when Gheorge Popescu
sent a free kick from midfield into the Romanian end. Adrian Ilie,
who appeared to be offside, chased it down and chipped the ball
over Tunisian keeper Chorki el Ouaer.
	   Tunisian defender Ferid Chouchane headed the ball away, but not
far enough, allowing Moldovan to pounce and equalize.
	   For most of the game the Tunisians were in control and led from
the 10th minute, when Skander Souayah converted a 10th-minute
penalty kick.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   ``We had a bad first half and our defense made many marking
errors,'' Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu said. ``Then we started
to panic. I'm responbible for the poor game organization because we
tried to rest some of our standout players.
	   ``Those who replaced them lacked ambition and freshness, they
didn't show they were worthy to play in our team. But we attained
our purpose to finish first and will play Croatia in Bordeaux, a
team which we know very well.''
	   Unlike the Romanians, the English were in control from the
start.
	   Darren Anderson scored in the 20th minute and David Beckham
curled in a 30-meter free kick nine minutes later as England
cruised past Colombia.
	   The Lens crowd included Prince Charles and his youngest son
Harry, exacerbating security concerns in an already highly
scrutinized match.
	   Earlier, Jamaica gave a victory to their cult following of fans.
	   Ever since they qualified in November as only the third
Caribbean team to reach the finals, Jamaica's ``Reggae Boyz'' were
nearly the longest of longshots but also a fascination among many.
	   ``I am very proud of them,'' coach Rene Simoes said. ``And I'm
sure Jamaica must be. We don't have to be ashamed of anything.
Let's go for the future and 2002.''
	   Their 3-1 loss to Croatia in their opener and 5-0 drubbing by
Argentina ended their second-round aspirations, and dimmed slightly
their following.
	   But Friday's victory gave them only the Caribbean's second
victory in the World Cup, 60 years after Cuba's 2-1 victory over
Romania in Toulouse, France in the 1938 World Cup.
	   Whitmore scored in the 40th and 54th minutes, keeping the
Jamaicans from finishing last in the 32-team field.
	   Japan, which lost 1-0 to both Argentina and Croatia, hit the
post and forced goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence into several saves in the
second half. It finally scored when Naoki Soma's long ball was
headed by Wagner Lopes to Nakayama, whose one-timer from 8 meters
easily beat Lawrence.
	   The goal saved Japan some face, avoiding a possible last-place
finish. It wasn't enough to stop Okada from throwing himself on
soccer's metaphorical sword.
	   ``I will quit as professional coach,'' Okada said. ``When a
coach fails to achieve what he sets out to do, he should quit. It
is my responsibility. I was not able to draw the best out of the
players in this match.''
	   Okada was the fourth coach to lose his job at the end of the
World Cup campaign.
	   In Bordeaux, the Argentines made it to the second round as the
only team not to concede a goal, and even counted on one of their
defenders for some offense.
	   Mauricio Hector Pineda ran onto a deflected ball from Ariel
Ortega in the 36th minute and paused before beating goalkeeper
Drazen Ladic.
	   Argentina controlled the possession and had the better of play.
	   Marcelo Gallardo forced Ladic into a dramatic save in the 45th
minute, blasting a free kick into the wall before chasing down the
rebound and getting another shot at goal.
	   Defender Roberto Ayala slalomed through the defense in the 71st
and curled a right-footer just wide of the post.

IOC official makes plea for public support of 2002 Winter Games

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A top International Olympic Committee
official on Friday asked for more public support for the 2002
Winter Games.
	   Anita DeFrantz, United States representative and vice president
of the IOC, said she didn't mean more public money, but more
patience with local organizers as they map out a budget and
detailed plans for the Games.
	   ``The key is community support because there is a great deal of
work to be done,'' DeFrantz said.
	   She was here with other member's of the IOC's Coordinating
Commission to review the work of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee.
	   ``The scope of the organization and necessary constructions (yet
to be completed) overwhelms us a little,'' said commission Chairman
Marc Hodler, an IOC member from Switzerland.
	   He said that even with the bobsled, skiing and skating venues
built before the city won the bid, ``there is still a lot to be
done.''
	   But DeFrantz asked for the public, press and government
officials to give local organizers some time to nail down specifics
before demanding public disclosure of the dollars to be spent, how
volunteers will be used and other matters.
	   ``We need patience in this period of planning,'' added SLOC
Chairman Robert Garff, following a press briefing.
	   He acknowledged a sense of nervousness and frustration as the
public and government officials await the October release of SLOC's
estimated dlrs 1 billion budget.
	   But Garff described the spending plan as a ``living budget''
that will change as the Games approach. He said the final tally
won't occur until possibly a year after the 2002 Winter Olympics
are over.
	   Local organizers have promised to come in under budget, although
SLOC spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said earlier this year that 2002
risks being remembered as the ``cheap Olympics.''
	   But even if DeFrantz said her plea for support didn't mean a tax
increase, a poll in March indicated taxpayers expect to be asked to
pay.
	   The Deseret News poll found 71 percent are not optimistic that
Utah will host the Olympics without asking taxpayers for more money
on top of the dlrs 59 million already invested in a bobsled and
luge track and other facilities.
	   That same survey, which had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percent, found support for hosting the Games at 67 percent.
	   Pollster Dan Jones attributed the support to the survey taking
place shortly after the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.
	   ``We expect bumps in public support along the way,'' Garff said.
``But we do know that as the Games get closer the people are more
enthusiastic as in other cities'' that have hosted the Olympics.

Kofi Annan says UN prepared for grave responsibility in Kosovo 4 adds Milosevic title 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: Adds Annan's support for rapid reaction force, grafs 7-11. Grf
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday that the
United Nations would carry out its ``grave responsibility'' in
Kosovo if the present intense international efforts to halt the
violence there should fail.
	   ``All our professions of regret, all our expressions of
determination to never again permit another Bosnia, all our hopes
for a peaceful future for the Balkans will be cruelly mocked if we
allow Kosovo to become another killing field,'' Annan told a think
tank in Oxfordshire county.
	   U.N. envoy Richard Holbrooke had just completed four days of
diplomatic efforts in Yugoslavia, but said they yielded no peace
formula and warned that NATO stepped up plans for intervention in
secessionist Kosovo province, where Serb security forces have been
fighting Albanian militants. More than 300 people have been killed
since March.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky also
concluded his efforts in Belgrade where he met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   If international efforts failed to stop the killing, Annan told
the Ditchley Foundation, the Security Council ``will not be slow to
assume its grave responsibility.''
	   Ten days ago, the Security Council approved a one-year extension
for the 34,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the
separate U.N. civilian mission there. Security Council approval
provides a legal basis for the operation under international law.
	   Annan also spoke of his support for a U.N. rapid reaction force,
saying such a unit might have prevented many deaths in Rwanda in
1994.
	   ``I believe that if we are to avert further such disasters in
the future, we need such a capacity, that member states must have
appropriately trained standby forces immediately available, and
must be willing to send them quickly when the Security Council
requests it,'' he said.
	   Led by Canada and the Netherlands, the United Nations agreed two
years ago to establish a small, elite headquarters unit to plan and
command peacekeeping missions.
	   The 4,000-member international rapid reaction force is training
and is to be ready by 1999.
	   But the issue remains controversial. U.S. congressional
conservatives oppose any arrangements that imply a U.N. standing
army _ which they say infringes on the prerogatives of sovereign
states.
	   Earlier in the day, Britain announced it was giving 1 million
pounds (dlrs 1.64 million) to help refugees in Kosovo and
reiterated its commitment to maintain fighter aircraft in the
Balkans. The aid money will be divided between the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the
Red Cross.

Coody leads Crampton, Stockton by one stroke AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
	   CLIFTON, New Jersey (AP) _ The Cadillac NFL Golf Classic is
turning into a true senior event.
	   A year after 61-year-old Bruce Crampton became only the seventh
player in his 60s to win on the Senior PGA Tour by winning here,
another so-called oldtimer is showing the way after the opening
round the dlrs 1.1 million event on Friday.
	   Charles Coody used a new short putter to make eight birdies en
route to a 6-under-par 66 and a one-shot lead over Crampton and
Dave Stockton.
	   The round was only the 12th below par this year for the
soon-to-be 61-year-old Coody, who took last month off after placing
no better than 19th in any event this year.
	   ``I am not going to say I'm surprised,'' Coody said. ``I'm very
pleased I did roll the ball as well as I did. Except for a couple
of shots, I also played pretty well. If I can put it on the putting
surface 16 times, I ought to be able to score well.''
	   The big difference was the putter on a hot and humid day on
which the temperature reached a high of 96, forcing many seniors to
ride carts. For the last nine or 10 years, Coody had been using a
long-handled putter, but he was having problems with his alignment
the past 18 months.
	   Over that time, he has switched to a regular putter five or six
times but had little success, until Friday.
	   Coody rolled in a 15-footer (4 1/2 meters) on the opening hole
for birdie and sank putts ranging from a tap-in to 40 feet in
capping his best round since a 65 in the du Maurier Champions two
years ago.
	   Even on his bad holes, the putter saved him. In bogeying the
par-5, No. 5, Coody hit three trees, but saved bogey by making a
10-footer (3-meters).
	   Coody, who hasn't won since the du Maurier in 1996, wasn't
worried about experimenting with a Bobby Grace putter in the
tournament.
	   ``The reason I was messing around anyway was I wasn't confident
as it was,'' he said. ``How much worse can it get?''
	   Crampton, 62, opened defense of his title with four straight
birdies. He finished with eight birdies and three bogeys.
	   ``I like this golf course,'' Crampton said. ``It requires you to
keep it in play. I always do well here.''
	   Neither Crampton nor Coody were even thinking about winning this
54-hole event yet. In 533 senior events, there have been only seven
60-plus winners, and none since Crampton last year.
	   ``We 60-year-olds are pulling for one another,'' Crampton said.
	   The competition over the final 36 holes could be tough.
Stockton, 56, has always played well at this course, and he did
again on Friday. He had six birdies, a bogey and missed at least
four good birdie chances.
	   Dana Quigley, who finished second in last week's event in
Canada, was in a group of seven players two shots off the lead on
the Upper Montclair Country Club, an old-style course marked by
narrow fairways, trees and small greens.
	   Thirty-eight players finished under par in the opening round,
which was delayed for 58 minutes late in the afternoon because
lighting was in the area.

Calder Trophy to Bruins forward AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Sergei Samsonov wasn't even the Boston Bruins'
most celebrated rookie when he entered the National Hockey League
last season. Now he's the best in the league.
	   Joe Thornton, a 17-year-old center with flowing blond locks, was
the big name in last year's draft when the Bruins took him with the
first overall pick. Samsonov, an 18-year-old left wing at the time,
wasn't taken until the eighth pick but had a big advantage.
	   Experience.
	   His year with the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey
League _ where he also was rookie of the year _ prepared him for
the NHL and gave the Moscow native time to improve his English.
	   Thornton had never played above the junior level, although he
did score 71 goals in 125 games over two seasons.
	   ``I probably had an advantage,'' said Samsonov, who was named
winner of the Calder Trophy for the NHL's top rookie on Thursday
night in Toronto. ``I knew what to expect in this league. It was
probably a little hard for Joe because he didn't know what to
expect.
	   ``But he got better in the second half of the season,'' Samsonov
added. ``There's no question, he's going to be a great player.''
	   Both started the season slowly, and Thornton, who finished with
three goals and four assists in 55 games, didn't show as dramatic
an improvement as Samsonov.
	   Samsonov had only four goals through the first 38 games but
scored 18 in the next 44 and added two goals and five assists in
Boston's six playoff games. He finished as the NHL's top rookie
scorer with 22 goals and 25 assists in 81 games
	   A shifty player, the 5-foot-8 (1.7-meter) Samsonov admitted he
tried to do too much on his own in the first half of the season.
	   ``Somewhere after the Olympic break I was feeling more
confidence. I was getting used to the league and used to my
partners,'' he said.
	   His season in Detroit was his first in North America after
playing the two previous seasons in Russia. In 1994-95, he had 110
goals in 50 games with the Red Army junior team before moving up to
the elite squad.
	   As Samsonov entered the FleetCenter for Friday's news
conference, a Russian song was played over the sound system as he
stopped to watch highlights of himself on the scoreboard in the
middle of the arena.
	   Was he impressed?
	   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I saw that before.''
	   He is the seventh Bruin to win the award, the first since Ray
Bourque in 1979-80. And his coach, Pat Burns, won the Jack Adams
Award as the league's outstanding coach.
	   Samsonov was a runaway winner of the Calder Trophy with 43
first-place votes from 54 ballots submitted by national hockey
writers. Defenseman Mattias Ohlund of Vancouver finished second.
	   ``Of course, I was nervous'' waiting for the announcement,
Samsonov said, ``because I didn't know if I was going to get this
award or not.''
	   He didn't set any goals when the season began and said the award
won't put added pressure on him to improve. He's convinced, though,
that going to the Bruins, who had the NHL's worst record the
previous season, was a good move.
	   ``It was a young team,'' he said. ``I guess it couldn't have
turned out any better.''

	   LENS, France (AP) _ England's dazzling 2-0 win over Colombia in
a do-or-die World Cup match Friday turned a threatened rumble ice with shields, dogs and tear gas guns stood in tight
formation, just in case. But they watched the feared English fans
hoist their girlfriends onto their shoulders and toast their
triumph with bottles of coke.
	   ``Rule Britannia,'' the crowd sang, again and again. For a
change, they chanted to the French police: ``If it hadn't been for
England, you'd be Krauts.''
	   English fans nearly outnumbered the 26,000 inhabitants of this
little northern industrial town, but only a fraction of them had
tickets. The rest gathered in groups around town or roamed the
streets looking for scalpers.
	   Before the game, desperate ticketless fans heaved bottles at the
riot police, who moved them back from the stadium and seized some
of their reserves of beer. Police charged repeatedly, wrestling men
to the ground and arresting them.
	   Dozens were arrested and slightly hurt in a series of small
skirmishes, but police had no immediate details.
	   Many fans drove to nearby towns to find a bar and a television
set. Others sat in quiet clumps listening to the stadium noises and
trying to guess what was happening.
	   Lens, with its bars and businesses shut down, had taken on the
air of the West Bank on a bad day. Helmeted police patrolled the
streets. Columns of paddy wagons and armored trucks parked by the
train station and the stadium.
	   In nearby Lille, where the channel tunnel train from London
stops, fans scuffled with local thugs, and at least three
Englishmen were arrested. Hundreds were turned back at the border
as suspected troublemakers.

Trinidad signs deal with Duva 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A day after filing suit to sever his ties with
Don King, unbeaten IBF champion Felix Trinidad announced Friday
that he had signed a eight-fight deal with rival promoter Dino
Duva.
	   The firstof the eight fights is expected to be a November
middleweight title unification bout against Ike Quartey.
	   The contract calls for one pay-per-view fight and the rest to be
televised on HBO, including a Nov. 14 showdown against the unbeaten
Quartey.
	   ``First Ike Quartey has to get rid of a mandatory (fight),''
Duva said, referring to the WBA champion's expected bout against
Andrei Pestriaev this summer. ``To be honest, I am not too worried
about him losing. After that, it would clear the way for the
fight.''
	   Duva is eyeing Madison Square Garden as the site for the fight,
but may have to look elsewhere since the arena is already booked
for a concert on that date.
	   ``The Garden is my first choice, but if not, some of the casinos
have expressed interest. If it doesn't happen in New York, I see it
happening in either Atlantic City or Las Vegas,'' Duva said during
a news conference Friday.
	   Trinidad will also have at least two fights at home in Puerto
Rico, including a date early next year in 45,000-seat Roberto
Clemente Stadium in San Juan, according to Duva.
	   On Trinidad's hit list of anticipated future foes are Pernell
Whitaker, Julio Cesar Chavez and Oscar De La Hoya.
	   ``Now I know all of these great fights will come,'' said
Trinidad, 33-0 with 29 knockouts, who beat the obscure Mahenge Zula
in his last outing in April.
	   ``I want to send a message to all of them when their times come,
no more excuses, let's get in the ring,'' Trinidad said. ``I will
be waiting for you, one by one.''
	   ``We believe that he has the ability and market ability to earn
dlrs 100 million in his careeer,'' Duva said of the 25-year-old
Trinidad. ``We expect him to reach that before this contract is
over.''
	   In a suit filed in U.S. Federal Court in the Southern District
of New York, Trinidad alleged that his four-year contract with King
expired on June 11. Additionally, he alleged that the promoter
committed at least eight cases of fraud and 50 breaches of the
contract, according to one of his lawyers, Pat English.

By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam, Alicia Dibos, Tina
Barrett and Caroline McMillan dodged the thunderstorms on the Bay
Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort on Friday and shot
5-under-par 66s to share the first-round lead at the ShopRite LPGA
Classic.
	   Sorenstam, who had played 15 holes when play was suspended the
first time, tapped in the putt finishing her round just seconds
before the alarm sounded for the second weather delay.
	   A little more than half the field had finished play before the
second delay.
	   ``It's very important to get off to a good start in a 54-hole
tournament,'' Sorenstam said. ``When we came out after the delay it
was a totally different golf course.''
	   Juli Inkster, Rosie Jones, Betsy King and Tammie Green were one
stroke off the lead, while Jenny Lidback, Barb Mucha, Penny Hammel
and Marianne Morris were at 68 on the links-style layout.
	   Donna Andrews, the leading money winner on tour who has finished
second in her last four starts, bogeyed the final hole and was also
at 68.
	   Those with morning starting times not only had the advantage of
getting their rounds in before the storm hit, but they also were
able to escape the worst of shirt-soaking humidity.
	   ``I'm just really glad to shoot the number I did playing in the
afternoon,'' Sorenstam said.
	   Playing the back nine first, Sorenstam had a tap-in for birdie
on the par-5 16th then made four consecutive birdies beginning on
No. 1. The stretch included four birdie putts.
	   ``My short game really helped me out today,'' Sorenstam said.
``I'm not lagging putts anymore. I'm trying to make them. I'm not
afraid anymore.
	   The other three co-leaders took advantage of earlier tee times.
	   ``I think I was lucky to tee it up at 8 in the morning when it
was cooler,'' Dibos said after she concluded her bogey-free round.
	   Barrett got her round going with a chip-in for birdie on No. 10
_ her first hole of the day _ and followed that with a 4-iron to 15
feet (4 1/2 meters) on the 11th for another birdie.
	   She could have had the lead outright but three-putted from 30
feet (9 meters) on the final hole for a bogey.
	   ``I misread the first putt and just didn't hit the second one,''
she said.
	   McMillan _ who was Carolyn Pierce when she won the JAL LPGA
Classic in 1996 _ also started her round on No. 10 and also got her
round off the ground with a chip-in, hers coming on No. 13 from 20
feet (6 meters).
	   That was the first of four birdies in six holes by McMillan.

Mexico expels three Basque radicals With Spain-Basque Violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has expelled three Basque radicals who
were turned over to Spanish police on arrival in Madrid, newspapers
reported Friday.
	   Mexico's National Immigration Institute announced the action on
Thursday but made no mention of charges against the men in Spain,
saying only that they had overstayed their visas _ or in one case
did not have one.
	   Ignacio Miguel Azcue Beresaluce arrived in Mexico in 1992 on a
three-month tourist visa, according to the institute. He faces
charges in Spain of belonging to an armed group, causing and
explosion and attempted terrorism, the daily El Universal reported,
quoting Spanish officials.
	   Juan Luis Camarero Lopez had no visa in Mexico, the institute
said. He had been sentenced in 1995 to 6 1/2 years in prison for a
terrorist attack, according to the newspaper. He allegedly fled to
France in March 1996 after his appeals were exhausted.
	   Pedro Maria Celarain Oyarzabal admitted having been in Mexico
since 1989 on false documents, the institute said. He was accused
in Spain of involvement in terrorist activity.
	   All three were expelled on Thursday.
	   Rafael Alvarez of the Miguel Agustin Pro Human Rights Center
linked to the Roman Catholic Church criticized the expulsions,
saying the men had a right to a judicial hearing in Mexico before
being expelled.

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs UNITED STATES: Judge backs FBI in bomb case against Puerto Rican professor 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A federal judge ruled Friday that a statement FBI
agents say they got from a University of Puerto Rico professor may
be used at his trial on bombing charges.
	   U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning said she believed FBI agents
who testified Thursday that Professor Jose Solis Jordan made the
statement voluntarily last Nov. 6.
	   Solis said he made no statement and was asking for a lawyer last
Nov. 6 when the agents say he was telling them about the 1992
bombing of a Chicago Army recruiting station.
	   Manning also said she was skeptical about a Solis claim that he
didn't understand a document he signed agreeing to answer FBI
questions and waiving his right to an attorney.
	   The 45-year-old professor, who has a doctoral degree from the
University of Illinois and is fluent in both English and Spanish,
said Thursday he didn't know what the paper meant.
 &UR; MONTSERRAT: Area may be resettled as volcano quiets down
	   ST. JOHN'S, Montserrat (AP) _ The government is considering the
resettlement of the community of Salem on this volcano-ravaged
island, a government spokesman said Friday, one day after a
memorial service marking the anniversary of the volcano's deadliest
eruption.
	   Herman Sergeant, spokesman for the Office of the Chief Minister,
said the government will make a decision about allowing people to
return to Salem, a community on the west-central part of the
39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) Caribbean island after
scientists finish a report on the activity at the Soufriere Hills
volcano.
	   Sargeant said decisions about returning to the evacauated areas
of the island are now made with far more caution because of events
of a year ago.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of residents overflowed the Brades
Pentecostal Church for a memorial service for more than a dozen
people swept to their deaths by a sudden eruption last year.
	   ``What happened on June 25 of last year is still very vivid,''
said Sargeant. ``It has made a lasting impression, I think, on how
we live our lives. It taught us not to take nature lightly.''
 &UR; SOUTH AFRICA: Body of missing Cuban doctor found
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The body of a Cuban doctor
missing since Sunday was found floating in a dam, with his hands
tied and two bullet wounds in his chest, police said.
	   Dr. Pedro Orestes Rodriques Sanchez' body was retrieved from the
dam near the Free State provincial capital of Bloemfontein on
Thursday.
	   Police Superintendent Charles Johnson said Friday police
believed Sanchez was killed by robbers.
	   ``We have good leads and hope to make arrests soon,'' Johnson
said.
	   On Tuesday, Sanchez' burnt out car was found in Bloemfontein's
South Park cemetery.
	   Sanchez and his wife, who is also a medical doctor, came to
South Africa after the health ministry recruited several hundred
Cuban medical professionals to boost its under manned services.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: More outages reported as telephone strike drags on
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters slashed more telephone
cables Friday, cutting service to hundreds more people even as
managers working on repairs threatened to join a strike against
privatizing the state telephone company.
	   ``Many of them (managers) have indicated that if things continue
as they are, they are not going to work and will join the
picketers,'' Angel Solis, president of the Bonafide Association of
Telephone Management Employees, said on the ninth day of the
strike.
	   Managers were against selling the company, too, he said. They
also fear losing jobs in the inefficient company that has about
6,400 workers and 1,500 managers.
	   Telephone company president Carmen Ana Culpeper denied managers
were considering striking. She praised the dedication of some 300
who have been sleeping in their offices, held virtual prisoner by
picketers.
	   Police reported several hoax bomb threats Friday, the day after
a homemade bomb planted at a branch of Banco Popular exploded in a
police officer's hands, tearing off a finger and wounding the other
hand and leg.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Immigrant farm workers say they were robbed by
employers
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Dominican consulate in Puerto
Rico announced Friday it will investigate complaints by immigrants
from the Dominican Republic that farm owners cheated them of
thousands of dollars in wages.
	   Some Dominicans, especially those who entered Puerto Rico
illegally, have said that some farm owners owe them dlrs 5,000 to
dlrs 6,000 in unpaid wages. Instead of paying them, the owners
report the workers to immigration officials so they are deported,
said Cesar Santana, the Dominican representative in Puerto Rico.
	   Santana said in a statement that the complaints reminded him of
the slavery era and he said he would investigate the reports and
file legal actions against any farm owners who were implicated in
the practice.
	   Each month, dozens of Dominicans make the dangerous journey in
small boats across the Mona Passage that separates the two islands
in an attempt to enter the United States illegally. Thousands of
Dominicans also live in Puerto Rico legally.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Haitians protest immigration policy
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Denise Metayer braved stormy weather Friday to
protest congressional inaction on a bill that would allow many
illegal Haitian immigrants to apply for permanent residency in the
United States.
	   ``Everyone gets justice in this country except Haitians,'' Ms.
Metayer said in her native Creole during a boisterous protest
Friday in front of a federal immigration office.
	   After spending years in the United States, many Haitian
immigrants could face deportation if Congress fails to pass a law
allowing them to apply for green cards.
	   About 200 protesters rallied in Miami and demonstrations were
planned in Orlando, Boston and New York.
	   Haitian immigrants were left out of a law passed last year that
opened the citizenship door to Central Americans. They want to be
able to apply for green cards.

World Cup: Second-half goal by trio of subs gives Romania draw, Group G title 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional.
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Overconfidence shouldn't be a problem
for Romania the rest of the World Cup. They each have a head of
bleached hair that can serve as a several-month reminder.
	   Showing up for their final group match against Tunisia, the
Romanians all sported blond manes, a pledge they made to themselves
for winning Group G. the only problem was they needed a draw to
achieve it, and for 71 minutes, that was in doubt.
	   Second-half substitute Viorel Moldovan buried a loose ball in
the penalty area in the 72nd minute and Romania managed a 1-1 draw
with Tunisia, earning a second-round clash with Croatia.
	   The draw gave Romania a 2-1-0 record, seven points and the Group
G title, avoiding a meeting with Argentina. Instead, Romania will
play Croatia in Bordeaux on Tuesday.
	   ``The poor organization of our defense in the first half was due
to the changes I decided to make,'' said Romanian coach Anghel
Iordanescu, who shaved his head as part of the pledge. ``This
almost derailed the game of the entire team in general. Those who
replaced (the best players) lacked ambition and freshness.''
	   Moldovan, who replaced Ilie Dumitrescu only five minutes
earlier, finished a play that started when Gheorge Popescu sent a
free kick from midfield into the Romanian end. Adrian Ilie, who
appeared to be offside, chased it down and chipped the ball over
Tunisian keeper Chorki el Ouaer.
	   Tunisian defender Ferid Chouchane headed the ball away, but not
far enough. The ball bounded to Moldovan, who volleyed the ball
into the goal.
	   Moldovan's goal came after 10 minutes of sustained possession
and pressure by Romania, its first consistent offensive effort of
the match.
	   Iordanescu's plan to rest strikers Adrian of Valencia and
Coventry's Moldovan and three other regulars almost cost the
Romanians the first place in Group G, as substitute strikers
Dumitrescu and Marius Lacatus failed to dent the Tunisian back
line.
	   For most of the first half, the Tunisians were in control and
led from the 10th minute, when Skander Souayah converted a
10th-minute penalty kick.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   Sellimi got the ball in the top corner of the penalty area, and
pivoted inward to get between Dulca and Anton Dobos. Looking to
recover, Dulca, whose arms were intertwined with the Tunisian
forward, grabbed Sellimi around the left shoulder before he went
down.
	   The goal came as Tunisia was by far the more dangerous team
through the first 45 minutes.
	   Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea was forced into several key
saves, intercepting a low cross from Sellimi in the 19th and
grabbing a volley by Kaies Ghodbane a minute later.
	   For the Tunisians, the result was some consolation after
disappointing losses to England and Colombia that cost Polish-born
coach Henry Kasperczak his job.
	   ``The first half was the best moment we had out of the three
matches. We had to go home with honor, having scored at least one
goal,'' coach Ali Selmi said.
	   For at least 71 minutes, there was even hope of victory.
	   ``Against Romania, we showed the best side of Tunisian soccer,''
Defender Ferid Chouchane said.
	   And, for some, the Tunisians carried the honor of the Arab
world.
	   ``In the first match against England, we were playing at a
disadvantage, against a team that had more experience. Against
Colombia, we weren't able to put our best foot forward,'' striker
Adel Sellimi said.
	   ``But in this match, I think our play can be a source of pride
for Arab soccer, in general. If we had played like this from the
start, we probably could have advanced to the second round. But we
were tricked by a lack of experience and a lack of confidence.''

Princess Anne helps celebrate Fredericton's anniversary 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) _ Princess Anne unveiled a
plaque commemorating Fredericton's 150th anniversary Friday as part
of her visit to the province.
	   The princess, dressed in an ice-green two-piece suit with black
accessories, entered City Hall immediately after the ceremony for a
private reception with city councilors.
	   Holly Phillips, 10, of Devon, New Brunswick, was one of the
determined few who waited in a light rain for the princess to
re-emerge 30 minutes later.
	   Phillips waved a pink hand-drawn heart that read: ``Welcome
Princess Anne to Fredericton. Enjoy your stay here.''
	   The princess stopped and accepted the gift from Phillips and her
9-year-old friend Mariska Kolijn.
	   ``It was surprising because she was just about to sit down,''
said Phillips. ``She looked different. She looked taller. I thought
she was short, but she's pretty tall.''
	   Anne also spent the day sharing her love of horses with a
handful of disabled at the Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation.
	   She visited members of the Fredericton Therapeutic Riding
Association, which teaches the disabled to ride horses.
	   She spoke at length with participants about the benefits of the
riding program, impressing them with her interest.
	   ``She seemed genuinely interested in horseback riding,'' said
Stephanie Pollack, a 27-year-old Fredericton resident who was born
with cerebral palsy. ``From what I've heard it is a love of hers.''
	   The princess is president of the Riding for the Disabled
Association and has been a passionate rider from early on, having
competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympics with the British equestrian
team.
	   Her tour of New Brunswick continues this weekend in Moncton and
Shediac.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton was in Beijing
Saturday for a welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, site of
China's crackdown against democratic protesters nine years ago.
White House officials promised that Clinton, in talks with Chinese
leaders, would protest as ``thoroughly unacceptable'' the latest
arrests of dissidents. In unusually blunt terms, Clinton's national
security director called China's human rights record ``terrible.''
The welcoming ceremony, in which Clinton was to review a regiment
of the People's Liberation Army early Saturday, stirred protests in
America and a congressional resolution urging Clinton not to step
foot in the plaza. No remarks were scheduled at the ceremony
outside the Maoist-era Great Hall of the People. Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin were to confer inside the Great Hall
and meet with reporters. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Compromise-minded Protestant
politicians won just enough seats in Northern Ireland's new
cross-community Assembly to guarantee a strong start for the peace
agreement, election returns indicated Friday. With about half of
the 108 seats in the Belfast Assembly declared by nightfall,
political analysts projected that the major Protestant party
supporting the April 10 accord, the Ulster Unionists, would win the
most seats in Thursday's election. Still, their lead over
Protestant parties against the peace deal looked uncomfortably
narrow. The Assembly is the linchpin of the Northern Ireland peace
accord. If it takes hold, Northern Ireland's divided politicians
will largely govern their own affairs for the first time since the
British government imposed ``direct rule'' from London in 1972.
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Friday that NATO has stepped up plans for intervention in
secessionist Kosovo and said his four days of shuttle diplomacy in
Yugoslavia had yielded no magic formula for peace. Fighting
intensified in the independence-seeking Yugoslav province, with
Yugoslav forces shelling three villages in western Kosovo, the
ethnic-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported. The Serbs'
Media Center said three people disappeared after making remarks
supporting the Yugoslav army. Neighboring Macedonia, meanwhile,
accused Yugoslav warplanes of violating its territory. Defense
Ministry spokesman Petar Atanasov claimed the jets crossed into
Macedonia twice on June 19 and once Tuesday. Fears that Kosovo's
war would spread beyond its borders have been a key impetus of
Western mediation attempts. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Security forces burned the offices of Togo's
main opposition leader and attacked one of his aides Friday,
witnesses said, while activists demanded the president's ouster
after his disputed re-election. President Gnassigbe Eyadema's party
proclaimed him winner of elections Sunday in this west African
nation after the country's top electoral officer resigned.
Gilchrist Olympio was declared runner-up. Security forces responded
to Friday's demonstrations by setting Olympio's campaign offices on
fire. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of
retribution, also said soldiers and police attacked Bob Akitani,
vice president of Olympio's party. Akitani was said to be
hospitalized with serious injuries, though no further details were
available. (TOGO)
	   KFAR FALOUS, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon gave a tumultuous welcome
Friday to 55 prisoners released by Israel, some of them held for 13
years, in a swap that revived talk of peace between the two foes.
Thousands of men and women surged forward to greet them, showering
them with rice and rose water in a traditional Arab welcome. Others
blew kisses and shouted ``God is great.'' Some of the prisoners,
who were held without trial on suspicion of aiding guerrillas
fighting Israel, broke down in tears as they crossed over from the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. The rare exchange
prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to urge Lebanon
to negotiate an agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from
southern Lebanon. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Standard and Poor's 500 set its second
record high in a week, but most stocks rose only modestly Friday as
the market turned cautious again after surging higher earlier in
the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 8 points to
8,943 after giving back most of an early 56-point gain. It was the
fourth gain in a row for the Dow, but the second straight session
in which the blue-chip barometer retreated into the close, barely
finishing higher. Broad-market indicators were mixed, with
advancing issues outnumbering decliners by only a narrow margin
overall. Still, the S and P 500 posted enough of a gain to erase
Thursday's small drop and top Wednesday's all-time high of
1,132.89, which was the measure's first closing record in two
months. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer,
is suggesting creation of a new alliance of oil exporters that
would stand ready to guide prices by direct intervention in the
markets. The remarks by Saudi oil minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi,
carried in Friday's Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, came a
day after OPEC reached an agreement to cut production in the face
of slumping prices. Naimi told the Financial Times that the new
alliance would not mean the immediate demise of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries but said the existing OPEC system had
become outdated. Naimi declined to specify which countries he would
like to see in the group but told the Financial Times there were
``eight or nine countries that have the reserves, production
capacity and dependence on oil revenues.'' (US-OIL ALLIANCE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is confident it will obtain a new
International Monetary Fund loan and that negotiations can be
wrapped up in a month, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said
Friday. Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion from
international lenders to shore up its struggling economy and
restore confidence in the stock market. The release Thursday of a
delayed installment of an existing dlrs 9 billion IMF loan failed
to boost the jittery market, which closed 4.97 percent lower. Heavy
selling on the treasury market prompted the Central Bank to raise
key interest rates to 80 percent from 60 percent. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. and the
debt-plagued Long-Term Credit Bank announced Friday that they were
working on a merger that would create Japan's second-largest bank.
The banks said that the agreement would help them compete in an age
of increased foreign competition as Japan introduces its
much-vaunted ``big bang'' deregulation measures. Though bank
officials referred to the deal as a merger, the scant details of
the plan released Friday indicated Sumitomo would buy out LTCB's
sound loans and leave the problem debts to be handled by the
government. Analysts saw the move more as a litmus test of Japan's
ability to stabilize its financial system than as an example of
entrepreneurial savvy. (JAPAN-TROUBLED BANK)
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ CBS Corp. is selling off the remainder of
Westinghouse Electric Co. to a joint venture led by Morrison
Knudsen Corp. for about dlrs 1.2 billion, completing the
dismantling of what was once one of the United States' largest
industrial companies. CBS said Friday it will sell Westinghouse's
nuclear power and government operations for dlrs 238 million in
cash and about dlrs 950 million in assumed liabilities and other
obligations. Morrison Knudsen, based in Boise, Idaho, is aligned
with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., which will be a minority partner.
Westinghouse bought CBS in 1995, but took the media company's name
in December while pursuing a plan to shed all of its industrial
businesses. Westinghouse's nuclear power business is the world's
largest. It also supplied the reactor for the United States' first
nuclear power plant in 1957. (US-CBS-WESTINGHOUSE)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African currency
plunged nearly 6 percent against the U.S. dollar Friday, recording
its biggest single-day drop. By the close of most business in
Johannesburg, the rand was quoted at 5.96 to the U.S. dollar, from
5.58 on Thursday. The rand began the year at 4.86 to the U.S.
dollar. Analysts said the currency was under heavy attack from
international speculators Friday and the South African central bank
appeared to have insufficient reserves to intervene. Reserve Bank
governor Chris Stals, attending a state dinner for visiting French
President Jacques Chirac, refused to comment on reports that the
U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had been asked to
intervene in favor of the rand. Traders in Johannesburg, London and
New York insisted that the British and U.S. central banks had been
in the market, briefly stabilizing the rand until speculators
stepped up their onslaught. (SOUTH AFRICA-CURRENCY CRISIS)

British government wins appeal in first beef on the bone case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Three Scottish judges on Friday
upheld a government appeal in the first case that challenged its
ban on sales of beef on the bone.
	   The government announced the prohibition on T-bone steaks and
rib cuts in December, after scientists said consumers who eat beef
cooked on the bone had a small risk of contracting the human form
of the brain-wasting bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease.
	   Hotelier Jim Sutherland was prosecuted after serving roasted
beef ribs to 180 people at a dinner for farmers at a hotel in
southern Scotland on Dec. 22, five days after the ban became law.
The case was thrown out of court in Scotland in April, after
Scottish Sheriff James Paterson called the law ``defective'' and
``manifestly absurd.''
	   The government appealed and on Friday the three appeals judges
said Paterson was wrong. They also ordered the case be sent back to
the sheriff for a decision on other legal aspects of the ban,
including a defense argument that the ban was made after inadequate
consultation.
	   ``While we are disappointed that the appeal has been upheld, the
case is far from over,'' said David Kidd, from the law firm
representing Sutherland.
	   Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham insisted the regulations
were essential to protect public health.
	   ``Following today's judgment the regulations remain in force and
should continue to be observed and enforced,'' he said.
	   The European Union banned British beef exports in March 1996,
after the government's scientific advisers concluded that mad cow
disease was the most likely source of a new strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable human brain ailment.
	   Early this month, the European Commission declared British beef
safe again and recommended the ban be lifted under strict
conditions.

Singh takes lead, but Woods back in contention AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be UPDATED with later scores
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Vijay Singh has been trying putter after
putter the past few weeks, never quite finding one that works. He
might want to hold onto the one he's using now.
	   Singh had seven birdies Friday, including one on his last hole,
to take the lead midway through the Western Open with an
8-under-par 136. First-round leader Greg Kraft and Lee Janzen,
still in the form that won him the U.S. Open last weekend, were one
stroke back in the dlrs 2.2 million Motorola-sponsored event at Cog
Hill's Dubsdread course.
	   Tiger Woods, who began the day 4-over and in danger of missing
the cut, eagled the ninth hole and birdied the 10th, 11th and 12th
holes to get back into contention. He was at 2-under with two holes
left to play.
	   ``This week, I've picked up a new putter and I'm just stroking
the ball so much better. And I've gone cross-handed,'' said Singh,
who shot 68 for the second day in a row. ``You just make a few
putts, and all of a sudden you're leading the golf tournament.
That's how close it was. I just hope it keeps going.''
	   Joe Durant was tied with Singh at 8-under with five holes left
to play.
	   Skip Kendall picked up three strokes to finish three behind
Singh at 5-under-par 139. The biggest move came from Clarence Rose,
who started the day 2-over but shot a 66 to finish at 4-under 140.
	   The temperature and humidity soared during the afternoon.
Players' shirts were sopping wet from almost the time they stepped
on the course.
	   Even guys from hot spots like Arizona and Florida were
suffering.
	   ``There was a spell there on the first nine holes where I
couldn't think of any time I've been that hot on a golf course
before,'' said Janzen, who lives in Orlando, Fla. ``I was just
drenched.''
	   It was so uncomfortable, Singh said, that he had trouble
concentrating.
	   ``My caddy said, `You've got to just buckle down there and do
it. This is the first time we've been in contention for awhile.
Don't let it slip away,''' said Singh, who won the Memorial
Tournament and Buick Open last year. ``Right now, that's the key
factor, how you manage with the heat.''
	   Singh, who started off No. 10, looked as if he was going to
succumb to the heat on the second nine. His drive went into the
rough just below the green on No. 4, and he put his second shot
just off the green. He used a 3-wood to chip on and then made a
6-footer (1.8 meters) to save bogey.
	   The fifth hole didn't look much better as Singh's drive went
into the rough again. He got back into the fairway and then hit a
beautiful 9-iron to the green that left him about 25 feet (7 1/2
meters) from the pin.
	   He sank the tough, uphill putt for a birdie, putting him
6-under. The crowd cheered, and Singh smiled in relief. He picked
up another stroke on the next hole, a par-3, and then birdied the
last hole.

Ferraris changing to challenge McLarens 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; will be updated with trials about 1200 GMT
By SALVATORE ZANCA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) _ The Ferraris are changing with the
times and the times are improving.
	   Sunday's French Grand Prix is the eighth race of the Formula One
series and begins a hectic period with four races over the next
five weeks and reliability will be key.
	   Over the first few races of the season, the McLaren-Mercedes
were making a mockery of the championship race with the Ferraris
behind.
	   Michael Schumacher failed to finish the first race of the season
while the McLarens dominated so much that Mika Hakkinen was the
winner in a friendly _ but highly criticized _ agreement between
him and teammate David Coulthard.
	   But in the last two races, Schumacher won once and teammate
Eddie Irvine finished third. Although Hakkinen also won a race for
McLaren he failed to finish the other and Coulthard dropped out in
both Canada and Monaco.
	   Schumacher is looking for the Ferrari to continually improve
with new equipment and get closer to the McLarens.
	   ``We have a new adaptation of the front wing that I used in
Montreal,'' Schumacher said. ``We also have a new floor and
sidepods which are new since Canada.
	   ``After the short run that Eddie did with them at Maranello on
Monday, things look quite promising,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``As expected, after the results of last week's test here, it
seems that we can now close the gap to the front,'' he said.
	   Irvine came within a tenth of a second of Hakkinen's time in
Friday's free practice. Hakkinen led the unofficial session with 1
minute 16.515 seconds with Irvine right behind at 1:16.597.
Schumacher was fifth with 1:17.429.
	   Third was Coulthard, 1:16.707 with Heainz-Harald Frentzen fourth
in 1:17.026.
	   Saturday is the official qualifying and Schumacher hopes to get
even closer to the McLarens.
	   ``Since the beginning of the year, it's pretty clear the
direction it's going,'' said Schumacher. ``What wasn't clear after
Canada was whether we've closed the gap or whether it was lucky
circumstances due to the weather or whether our car was working
good and their cars wasn't.''
	   Although Schumacher hasn't won a pole position all year, he has
won two races and is still in contention for the driving title.
	   Hakkinen, with 46 points, has a 12-point advantage over
Schumacher. Coulthard is third with 29 in the driver's standings.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, enters Sunday's
French race on a roll. In addition to the Canadian victory three
weeks ago, he has won three of the last four French races here.
	   Schumacher feels he is close enough to challenge in a race.
	   ``Even if they are a couple of tenths ahead, I wouldn't be
worried because in the race you can play different games and you
close the gap,'' Schumacher said.

Graf out of Wimbledon and many wonder if she'll ever return
Eds: RECAPS previous; play to begin at 1000 GMT on outside court
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ It's easy to believe that Steffi Graf
may have played her last match at Wimbledon.
	   The seven-time champion, playing only her fifth tournament in a
year filled by knee surgery and other nagging injuries, went out
Friday at the All England Club to Natasha Zvereva, a player she'd
beaten in all 17 previous matches.
	   Zvereva of Belarus won 6-4, 7-5 in the third round. The
fourth-seeded Graf played well enough, but Zvereva _ known mostly
as a doubles player _ won with the ``best match of my life,'' she
said.
	   The 29-year-old Graf fended off questions about her future and
waved politely as she left Centre Court. It's match to match now,
she said, and she hedged whether she'd return to Wimbledon.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' said Graf, whose 21 Grand
Slams stand her No. 2 behind Australian Margaret Court.
	   ``I definitely couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play
again. Hopefully, I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy
myself. But I've learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   Graf was upbeat after the loss, contrasted with the scene after
her first match Monday when she broke down crying _ overcome by
being back at Wimbledon after missing last year.
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   Graf struggled from the beginning in the rain-delayed match on
Centre Court. She double faulted six times, returned poorly and was
often a step behind Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   ``Every time I go on the court I start playing nervously in the
beginning. Clearly it's a lack of matches. Every time it was
important I didn't play the points well at all.''
	   ``I didn't have high expectations as maybe other people had,''
she said. ``I mean, I just didn't... I just play form match to
match.''
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
lopsided in tennis including a 6-0, 6-0 hammering of Zvereva in the
1988 French Open final. Zvereva never recovered as a singles player
but has won 18 Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   ``I don't know if this was the 18th or 20 or 25, but I've done
it,'' Zvereva said. ``Wow! I don't know how, but I've done it.''
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon and the third cut short by
on-and-off light showers with only a dozen singles matches
completed. And Satuday was iffy with showers _ and even hail _ in
the forecast.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento, while No. 6 Monica Seles was leading Yayuk Basuki 6-2 when
the match was suspended.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1. No. 14
Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0 third-round
win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion and top seed Pete Sampras never got on court
for a testing third-round match against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.
	   Weather permitting, No. 1 seed Martina Hingis was to face Elena
Likhovtseva of Russia to open Centre Court play in the third round.
That match was followed by Britain's Tim Henman against Byron Black
of Zimbabwe. Sampras faced Enqvist in the third match on Centre
Court.
	   On Court No. 1, third-seed Petr Korda opened against Jerome
Golmard of France in the third round.

World Cup: England gets best on pitch, avoids worst off it 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England produced the best on the pitch and avoided
the worst off it. For players and fans, the reward was a
second-round World Cup match against Argentina next Tuesday.
	   England can look back on its 2-0 victory over Colombia on Friday
with confidence, yet what loomed ahead was a match against the
World Cup's only perfect defense and a prolific strikeforce.
	   For their part, the Argentines beat Croatia 1-0 to win Group H
and become the only team to make it through the first round without
allowing a goal.
	   Around the stadium in northern Lens, English fans produced
several ugly incidents but, fortunately, didn't achieve the level
seen earlier in the tournament.
	   On the cheerful side, Jamaica's Reggae Boyz earned their
first-ever World Cup victory, beating hapless Japan 2-1 and setting
off wild celebrations around the stadium in Lyon. Both were
eliminated from Group H and the Japanese coach resigned.
	   Tunisia earned its first point in the competition, taking an
early lead against Romania at the Stade de France and holding on
for a 1-1 draw after allowing a goal from Viorel Moldovan.
	   Without catching its breath after the first round, the World Cup
was to start the single-elimination phase Saturday with defending
champion Brazil meeting Chile in a highly charged South American
duel at Paris' Parc des Princes.
	   The losing finalist of four years ago, Italy, was favored to
beat Norway in southern Marseille.
	   The southern port city had been the scene of the worst
hooliganism so far when England played Tunisia in the second week
and police kept a tight lid on Lens Friday night, where England
faced Colombia.
	   Scores of English fans pelted police with beer cans despite a
tight security clampdown around the State Felix Bollaert, where
Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry were in attendance.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local French North African youths. In all, several dozen fans were
detained.
	   On the field, Darren Anderton drove home the opener with a
scorching drive high into the net. And later, David Beckham bent a
30-meter free kick round the Colombian wall and inside the left
hand post. The two goals showed the poise and flair that critics
long claimed England didn't possess.
	   ``It was a great performance,'' Hoddle said.
	   Argentina's coach Daniel Passarella was just as pleased with
Argentina's performance, which included not conceding one goal in
three games.
	   Even the lone score came from a defender Friday.
	   After Ariel Ortega split Croatia's defense with a deep pass
deflected off sweeper Zvonimir Soldo, Hector Pineda connected in
the 36th minute with a left-footed drive from inside the penalty
area.
	   ``Our defense keeps getting better and better organized each
game,'' midfielder Matias Almeyda said. ``I hope it lasts through
the final.''
	   If only Brazil or Chile could say that much. Then again they
have offense for Saturday's clash.
	   To counter the Brazilian duo of Ronaldo and Bebeto, Chile had
Marcelo Salas and Ivan Zamorano.
	   ``Chile has one of the most efficient and feared front lines in
the Cup,'' admitted Brazilian midfielder Leonardo. ``But that
doesn't worry us. Their defense isn't so good.''
	   The first quarterfinalist though will be Italy or Norway.
	   And this year, Italy has offense too, with Christian Vieri
sharing the scoring lead with four goals.
	   Italy is now counting on the combined powers of Alessandro del
Piero and Roberto Baggio to break open Norway's tough defense.
	   ``I believe we have a 50 percent chance of reaching the
quarters. I expect Italy to take the initiative and attack. We will
be there waiting for them and ready to strike back,'' Norway coach
Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said.
	   Don't call it boasting. Norway already beat Brazil in their last
game.

World Cup: England's win gives it chance to avenge 'Hand of God' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By MORELEY MEYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ England's 2-0 victory over Colombia Friday
night was more than just a passport into the last 16 of the World
Cup. It provides a chance for a long-awaited payback against
Argentina.
	   First-half goals from Darren Anderton and David Beckham ensured
England the runner-up spot behind Romania in Group G and a
second-round clash with Group H winner Argentina in Saint-Etienne
on Tuesday.
	   This will be the fourth World Cup clash between England and
Argentina. The first encounter, a 3-1 win for England in the Group
stages of the 1962 tournament was comparatively uneventful.
	   However, the grudge element entered into the equation when
England staged the World Cup in 1966 and played Argentina in the
quarterfinal. The South Americans looked the better team until
their captain Rattin was sent off and England took the match 1-0
and went on to win the trophy.
	   Two decades later, there was an even greater controversy when
England and Argentina clashed in the quarterfinals of the 1986
World Cup in Mexico.
	   This is the match which will be ever remembered for Maradona's
``hand of God'' goal when he punched the ball into the net to give
Argentina the lead. The Argentine captain then added a second goal
as Argentina won 2-1 and subsequently captured the crown.
	   The incident rankles still in England and is stamped on the
memory of players and fans alike.
	   Even Michael Owen, England's 18-year-old emerging star, has been
immersed in the story of the events which took place when he was
only six years old.
	   ``Everybody was talking about it in the dressing room tonight. I
know all about it. It is a chance for revenge,'' he said after
England's classy dismissal of Colombia.
	   Manager Glenn Hoddle was pleased about England performance, but
also wary of the clash with Argentina.
	   ``I thought it was an excellent performance. We scored two great
goals and we could have had five or six more. We have done what we
had to do and now we must think about our next game _ and
Argentina. We all know how important that match is and the history
attached to it.''
	   England's first goal arrived in the 20th minute when Owen found
Anderton who drove the ball into the roof of the net.
	   ``It may have not been my best goal, but it was certainly the
sweetest,'' Anderton said later.
	   Within nine minutes England was two-up and never looked in
danger. It was a spectacular effort from a free-kick. Paul Ince was
fouled 30 meters from goal and Beckham curled the ball over the
defensive wall into the right hand corner of the goal.
	   ``It was my first goal for England,'' he said. ``I knew it was
my distances as soon as I got it. So I just stepped up I knew it
was on target and it was in.''

World Cup: Discipline, not Latin fervor, serves Argentina well 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Discipline is the new byword in
Argentina's team, and so far it's working.
	   Since the exit of superstar Diego Maradona _ soccer's brilliant
enfant terrible of the 1980s _ the two-time world champions have
built up the tight defending and teamwork that lifted them out of
the first round with a perfect record.
	   Maradona led Argentina to its last World Cup in 1986, but Latin
fervor hardly flashed Friday as Argentina defeated Croatia 1-0 to
win its qualifying group and set up a second-round clash with
England on Tuesday.
	   The South Americans, who needed only a tie to finish first in
their group, used their edge in mobility, punch and precision to
secure a workmanlike victory against the disappointing Croats, who
also were sure of advancing and now meet Romania in the first
knockout stage.
	   ``They deserved victory and Argentina confirmed their big
ambitions,'' conceded Croatia's coach Miroslav Blazevic.
	   Argentina smothered any attempts at creativity by Croatia's
midfield, drying up striker Davor Suker and allowing Croatia only
three shots on goal. The result left Argentina with three victories
in as many games at this World Cup and the only team not to concede
a goal so far.
	   A defender even scored the decisive goal. Hector Pineda
connected in the 36th minute, taking down a lob by Ariel Ortega
with his chest and slamming home a left-footed shot from inside the
penalty area.
	   ``Our defense keeps getting better and better organized each
game,'' midfielder Matias Almeyda said. ``I hope it lasts through
the final.''
	   Argentina's current edition bears the stamp of coach Daniel
Passarella, who took over the team after the 1994 World Cup,
rejuvenated it and is known as a strict disciplinarian.
	   Passarella, who captained Argentina's 1978 world champion team,
has even gotten star striker Gabriel Batistuta to trim his nearly
shoulder-length mane.
	   Argentina showed Friday that it doesn't rely only on Batistuta,
whose four goals at this World Cup include three in a 5-0 rout of
Jamaica. Ortega was the sharpest forward, and Marcelo Gallardo, 22,
one of the few home-based Argentina players, credibly replaced him
as midfield playmaker.
	   World Cup newcomer Croatia had its best chance in the 63rd
minute when substitute Goran Vlaovic unleashed a 27-meter drive
that crashed onto the goalcross with Roa well beaten.
	   Coach Blazevic tried to keep his team's spirits up for the game
against Romania, which the Croatians consider an uncomfortable
opponent.
	   ``We come out of this with our heads held high and hope we will
have more luck next time,'' he said.

World Cup: Japan's first goal not enough in 2-1 loss to Jamaica 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous; changes byline
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Japan finally scored its first World Cup
goal, but it wasn't enough to prevent them from bidding adieu to
the tournament with three straight losses.
	   Defender Naoki Soma struck a long diagonal pass from the left to
Wagner Lopes near the goal. Brazilian-born Lopes tipped it to a
running Masashi Nakayama, who forced the ball into the net.
	   But the goal came too late in a 2-1 loss Friday to fellow
tournament rookie Jamaica on goals by Theodore Whitmore in the 40th
and 54th minutes.
	   The Reggae Boyz' victory sent the yellow and green section of
the stands into a jubilant macarena. It was the first win at the
World Cup for a Caribbean nation since Cuba beat Romania 2-1 in
France six decades ago.
	   Nakayama, known affectionately back home by his nickname
``Gon,'' appeared before reporters on a wheelchair. A medical
examination after the game found he had injured his right leg,
shortly after his goal in the 74th minute. But he had kept on
playing until the final whistle.
	   ``If we can't score, we can't lead and we can't ever win,'' said
the 30-year-old forward, who holds the J-League record of netting
four consecutive hat tricks. ``I drove it in with my thigh. I was
leaning forward. I just wanted to drive it in.''
	   Coach Takeshi Okada immediately announced he would step down.
Ever since Japan's 1-0 loss to Croatia last week wiped out its
chances for advancing past the first round, Okada has been hinting
that he would resign.
	   ``I will quit,'' he told reporters. ``It is my responsibility. I
was not able to draw the best out of the players in this match.''
	   If Nakayama's goal had all the elements of Japan's fortes _
coordinated teamwork and selfless courage _ the rest of the game
only highlighted the team's inability to finish off fancy passing
with a goal.
	   Unlike its previous losses to Argentina and Croatia, Japan had
many opportunities against the less experienced Jamaicans. But the
ball went soaring above the goal, bounced off the post or struck
the outstretched limb of a Jamaican defender.
	   Jamaican coach Rene Simoes had studied Japan's strategy well. He
said he assigned players specifically to stop Soma, as well as key
midfielders Hidetoshi Nakata and Hiroshi Nanami.
	   ``I am very proud of them. I knew the potential of my team,''
the Brazilian coach said.
	   Japan's 22-year-old goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi fought back
his tears as he reached up again and again to answer the cheers of
the thousands of blue-jersey-clad Japanese, who had filled the
stadium in Lyon.
	   ``Our opponents came at the goal with a ferocious determination.
We have to learn to become much more foreceful,'' Kawaguchi said.
	   Nanami, the midfielder, said enduring the anguish of defeat was
part of the learning experience at Japan's first World Cup.
	   ``The desire to win grows with every bitter experience like this
on the international stage,'' Nanami said. ``Maybe going through
this pain just three times isn't enough.''

World Cup: Second-half goal by trio of subs gives Romania draw, Group G title 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Overconfidence shouldn't be a problem
for the Romanians the rest of the World Cup. They each have a head
of bleached hair that can serve as a several-month reminder.
	   Showing up for their final group match against Tunisia, the
Romanians all sported blond manes, a pledge they made to themselves
for winning Group G. the only problem was they needed a draw to
achieve it, and for 71 minutes, that was in doubt.
	   Second-half substitute Viorel Moldovan buried a loose ball in
the penalty area in the 72nd minute and Romania managed a 1-1 draw
with Tunisia, earning a second-round clash with Croatia.
	   The draw gave Romania a 2-1-0 record, seven points and the Group
G title, avoiding a meeting with Argentina. Instead, Romania will
play Croatia in Bordeaux on Tuesday.
	   ``The poor organization of our defense in the first half was due
to the changes I decided to make,'' said Romanian coach Anghel
Iordanescu, who shaved his head as part of the pledge. ``This
almost derailed the game of the entire team in general. Those who
replaced (the best players) lacked ambition and freshness.''
	   Moldovan, who replaced Ilie Dumitrescu only five minutes
earlier, finished a play that started when Gheorge Popescu sent a
free kick from midfield into the Romanian end. Adrian Ilie, who
appeared to be offside, chased it down and chipped the ball over
Tunisian keeper Chorki el Ouaer.
	   Tunisian defender Ferid Chouchane headed the ball away, but not
far enough. The ball bounded to Moldovan, who volleyed the ball
into the goal.
	   Moldovan's goal came after 10 minutes of sustained possession
and pressure by Romania, its first consistent offensive effort of
the match.
	   Iordanescu's plan to rest strikers Adrian of Valencia and
Coventry's Moldovan and three other regulars almost cost the
Romanians the first place in Group G, as substitute strikers
Dumitrescu and Marius Lacatus failed to dent the Tunisian back
line.
	   For most of the first half, the Tunisians were in control and
led from the 10th minute, when Skander Souayah converted a
10th-minute penalty kick.
	   Souayah drove his chance into the lower left corner after
Christian Dulca was whistled for dragging down Adel Sellimi.
	   Sellimi got the ball in the top corner of the penalty area, and
pivoted inward to get between Dulca and Anton Dobos. Looking to
recover, Dulca, whose arms were intertwined with the Tunisian
forward, grabbed Sellimi around the left shoulder before he went
down.
	   The goal came as Tunisia was by far the more dangerous team
through the first 45 minutes.
	   Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea was forced into several key
saves, intercepting a low cross from Sellimi in the 19th and
grabbing a volley by Kaies Ghodbane a minute later.
	   For the Tunisians, the result was some consolation after
disappointing losses to England and Colombia that cost Polish-born
coach Henry Kasperczak his job.
	   ``The first half was the best moment we had out of the three
matches. We had to go home with honor, having scored at least one
goal,'' coach Ali Selmi said.
	   For at least 71 minutes, there was even hope of victory.
	   ``Against Romania, we showed the best side of Tunisian soccer,''
Defender Ferid Chouchane said.
	   And, for some, the Tunisians carried the honor of the Arab
world.
	   ``In the first match against England, we were playing at a
disadvantage, against a team that had more experience. Against
Colombia, we weren't able to put our best foot forward,'' striker
Adel Sellimi said.
	   ``But in this match, I think our play can be a source of pride
for Arab soccer, in general. If we had played like this from the
start, we probably could have advanced to the second round. But we
were tricked by a lack of experience and a lack of confidence.''

Includes items on Maradona, Posh Spice, 1,700 World Cup goals, interns sentenced. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The goal that ended the tournament for the United
States team was the 1,700th goal in World Cup history.
	   The goals are really adding up this tournament. On June 12th
South African Pierre Issa's own goal in the match against France
was the 1,600th goal in World Cup history. Two weeks later,
Slobodan Komljenovic's 4th minute goal against the Americans made
it 1,700.
	   The last time there where two record goal numbers in the same
tournament was in Mexico 1986. Jean-Pierre Papin of France scored
the 1,200th goal on June 1, 1986 and a little over two weeks later
Gary Lineker lifted the score to 1,300.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina has a small advantage
over other teams in its quest to advance in the World Cup, said
Diego Maradona, the country's legendary star.
	   For the first time in four World Cups, Maradona isn't directing
traffic in Argentina's midfield. His number 10 jersey is now worn
by the team's other playmaker, Ariel Ortega.
	   Watching the team's first-round games has made him nostalgic,
Maradona said. His mother, too.
	   ``I see Matthaus and Valderrama and I say 'why am I not there?''
he said, referring to the two other veteran players.
	   On the team's chances in the second round, the former star said
Argentina ``has a slight edge'' over the tournament's remaining
teams.
	   ``This is not a World Cup rich in individual skill or strong
teams,'' he said.
	   Watching the team's first-round games has made him nostalgic,
Maradona said.
	   The 37-year-old is expected to travel to France next week where
he will be a commentator for Argentine and Mexican television
stations.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The crowd rooting for England against
Colombia Friday night in Lens may have been large but it definitely
lacked Spice.
	   Victoria Adams, the Spice Girls' very own Posh Spice, was in the
midst of a U.S. tour with the pop-music group and unable to cheer
in person for her boyfriend, England's David Beckham.
	   A large group of players' wives and girlfriends traveled from
England Friday for the game.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ An intern at the French World Cup organizing
committee was sentenced to three months in prison for dealing in
stolen accreditations, the daily newspaper L'Equipe reported.
	   The intern, 20-year-old Olivier R., and another intern Yamina K.
,24 _ no last names where given _ where arrested last Tuesday at
the Stade de France. The two worked for the accreditation service
which provides journalists, technical staff and others with badges
to enter the stadium.
	   A judge in Bobigny found them guilty Thursday of stealing badges
and selling them to Japanese fans for the equivalent of dlrs 500 a
badge. The badges gave access to certain zones of the stadium but
no access to the stands during the match according to the daily.
	   The court sentenced Olivier R. to three months in prison, in
addition to a six-month suspended sentence. Yamina K. got a
three-month suspended sentence.

Unveiling of U.S. stamp kicks off Berlin airlift commemorations 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Fashions from the '40s. Gershwin tunes. Marlene
Dietrich. And candy dropping from the sky.
	   This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the
Berlin airlift, and the city is showing its gratitude with romantic
tributes to 1948-49, when daring Allied forces defied _ and
defeated _ a Soviet blockade.
	   Kicking off the events, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled its
50th anniversary airlift stamp Friday at Tempelhof Airport, the
main base of operations for the 15-month airlift that brought coal
and food to 2 million West Berliners.
	   The 32-cent stamp _ the first ever introduced outside the United
States _ shows a C-54 cargo plane coming in for a landing as
Berliners gaze skyward.
	   The stamp was flown in on the ``Spirit of Freedom,'' a restored
C-54. The plane has been turned into a flying museum about the
airlift and the division of West Berlin into American, British and
French sectors after World War II.
	   The three allies launched the airlift June 26, 1948, two days
after the Soviet Union cut off all land and water routes to West
Berlin in an attempt to push out the western forces. The Soviets
eventually gave up the blockade after nearly a year. The airlift
continued through September 1949 while ground links were inspected
and restored.
	   ``The stamp truly depicts the promise the Berlin Airlift brought
to this magnificent city and the courage of the people of Berlin,''
said Gen. John P. Jumper, commander of U.S. air forces in Europe.
	   Also at the unveiling was American pilot Gail Halvorsen, the
so-called ``Candy Bomber'' who initiated the practice of pilots
tossing gum and chocolate from their planes to West Berlin
children.
	   Halvorsen, 77, and others had hoped to re-enact the candy drop
this weekend with flights over Berlin. But city officials nixed the
idea because of security concerns, so the tiny parachute-borne
candy will be dropped from construction cranes.
	   Although the anniversary was Friday, Berlin held its major
celebrations early to coincide with a visit by U.S. President Bill
Clinton. Thousands of people came to Tempelhof Airport on May 13 to
hear emotional speeches by Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   This weekend's events are less official and more about having
fun.
	   There will be re-enactments of the black market that operated in
Berlin during the airlift _ including fake transactions using Lucky
Strikes as currency.
	   The city also is planning a fashion show featuring late 1940s
attire and free screenings of ``A Foreign Affair,'' the 1948 Billy
Wilder movie starring John Lund and Marlene Dietrich that was
partly shot in the city's postwar ruins.
	   A concert Saturday night in central Berlin is to feature swing
music and works by Gershwin.
	   A museum dedicated to the Allied occupation of Berlin, which
ended after Germany's 1990 unification, is to open Saturday. It is
on a boulevard named after U.S. Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the former
military governor in West Germany who started the airlift.
	   On Friday, workers were still rolling blue paint on the museum
entrance sign that says ``Wilkommen. Welcome. Bienvenue.'' Exhibits
include occupation-era signs, such as the famous ``You are now
leaving the American sector.''

US fails to head off Security Council meeting on Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite U.S. objections, the Security
Council has decided to meet Tuesday to consider Arab demands that
Israel reverse its decision to extend municipal services from
Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said any Security
Council discussion ``would be counterproductive to the success of
our discussions with the Palestinians and the Israelis.''
	   But that view was not shared by the majority of the 15 council
members. Following Friday's consultations, the council president,
Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, said the meeting would be held
Tuesday.
	   The Arab League asked for the meeting after Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday to put Jewish settlements under
Jerusalem municipal authority for certain services, notably
building and planning.
	   An Arab League has condemned the Israeli plan, calling it an
attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem'' and
``destroy the peace process.''
	   The United States has called for a ``timeout'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   But Washington traditionally resists any moves to involve the
United Nations in the Arab-Israeli conflict because of widespread
opposition to the Jewish state within the 185-member organization.
	   The United States sought to delay the counci meeting until next
month, saying any council action on the issue would enflame
passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the moribund
Middle East peace process.
	   But Bahrain, the only Arab country on the council, insisted on
the meeting as soon as possible. As a rule, the Security Council
accepts all such requests from its members.
	   The meeting will likely take up a draft resolution, informally
circulated last week by Arab ambassadors to the United Nations,
which condemns the expansion plan and demands that it be rescinded.
	   It also calls on Israel ``to refrain from all actions of
measures, including settlement activities, which are illegal'' and
could interfere with future talks on the status of Jerusalem.
	   Monteiro said it was unlikely that the resolution would be voted
on Tuesday.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But having to resort to the veto is
considered a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent
member is unable to muster majority support.

Ulster Unionists coming out on top in Belfast Assembly election uncertain. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Balloting resumes at 0900 GMT. Timing of final results
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's major
Protestant party, essential to making the Belfast peace agreement
work, is expected to scrape home with just enough seats in the new
cross-community government when final election results are
announced Saturday.
	   Ballot counting resumes Saturday morning to determine who won
the final 41 seats still up for grabs following Thursday's election
to the 108-member Belfast Assembly.
	   David Trimble's Ulster Unionists, split over his support for
April's compromise agreement involving seven other parties, was
being projected to win 28 or 29 seats despite scoring their lowest
share of the vote _ 21.3 percent _ in Northern Ireland's 77-year
existence.
	   Political analysts say that should be just enough to prevent
Protestant hard-liners from forming an effective obstructionist
bloc in the Assembly, whose decisions must be approved by
majorities of both its Protestant and Catholic members.
	   The two parties opposed to sharing power with the north's rising
Catholic minority, Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists and Bob
McCartney's United Kingdom Unionists, appeared on course to win 26
or 27 seats. one or two independent Protestants might be elected to
bolster the anti-agreement camp.
	   ``They'll be a big pain, causing trouble whenever they can. But
they won't have quite enough ammo to stop the Assembly in its
tracks as they no doubt want to do,'' predicted John Alderdice,
whose middle-of-the-road Alliance Party is the only one to attract
much support from both Protestants and Catholics.
	   Alderdice's party fared comparatively poorly, with 6.5 percent
of votes and an expected six seats.
	   The rival wings of Catholic opinion, meanwhile, broke personal
records in Thursday's election.
	   John Hume, the moderate Catholic architect of the successful
negotiations, saw his Social Democratic and Labor Party collect
more votes than the Ulster Unionists for the first time since the
SDLP's foundation in 1970. His 22 percent share of votes was
expected to deliver 24 or 25 seats.
	   Some observers said the party's performance should entitle Hume,
rather than Trimble, to assume the top post in a new 12-member
administration that the Assembly must appoint. But Hume dismissed
the suggestion.
	   And Sinn Fein, the IRA-allied party, received 17.6 percent of
the vote, on the weight of strong youth organization and the appeal
of the Irish Republican Army's 11-month-old truce.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who topped the poll in Catholic
west Belfast and carried three party colleagues there with him to
victory, said he expected Sinn Fein's support would translate into
17 seats in the Assembly and two seats in the administration.
	   That prospect drove many Protestants to back Paisley's party
rather than Trimble, who has insisted he won't sit in the same
administration as Sinn Fein unless the IRA starts disarming.
	   The Belfast agreement requires the IRA and the two major
pro-British paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force, to start disarming as the price for their
affiliated politicians' involvement in the Assembly.
	   But in a sign of how badly divided the Protestant vote was among
more than a half-dozen parties, the leading representatives of the
two pro-British gangs were struggling to get elected.
	   The UVF-affiliated Progressive Unionist Party, a likely ally of
Trimble in pushing forward the agreement, expected to get its two
most high-profile negotiators elected Saturday: David Ervine, a
former car bomber, and Billy Hutchinson, who spent 16 years in
prison for murdering two Catholics.
	   But the UDA-linked Ulster Democratic Party and its
forward-looking leader, Gary McMichael, looked certain to be shut
out of the Assembly after attracting just 1 percent of votes.

Catholic priest pleads guilty to assaults on boys 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRADFORD, England (AP) _ A Roman Catholic priest pleaded guilty
on Friday to 12 indecent assaults on boys under 16.
	   The Rev. David Crowley, 44, also peaded guilty at Braford Crown
Court to three charges of indecency with a child. Sentencing was
deferred to a later, unspecified, date.
	   The offenses took place while Crowley worked in West Yorkshire,
northern England, and Devon in the south, between June 1981 and
August 1992. He was currently at St. Joseph's Church in Little
Horton, Bradford _ also in the north.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, the Rt. Rev. David Konstant,
immediately suspended Crowley and said he had betrayed the diocese.
	   ``Along with all Catholics I am saddened and distressed that
such shameful actions were committed by a priest,'' the bishop
said. ``We extend our deep sympathy to the young people affected
and to their families. The interests of children and young people
are paramount to us and it is inexcusable that someone who was in a
position of trust should cause hurt.''

A lot of fireworks on the Fourth With TRAV-Independence Day-Tips

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ An Independence Day holiday in Philadelphia,
the very cradle of liberty, will give you a lot of bangs.
	   Friday: Fireworks.
	   Saturday: Lots of fireworks.
	   Sunday: More fireworks.
	   The pyrotechnics are part of the city's Welcome America
celebration, 10 days of festivities throughout the Philadelphia
area. The focus will be on two city centers _ Independence Historic
National Park and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
	   A good place to start is at one of the two visitors centers. At
the east end of the Franklin Parkway is the Philadelphia Visitors
Center, full of maps, brochures gifts, and guides.
	   In the historic area, there's the Visitors Center of
Independence National Historic Park. It offers a short educational
film, displays and abundant information. Be sure to ask the ranger
for a map of the area. Most of this touring is on foot.
	   At Independence Hall in the heart of the historic district, Park
Rangers lead free guided tours. Opened in 1732 as the State House
for the Pennsylvania colony, the structure became the home of the
Second Continental Congress in 1775. With the signing of the
Declaration of Independence there on July 4, 1776, and the drafting
and approval of the Constitution in 1787, Independence Hall became
one of America's most significant buildings.
	   Standing inside Assembly Hall, it feels as though the
Continental Congress is just out taking a break. Chairs and desks
are in place, and the silver ink stand used by the delegates to
sign the Declaration sits at the ready.
	   The courtyard behind the Hall, where local colonists gathered
with their kids and cows to hear the Declaration read aloud for the
first time, is lush and wooded. It's a nice place for a picnic or
to rest weary feet.
	   The Centennial Bell, forged and rung for the 1876 Centennial
celebration, is atop the hall.
	   The famous Liberty Bell, the one that first proclaimed
Independence but cracked in 1835, draws 2 million visitors a year
to its glass and steel pavilion a short walk away.
	   Across the street from it is the Bourse, the country's first
commodities exchange. It now houses a large food court, gift shops,
and office space.
	   The Mummers, who have strutted through Philadelphia with their
string bands and fanciful costumes in a New Orleans-style
extravaganza every New Year's Day since 1901, will do their stuff
on July 1, winding up at the Liberty Bell.
	   On July 4, descendants of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence will tap the Liberty Bell, setting off a nationwide
bell-ringing. In the afternoon, Sen. George Mitchell will be
presented the Philadelphia Liberty Medal for his work towards peace
in Northern Ireland.
	   Head east to Penn's Landing along the Delaware River waterfront
for an afternoon of arts, games, and entertainment. Several stages
will be set up for musicians and there will be food aplenty.
	   On the evening of July 3, boats large and small and decorated
with strings of lights will parade up and down the Delaware to live
island funk music as part of the Electrical River Spectacular.
	   On your way to the waterfront, pop into the City Tavern, a
reconstruction of the original City Tavern which was built on the
same spot in 1773. Rare 18th-century maps grace the walls.
	   Also in the historical area is the 18th-century home of
seamstress and upholsterer Betsy Ross and her family. It's believed
that this is where Ross, at the request of George Washington,
stitched the first American flag.
	   Across the street is the Humphreys Flag Company. In this
location since 1864, the company makes flags of over 200 nations
and sells over 100,000 American flags every year.
	   A five-minute walk from the Betsy Ross House is the charming
cobblestone street, Elfreth's Alley, decorated with flower boxes
and flags. With its 33 houses dating to the early 1700s, it's the
nation's oldest continuously occupied residential street.
	   Heading back to the Liberty Bell from there, you pass the
historic Christ Church, founded in 1659 and attended by the likes
of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
	   Enclosed in an ornate wrought iron fence outside the church is
the burial ground where you'll find the graves of Ben Franklin, his
wife and their children. Folks like to toss a penny onto his grave
for good luck.
	   For the Fourth of July parade, head to the Franklin Parkway. If
you don't have a car, look for one of the purple Philadelphia
Phlash shuttle buses. They run from 10 a.m. to midnight on a loop
from the Parkway to the historic district.
	   A good place to start is the Swann Fountain in Logan Circle. The
massive fountain is a perfect place to relax or, on a hot day, to
take a dip. And on July 4 it'll be a good place to start watching
the parade with it's floats and bands and the best Ben Franklin
look-alike you've ever seen.
	   The parade kicks off at 6:30 p.m. and follows the Parkway to the
steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Many people like to run
the steps of the museum like Sylvester Stallone did in the movie
``Rocky.''
	   After the parade, Peter Nero and the Philly Pops and later Boyz
II Men will give free concerts from a stage in front of the museum.
	   Thousands of people flood the Parkway for the concert, and the
fireworks display that follows. So grab some grub from one of the
numerous food carts lining the street, pick out a comfortable curb,
and settle in for an evening's entertainment.
	   Besides the Parkway pyrotechnics of the July 4, the cities of
Philadelphia and Camden join forces on the night of July 5 to
produce a fireworks extravaganza launched from barges on the
Delaware River. Penn's Landing offers a good viewing spot for you
and 50,000 of your closest friends.
	   Not to be outdone, the Philadelphia Phillies will host two
nights of fireworks after their games against the Milwaukee Brewers
on July 3 and 4.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Heavy police presence, a strict alcohol ban
and tougher border checks that turned away suspected hooligans
appeared to do the trick: a high-risk World Cup match went off in
relative calm.
	   After repeated violence since the five-week soccer championship
began June 10, authorities took no chances with Friday's
England-Colombia match attended by Prince Charles and his son,
Prince Harry.
	   Shops in this town near the Belgian border closed early, giant
outdoor World Cup screens were taken down and bars served
non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000 police stood ready.
	   English police helped spot known hooligans, and border police
turned away hundreds of suspected troublemakers.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train
from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed. Many
brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local North African French youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match.
	   Police arrested about 50 fans in Lens and a dozen in Lille,
officials said.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in clashes overnight Thursday in northern
France and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   Many suspect English nationals never made it to Lens. French
authorities reported turning away 400 of them who arrived Friday at
Calais, Lille airport and train station, and at the Belgian border.
	   Nevertheless, the high number of drunken English fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the evening match.
Prince Charles and Prince Harry were seen in a VIP box at the
heavily guarded stadium packed with 41,000 fans.
	   ``No screen to watch the match, no beer, police everywhere. What
do you French take us for?'' asked John, a fan in a wig with the
red, white and blue of the English flag, who refused to give his
last name. ``People just came here to have fun, not to be
savages.''
	   But most locals were lying low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   Lens was the scene of rioting by German fans last Sunday, when a
French policeman was left in a coma.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists planned to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   But the prediction didn't materialize. German authorities had
stepped up border checks of France-bound travelers, turning back
some suspected hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured. English
fans have clashed with, or were attacked by, North African French
youths from poor suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

NAXOS: Rugged beauty lies beyond the hedonistic beaches With TRAV-Naxos-Tips 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY309
By TIM GIHRING
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NAXOS TOWN, Greece (AP) _ If imitation is any measure, tourists
on Greece's Naxos island have made Dionysus truly immortal.
	   The Aegean isle is where the mythical god of wine and revelry
married Ariadne _ abandoned on Naxos by Theseus _ but marriage
failed to tame Dionysus. He cavorted anyway.
	   That hedonist tradition has been taken up today by beautiful
tourists from around the world who soak up the sensuality of Naxos'
beaches wearing little and less.
	   Naxos and its fellow Cyclade islands nurture a carefree
lifestyle fueled by suntan oil, ouzo and cold cash.
	   Behind the shallow facade of Naxos, however, is an inner beauty
of rural quietude.
	   For the few who look deeper, inland around the Cyclades' highest
mountain where the mythical god Zeus was born, the island rewards
with rugged terrain easily hiked, white churches perched on
hilltops, and isolated villages where one can walk every stone
street without passing another tourist.
	   Naxos' fertile interior has been hailed by travelers for
millennia as the most beautiful scenery of the Cyclades. There are
no bellies spilling over Speedos here, or resort workers who only
want your money, just village folk who have retained a genuine
hospitality.
	   The interior's Venetian castles and towers are the most visible
reminders of the island's rich history and former power. The
Thracians inhabited the island until the Carians took over probably
around the 11th century B.C. and named the island for their king,
Naxos. Succeeding rulers included the Spartans and the Turks before
Naxos became a part of Greece in 1830.
	   Now the tourists reign, but most never venture far from the port
and beaches of Naxos Town, where nearly all the hotels are located.
A bus ride will take the adventurous tourist into the Tragea, the
olive-growing region of Naxos.
	   Filoti is the largest village in the Tragea and is a popular
starting point for hikes to Mt. Zeus, the Cyclades' highest point.
	   As my friend and I trekked up Filoti's main road toward Zeus, an
old man walking to church handed us chunks of delicious bread from
a fresh loaf he carried like a football. A few steps later, a woman
did the same.
	   We needed the sustenance. It took more than two hours to reach
the top of Zeus. We took a roundabout trek past a ruined windmill
and up to the mythical birthplace of Zeus, a rather ungodly dank
cave on a low slope of the mountain. The peak offered more heavenly
views of villages, mountains and the sea, accompanied by the tinkle
of bell-wearing goats.
	   The hike up Mt. Zeus paints a still life of silent, scrubby
mountains and terraced olive groves, but the real life is in the
villages. The most developed community after Naxos Town is the
seaside village of Apollonas, where a gigantic male statue called a
kouros _ cracked while being carved in the seventh century B.C. One
of three kouros on Naxos, the 35-foot (10.5-meter) statue lies
unfinished in a nearby quarry.
	   A more traditional village is Apiranthos, an attractive nest of
rustic stone houses stuck on the slopes of Mt. Fanari, the island's
third-highest peak. I leisurely lost myself in the twisting marble
streets, passing a castle and churches white as sugar cubes. I was
hiking up to Fanariotissa, a church on Fanari's peak.
	   Tin icons and paintings of saints in the tiny church spurred
contemplation. I was completely alone on the peak except for goats
milling below. I saw the sea lapping at two sides of the island and
villages scattered in the valleys like sleeping white cats.
	   When I came down I took the bus to Chalki, a town noted for its
Byzantine church filled with 13th-century frescoes and its Venetian
tower houses. The stout, austere buildings are mostly abandoned but
one can imagine a romantic past of wealth and pirates, who were
spotted from the slits that serve as windows.
	   From Chalki, a dirt path led me through olive groves to the
hamlet of Tsikalario. It was siesta time, the silence broken only
by the splash of water filling a woman's bucket at a public
fountain. I saw what I thought would make a beautiful photo: two
white horses grazing next to a white church with the valley spread
out below. I was out of film.
	   I walked out of Tsikalario replaying the image of the white
horses and the church, knowing I didn't have time to revisit it.

Naxos. I would return.

Guatemala to probe U.S. lawyer's accusation against army in bishop's death 
</HEADLINE>
By ALFONSO ANZUETO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors have said they will
investigate accusations that a death squad linked to Guatemala's
army killed a bishop shortly after he presented a human rights
report damaging to the military.
	   Otto Ardon Medina, the prosecutor in charge of investigating the
April 26 bludgeoning death of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi
Conedera, said Friday that he will check the 23 people that U.S.
lawyer Jennifer Harbury identified as military officers linked to
the killing.
	   Gerardi was killed two days after issuing a report accusing the
army of committing most of the human rights abuses in Guatemala's
36-year civil war, which ended under peace accords signed in 1996.
	   A group called the ``Jaguar Avengers,'' which Harbury described
as a ``notorious death squad,'' took credit for the killing in a
letter.
	   At a Washington news conference Thursday, Harbury said a
witness, who ``was for many years in close contact with this death
squad,'' said the Guatemalan army was involved in the Jaguar
Avengers. Harbury refused to disclose the witness' identity, saying
the person ``is in extreme personal danger.''
	   Harbury came to prominence in the mid-1990s when she began a
campaign to uncover information about the death of her guerrilla
husband, who was captured by the army in 1992.
	   She has taken that case to the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights and is suing the U.S. government and the CIA in federal
court in Washington. She accuses them of collaborating in his death
and claims they committed fraud against her and several members of
Congress.
	   On Thursday, she also asserted that Guatemalan army death squads
``coordinate very closely with some intelligence branch of the U.S.
government.''
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin denied those
accusations Thursday and noted that the FBI is assisting Guatemalan
prosecutors in the investigation of Gerardi's death.
	   Defense Minister Hector Mario Barrios Celada said Harbury's
accusations ``lack support,'' and claimed that one of the officers
on her list died in June 1994.
	   The only suspect currently under arrest in the Gerardi case,
Juan Carlos Vielman, is a civilian who claims he is innocent.

DAMASCUS: New sites and sounds in world's oldest city 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ As recently as a decade ago, night in the
Old City of Damascus belonged to stock boys refilling the shelves
of the bazaar, the occasional policeman and lots of stray cats.
	   These days after the sun goes down, the cobblestone streets
within the ancient walls echo with the footsteps of Syrians and
tourists making the rounds of a growing number of piano bars, jazz
clubs and restaurants that serve Arab and European fare.
	   Damascus _ which bills itself as the oldest, continuously
occupied city in the world _ is undergoing a revival.
	   It can be seen not only in the rejuvenated night life but also
in the grand old houses being bought up and refurbished and in the
restoration of major monuments, such as the eighth-century Omayyad
Mosque at the city's heart.
	   Suhail Zakkar, a professor of Islamic history at Damascus
University, credits ``the desire for tourism, not only from outside
the country but from inside Syria.''
	   More important, he says, is ``growing awareness throughout the
Arab world that we must protect our heritage, if only to teach our
coming generations about our rich history.''
	   Damascus' history is richer than most. First inhabited 7,000
years ago, it was known to the Egyptian pharaohs and rated a
mention in the Old Testament's Book of Genesis.
	   Because it was a major trading and religious center, the list of
conquerors reads like a who's who of the ancient world: Persian
King Cyrus, Alexander the Great and the Arab warrior Saladin all
captured the city. Angered when the city resisted, the Mongol
warrior Tamerlane burned it to the ground in A.D. 1400.
	   Though Muslim monuments predominate, Christianity has left its
mark, too. The Street Called Straight _ the only road that bisects
the Old City _ was where St. Paul was converted. A shrine in the
Omayyad Mosque marks the site where legend holds that the head of
John the Baptist is entombed.
	   The Old City's main draw continues to be the Souk al-Hamidiya,
where vendors accost visitors with shouts of ``Come see my
silver,'' ``Buy my sweets,'' and the weary, ``No charge for
looking.''
	   Stores, often no larger than a modest bedroom, overflow with
silk brocade and inlaid wood boxes made in Syria, spices from India
and Africa, carpets from Iran, brass pots from Central Asia.
	   Most of the restoration is occurring on the bazaar's fringe.
Hidden behind anonymous wooden doors along the labyrinthine lanes
are Ottoman-era palaces rich with hand-carved wood, marble and
decorative stone inlays.
	   Some are private residences for prominent Syrian families. But
many are being converted for other uses, such as a Danish cultural
center and a hands-on laboratory for University of Damascus
architecture students.
	   Marmar, a cabaret that opened near the eastern Touma Gate
earlier this year, is housed in a section of an 18th-century
caravansary, an inn surrounding a court where caravans spent the
night.
	   Its high-ceilinged rooms are frequently jammed with young
Damascenes who come for drinking and dancing to live jazz and rock
bands.
	   ``We wanted a place that was casual, relaxed and different from
the other things in the Old City,'' said Mounzer el-Kubeh, one of
the owners.
	   A short walk away is Al-Zeitouna, which led the revival of Old
City restaurants with its opening in 1995.
	   Set in the courtyard of a refurbished 19th-century mansion,
Al-Zeitouna's walls are alternating layers of black and white
stone, broken by the lush red of blooming rose bushes.
	   The restaurant offers an Arab ``mezza'' _ dozens of small salads
_ followed by steak, lamb chops or fish. Most diners drink Lebanese
wine or arak, a licorice-flavored Arab liquor, but bottles of
Johnny Walker Scotch sit on some tables.
	   Owner Salim Nassan said he was inspired by visits to other old
cities.
	   ``Everywhere I went, there was an old town with a life. Athens,
Istanbul, Montreal,'' he said. ``I want Damascus to be like the
others.''
	   He thought a moment and added: ``No, I want Damascus to be
better.''

Five share lead in storm-interrupted ShopRite LPGA Classic AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with play finished for the day
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam, Alicia Dibos, Tina
Barrett, Caroline McMillan and Moira Dunn dodged the thunderstorms
on the Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort and shot
5-under-par 66s to share the first-round lead in the ShopRite LPGA
Classic.
	   Sorenstam, who had played 15 holes when play was suspended the
first time, tapped in the putt finishing her round just seconds
before the alarm sounded for the second weather delay.
	   A little more than half the field had finished play before the
second delay. Play eventually resumed and Dunn, in the final group,
finished just as daylight was disappearing.
	   ``It's very important to get off to a good start in a 54-hole
tournament,'' Sorenstam said Friday. ``When we came out after the
delay, it was a totally different golf course.''
	   Juli Inkster, Rosie Jones, Betsy King, Tammie Green, Luciana
Bemvenuti and Smriti Mehra were one stroke off the lead.
	   Several players were bunched at 68, including Donna Andrews, the
leading money winner on tour who has finished second in her last
four starts. She bogeyed the final hole.
	   Those with morning starting times not only had the advantage of
getting their rounds in before the storm hit, but also were able to
escape the worst of shirt-soaking heat and humidity.
	   ``I'm just really glad to shoot the number I did playing in the
afternoon,'' Sorenstam said.
	   Playing the back nine first, Sorenstam had a tap-in for birdie
on the par-5 16th then made four consecutive birdies beginning on
No. 1.
	   ``My short game really helped me out today,'' Sorenstam said.
``I'm not lagging putts anymore. I'm trying to make them. I'm not
afraid anymore.''
	   The other three leaders took advantage of earlier tee times.
	   ``I think I was lucky to tee it up at 8 in the morning when it
was cooler,'' Dibos said after she concluded a bogey-free round.
	   Barrett got her round going with a chip-in for birdie on No. 10
_ her first hole of the day _ and followed that with a 4-iron to 15
feet (4 1/2 meters) on the 187-yard 11th for another birdie.
	   She could have had the lead outright but three-putted from 30
feet on the final hole for a bogey.
	   ``I misread the first putt and just didn't hit the second one,''
she said.
	   McMillan _ who was Carolyn Pierce when she won the JAL LPGA
Classic in 1996 _ also started her round on No. 10 and also got her
round off the ground with a chip-in.
	   That was the first of four birdies in six holes by McMillan.

	   Naxos is well-connected to other Greek islands by inexpensive
ferries. A seven-hour ferry ride for dlrs 15 (4,590 drachmas) takes
you from Piraeus (Athens' port) to Naxos Town. A hovercraft takes
about half as long but costs about twice as much.
	   For accommodations, wander Naxos Town looking for signs
advertising rooms. Even in high season we negotiated with three
guest houses on the same street, ending up with a beautiful,

Britain makes new deal to speed Channel Tunnel trains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain plans to make tracks to hold up its end of
the high-speed train link between London and Paris.
	   Eurostar trains hit speeds up to 186 mph (299 kph) on the
Continent, and 100 mph (160 kph) in the linking tunnel beneath the
English Channel. In England, they poke along between 60 mph (96.5
kph) and 80 mph (128.7 kph).
	   The British government announced recently that it had finally
made a deal with London and Continental Railways and Railtrack PLC
to start upgrading Britian's track.
	   When the job is completed in 2007, travel time between Paris and
London should be reduced to 2 hours 25 minutes, down from the
current 3 hours. It should also reduce the London-Brussels time,
which is currently 2 hours 36 minutes.

with what Montreal is planning for some 1.5 million jazz buffs
expected to show up July 1-12 for the city's 19th annual music
festival.
	   For starters, Ray Charles, Wynton Marsalis and Roberta Flack
will be there. And for 12 hours a day, from noon to midnight, there
will be 300 free outdoor concerts, and 100 ticketed performances on
nine indoor stages.
	   All this in a closed-off, four-square-block section of the
central city. No traffic for 12 days _ just music, food, grooving
and street performers.
	   The Montreal International Jazz Festival also plans to go beyond
its name this year by offering up a little something for musical
tastes outside of jazz. Programs will include blues, Latin rhythms,
gospel, Cajun, and a special Africa Fete.
	   And, finally, there's plenty planned for the kids. A special
children's village will offer street performers, makeup artists, a
musical playground and a ``kid's musical.''

	   CHEYENNE, Wyoming (AP) _ The capital of the United States' least
populous state is about to undergo its annual transformation from a
town of about 55,000 to a festive metropolis with four times that
many people.
	   Drawing visitors from around the world is the 102nd Cheyenne
Frontier Days, the world's largest outdoor rodeo, and numerous
satellite activities.
	   The heart of the 10-day event, which runs from July 17-26, is
the daily rodeo with steer wrestling, calf roping, barrel racing,
bareback and saddle bronc riding and bull riding.
	   The rodeo also is the only U.S. stop on the Canadian
Professional Chuckwagon Association circuit, and features daily
races of wagons pulled by teams of four thoroughbred horses.
	   Each night after the rodeo, a large stage is wheeled onto the
rodeo grounds for a country-Western concert. This year's performers
include country stars Sawyer Brown, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill and
Faith Hill.
	   The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds precision flying team performs
during the rodeo each year, and there are free parades and pancake
breakfasts in downtown Cheyenne.

	   LOMPOC, California (AP) _ If it's color, fresh air and the sweet
aroma of spring perennials you're after, then head to the ``Valley
of Flowers'' on California's unspoiled Central Coast.
	   Off the beaten path 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Los
Angeles, Lompoc, a city of 40,000, is easy to miss.
	   But the area is best known as the Valley of Flowers because it
produces flower seeds and cut flowers for retailers around the
world. Fragrant fields of snapdragons, Queen Anne's lace and sweet
peas stretch across the often fog-shrouded Lompoc Valley, from the
rolling Santa Ynez Mountains down to the blue Pacific.
	   Every June, the stalks are in full bloom and ready for
harvesting.
	   Once the producer of more than half the world's flower seeds,
much of the seed-growing business has moved overseas to countries
where labor is cheaper. But one day a year, in April, people can
catch a glimpse of newly developed varieties that will be sold to
retailers as local seed companies open their test gardens to the
public.

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen; agreements reached begins at 0100 GMT; Clinton-Jiang statements tentatively set for 0400 GMT AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with military agreements; ceremony
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton was in Beijing
Saturday for a welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, the
sprawling plaza thick with memories of China's bloody crackdown
against democratic change nine years ago.
	   White House officials promised that Clinton, in talks with
Chinese leaders, would register a strong protest about ``thoroughly
unacceptable'' fresh arrests of dissidents. In unusually blunt
terms, Clinton's national security director deplored China's human
rights record as ``terrible.''
	   As the human rights drama played out, U.S. and Chinese
negotiators reached a deal on two important security issues: the
two nations agreed to no longer aim long-range nuclear missiles at
one another and settled on stiffer export controls on missile
technology to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions, an
administration official said.
	   The welcoming ceremony, in which Clinton was to review a
regiment of the People's Liberation Army, already had stirred angry
protests in America and a House-passed resolution urging Clinton
not to step foot in Tiananmen.
	   The square was the site of a 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, in which hundreds _ if not thousands _
of democracy advocates died. But to the Chinese government, it is
the country's spiritual and political heart, where Mao Tse-tung
declared victory in the communist revolution of October 1949.
	   No remarks were scheduled at the ceremony outside the Maoist-era
Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
planned to confer inside the Great Hall and meet with reporters.
	   Clinton's arrival in the capital marks the final step in a
gradual process of ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic
isolation of China. It is a personal victory for Jiang, who made it
a priority to arrest the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations,
bolstering his diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation.''
	   But he softened his criticism by saying China was trying to make
the summit a success and that the action against dissidents was not
as harsh as it has been in the past.
	   White House officials made clear that Clinton was not prepared
to punish China or pull back from expanding cooperation. ``I have
come to China to strengthen the ties between our two nations,'' the
president said Friday in the village of Xiahe after criticizing the
arrests.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Republican
Rep. Christopher Smith asserted that Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism
was not enough. He said, ``The tortures are not gentle.''
	   Berger said Clinton still hoped for an agreement in which the
United States and China would no longer target nuclear missiles at
each other _ a largely symbolic step since missiles could be
retargeted within minutes. The accord has been hung up by China's
insistence that the United States renounce the possible first use
of nuclear weapons _ a move Clinton refuses to take.
	   Berger indicated it was more likely that China would agree to
some restrictions on missile technology exports.
	   He said the United States also hoped for progress on energy,
pollution control, science and technology issues and a process for
improving China's legal and judicial system. On human rights,
Berger said it was unlikely any change would be apparent
immediately but he noted that some prominent dissidents were
released after Jiang's visit to Washington last October.
	   Trade is a contentious issue between the two countries, and
Berger said it would be discussed but ``I don't expect anything
concrete to come out of that.''
	   Clinton himself made clear that the United States would not
alter its policy toward Taiwan _ the ``one China'' policy by which
the United States supports neither the independence of Taiwan nor a
one China-one Taiwan system.
	   Saturday was to be the busiest day of Clinton's nine-day visit.
The talks with Jiang were expected to focus on Asia's economic
crisis and the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan as well
as U.S.-Chinese differences over human rights, trade and arms
control. The two leaders also will meet over dinner Sunday.
	   The president will confer separately with Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji, the economic troubleshooter known for his combativeness in
fighting conservative opposition to reform of China's ailing state
enterprises.
	   White House officials said they still did not know if the
government would consent to live television broadcasts across China
of Clinton's remarks Sunday or his address Monday to students at
Beijing University. ``We'd like the most exposure for the president
that we can get,'' Berger said.

Modern day pirates? Scientists want treasure hunters banned from seas

<TEXT>
	   When treasure hunters found an amazingly intact American cargo
ship that sank off the Bahamas in 1866, it was so full of mugs,
axes, porcelain table settings and sealed jars of food that they
dubbed it the ``SS Kmart.''
	   But instead of carefully dissecting the 127-foot (39-meter)
Baltic, and preserving the items for a museum, they ransacked it _
grabbing some pieces for sale and simply tossing others back
overboard.
	   ``The Baltic was like a dream ship for archaeologists that was
just ravaged,'' said Barry Clifford, a leading shipwreck salvager
from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. ``Now this wreck ... is lost
forever.''
	   Marine archaeologists who want to bring a halt to such
plundering will gather in Paris on Monday to push for an
international ban on maritime treasure hunting. Technological
innovations like robots capable of deep sea exploration are opening
up the seas and archaeologists say action must be taken before more
ships are pillaged.
	   The hunters are fighting back, through lobbying and through a
media campaign that argues the ban would discourage commercial
salvagers from donating findings to museums by driving their
activities underground.
	   The issue is gaining importance in the Caribbean and South
America. Treasure hunters from the United States are flocking there
to evade a crackdown in U.S. waters, where many wrecks have already
been destroyed.
	   Scientists report an alarming jump in the destruction of
shipwrecks off the Dominican Republic and Haiti as well as Vietnam,
Indonesia and Thailand.
	   In Ecuador, some of the same U.S.-based crew members who
plundered the Baltic in 1992 now are under investigation for
allegedly looting La Capitana Jesus Maria, a Spanish galleon that
sank in 1654 with chests of gold and silver coins.
	   Ecuadorian officials say their meager coast guard can't
adequately patrol the seas.
	   ``There is no way of knowing where the divers are, what they are
doing,'' said Juan Manuel Escalante of the Ecuadorian Embassy in
Washington. ``Our resources aren't great.''
	   Ever since scuba diving became popular in the late 1940s,
growing numbers of people have searched the seas for treasure.
	   But devices like the camera-carrying robots, which allowed
scientists to find the Titanic, are helping treasure hunters locate
shipwrecks faster, and reach the farthest recesses of the sea.
	   ``If you can get to the Titanic 2 1/2 miles down, you can
basically reach any kind of ship,'' said Ricardo Elia, a marine
archaeologist at Boston University.
	   In one notorious case, treasure hunters blew apart a
16th-century ship thought to be the oldest wreck ever discovered in
the Western Hemisphere. When archaeologists came upon the wreck off
the Turks and Caicos Islands in the 1980s, they found a modern
pipebomb, bent guns and twisted anchors among the damaged
artifacts.
	   Scientists want to end the plundering by adopting a treaty
proposed by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
	   The proposal would make shipwrecks the property of governments,
prohibit the sale of their artifacts and extend the span of
nations' territorial waters. Governments would be urged to step up
maritime vigilance.
	   The proposal prohibits ransacking wrecks anywhere, but it is
unclear how the rules would be enforced beyond national waters.
Scavengers would be subject to the laws of the government
controlling the waters of the wreck.
	   UNESCO's general assembly and national governments will have to
ratify the proposal, a process that would take several years.
	   Treasure hunters argue, however, the treaty is flawed.
	   ``It includes everything from historic shipwrecks to broken
surfboards to that beer can you threw over the boat yesterday,''
said Peter Hess, a U.S. lawyer who represents salvagers.
	   Critics contend it would ban commercial salvagers who contribute
to archaeological knowledge such as Clifford, whose Whydah museum
houses pirate artifacts.
	   ``There would no longer be an incentive for anybody to do good
archaeology in the course of recovery operations,'' Hess said.
	   He said unscrupulous divers ``would be forced to do what is
referred to as `rape and escape' _ get the goodies and run.''
	   In the end, archaeologists may have to accept a role for private
salvagers, who raise funds through stock offerings, sales of
artifacts and grants, said Bob Marks, a veteran treasure hunter
from Indialantic, Florida.
	   ``The academics have no money to do this kind of stuff,'' he
said.

U.S. envoy has no answers for Kosovo With Yugoslavia-Kosovo Serbs An AP News Analysis 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ If warring Albanian separatists and
Serbian security forces allow it, a mission of diplomatic observers
will be able to get close enough to the fighting in Kosovo to give
the outside world a more exact picture of the strife there.
	   What they cannot do, however, is end the conflict.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke left Yugoslavia on Friday after
four days of shuttle diplomacy, a peace mission that, by his own
admission, produced no magic formula for ending the undeclared war
in Kosovo.
	   The only result was to send in the diplomatic mission.
	   Some people in the West, eager to stop Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic from ordering more violence against innocent
civilians, say NATO should bomb Serbian positions in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1 and most want
independence.
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke ended his visit with a warning that NATO is stepping
up plans for intervention. But his experience in Bosnia _ the last
Balkan crisis _ shows that it will only make sense to bomb if there
is also a political plan ready to end the conflict.
	   In 1995, when America decided it had to try to end three years
of war in Bosnia, Holbrooke and his team had been negotiating
behind the scenes for four months before NATO jets finally assailed
Bosnian Serb military positions in early September.
	   The day the bombing started, Milosevic was named to negotiate,
on behalf of Bosnia's Serbs, what became the Dayton peace accord.
	   The military assault simply helped bring home a deal already in
the making.
	   In Kosovo, there is no political deal in the making _ at least,
not yet. There are no crystal-clear lines of battle _ and in the
militants of Kosovo's shadowy secessionist army, no clear
negotiating partners.
	   The ethnic Albanians insist on independence. The outside world
says no way _ a message rammed home to the Kosovo Albanians'
pacifist leader, Ibrahim Rugova, by NATO and Holbrooke.
	   ``The international community will not recognize Kosovo as an
independent country,'' Holbrooke said. ``The international
community is opposed to forcible change of boundaries.''
	   That statement was a tacit acknowledgement that much now depends
on the Kosovo Liberation Army, a still shadowy group that first
emerged in 1996 and has grown rapidly since March, when Serbian
police began cracking down on militants and sparked fighting that
has claimed more than 300 lives.
	   The rebel group says it is going to win independence with the
gun. Its growing strength makes it more difficult than ever for
Rugova to settle for something less.
	   Kosovo's Albanians are what Belgrade historian Milan Protic
calls ``a young nation,'' with many children in each family. Each
youth killed is one too many, but there are many young Albanians
ready to die for the cause.
	   Kosovo's Serbs, by contrast, are a dying breed, outnumbered and
unable to defend the province's Orthodox Church monuments that are
the touchstone of Serbian culture.
	   To stay in their homes, they believe Milosevic had no choice but
to revoke Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989, and rule with virtual
martial law.
	   The Albanians were bound to start fighting that repression some
time, and have now begun. That has only prompted tougher Serbian
measures, and sent tens of thousands _ mostly Albanians, but also
Serbs _ fleeing from home.
	   Kosovo Serbs feel abandoned by Milosevic. They know that he
eventually ditched Serb minorities in Croatia and Bosnia, whom he
had earlier goaded into ultimately fruitless wars, and fear he will
make a deal that effectively hands Kosovo to the Albanians. They
are threatening to march on Milosevic's capital, Belgrade.
	   With both sides on the ground growing more radical, it will
become ever more difficult for mediators like Holbrooke to broker
any political deal.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Prosecutors on Friday filed a
motion to block the release of three former national guardsmen
convicted of killing four U.S. religious workers in 1980.
	   Douglas Melendez, head of the regional prosecutor's office in
Zacatecoluca that is handling the case, said the convicts have not
compensated the victims' families as required by law and that one
of them has a record of bad conduct in prison.
	   If the motion to revoke the release order fails, the men could
go free on Tuesday.
	   Judge Gloria Platero on Wednesday ruled that three of the five
men convicted in the killings qualify for early release from their
30-year sentences on a law passed in April to relieve prison
overcrowding.
	   The ruling prompted expressions of concern from the U.S. \,
Roman Catholic leaders and relatives of the victims, who argue that
higher officials who may have been involved in the case were never
identified.
	   Several of the former guardsmen have said that higher-ups _ whom
they did not name _ ordered the killings. Prosecutors said they
cannot reopen the case because the statute of limitations has
expired.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and
lay worker Jean Donovan were driving along a Salvadoran road when
they were kidnapped, raped and shot dead on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ An alleged Colombian cocaine
trafficker jailed in Florida has been ordered to stand trial on
drug charges in Panama, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Jose Castrillon, 45, reputedly a member of the Cali cartel, was
extradited from Panama in May to face drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges in Tampa, Florida. He has pleaded
innocent.
	   Panamanian security chief Gabriel Castro told the daily La
Prensa that he will meet with U.S. prosecutors next week to discuss
the case, and that Castrillon could be returned to Panama to face
drug charges.
	   Police arrested Castrillon in April 1996, accusing him of
heading the Cali cartel's operations in Panama.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil loses nearly half a billion
dollars every year because of massive traffic jams that often bring
its major cities to a near standstill, a report published Friday
said.
	   With annual losses of 346 million reals (dlrs 300 million), Sao
Paulo _ South America's largest city _ tops the list of 10 cities
surveyed by the government's Institute of Economic Studies. Rio de
Janeiro had yearly losses of 73 million reals (dlrs 63 million).
	   The study found that 146 million reals (dlrs 90 million) worth
of fuel is wasted every year in traffic jams, and consumption drops
because more and more people prefer to stay home rather than face
traffic-clogged streets.
	   In Sao Paulo, people spend an average of 40 extra minutes
getting to work, reducing productivity by between 14 percent and 20
percent, the report said.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ General Motors Corp. strikes in the
United States could halt production at a Brazilian subsidiary,
labor leaders said Friday.
	   ``Because of the strike in the United States, GM is not
receiving the engine components it needs to produce the Blazer and
the S-10 pickup truck'' said Lauro da Silva, one of the directors
of the Metalworkers Union in Sao Jose dos Campos.
	   The models are made at the GM plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, 90
kilometers (55 miles) northeast of Sao Paulo.
	   GM officials were not immediately available for comment, but the
Gazeta Mercantil newspaper quoted Jose Antonio Maia, a public
relations director, as saying ``production could be partially
paralyzed.''
	   ___
	   IQUITOS, Peru (AP) _ U.S. and Peruvian officials on Friday
launched an anti-drug school in the Amazon jungle to train
commandos to stem the flow of raw cocaine out of Peru on rivers,
the new route of choice by traffickers.
	   The School for River Operations, located on the Iquitos Naval
Base 620 miles (1,000 kms) northeast of Lima, will train an elite
Peruvian counter-drug unit to cut off the flow of raw cocaine from
Peru to Colombia on the Amazon river.
	   The school's instructors, selected from Peru's police and navy,
will be trained by U.S. Army Special Forces agents, U.S. officials
said.
	   The U.S.-funded project will cost dlrs 60 million over the next
five years and will be run by Peru's navy.
	   Drug traffickers in Peru began using jungle rivers to smuggle
raw cocaine to Colombia in 1996, a year after Peru began shooting
down suspicious air craft in drug growing regions, closing down air
routes, experts say. The raw cocaine is converted to refined
cocaine in Colombia and from there shipped to the United States or
Europe.

Jane's: India to build nuclear submarine by 2004 with Russian aid 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs.
By RAMOLA TALWAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Reports that India plans to build its first
nuclear-powered submarine by 2004 fuels expectations that the South
Asian arms race will shift to developing means to deliver the
weapons.
	   India plans to fit the submarine with missiles carrying nuclear
warheads, an Indian researcher said Friday, and two reports in the
latest issue of the British-based Jane's Intelligence Review
focused on a key element of India's planned delivery system
	   The reports were by Bombay-based science writer Gopi Rethinaraj
and Andrew Koch, a senior research analyst at the Center for
Defense Information in Washington.
	   The plans to build a nuclear submarine follow nuclear tests last
month by India and its rival neighbor, Pakistan.
	   India has said it needs a nuclear defense to counter the nuclear
capability of neighbors China and Pakistan, with which it has
fought a total of four wars in the last 50 years. India accuses
China of supporting Pakistan's nuclear program.
	   Discussing his research, Rethinaraj said he believed India would
have the submarine's hull and reactor in place by the end of this
year and would complete integration of the components by 2004.
	   A fleet of five Indian submarines is planned, Jane's said,
making India the only country outside the five official nuclear
weapons states _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States _ to operate nuclear submarines.
	   Since conventional submarines need to surface at least once a
week to draw oxygen to run diesel generators, they can be easily
detected. Nuclear submarines, however, can stay submerged for more
than three months, and it is considered safer for them to carry
nuclear weapons because they are harder to detect.
	   Rethinaraj said India would arm its subs with nuclear warhead
missiles, but not immediately. Analysts estimated production of
Sagarika missiles, which can be fired underwater, would begin by
2005.
	   India's nuclear submarines are to be propelled by a pressurized
water reactor burning enriched uranium fuel. A land-based prototype
of the submarine's engine has been tested at Kalpakkam in southern
India, according to Rethinaraj and Koch.
	   Russian assistance to the Indian project is mainly in
non-nuclear areas such as hull design and underwater navigation,
the report said. It said Russia is also helping India develop the
Sagarika missiles and supplying a limited amount of turbojet and
guidance technology.
	   Jane's said Russia was given a dlrs 2.6 billion contract to
build two nuclear power reactors in southern India in exchange for
its help on the submarine project. The contract was signed five
days ago.
	   The United States maintained the reactor deal sent ``the wrong
signal at the wrong time,'' coming soon after international
sanctions were imposed to punish India for its nuclear tests. But
Russia assured India it would brook no outside interference in
their economic relationship.

	   Under a hazy sun, Clinton and Jiang walked side by side to
review an honor guard of the People's Liberation Army at the edge
of the historic square. The two leaders appeared at ease, chatting
and smiling as troops marched by.
	   As the human rights drama played out, U.S. and Chinese
negotiators reached a deal on two security issues: the two nations
agreed to no longer aim long-range nuclear missiles at one another,
and also settled on stiffer export controls on missile technology
to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions, according to an
administration official.
	   White House officials promised that Clinton, in talks with
Chinese leaders, would register a strong protest about ``thoroughly
unacceptable'' fresh arrests of dissidents. In unusually blunt
terms, Clinton's national security director deplored China's human
rights record as ``terrible.''

	   The ceremony lasted 11 minutes, then the two leaders retired
inside for their talks. Clinton's wife, Hillary, stood with Jiang's
spouse during the arrival.
	   The welcoming ceremony, in which Clinton was to review a
regiment of the People's Liberation Army, already had stirred angry
protests in America and a House-passed resolution urging Clinton
not to step foot in Tiananmen.
	   The square was the site of a 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, in which hundreds _ if not thousands _
of democracy advocates died. But to the Chinese government, it is
the country's spiritual and political heart, where Mao Tse-tung
declared victory in the communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival in the capital marked the final step in a
gradual process of ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic
isolation of China. It was a personal victory for Jiang, who made
it a priority to arrest the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese
relations and bolstered his diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation.''
	   But he softened his criticism by saying China was trying to make
the summit a success and that the action against dissidents was not
as harsh as it has been in the past.
	   White House officials made clear that Clinton was not prepared
to punish China or pull back from expanding cooperation. ``I have
come to China to strengthen the ties between our two nations,'' the
president said Friday in the village of Xiahe after criticizing the
arrests.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Republican
Rep. Christopher Smith asserted that Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism
was not enough. He said, ``The tortures are not gentle.''
	   In addition to the military agreements, the United States also
hoped for progress on energy, pollution control, science and
technology issues and a process for improving China's legal and
judicial system. On human rights, Berger said it was unlikely any
change would be apparent immediately but he noted that some
prominent dissidents were released after Jiang's visit to
Washington last October.

the United States supports neither the independence of Taiwan nor a
one China-one Taiwan system.
	   Saturday was to be the busiest day of Clinton's nine-day visit.

crisis and the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan as well
as U.S.-Chinese differences over human rights, trade and arms

fighting conservative opposition to reform of China's ailing state
enterprises.

of Clinton's remarks Sunday or his address Monday to students at
Beijing University. ``We'd like the most exposure for the president
that we can get,'' Berger said.

Woods roars back, but trails Durant in Western Open AP Sports Writer

By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ In danger of missing just his second cut
in 42 events as a professional, Tiger Woods roared back with a
5-under-par 67 that put him at 1-under 143 midway through his
defense of the Western Open title.
	   At that, Woods cut only one stroke off the deficit he faced
following Thursday's round as Joe Durant shot a 67 to take the lead
alone at 9-under 135.
	   Woods had one eagle and four birdies on Cog Hill's Dubsdread
course.
	   ``I need to have a great weekend,'' Woods said Friday. ``I need
to play two great rounds and who knows? I could shoot in the
mid-60s both rounds, post it early. You never know what could
happen.''
	   Vijay Singh, who seemingly has worked out his putting problems
this week, had seven birdies in shooting a second straight 68 and
was at 8-under 136. First-round leader Greg Kraft and Lee Janzen,
still showing the form that won him the U.S. Open last weekend,
were two strokes back. Janzen shot 69 and Kraft 70.
	   Scott Hoch shot a 67 and was at 138 and Skip Kendall had a 69
for 139. Clarence Rose, who started the day 2-over, shot a 66 to
finish at 4-under 140 with Steve Stricker, the 1996 Western Open
champ. Stricker shot a 69.
	   Woods, who was 4-over and nine strokes off the lead after the
first round, looked like he would be going home early on the front
nine. After making birdie on the first hole with a spectacular
30-foot putt that broke right to left, he struggled through the
next few holes.
	   He two-putted on No. 2, hit a bunker on No. 3, two-putted on No.
4 and then hooked his drive on No. 5. As he watched the ball sail
through the air, Woods yelled and smacked the tee marker with his
driver.
	   He turned things around on the par-5 No. 9 with an eagle.
	   ``It was huge,'' Woods said.
	   He had birdies on Nos. 10, 13 and 15. He could have gone even
lower, but he had a bogey on No. 17 and then he missed a birdie
putt on No. 18, settling for par.
	   ``I hit the ball very well today and made some putts,'' Woods
said. ``I got the ball around the hole where I had some chances and
I made them.''
	   Woods wasn't the only one who's putting improved Friday. Singh,
who's been testing putter after putter in the past several weeks,
used a new putter and a new grip.
	   ``I'm just stroking the ball so much better. And I've gone
cross-handed,'' Singh said. ``You just make a few putts, and all of
a sudden you're leading the golf tournament. That's how close it
was. I just hope it keeps going.''
	   The temperature soared and players' shirts were sopping wet from
almost the time they stepped on the course.
	   Singh, who started off No. 10, looked as if he was going to
succumb to the heat on the second nine. After bogeying No. 4, his
drive on No. 5 went into the rough. But a beautiful 9-iron to the
green left him about 25 feet (7.5 meters) from the pin and he sank
the uphill put for a birdie.
	   He picked up another stroke on the next hole, a par-3, and then
birdied the last hole.
	   ``Seemed like every time I made a birdie, I looked up and Vijay
just made one, too,'' Janzen said. ``I feel comfortable just to be
right where I am right now. It doesn't seem to be giving up any low
scores, the golf course. I assume I'll probably be in the top five
still at the end of the day, and I think that's a great position
going into the weekend.''

Chirac tries to forge alliances during first trip to southern Africa

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac
recognizes that South Africa has become the anchor for economic
growth in the region since all-race elections in 1994.
	   Chirac, on a six-day visit to southern African countries, is
trying to forge new economic and political alliances between France
and the region. Less than a year ago, French launched major changes
in its Africa policies away from involvement in her former West
African colonies.
	   Chirac met with President Nelson Mandela on Friday at the start
of a visit emphasizing South Africa as the key to France's new
policy.
	   Chirac said France wanted to strengthen ``the relationship of
friendship, partnership and trust with southern African countries,
especially South Africa which is the real engine for southern
Africa.''
	   He also said Mandela's recent visit to a summit of European
leaders in Cardiff added ``energy'' to long-running negotiations on
a trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa.
	   ``I think the agreement has been discussed for too long and it
is time to conclude it,'' he said.
	   The two president also watched three bilateral accords being
signed by French and South African officials.
	   Afterward, Mandela joked with Chirac over France's defeat of
South Africa, knocking it out of the World Cup soccer finals in
France.
	   ``Of course, I expect President Chirac to apologize to me,''
Mandela grinned
	   French Finance Minister Herbert Vedrine signed three accords on
shipping, sports and police cooperation.
	   Chirac arrived in South Africa from Namibia.
	   The trip marks the first time a French President is visiting
Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen; agreements reached AP White House Correspondent

By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a ceremony heavy in symbolism, U.S. President
Bill Clinton opened his state visit Saturday in Tiananmen Square,
the sprawling plaza haunted with memories of China's bloody
crackdown against democratic change nine years ago.
	   The president shook hands with President Jiang Zemin and other
leaders of the communist regime at a red-carpet welcoming ceremony
outside the Great Hall of the People.
	   Under a hazy sun, Clinton and Jiang walked side by side to
review an honor guard of the People's Liberation Army at the edge
of the historic square. The two leaders appeared at ease, chatting
and smiling as troops marched by.
	   As the human rights drama played out, U.S. and Chinese
negotiators reached a deal on two security issues: the two nations
agreed to no longer aim long-range nuclear missiles at one another,
and also settled on stiffer export controls on missile technology
to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions, according to an
administration official.
	   White House officials promised that Clinton, in talks with
Chinese leaders, would register a strong protest about ``thoroughly
unacceptable'' fresh arrests of dissidents. In unusually blunt
terms, Clinton's national security director deplored China's human
rights record as ``terrible.''
	   The ceremony lasted 11 minutes, then the two leaders retired
inside for their talks. Clinton's wife, Hillary, stood with Jiang's
spouse during the arrival.
	   The welcoming ceremony, in which Clinton was to review a
regiment of the People's Liberation Army, already had stirred angry
protests in America and a House-passed resolution urging Clinton
not to step foot in Tiananmen.
	   The square was the site of a 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, in which hundreds _ if not thousands _
of democracy advocates died. But to the Chinese government, it is
the country's spiritual and political heart, where Mao Tse-tung
declared victory in the communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival in the capital marked the final step in a
gradual process of ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic
isolation of China. It was a personal victory for Jiang, who made
it a priority to arrest the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese
relations and bolstered his diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation.''
	   But he softened his criticism by saying China was trying to make
the summit a success and that the action against dissidents was not
as harsh as it has been in the past.
	   White House officials made clear that Clinton was not prepared
to punish China or pull back from expanding cooperation. ``I have
come to China to strengthen the ties between our two nations,'' the
president said Friday in the village of Xiahe after criticizing the
arrests.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Republican
Rep. Christopher Smith asserted that Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism
was not enough. He said, ``The tortures are not gentle.''
	   In addition to the military agreements, the United States also
hoped for progress on energy, pollution control, science and
technology issues and a process for improving China's legal and
judicial system. On human rights, Berger said it was unlikely any
change would be apparent immediately but he noted that some
prominent dissidents were released after Jiang's visit to
Washington last October.
	   Trade is a contentious issue between the two countries, and
Berger said it would be discussed but ``I don't expect anything
concrete to come out of that.''
	   Clinton himself made clear that the United States would not
alter its policy toward Taiwan _ the ``one China'' policy by which
the United States supports neither the independence of Taiwan nor a
one China-one Taiwan system.
	   Saturday was to be the busiest day of Clinton's nine-day visit.
The talks with Jiang were expected to focus on Asia's economic
crisis and the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan as well
as U.S.-Chinese differences over human rights, trade and arms
control. The two leaders also planned to meet over dinner Sunday.
	   The president will confer separately with Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji, the economic troubleshooter known for his combativeness in
fighting conservative opposition to reform of China's ailing state
enterprises.
	   White House officials said they still did not know if the
government would consent to live television broadcasts across China
of Clinton's remarks Sunday or his address Monday to students at
Beijing University. ``We'd like the most exposure for the president
that we can get,'' Berger said.

Guinea-Bissau president says he's open to talks

	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ While Guinea-Bissau's besieged
president indicated that negotiations were possible with the
renegade soldiers trying to overthrow his government, fighting
continued in the capital of this west African country.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said Friday that he was open to
negotiations to end the conflict that has been tearing at the
capital of Bissau for the last two weeks, although he did not
specifically say he would sit down with the rebels.
	   ``We are open to dialogue on the condition that the rebels lay
down their arms,'' he said at a press conference. ``We're open for
any dialogue wherever it comes from to end this conflict.''
	   The rebels have said they will stop fighting when Vieira, whom
they accuse of corruption, steps down and leaves the country.
	   The capital has been shattered by almost three weeks of
fighting, after former army chief of staff Ansumane Mane launched a
June 7 coup attempt against Vieira.
	   Fighting continued Friday in the northern outskirts of Bissau,
where Mane's breakaway military is locked in a standoff with
loyalist troops and their Senegalese allies.
	   The nearby town of Cumere, which is just next to a key rebel
base, also came under intense shelling from a ship stationed
offshore. The rebels later returned fire on government positions in
Bissau from their main garrison.
	   Meanwhile, efforts by religious leaders to negotiate an end to
the clashes stalled Friday after Bissau's Roman Catholic Bishop
Setinio Artur Franzetti said he was unable to meet with Vieira.
	   Almost the entire Bissau population of 300,000 has fled to
nearby towns, prompting what could become a major humanitarian
crisis without an influx of food and medical relief, aid workers
said.

Kosovo Serbs appeal for protection, criticize Milosevic With ANALYSIS-Kosovo What To Do? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fearing for their future, Kosovo's
beleaguered Serbs appealed to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
for protection, warning no deal for the province could work without
them.
	   In an open letter to Milosevic on Friday, Kosovo Serb leaders
said that the province's minority Serbs were in a ``desperate''
situation, endangered by ethnic Albanian militants fighting for
secession of the predominantly Albanian province from Serbia.
	   ``Every day columns of buses and cars full of Serb children,
women and old flee Kosovo,'' said the letter by Momcilo Trajkovic
and Serbian Orthodox Church Bishop Artemije carried by Serb media.
``Nobody is asking them where (they are going) and why they are
leaving ...''
	   The two alleged that ethnic Albanian militants have imprisoned
more than 40 Serbs in makeshift camps in Kosovo. They said the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian militant organization,
controls some 40 percent of the Serbian province.
	   More than 300 people have been killed and thousands fled their
homes in Kosovo since fighting between the rebel group and Serb
police and army escalated in March. Most of the victims have been
ethnic Albanians, but dozens of Serbs have also been killed and
hundreds have fled.
	   International efforts to negotiate a settlement for Kosovo so
far have failed, as NATO continues to discuss options to end the
conflict that officials fear could engulf the whole of the Balkans.
	   Milosevic rose to power in Kosovo in 1987 by pledging protection
for the region's minority Serbs, whose rights he said were violated
by Kosovo's growing ethnic Albanian population. He revoked the
province's broad autonomy and introduced heavy military and police
presence.
	   Now, almost ten years later, the Kosovo Serbs criticize
Milosevic's policies saying their position in the province has
never been worse.
	   ``It is a painful truth, Mr. President, that Serbs in their own
state have to take up arms to defend their villages and dig
trenches around their homes,'' Trajkovic and Bishop Artemije wrote.
	   Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their history and culture.
Hundreds of Serbian orthodox monasteries dot the hills of Kosovo,
but the Serb population has now shrunk from 30 percent in the
1970s' to only 10 percent of the province's roughly 2 million
people.
	   ``Both the international community and Serbia; all have
forgotten about us,'' Trajkovic told the AP by telephone. ``But if
we didn't exist in Kosovo, there would be no Kosovo problem.''
	   He said that Serbs have called for a huge gathering to be held
June 28, on the anniversary of the 1389 Kosovo battle Serbs lost to
the Turkish empire. The gathering will be held in Gracanica, a 14th
century Serb monastery near Pristina. Milosevic is invited,
Trajkovic said.
	   ``If he doesn't come to us we will come to him. There can be no
peace in Kosovo without us, and everybody must know that _ America,
Europe and Milosevic,'' he warned.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The killing of a popular Berber singer
who had criticized both the government and the nation's Muslim
insurgency sparked rioting in eastern Algeria, where hundreds of
young people smashed windows and windshields.
	   The shooting of Lounes Matoub brought an outpouring of emotion
Friday among young people in Tizi-Ouzou, the regional capital of
Algeria's Berber people.
	   Thousands of Berbers, many sobbing, viewed the body of the
42-year-old singer, wrapped in a blood-spattered cloth at a
hospital morgue in Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Algiers.
	   Several mourners fainted before the body. His head was pierced
by three bullets.
	   Thursday's killing also heightened opposition to a law taking
effect next week that makes Arabic the sole official language of
Algeria, banning the official use of French and Berber. Berbers, a
Muslim people of North Africa, are struggling for government
recognition of their own language, Tamazight.
	   As a few army troops stood by on Friday, enraged young people
ran through the streets, shattering glass and scrawling hostile
graffiti against President Liamine Zeroual and Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouayahia.
	   They tore down Arabic-language signs to protest the language
law.
	   No arrests were reported.
	   A general strike in the Berber region was called for Sunday, the
same day Matoub is to be buried in his native village of Beni
Douala.
	   The government sent its ministers of health, communication and
culture to give their condolences to the Matoub's family. ``It's
too little, too late!'' cried protesters, who stoned a state-owned
gas station in Tizi-Ouzou.
	   Matoub was killed at a fake roadblock set up outside the nearby
town of Oued Aissi. Witnesses said his wife and two sisters-in-law
also were injured in the attack and were hospitalized.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility, officials blamed it
on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's most violent movement,
which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held him for two weeks.
	   Matoub went to France after his release and remained a vocal
opponent of both the Algerian government and the militants. He
returned to Algeria only this month.
	   Matoub was the latest Algerian artist killed during the
insurgency, which has claimed more than 75,000 lives. Militants
have often targeted singers as well as intellectuals.
	   The insurgency started after the military-backed government in
the former French colony scrapped 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

Boxer arrested on return to Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez, considered Mexico's
greatest boxer, was arrested on tax charges Friday as he returned
to his native country following a fight in Connecticut.
	   Federal police met Chavez's plane as it arrived in the
northwestern city of Culiacan and arrested him, according to the
Televisa network.
	   The federal attorney general's office said Chavez was arrested
on tax evasion charges, but said he would be eligible for release
on bail.
	   Televisa quoted Chavez's attorney, Luis Medina, as saying the
arrest is apparently related to a 1996 arrest warrant on tax
evasion. That case seemed to have been settled, but Medina said
Chavez's representatives had not received a formal certificate of
the settlement from the Treasury Secretariat.
	   On Thursday, the former six-time world champion stopped Ken
Sigurani at 2:09 of the third round in a non-title bout at the
Foxwoods Resort Casino.
	   The victory by Chavez (101-2-2) sets up a September rematch with
WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya stopped
Chavez in the fourth round in June 1996.

Thailand announces annual elephant day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has named an annual national
day in honor of its beloved but endangered national animal, the
elephant, Bangkok newspapers said Saturday.
	   The government designated March 13 as National Elephant Day to
heighten public awareness about the plight of the gentle giant,
which has been Thailand's national animal since 1963.
	   From an estimated 300,000 at the turn of the century, the number
of elephants in Thailand has declined dramatically due to loss of
habitat and exploitation by humans.
	   There are no more than 6,000 wild and domesticated elephants
left today, and the population continues to decline.
	   Once indispensable for logging and transport, today domesticated
elephants are used mainly in the tourist trade and by illegal
loggers. Wild elephants are confined mostly to small herds in half
a dozen national parks.
	   An elephant character, ``Chai-yo,'' will serve as the mascot of
the Asian Games in Bangkok in December. It is also the symbol of
Amazing Thailand Year, a major effort to attract tourists to the
recession-hit Southeast Asian country.

Four with suspected links to World Trade Center bombing arrested in Thailand 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have arrested four
Pakistanis suspected of being members of an extremist group
involved in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center building in
New York, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The four were seized in Bangkok in a raid by Thai Immigration
Police and agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
English-language The Nation said.
	   According to sources quoted by the newspaper, the four were
suspected of planning to assassinate U.S. Ambassador William Itoh
and launch a terrorist strike against the embassy here.
	   A U.S. embassy spokesman could not be immediately reached for
comment.
	   The Nation quoted senior Thai officials as saying swift
extradition of the four to the United States was possible.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack.
	   Last November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Ahmed Yousuf of
Pakistan on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as one
of the masterminds of the bombing.
	   The Nation said the four men _ Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja Pahu
Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Husen, 25 _ have been
charged by Thai authorities for illegal entry and are being jointly
questioned by Thai and U.S. investigators.

last October.
	   Clinton's wife, Hillary, stood with Jiang's spouse during the
controversial arrival ceremony.
	   To many Americans, the square is a reminder of the military's
1989 killings of hundreds _ if not thousands _ of democracy
advocates. But to most Chinese, it is the country's spiritual and
political heart, where Mao Tse-tung declared victory in the
communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival in the capital marks the final step in a
gradual process of ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic
isolation of China. It is a personal victory for Jiang, who made it
a priority to arrest the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations
and bolstered his diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation.''
	   But he softened his criticism by saying China was trying to make
the summit a success and that the action against dissidents was not
as harsh as it has been in the past.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least four people were killed and 35
others injured when five passenger cars of a Bangkok-bound train
jumped the tracks while rounding a curve, newspapers said Saturday.
	   The accident occurred Friday night in rugged jungle about 150
kilometers (93 miles) south of Chiang Mai, according to the
English-language The Nation.
	   The accident blocked the tracks and stalled at least four trains
between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, the northern Thailand hub and
tourist center.
	   The daily quoted railway officials as saying salvage operations
would begin Saturday.
	   The Bangkok-Chiang Mai railroad is one of Thailand's major
transport links, carrying thousands of domestic and foreign
passengers each week.

U.S.-China summit talks yield missile pact 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The United States and China agreed Saturday to no
longer target each other's cities with nuclear missiles. But summit
talks fell short of U.S. hopes to stop China from selling missile
technology to third-world nations, an administration official said.
	   The agreement, hammered out over weeks of diplomatic
negotiations leading up to the summit, was being formalized by
President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in private
meetings at the Great Hall of the People.
	   China, one of five declared nuclear powers, has 18 long-range
missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at U.S. cities _ compared to
the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear warheads.
	   Even with the detargeting agreement, a largely symbolic pact
that Russia also made with the United States last year, Chinese
missiles could easily be retargeted, but without the hair-trigger
speed that Clinton has said could lead to accidental launch.
	   Beijing had wanted, as a condition of detargeting, a U.S.
promise never to be the first to launch nuclear weapons _ a
concession that administration officials said as recently as Friday
that Clinton would not make.
	   While he could claim a victory on detargeting, Clinton was
unable to extract from Jiang a pledge to stop selling missile
know-how to potentially volatile nations.
	   Instead, an administration official said China would only agree
to move toward imposing stiffer export controls on missile
technology to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions _ from the
Indian subcontinent to the Korean Peninsula. The official said the
Chinese would adhere to guidelines of the Missile Technology
Control Regime and consider formally adopting the arms-control
measure.
	   In exchange for concessions on technology exports, Beijing had
demanded that Washington ease restrictions on high-technology
sales.
	   But Clinton had no political room to give on that issue. Thorny
questions remain unresolved _ in congressional and Justice
Department investigations _ about possible transfers of sensitive
technology to China under satellite launch deals that he approved
for U.S. aerospace companies, including one whose chief executive
is a major financial backer of the Democratic party.

Nervous Taiwan fights deadly virus that has killed more than 50

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Elementary schools across Taiwan started
summer vacation a week early, but their newly freed charges have no
place to go: Combating a virus that already has killed 52 children,
summer camps won't open this year, and swimming pools have barred
all kids under 14.
	   ``I guess I will have to keep my three kids at home the entire
summer and spend my days arbitrating their squabbles,'' said one
mother, Chen Mei-hua.
	   Panicked officials who failed to heed a doctor's pleas to take
action earlier are now making desperate attempts _ through school,
pool, and camp closures _ to halt the spread of the deadly
intestinal virus, which also has sent 157 to the hospital.
	   The outbreak has cast a pall over Taiwan: TV broadcasts showed
saddened schoolchildren standing in front of blackboards tallying
the funerals of their classmates. Newspapers flash death toll
updates almost daily.
	   Dr. Kuo Ming-yu believes the government could have avoided all
of this _ if they had just listened to warnings from him and
several other doctors back in April.
	   The intestinal virus is a common one that hits Taiwan every
summer and is usually much milder. But this spring, Kuo noticed
that several babies and toddlers he saw in his clinic in northern
Taoyuan had developed high fevers from brain or lung infections.
	   Kuo, whose clinic in northern Taoyuan is one of 800 islandwide
required to report regularly on possible epidemics, urged
authorities to quarantine baby rooms in hospitals and take extra
precautions in nursery schools.
	   But officials waited for lab results in order not to
unnecessarily panic the population. No action was taken for a
month. By late May, seven children were dead.
	   As of Friday, the virus, now identified as enterovirus 71, had
killed 52 children in Taiwan. Another 157 were stricken seriously
enough to require hospitalization.
	   ``Our disease-control system is unresponsive,'' Kuo said.
	   The head of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control stepped
down last month to take responsibility, and Premier Vincent Siew
apologized to the Taiwanese people on Thursday for the government's
slow response.
	   He also promised to get government agencies to work better
together to try to contain the virus, which has proved fatal
elsewhere as well: It killed more than 20 people in Malaysia and
three in Japan last year.
	   Early symptoms of the virus are fever, headache and vomiting.
Later, ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on the hands and
feet can develop.
	   Complications include encephalitis, meningitis and inflammation
of the heart muscle. It is the complications rather than the
original infection that most often prove fatal.
	   Children are particularly vulnerable: Most of those stricken are
under 5, although children as old as 16 get sick, too.
	   The disease, spread by physical contact, normally breaks out
between April and September and then disappears. The number of
serious cases rarely exceeds 10.
	   Taiwanese officials said the epidemic has peaked now, but could
take another two months to die out entirely.
	   ``The worst thing about this virus is we don't know how serious
it is, or what to do about it,'' said Feng Chiao-lan, an official
at the private Humanistic Educational Foundation.
	   ``So many parents were so panicky that they kept their children
entirely out of public, even from schools. ... Others think it is
no big deal.''
	   Three experts from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease
Control have visited to collect data and help conduct tests. One
U.S. immunologist, Hsieh Wen-ju, said he feared a similar outbreak
in China or India, two other densely populated nations.
	   No foreigners were among those stricken, but several have sent
their kids out of the country as a precaution.
	   Russel Flannery, a Taipei-based American journalist, sent his
10-year-old daughter, Hilary, to his parents' home in Vermont last
weekend to spend the summer there. ``I can't take any chances,'' he
said. ``I have only one daughter.''

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen; agreements reached statements about 0400GMT AP White House Correspondent

RETRANSMITTING
Eds: New details on agreements; will be topped with Clinton-Jiang
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin held summit talks Saturday after a welcoming ceremony heavy
in symbolism at Tiananmen Square, the sprawling plaza haunted with
memories of China's bloody crackdown against freedom nine years
ago.
	   ``I know I speak for the vast majority of the American people
when I say that this effort to improve and strengthen our
relationship is very welcome,'' Clinton told Jiang.
	   The two leaders were to announce an agreement to no longer aim
long-range nuclear missiles at each other's country. It was a
largely symbolic step, since missiles could be retargeted in a
matter of minutes. In sealing the accord, the United States did not
agree to relinquish the possible first use of nuclear weapons, as
China had demanded, officials said.
	   Clinton thanked the Chinese leader for ``the open and honest
relationship we have developed in discussing all matters.''
	   Jiang said closer U.S.-China relations ``are an inevitable
development of history and are irresistible by any force on
Earth.''
	   The two leaders met in the Maoist-era Great Hall of the People
after standing at the edge of Tiananmen Square in an 11-minute
ceremony that included a 21-gun salute. Dozens of human rights
groups, as well as a House-passed resolution, had urged Clinton not
to step foot in Tiananmen because of the symbolism.
	   Walking side by side, Clinton and Jiang reviewed an honor guard
of the People's Liberation Army and stood at attention for the
playing of national anthems. Cannons thundered the welcoming
salute. It was a sweltering morning and the normally busy square
was cleared for the ceremony.
	   The two leaders were to announce a series of modest agreements.
	   China agreed to move toward imposing stiffer export controls on
missile technology to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions,
according to an administration official. With a nuclear arms race
under way in South Asia, China and the United States agreed not to
export missiles, missile equipment, technology or delivery systems
for weapons of mass destruction. China also said it would expand
the export control list of chemicals that could be used for weapons
purposes.
	   In a sensitive area, China agreed to permit inspections of high
tech American exports, such as supercomputers, to insure they are
used for intended purposes.
	   To Americans, Tiananmen Square is a reminder of the military's
1989 killings of hundreds _ if not thousands _ of democracy
advocates. But to China, it is the country's spiritual and
political heart, where Mao Tse-tung declared victory in the
communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival marked the final step in a gradual process of
ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic isolation of China. It
was a personal victory for Jiang, who made it a priority to arrest
the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations and bolstered his
diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible.''
	   Yet White House officials made clear that Clinton was not
prepared to punish China or pull back from expanding cooperation.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Rep.
Christopher Smith, a conservative Republican, asserted that
Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism was not enough. He added, ``The
tortures are not gentle.''
	   Clinton himself made clear that the United States would not
alter its policy toward Taiwan. The United States supports a ``a
one China'' policy that does not recognize Taiwan's claims of
independence and holds that the future relationship is a matter to
be resolved peacefully between the two parties.
