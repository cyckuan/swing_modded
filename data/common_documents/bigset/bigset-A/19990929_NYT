PAUL HILL, 65, FOUNDER OF WASHINGTON CHORUS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paul Hill, the founder of the 160-voice Paul Hill
Chorale and a leader in establishing Washington as one of the
nation's principal centers for choral singing, died on Monday at
his home in Potomac, Md. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's
disease, his wife, Joyce, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill formed the chorale, now called the Master Chorale of
Washington, in 1967, and it quickly became one of Washington's
leading groups. Its first performance was of Bach's motet ``Jesu,
meine Freude'' at the National Cathedral, and it performed at the
opening of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedy Center opening, Hill's chorus joined with the
Choral Arts Society to sing ``A Free Song'' by William Schuman, one
of the many modern pieces that Hill championed.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was born in Cincinnati and was raised and educated in Los
Angeles, receiving a bachelor's degree in music from La Sierra
College (now Loma Linda University) and a master's degree in church
music from the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   His wife recalled Tuesday that one of his early teaching jobs
was directing a school band but that he was called upon in midyear
to direct the choir when its director left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the sound of the human voice so much that he never
went back to the band,'' Mrs. Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill then taught singing at Southwestern University in Keene,
Texas, and at Columbia Union College in Takoma Park, Md., a
Washington suburb. His wife said that he formed the chorale to give
his graduating vocal students a place to continue their singing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides leading the Paul Hill Chorale, which was made up of 144
amateurs augmented by 16 paid professionals, Hill formed the
20-voice Washington Singers (now the Master Chorale Chamber
Singers), one of the nation's few fully professional ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Paul Hill Chorale sang the premiere of ``An
American Oratorio'' by Ned Rorem, and in 1991 it celebrated its
25th anniversary with premieres of works it commissioned from
Rorem, Libby Larsen and Gregg Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Illness forced Hill to yield his leadership of the singers to
Donald J. McCullough in 1996, but he remained active as a
consultant. Even when the disease left him mostly paralyzed, his
wife said, he was able to write letters with a computer program
with which he activated representations of typewriter keys on a
screen by staring at the letters one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by four children from a
previous marriage, two daughters, Kathleen Clem of Apex, N.C., and
Karen Hill of Forest Falls, Calif.; and two sons, Roger, of
Morganton, N.C., and Randall, of Hood River, Ore.; a sister, Carol
Jean Kenaston of Inverness, Fla., and six grandchildren.

BIG BOPPERS GOING YARD AND THEN GOING HOME

<P>
   Except for the Yankees and their legendary succession of home
run hitters, championship teams and home run champions have shown
no significant correlation throughout baseball history. But the
1990s have produced even fewer home run champions on first-place
teams than in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   That development has been punctuated by the two-year onslaught
of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who entered Tuesday night's games
tied for the National League lead with 61 home runs a year after
they became the first two players to break the 61-homer barrier.
Sosa hit his 62nd Tuesday night against the Phillies; McGwire's
Cardinals were rained out in St Louis against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   As exciting and remarkable as their exploits have been the
second time around, much attention has been focused on the negative
aspects of the astronomical number of home runs McGwire and Sosa
have hit.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Chicago Cubs won four consecutive games last week,
they threatened to become the first team in baseball history to
have one of its players hit more home runs than it had victories.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 31, when Sosa hit his 55th home run, until last
Wednesday, when the Cubs gained their 61st victory, Sosa was ahead
of his team. Now the Cubs are leading him.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cubs have a winning record (29-27) in games in
which Sosa has hit home runs. St. Louis has a losing record (21-31)
in games in which McGwire has homered. McGwire, in fact, has hit
more home runs in losing games (38) than any player in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, suggests that McGwire somehow contributes
to Cardinal losses with his home runs. In their third and fourth
losses in a four-game sweep by Cincinnati earlier this week,
McGwire's home runs were instrumental in triggering scoring sprees
that put the Cardinals ahead of the Reds, only to have the Reds
come back themselves and win.
</P>
<P>
   Based on developments in this decade, home runs and victories
don't necessarily go together. Only twice since 1989 has a league's
home run champion played for a team that finished in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle hit 50 home runs in 1995 when Cleveland won the
American League Central title and the league pennant. Ken Griffey
Jr. hit 56 in 1997 when Seattle finished first in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Belle and Griffey represent the smallest collection in their
category since the 1940s, when only two players combined individual
and team championships. They were Hank Greenberg, who hit 41 home
runs when the Detroit Tigers won the AL pennant in 1940 and Dolph
Camilli, who socked 34 when the Brooklyn Dodgers won the NL pennant
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1954 in the AL and 1956 in the NL that home run
champions again finished first in the won-lost standings. Larry
Doby (32) did it with Cleveland in '54 and Duke Snider (43) with
the Dodgers in '56.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have had far more instances of team and home run
championships than any other team, but even they have not achieved
those dual honors regularly. In the 37 years the Yankees have
finished first in the league or their division, they have produced
the AL home run champion 14 times _ Babe Ruth five times; Mickey
Mantle four times; and Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris, Graig
Nettles and Reggie Jackson once each. In recent years the Yankees
haven't had that type of home run hitter. Since they resumed
finishing first in 1996, they have had lineups that featured good
hitters, though not prolific home run hitters. The 44 home runs
Tino Martinez hit in 1997 were an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The title teams in the 1990s, however, haven't been completely
devoid of home run hitters. First-place teams have had players with
impressive home run performances; they just haven't been good
enough to put the players at the head of their leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last season Greg Vaughn whacked 50 home runs for
San Diego, the NL pennant winner. In another season, his total
would have stood out and he would have been the league champion.
But not in 1998, when McGwire hit 70 and Sosa 66 in the same
league.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly last season, two of the AL division champions,
Cleveland and Texas, had players with 45 home runs (Manny Ramirez
and Juan Gonzalez), a once hefty total. But Griffey hit 56 for the
second successive season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Gonzalez connected for 47 home runs and Belle 48 for AL
division champions, but three players topped them, led by McGwire
with 52 for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 McGwire hit 42 for AL West champion Oakland, but
Gonzalez won the league title with 43.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that has made a major difference in NL home run races
in the '90s has been the creation of the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at a home run-friendly altitude, Rockies' hitters won
three consecutive league titles before McGwire and Sosa began their
slugging act last season. Dante Bichette won with 40 in 1995,
Andres Galarraga with 47 in '96 and Larry Walker with 49 in '97,
but the expansion Rockies weren't good enough to finish first. Last
year, when Galarraga played for a team good enough to win, Atlanta,
he clouted 44 home runs, but he was easily eclipsed in the greatest
home run race in baseball history.

MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY, 69, WRITER OF DARKOVER FANTASIES
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Nev.)  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marion Zimmer Bradley, a science fiction writer and the creator
of the Darkover series of fantasies, died on Saturday at Alta Bates
Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69 and lived in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Elisabeth Waters, her cousin
and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bradley rose to fame in 1958 with the publication of ``The
Planet Savers,'' the first of her top-selling Darkover novels. The
series eventually comprised 21 books, written almost exclusively by
Ms. Bradley, which told the story of a planet discovered at the end
of the 21st century and colonized by Earth.
</P>
<P>
   She later worked primarily in the fantasy genre, often adding a
feminist spin to well-known myths. In 1983, she published her most
famous work, ``The Mists of Avalon,'' a retelling of the legend of
King Arthur from the vantage point of its principal women _
Viviane, Gwynyfar, Morgaine and Igraine. Hailed by Maureen
Quilligan in The New York Times as ``a massive narrative that is
rich in events placed in landscapes no less real for often being
magical,'' the novel remained on the Times best-seller list for
four months. In her 1987 work ``The Firebrand,'' she retold the
story of the Trojan War from the perspective of the goddess
Cassandra, whom she renamed Kassandra.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Albany, N.Y., Ms. Bradley began to write as a teen-ager
and by the age of 17 had created a magazine for science-fiction
fans. Two years later she began writing for pulp magazines. In 1964
she graduated from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and
then did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley
from 1965 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Though she continued to write until her death, Ms. Bradley's
poor health in the early 1990s limited her activities. She devoted
much of her time to editing magazines, including her own, Mary
Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She
also edited an annual anthology called ``Sword and Sorceress'' from
Daw Books in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bradley's marriage to Robert Alden Bradley ended in divorce
in 1964. She is survived by three children, David Bradley of
Oakland, Calif.; Patrick Breen of Denver, and Moira Stern of
Sparks, Nev.; a brother, Leslie Zimmer of East Greenbush, N.Y., and
two grandchildren.

`SPIDER' COULD DROP IN AT LAKERS CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Desperate to strengthen their frontcourt,
the Los Angeles Lakers are on the verge of signing an aging power
forward with a bug-like nickname who won championships with the
Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Worm. The Spider.
</P>
<P>
   John ``Spider'' Salley, 35 years old and retired since 1996, is
expected to sign a contract with the Lakers sometime in the next
few days, sources said Tuesday. He's a curious choice, having
retired three years ago, his contact with the NBA since limited to
a seat in the NBC studio next to Hannah Storm.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6-11 (and last he played, about 255 pounds), the
gregarious veteran could compete for a job backing up at center and
power forward. The Lakers have just four players to play the two
positions and no real bruisers after Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Salley probably will get a non-guaranteed contract and be
invited to training camp, which begins Tuesday at UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th overall pick in 1986, Salley played six seasons in
Detroit, winning championships in 1989 and '90. He earned a third
ring playing for the Bulls, under current Lakers coach Phil
Jackson, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A defensive specialist, he blocked 100 or more shots in six of
his first seven seasons. In 10 NBA seasons, which also included a
short stint with Toronto and three years with Miami, Salley
averaged 7.3 points and 4.7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rambis signs: Former head coach Kurt Rambis, who previously
decided to stay with the Lakers, made it official, signing a
contract to become a front-office consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, his position is adviser to the president/basketball.
His role is ambiguous but will entail consulting withowner Jerry
Buss, executive vice president Jerry West and general manager Mitch
Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime assistant and former player, Rambis coached the
Lakers after Del Harris was fired in February. He was replaced by
Jackson in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt has long been a fan favorite, as well as a favorite of
those of us in the Lakers family,'' Kupchak said, ``and we're
pleased that he will remain a part of our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Celestand signs: The Lakers announced the signing of rookie
guard John Celestand. The second-round pick signed a one-year,
partially guaranteed deal for the rookie minimum of $301,000. The
money will become fully guaranteed if he makes the 12-man roster or
starts the season on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Celestand is the third point guard on the roster, behind
returning starter Derek Fisher and second-year man Tyronn Lue. The
Lakers continue to pursue veteran Ron Harper and have expressed
interest in Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   First-round pick Devean George has not signed a contract and the
stalemate in negotiations could potentially keep him out of camp, a
team source said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets' long wait to reel in free agent Shandon Anderson ended
Tuesday when Anderson agreed to terms and arrived in Houston to
sign with the Rockets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week before the start of training camp in Austin, Anderson
agreed to a contract worth $4.3 million over two years and will
hold an option for a third season at $2.42 million, according to
sources close to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The third year was considered an important protection for
Anderson, allowing him to hold the option of remaining with the
Rockets for a third season to become a ``Larry Bird'' free agent.
That would allow him to re-sign for a contract in excess of the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson opted not to take a three-year contract, thus
preserving the option to seek a new deal in two seasons, the first
chance the Rockets have to be under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson holds Bird rights with the Jazz and could have remained
with Utah for far more than he will receive from his agreement with
the Rockets. Anderson also considered the Golden State Warriors and
Indiana Pacers, both of whom could have been under the salary cap
after the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, heading into his fourth season out of Georgia,
preferred the role the Rockets could offer to start as a shooting
guard. He also wanted to live in a more urban setting than Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz owner Larry Miller said last week that Anderson no longer
would consider returning to the Jazz, but last-ditch talks
continued through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the Rockets' prime free-agent target outside of the
organization and considered the NBA's top unsigned free agent, and
agent Dan Fegan flew to Houston on Tuesday but were not available
for comment. A news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. today to
announce the signing. Rockets officials, citing team policy, would
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, already over the salary cap, could offer only the
$2.1 million salary-cap exception. That exception is available only
every other season for teams over the salary cap. They also have a
$1 million cap exception available this season or next.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 25, averaged 8.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last
season as a Jazz reserve. The Rockets envision him as a starter at
shooting guard and as a backup to Scottie Pippen at small forward.
He also would fit in with plans to adopt a more up-tempo style of
play and is considered an excellent defender at either position.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's signing could send Rockets free-agent guard Sam Mack
to Golden State or Indiana. Mack's agent, Bill Duffy, said the
Rockets have told him they probably would not bring back Mack if
they could sign Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door is still open,'' Mack said. ``But now we need to sit
down and decide what they (the Rockets) want to do. I'm still their
player; I still have my Bird rights; they could still sign me. It's
just an issue of what they're willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to both teams (Indiana and Golden State) every day.
Both teams are interested. They want to sign me. But they want to
see what move Shandon makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever said salary negotiations would be easy? It's a long,
drawn-out process. The key is to wait and be patient. I can't
control what the (Rockets') staff is thinking. They might see some
fit for the team that I don't see right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fit that drew the Rockets to Anderson was to add his defense
and offensive versatility to the similar skills of Pippen, Steve
Francis and Cuttino Mobley. After waiting so long to complete their
pursuit of Anderson, they finally had the chance to see each of
their major offseason acquisitions in town at the same time
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson and Francis arrived Tuesday to handle the
logistics of their moves, Kenny Thomas, the Rockets' first-round
draft pick, and Tony Massenburg, acquired with Francis from
Vancouver, began workouts at the Rockets' training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Those pieces began to come together, but Pippen's future with
the Rockets remained less certain. Pippen trade rumors have become
an almost daily source of amusement or annoyance for the Rockets.
But though Rockets officials would not comment on trade
speculation, sources said virtually every rumored deal has been
either unattractive or impossible because of salary-cap restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is ironic given the sudden wave of Pippen reports that
the past two days have been devoted almost exclusively to closing
the deal with Anderson, there have been offers made to acquire
Pippen. The Lakers' offer of Glen Rice, Robert Horry and a third
player included to make the cap manipulations work _ a trade that
would have to be a part of many of the rumored deals _ has long
been unavailable. Even before the Lakers opted to at least try to
make their current mix work, the Rockets were hesitant to trade
Pippen largely for a player, Rice, in the last year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of the offers the Rockets have received to deal Pippen,
virtually all have been in exchange for high-priced, expendable
players, rather than for a replacement superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Other deals also have proved equally trying. Forward Don
MacLean, acquired from Orlando in the Francis deal, was added in
part to make it easier to pare the roster than if the Rockets had
kept every Grizzlies player included in the deal to make the
salaries match. But at $2.8 million next season, and $9.3 million
over the next three seasons, MacLean has been difficult to move.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Maloney, the fourth point guard last season, is a base-year
player and to be included in a trade would have to be dealt for
another base-year player with a similar salary if both teams are
over the cap, as most are by now.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the roster has begun to take shape. Charles
Barkley remains unsigned but has committed to return to the team.
But like Mack, the other free agents _ Anthony Miller and Stanley
Roberts _ do not fit into the team's plans. Miller is close to an
agreement with the Dallas Mavericks, his agent Tony Dutt said.
Roberts said Tuesday he is scheduled to work out for the Milwaukee
Bucks today.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' second-round picks, center Tyrone Washington and
forward Venson Hamilton, have signed to play in Europe, Washington
in Italy and Hamilton in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As far as players the Rockets would attempt to add, the Rockets
could face a decision with the last roster spot currently
available. (Although teams can bring as many as 20 players to camp,
the rosters must be at 15 players with three on the injured list at
the start of the season.) With Anderson and Barkley, the roster
will include 14 players.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' next decision could be whether to add depth at
center or small forward/shooting guard. Center Thomas Hamilton
remains a project, but Massenburg could prove a sufficient backup
for Hakeem Olajuwon while Hamilton continues to develop and work on
conditioning. Mobley is the only true shooting guard reserve, but
the Rockets could play Bryce Drew and Francis together in a
backcourt if needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An actor who plays a leading role in the Broadway
musical ``Ragtime'' and who was mistakenly arrested two months ago
at his Harlem apartment building filed court papers on Tuesday
stating his intent to file a lawsuit against the city in federal
court next month.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, Alton Fitzgerald White, and three other plaintiffs,
all of whom are black, allege that police officers stopped them
solely because of their race, even though they did not fit the
description of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, the four men filed official notice with
the city of their plans to seek at least $3 million in punitive
damages and the establishment of a court-monitored program that
would insure that the Police Department adequately disciplined
officers who stopped suspects solely because of their race, a
practice known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis M. Steel, the lawyer for the three men arrested with
White, said on Tuesday that he believed that racial profiling was a
systemic problem. He said a monitor needed to be in place to
oversee training and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   White, who spoke about the arrest at Rice High School in Harlem
on Tuesday, said he was in the vestibule of his building on July 16
when police officers stopped him and the three other men. The
officers, he said, told the four men they were looking for four
black men with guns. The four men were arrested, handcuffed and
strip-searched before being released five hours later.
</P>
<P>
   White's lawyer, Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, said, ``he wants to see systematic
changes. He does not want to see that happen to anyone else in the
city, specifically African-American males.'' Siegel said his client
would not settle the lawsuit without assurances that there would be
wide-ranging changes in police practices.
</P>
<P>
   Senior police officials publicly apologized to White and the
three other men, Ronald C. Jackson, 28, a student affairs
coordinator at Columbia University; Marcus McCollum, a public
relations director and Christopher Montgomery, 24, a graduate
student at Columbia.

   After the arrests, Marilyn Mode, the chief spokeswoman for the
Police Department, said the men were not picked up because of their
race, but because they fit a description of drug dealers given by a
resident. She said strip-searching was routine procedure in all
felony drug cases. Her office did not return telephone calls for
comment on Tuesday.

FOX: MALONE'S NOT IN JEOPARDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The firing of Los Angeles Dodgers president and
CEO Bob Graziano, the latest bombshell to rock the foundation of
the once-stable Dodgers, shouldn't have an impact on changes the
club wants to make in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who received a vote of
confidence for his own job security from Rick Welts, president of
Fox Sports Enterprises, said the organization's plan of attack
remains the same even after Tuesday's firing of Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Bob and I always kept Rick and ownership
abreast of what the plan is and what direction we're heading,''
Malone said. ``They were aware of our plan for the offseason. It
will continue in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Welts will sit in for Graziano while a successor is found, but
he reiterated his commitment to Malone and the general manager's
ability to turn around the dormant organization. Malone was signed
to a four-year contract by Graziano last September.
</P>
<P>
   Welts said the decision to oust Graziano, who served in the
organization for 14 years, had nothing to do with the team's
mediocre performance despite an $80 million payroll. The Dodgers
entered the day 74-82 and 22 games behind second-year franchise
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Malone is not going anywhere next year,'' Welts said.
``The baseball operations is in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and Malone will meet with the rest
of the Dodgers' baseball decision-makers during this season-ending
road trip to decide their final course of action heading into the
offseason. Among the topics will be the future of the coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Malone and Johnson repeatedly talked
about paring the club's payroll while upgrading the talent. Both
stated that trading a high-priced veteran is a possibility since
the team, in its current state, would have a $92 million payroll
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also are saddled with burdensome multiyear contracts
on several players the Dodgers may shop during the winter. Included
in that is second baseman Eric Young and, despite the public
outburst against management, the ultra-popular Raul Mondesi. They
each are signed through 2001 at a combined $29.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fan favorite Eric Karros has one more year left on
his contract and Malone said, at this point, he won't talk about a
contract extension. Johnson said the Dodgers might move one of
their experienced pitchers as well, and all signs point toward
right-hander Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had conversations with Kevin and Bob from a field-level
standpoint about some of the things I'd like to change,'' Johnson
said. ``I don't know (Fox Group chairman and CEO) Peter Chernin or
(Fox Entertainment Group Co-COO) Chase Carey. I don't know how much
communication there is between them. The general manager makes
(player-personnel) decisions, but if you're talking about a lot of
money, ownership has to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox showed its willingness to get involved since purchasing the
Dodgers from Peter O'Malley last March. Chase himself was
responsible for the trading of then-franchise catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Carey and Chernin helped lure free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown.
They signed off on the seven-year, $105 million contract that
includes chartered flights for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Dodgers can continue down their planned path for
the offseason, but that could change with the appointment of the
new president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to go out and hire someone else in that
position, what impact is he going to have in trades and free agents
and payroll?'' Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``You
don't know what's going to happen. It's an unstable situation. This
has been the most stable organization for a long time. I think
they're searching for an identity.''

BUSH PUSHES RECORD, RE
 JECTS TALK HE GOT ANY SPE
 CIAL TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By CHRIS MOESER 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  PHOENIX - Responding to ongoing
stories about his privileged back ground, George W. Bush on Sept.
28 denied suggestions that he received preferential treatment in
joining the Texas Air National Guard and again when he bought the
Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview with The Arizona Republic, Bush sought instead
to highlight his record as governor, suggesting the stories were
idle spec ulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what happens when you're running for office,''
Bush said. ``People speculate on all kinds of things. The truth of
the matter is I put together the group that ended up buying the
team (Rangers) from Eddie Chiles. He wanted to sell, and I
purchased.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, based in part on earlier reports, said
Sept. 28 that Bush got preferential treatment when he bought the
team in 1989 from Chiles, a longtime friend of Bush's father,
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The story suggested Bush's invest ment group was unable to put
together a deal until Baseball Com missioner Peter Ueberroth
intervened to attract another investor, Richard Rainwater of Fort
Worth. Ueberroth reportedly encouraged Rainwater to join the deal
``out of respect'' for President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The story also suggests that Bush borrowed most of the $606,000
he invested in the team _ less than 2 percent of the total
investment. He earned $14.9 million when the team was sold last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I was the buyer of choice. Eddie Chiles decided
he wanted to sell to my group. What ended up happening is the
commis sioner came into Dallas and said we needed more Texans in my
group,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard and I put our groups together and became partners.
It's a very successful franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is clearly tiring of the questions about his family ties.
When the National Guard issue was raised, Bush brushed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to try to write something negative, just say he's
George Bush's son. I can only tell people what the facts are,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guard unit that I joined was looking for pilots. They were
out actively recruiting for pilots. I put my name in the hat . . .
I flew, and I was proud of my service.''
</P>
<P>
   A former speaker of the Texas House said Sept. 27 that he called
the head of the Texas Air National Guard at the request of a
longtime Bush family friend to help Bush join the guard in the
midst of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But Ben Barnes said no one in the Bush family asked for his
help.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his background and upbringing, Bush responded
only that he grew up in ``a house of love'' before launching into a
de fense of his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you need to do is go over to Texas and ask people
to go check. I was the first governor ever elected to back-to-back,
four-year terms. . . . And I've got a record,'' he said, supporting
education, tax cuts, welfare reform, and faith-based pro grams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing of having run and won and then put
yourself on the ballot for confirmation one way or the other is,
people get to make a decision based not only on some one's brains
but on someone's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated calls for commentator Pat Buchanan to remain a
Republi can. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has called on Buchanan to
leave the party. Buchanan may bolt to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he would stay in the Republican primary so we can de
bate ideas and see whether Re publicans endorse my ideas or his
ideas or Senator McCain's ideas,'' Bush said. He said he rejected
Buchanan's suggestion that the United States should not have de
clared war on Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he chooses to bolt the party, there's nothing I can do
about it. What I then need to do is convince Republicans who may
follow him that a Republican president is one who works with the
Congress'' and gets things done.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined his efforts to fight for Hispanic votes in
the race and broaden the appeal of the GOP. He praised McCain for
also reaching out to Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a series of Republican voices saying, `We
hear.' Step one is to ask for the vote,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I've done a good job of in Texas is
rejecting the politics of pitting one group of people against
another. I've been a uniter, not a divider.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has opposed English-only re quirements and California's
Prop osition 187, which denied benefits and education to children
of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly important mes sage to Hispanic moms and
dads to say that . . . your children will learn to read and write
in English because we understand English is the gate way to being
able to access the American Dream. But instead of saying English
only, what I've said is, I support English plus. English em powers
people to realize their dreams, plus I respect the Hispanic
heritage,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, Bush was asked a question in Spanish
and responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child ought to be educated, regardless of the status of
their parents. I can understand the reasons the people of
California expressed themselves the way they did, but I just happen
to have different point of view,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed a vigorous campaign in Arizona, hinting about a
debate and havinge ``an active TV buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is an important state. It is in play . . . I intend to
campaign hard here.''

YANKEES BEAT ORIOLES, 9-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Somewhere there is a college genius flopped on a
fraternity couch who can relate to the New York Yankees. The final
exam is imminent, but there's no sense of urgency. The final exam
is coming, but there's no sign of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees probably haven't approached every test _ the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, the Kansas City Royals _ as seriously as they
should have, but they'll probably be O.K. They still have the
wherewithal to ace the American League playoffs. The Yankees edged
closer to clinching the A.L. East on Tuesday night, reducing their
magic number to two by thumping Baltimore, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez drove in four runs and with 102 runs batted in for
the season, he became the fourth Yankee to drive in 100 or more
runs this season, joining Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill and Derek
Jeter. The quartet is the first to accomplish this feat since Joe
DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, Bill Dickey and George Selkirk did so for the
1939 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, left the game
after his second at-bat with what the team described as a slightly
sprained left thumb, and X-rays showed no broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch swung and missed at a pitch, immediately released the
bat with his left (nonthrowing) hand and grabbed for his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees Manager Joe Torre and the trainer Gene Monahan went to
speak to Knoblauch, who went on to finish his at-bat _ grounding
out _ before being replaced for the bottom of the third inning.
Knoblauch, who wore a soft cast on his left hand after the game,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any substantial injury to Knoblauch's thumb would be a problem,
of course, because his left hand is dominant in his swing. He uses
the left hand to pull the bat and snap its barrel through the
strike zone. Opposing teams usually try jamming Knoblauch, anyway,
and would have greater reason to do so if his hand is weakened.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees slogged through their brutal 10-6 loss to Tampa
Bay Monday, they realized they played without enthusiasm, Martinez
said, without intensity. Torre watched silently, visibly upset; any
thought balloons that might have been attached to Torre certainly
would've contained a fair share of profanity. ``We saw Joe's
face,'' said Martinez, referring to the Torre, ``and we realized''
how poorly they played.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took a 4-1 lead after two innings, against the
rookie pitcher Ed Yarnall. But in the third inning, Derek Jeter
singled and Bernie Williams walked, and Martinez strolled to the
plate as the potential tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Martinez determined to forget about his
batting average, which has hovered around a disappointing .260 most
of the season, and just concentrate on having good at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and others noticed the difference in batting practice the
last couple of days: Martinez was driving the ball to both sides of
the field. ``You know it's a real good sign when he's going gap to
gap,'' said Scott Brosius, the third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Baltimore's Sidney Ponson in the third inning, Martinez
turned on a 97-mile-an-hour fastball and launched the ball into the
seats, his face splitting into a smile as he rounded the bases. The
Yankees went on to roll over the Orioles, capitalizing on some of
the 11 walks issued by Baltimore. D'Angelo Jimenez, Knoblauch's
replacement, broke a 5-5 tie in the sixth inning with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would have to collapse like _ well, the Mets _ to
finish behind Boston in the A.L. East. Their focus now, Brosius
said before the game, is to get back to playing well again, and to
win the home-field advantage through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 95-62, one game behind Cleveland (96-61) for the
best record in the league, and one game ahead of the Texas Rangers
(94-63) as the other two division leaders also won tonight. The
Yankees beat the Indians in 7 of 10 meetings this season, and
bested the Rangers in 8 of 12; should they tie either team, the
Yankees would have the home field advantage based on their regular
season pre-eminence in head-to-head games.
</P>
<P>
   They have two more games left with the Orioles, three more in
Tampa Bay over the weekend. Torre was not talking about having the
home field in the playoffs after the game. He just wants the
Yankees _ the best and brightest in the league, on any given day or
week _ to get back to playing consistently. ``We need to win
games,'' Torre said. ``That's our priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The final exam is imminent.

LOS ANGELES: to get worked out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Altogether, investigators interviewed more than 60 people and
culled through hundreds of pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations include:
</P>
<P>
   - A safety inspector measured ``elevated readings'' of lead
contamination in several freshly painted San Fernando Valley
elementary schools. The inspector was concerned that the district
had illegally used lead paint, likely purchased in Mexico, in the
classrooms. It is unclear if anyone ever followed up.
</P>
<P>
   - A safety branch supervisor downplayed the extent of asbestos
contamination at Van Nuys Middle School during a March 1998 meeting
with faculty.
</P>
<P>
   - Between 30 and 40 construction workers at Portola Middle
School &UR;  &LR; in suburban Tarzana may have been exposed to asbestos
during maintenance work. A safety branch inspector documented
asbestos around a broken pipe, but workers may not have been
notified.
</P>
<P>
   - Administrators delayed closing down the physical education
office at Wilson High School near downtown Los Angeles after
finding asbestos. The delay exposed faculty to the carcinogen for a
``few days'' longer than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   - District officials failed to evacuate students at South Gate
High School during an asbestos cleanup on the same floor.
</P>
<P>
   - Fearing liability, a safety branch supervisor chastised an
inspector for writing in a report that children at Cathay Center
School were playing with broken pieces of floor tile. The tile was
suspected of containing asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   - Administrators ignored warnings from safety branch inspectors
about building Belmont on an oil field and cut the branch out of
the process for at least two years, giving the inspectors ``no real
power or oversight authority.''
</P>
<P>
   - Supervisors in the Real Estate and Asset Management Branch
demanded a safety inspector be removed from his duties monitoring
Jefferson Middle School after the inspector sought additional
testing.
</P>
<P>
   - Jefferson Middle School also was used as a collection point
for hazardous materials during construction.
</P>
<P>
   There was a widely-held perception that safety inspectors should
``spin'' their reports of hazards and not confront other LAUSD
managers with their findings, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a recent scathing audit of Belmont High School's
construction, the Rohman report, reviewed by the Daily News, does
not recommend disciplining or firing specific district employees.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Belmont report and Rohman report both cite the
actions of many of the same officials, including Wong; another
former Environmental Health and Safety Branch director, Diane Doi;
and Real Estate and Asset Management Branch director Robert Niccum.
</P>
<P>
   Niccum said he had not received the report but disputed the
report's charge that political considerations were put ahead of
scientific ones when dealing with state environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we ever distort (state law) for political purposes?
Certainly not,'' Niccum said.
</P>
<P>
   Wong and Doi could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Scott Wildman, a vocal critic of the
district's environmental oversight at Belmont, called the report
``another nail in the coffin of many high-level administrators at
the district.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clean house, but we have to clean house at the
top,'' Wildman said, before praising the superintendent for
allowing the investigation to go forward unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent has put us in a position where we have
identified the problems and now can eliminate the people who have
victimized the children and wasted millions of tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While Arabzadeh, the whistle-blower, declined to cooperate with
Rohman, the ousted environmental chief said he gave a great amount
of detailed information to LAUSD auditor Don Mullinax's
investigation into the Belmont fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Arabzadeh said he was pleased to hear that the report backs up
some of the charges he leveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very glad this is all coming out,'' he said. ``Our kids
deserve a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   He also disputed the idea that he did nothing to stop the
mismanagement and doctoring of reports cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report advises the school board to give the Environmental
Health and Safety Branch equal status to the real estate and
maintenance divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Rohman wrote that the school board should give the safety branch
more money and hire a safety director with a strong scientific and
technical background.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he recommends opening up more safety branch records
to the public, with fewer documents labeled as ``privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found three incidents where the district's
application of the attorney-client privilege was ``questionable at
best,'' Rohman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the privilege may have been misused for an
entire category of documents.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD General Counsel Richard K. Mason said he had not reviewed
the Rohman report, but was aware of the investigator's concerns
regarding the distribution of public information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were issues related to some offices utilizing a
confidential stamp, which when brought to my attention I
rectified,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have indicated to staff that they need to be vigilant in
making sure documents are appropriately stamped confidential only
when justified.''

REPORT SAYS LAUSD HID SAFETY HAZARDS FOR A DECADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Unified School District officials
routinely covered up serious environmental hazards at campuses
throughout the district, jeopardizing students, according to a
report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy report concludes the nation's second-largest school
district downplayed safety issues - including lead and asbestos
contamination - because of pressure from district managers.
</P>
<P>
   The report charges that politics - not science - ruled decisions
about environmental hazards, warping the findings of the LAUSD
Environmental Health and Safety Branch, the district's watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a change from the `let's-not-scare-parents'
approach to an open process that allows community monitoring and
involvement,'' according to the report written by Keith Rohman, a
private investigator for Public Interest Investigations, the Los
Angeles firm that conducted the probe.
</P>
<P>
   By concealing problems, students may have been exposed to
lead-based paint in many San Fernando Valley schools, and children,
teachers, and maintenance workers at several schools may have been
exposed to asbestos, a carcinogen, the report contends.
</P>
<P>
   Former and current employees cited in the report also charged
that the corrupted oversight process contributed to the district's
decision to build the Belmont Learning Center atop an active oil
field plagued by explosive and deadly gases, and led officials to
temporarily stockpile hazardous materials at Jefferson Middle
School during its construction.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, district managers edited safety reports issued by
inspectors in the Environmental Health and Safety Branch to remove
information deemed ``too scary for the community'' or that might
``unduly pressure another district entity,'' Rohman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and school board members discussed
the findings during a private session Tuesday morning. Although a
district spokesman declined to comment, board member Victoria
Castro said she feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reports are devastating to me personally. I depended on
staff for many of my decisions,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that the Los Angeles Daily News had reviewed the
confidential document, the district released the tome at 6 p.m. but
did not provide copies. The board has scheduled a special public
meeting for Thursday to present the findings. Rohman also declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The school board ordered the investigation into the
Environmental Health and Safety Branch in July 1998 after firing
the division's director for what it called poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, Hamid Arabzadeh made approximately 40
allegations about environmental safety issues. The probe found
evidence to support many of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the report chronicles allegations leveled by current
and former staff members in the Environmental Health and Safety
Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found serious flaws in how EHSB functioned that affected
its ability to ensure that schools were safe,'' the report said.
``Primarily, these flaws were the result of an organizational
culture that pressured EHSB staff and managers to underreport
environmental and safety hazards, a practice directly at odds with
EHSB's stated mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Susie Wong, director of the Environmental Health and Safety
Branch from 1989 through 1996, said oversight problems arose as the
safety branch began to expand its duties and staffing between 1982
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The district's efforts to build schools and the lack of clean
sites in the city was the central issue in intradepartmental
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of turf wars going on with us and (the) real
estate (branch).'' Wong said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while for all that to get worked out.''

PATIENT DIES WHILE UNDERGOING GENE THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A patient has died while undergoing gene therapy in a trial
study at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment itself should prove to be the cause of his
death it could be a severe setback for gene therapy, an
experimental technique whose fulfillment has long fallen short of
its high promise.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year old from Arizona, died
on Sept. 17 shortly after receiving a dose of viruses carrying a
corrective gene.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger, who suffered from a deficiency of ornithine
transcarbamylase, a genetic defect that prevents the correct
metabolism of ammonia, was part of a group of 18 patients who were
being tested with different doses of the therapy. He and another
patient, who was unaffected, received the highest dose being given
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voluntarily halted the trial after Jesse's death,'' said
Rebecca Harmon, a spokesperson for the University of Pennsylvania.
``We' re all devastated by this. Jesse truly was a hero in
advancing the cause of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death was first reported in Wednesday's editions of
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Raper, the principal scientist in charge of the trial,
said that the timing of the treatment and Gelsinger's death
suggested a possible relationship but that the cause had not yet
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Adenovirus, the virus used in the study, is a cause of the
common cold and usually causes only a mild fever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 230 clinical trials of genetic engineering techniques
are now in progress, but most are at a preliminary stage and none
has yet led to an approved therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are both the hope and despair of genetic engineers.
Viruses can focus in on specific kinds of cells, penetrate their
membranes and insert their genes in working order into the cell's
DNA. Most approaches to gene therapy use viruses as the vehicle to
convey genes to target cells. The virus' harmful genes are stripped
out and a therapeutic gene inserted in their place.  &QL;

LINE STARTS FORMING HOURS BEFORE KRISPY KREME OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Welcome to Krispy Kreme. We are now serving our
hot glazed doughnuts. How may I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, a few political proclamations and music from
The Profit and Loss Dixieland Band, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts opened
the doors and drive-through Tuesday of its second store in Southern
California and first in the San Fernando Valley. Hundreds of hungry
commuters had been waiting up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   David Daniel, a 31-year-old coordinating producer with the
Turner Entertainment Report, arrived at 3:45 a.m. Daniel, a
resident of suburban Encino, said he wanted to be first in line for
the opening at 6 a.m. because he thinks Krispy Kremes are the best
doughnuts in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Georgia for eight years and got hooked on them
there,'' said Daniel. ``This is the first time they are going on
sale in Los Angeles, the greatest city in the world, and I figured
why not be the first one to purchase the best doughnuts here.''
</P>
<P>
   He was outdone, however, by Jim Wallace, 73, of the community of
Van Nuys, who walked through the front door moments before the
store was to open and bought the first Krispy Kreme Original Glaze
doughnut for 70 cents. Wallace described the doughnut as ``out of
this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Store manager Dave Woodard asked the retired driver from
Rockwell Industries to sign the dollar bill he used to pay for the
doughnut. The bill will be framed and hung on the wall behind the
counter. For his efforts, Daniel was the second customer and spent
$21.21 for four dozen Original Glazed doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis King, who brought along Gail Foster, drove from suburban
Simi Valley to Van Nuys for 11 dozen. She said she used to drive to
the other Southland location in La Habra occasionally to satisfy
her craving for the doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fanaticism was definitely the flavor of the day, sprinkled with
nostalgia. Hundreds of people waited an hour or more after the
store opened to place their orders. Scores of media representatives
recorded every passing doughnut hole. A helicopter pilot was cited
for illegally landing his aircraft near the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commander'' Chuck Street, a well-known radio helicopter pilot
working as an independent contractor for KIIS-FM radio, was cited
by the Los Angeles Fire Department for landing on private property
to cover the opening of the doughnut shop, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Humphrey, a fire department spokesman, said Street
violated a city ordinance that requires pilots to get a permit to
land from the department so it can ensure adequate resources for
crowd control and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street was very kind and complimentary and said he didn't
realize Van Nuys is part of Los Angeles,'' Humphrey said. ``There
was never a safety issue. He simply forgot to notify the fire
department of his expected landing.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. City Councilman Joel Wachs, whose 2nd District includes Van
Nuys, appeared at the opening celebration and, on behalf of the
City Council, proclaimed Tuesday as Krispy Kreme Day in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago someone became president by offering a chicken in
every pot. So I can run for mayor on a Krispy Kreme in every
kitchen,'' joked Wachs, a previous and possibly future mayoral
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Glickman, president of Great Circle Family Foods, the
exclusive Southern California franchisee of Krispy Kreme, said he
has very high hopes for the company's new Van Nuys store, which he
expected to sell 50,000 doughnuts by the end of the first day _
about 46 doughnuts per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts opened its first Southern California
store in La Habra in January, and in nine months the store has sold
more than 10 million doughnuts, an average of 44,000 per day,
Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to Krispy Kreme in Southern California has been
great. We are producing as many doughnuts as we can and are selling
out of them every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said two more stores _ one at the Block at Orange
Shopping Center in the city of Orange and one just outside the
Ontario Mills Mall at Ontario _ will be opened this year, and the
company is considering more shops around Los Angeles County,
possibly in the West Valley and in Burbank.

DODGERS SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT AN O'MALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now that they've disposed of Bob Graziano, the
Dodgers ought to woo an O'Malley to succeed him. That's right. One
of Peter O'Malley's children.
</P>
<P>
   Not THAT Peter O'Malley. The last thing the Dodgers need is the
same old blood that circulated in the organization for decades.
We're thinking more along the lines of a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   We're thinking of Susan O'Malley, the president of the
organization that runs the Washington Wizards and Capitals and the
middle of five children of the onetime president of the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The old boys' network hasn't exactly been a rousing success for
the Fox ownership group. So why not let O'Malley into the club?
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers want someone with experience operating a sports
team, O'Malley is doubly qualified. If the organization is looking
for someone who can schmooze Corporate America, O'Malley can do
that.
</P>
<P>
   She has spent the past few years cinching corporate sponsors,
securing marketing deals and selling luxury suites for the MCI
Center, a two-year-old, state-of-the-art facility that houses both
the NBA's Wizards and the NHL's Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, 38, has the experience and expertise to do what
Graziano could not. She can return the Dodgers to their rightful
place as the most progressive and innovative organization in
sports. Rick Welts, the president of the Fox Entertainment Group,
suggested ownership will settle for no less.
</P>
<P>
   Welts also said there are ``no age or gender requirements'' for
Graziano's successor. Good.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a sports person and a business person the Dodgers want,
O'Malley's their person.
</P>
<P>
   She relayed word Tuesday through a spokesman that she had not
been contacted about the job. Let's hope Welts was simply going in
alphabetical order and hadn't gotten past the L's (well, he did say
he spoke Tuesday morning to Dodgers executive Tommy Lasorda, who
professed no interest in Graziano's job).
</P>
<P>
   Because if the Dodgers want their next president to unearth
additional revenue streams in Chavez Ravine, the better to keep
Dodger Stadium competitive with all the state-of-the-art stadiums
springing up like mushrooms after a rain, O'Malley can do that.
</P>
<P>
   She could take that $40 million in scheduled improvements to
Dodger Stadium and turn it into a mint. With her marketing savvy,
the Dodgers would be competitive from a revenue standpoint. And
pennant races notwithstanding, isn't that really the bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   Abe Pollin, the chairman of the Washington Sports and
Entertainment Group, has said O'Malley ``did a terrific job of
revitalizing the organization from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been described as an excellent motivator and adept spin
artist, conjuring an image of Lasorda in nylons and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley cares what the consumers think. She has been known to
call season-ticket holders at random to solicit their feedback.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers want their next president to rededicate the
Dodgers to community service, O'Malley can do that, too. She's so
persuasive, she'd have Raul Mondesi reading to first-graders in
Boyle Heights and Kevin Brown delivering Thanksgiving turkeys to
families in South Central L.A.
</P>
<P>
   And she'd practice what she preaches. O'Malley is in the
business of making money, but she's no mere mercenary. Her future
plans include starting her own charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If it's innovation the Dodgers desire, O'Malley can provide
that. There's a reason ``Advertising Age'' has listed her among the
top 100 marketers. She is creative and calculating and in today's
clime, there's no better combination.
</P>
<P>
   When Welts said, ``Bob has a different set of experience than
what I think we need, what I want,'' he meant Graziano was first
and foremost a CPA.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley is a saleswoman at heart who has grown up in the sports
arena. She is one of the most senior-ranking women in professional
sports. If she isn't on Welts' short list of candidates to succeed
Graziano, it is simply not long enough.  &QL;

PARENTS, TEACHERS UNION SAY LIVES ARE IN DANGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Students, parents and the teachers union reacted
with outrage Tuesday to a new report that accuses Los Angeles
Unified School District of concealing and minimizing environmental
hazards at schools, including several in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played politics with the health and safety of students
and teachers. To me, that's a criminal act,'' said Day Higuchi,
president of United Teachers Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi said he wants to know which teachers worked at the
schools during the periods of time described in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any one of them develops cancer, No. 1, there's a humongous
lawsuit and, more than that, you're playing with people's lives,''
said Higuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental safety reports were downplayed or problems were
underreported during a 10-year span at schools including Portola
Middle School in suburban Tarzana and Van Nuys Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   At Portola, maintenance workers might not have been informed of
the presence of asbestos, the report said. At Van Nuys Middle
School, district health and safety officials are accused of
underreporting the amount of asbestos present in the air on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Parents whose children attend those schools were outraged by the
report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those actions are completely unethical and criminal,'' said
Stephanie Carter, a leading proponent of district breakup and
parent of a former Portola Middle School student.
</P>
<P>
   ``To endanger the lives of children is wrong and to knowingly do
it to protect your job and to protect any kind of political agenda
is completely unethical,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Valdivieso, whose son attends sixth grade at Van Nuys
Middle School, said she was disturbed by the report's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That alarms me,'' Valdivieso said. ``I wouldn't have my kid
here if there's a danger of asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Valdivieso, 11, said he doesn't feel safe at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something wrong, they should correct it at once,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tosca Broadous, who was waiting in her car outside Van Nuys
Middle School to pick up her sister, a teacher, called for the
district to answer the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be honest about what they're doing and not put
anybody's health in jeopardy,'' Broadous said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Delgado, principal of Van Nuys Middle School, said his
campus is safe even though an unusually high level of asbestos
prompted the evacuation of the library and administration building
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the entire school has been made safe and
construction workers are replacing all the school's floor tiles,
considered to be the source of the carcinogen-causing material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident that the school is safe,'' said Delgado,
who sent letters home to parents and held an information meeting at
the time of the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lawler, principal of Portola Middle School, said his
campus is safe but that he does not recall the incident cited by
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be absolutely stunned if it happened while I was here
for the past three years,'' Lawler said. ``It's hard to believe
that work got done without informing (workers) of the presence of
asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Dixon-Davis, a community activist whose son attends ninth
grade at Chatsworth High School, said the report reveals systemic
flaws in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   She said district employees who want to reveal wrongdoing are
reluctant to do so for fear of reprisal by the school board or
their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cover up,'' Dixon-Davis said. ``It's a bureaucracy and
there needs to be a way to break this open.''

BOTTOM LINE: SWANSON MOVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The trouble with Brennen Swanson? He's too
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, Cal State Northridge's standout linebacker who had 15{
sacks last year, hasn't had the same success pressuring the
quarterback through three games, with only a half-sack.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, a senior who is a half-sack away from tying the
school's career record of 20, hasn't had as many opportunities for
sacks because he's athletic enough to go into coverage.
</P>
<P>
   With just five sacks as a team, CSUN's defensive coaches are
making an adjustment for Saturday's Big Sky Conference game against
Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put (Swanson) on the line a little more,''
defensive line coach David Robinson said. ``We're going to keep him
inside, to rush the passer.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to put Swanson back at the end of the line as a
pass-rushing specialist on a defense that has allowed 119 points
and 1,255 yards in its last two games, both losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put me at defensive end,'' he said, ``and that's the only
thing I need to do: get sacks.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Sophomore safety Hassan Adbul-Malik (pulled
hamstring) was in full pads but probably won't play until the
Montana game on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center Julio Alcala (back) didn't practice. ``He's got a
back that's chronically tender,'' Kearin said, ``and I want him for
Saturdays.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Jaumal Bradley has tonsillitis and is doubtful
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Line, a starting defensive lineman, has a strained tendon
in his left knee and might not play this week. Two other defensive
starters, safety Rahman Sparks (ribs) and defensive end Jason Mageo
(ankle), are also doubtful for Idaho State.

REGULATORS OK WESTERN RESOURCES MERGER WITH KANSAS CITY POWER &AMP;
LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS _ Kansas regulators Tuesday approved the merger of
Western Resources Inc. and Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co., but on
terms not quite as attractive as the utilities had once expected.
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources, whose stock price has dropped by more than
half in the last two years, has said it needed an order from the
Kansas Corporation Commission that would not harm the company
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Western wouldn't say Tuesday whether the terms of the order met
that standard. The Topeka, Kan., utility company said it was
considering its options, which include rejecting or accepting the
state's order or asking Kansas regulators in the next 15 days to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the complexity of the issues and the significant
financial implications on our company's future, we are reviewing
all of our options regarding the conditions outlined in today's
order,'' said David Wittig, Western's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory commission had already indicated that it would
not approve the merger with the conditions the KCC staff had
crafted in an agreement with the utilities in May.
</P>
<P>
   The staff agreement would have permitted the merged company to
retain four years of merger-related savings _ about $180 million.
In addition, $300 million of the deal's acquisition premium would
have been paid over several years by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's order would put more pressure on the merged
company to find merger-related savings. And none of the acquisition
premium would be permitted to show up in customer rates.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said they would allow the merged company to
retain all the merger savings in the first four years and an
additional $179 million of savings spread over the next 35 years.
The amount could total $359 million _ in today's dollars _ although
that could go up if there were more savings than expected in the
first four years.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas ratepayers would not receive the $45 million in rate
credits that was in the staff agreement. But there would be a rate
freeze for the first four years and then hearings would set new
rates. In theory, because the merged company had cut costs, that
should result in lower electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable and appropriate for these savings to be
shared between ratepayers and the shareholders,'' the commissioners
said in their order.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the critics of the May staff agreement said Tuesday's
order, while not perfect, was a better balance of interests of the
utilities and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fault the commission for their efforts at balance,''
said Walker Hendrix, counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer
Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the big battle would come four years down the road when new
rates would be set, which would be when consumers would see any of
the promised savings.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Peterson, an area attorney representing several Johnson
County cities in the merger hearings, said the commission's order
would give the merged company more than he would have preferred.
However, a major issue with his clients was their opposition to the
acquisition premium in rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say we would probably not be on the forefront
of an appeal,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Zakoura, an attorney representing several industrial
customers in the hearings, said he too saw the commission's order
as a mixed bag. He would have preferred less of the savings going
to the merged company after the rate freeze but said the order was
a big improvement in not allowing the acquisition premium to show
up in rates.
</P>
<P>
   His clients haven't decided whether to ask the commission to
reconsider some of the order's provisions, Zakoura said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the commission balancing between the company and
ratepayers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So now the regulatory approvals are in hand or a decision is
near. Missouri and Kansas have given their OKs. Federal regulators
still have to vote, although their staff has an agreement with
Western and KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators were once considered the chief obstacles to getting
the deal completed. But Western's low stock price is now an issue,
as well. Shortly before a deal would close, either utility can walk
away if Western's stock is at or below $29.78 a share. It closed
Tuesday at $20.81.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger closed at that stock price, KCP&AMP;L shareholders
would get about $8 a share less than originally expected, when
Western's stock was in the $40s.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman Pam Levetzow said the utility was reviewing
the Kansas order and what effect, if any, it has on the merger. As
for what KCP&AMP;L would do if Western's stock doesn't recover: ``We
aren't prepared to talk about that yet,'' she said.

JURY AWARDS $120 MILLION TO WOMAN INJURED AT RAIL CROSSING

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Jackson County jury on Tuesday decided that
the nation's largest railroad company should pay $120 million in
punitive damages to a Sedalia, Mo., woman severely injured in a
1997 train crossing accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they wanted to force Union Pacific Railroad Co. and
other railroads to pay to upgrade crossing signals.
</P>
<P>
   The punitive award is on top of the $40.4 million in actual
damages awarded a day earlier to plaintiff Kimberly Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Vicky Willers of Independence said Tuesday that railroads
must pay for the signal improvements, rather than wait for
government agencies to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their railroads; it's their tracks _ they're
responsible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyers hammered Union Pacific in the trial for not
having paid to quickly install lights and gates on a crossing just
south of U.S. 50 and east of Warrensburg, Mo. The railroad knew
that the crossing on a gravel county road was dangerous, they
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months before Alcorn was injured in August 1997, state
officials had told the railroad that the view at the crossing was
90 percent blocked by brush and terrain. The company and state
officials started the long process to get a government subsidy to
pay Union Pacific about $200,000 to install lights and gates.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, four months before Alcorn's accident, an Amtrak
train struck a truck at that intersection, killing a 22-year-old
man. The railroad still did nothing, contending that such crossing
upgrades were the state's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 29, 1997, an Amtrak train going 65-70 mph struck the car
in which Alcorn was riding. She suffered brain damage, more than 20
broken bones and other injuries. One of her two teenage daughters
testified at trial that their mother no longer took care of them,
but that they took care of her.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Amtrak at fault for 25 percent of the $40.4
million in actual damages but not liable for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Union Pacific lawyer Ted Williams told jurors that
his company had properly been working with the state to upgrade the
crossing signal. Such upgrades are a state responsibility, he said,
and railroads pay to maintain them after they are installed.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific nationwide pays $26 million a year to maintain
crossings and $14 million a year for safety training programs such
as Operation Lifesaver, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a company that doesn't care about crossing
safety,'' he said, and he asked jurors to assess no punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyer Grant L. Davis told jurors Tuesday that Union
Pacific had a net worth of $6.9 billion, but not even one employee
to study whether crossings needed to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   They do pay for crossing-signal upgrades in certain situations,
Davis noted: ``They do it when there's something in it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew the crossing where Alcorn was injured was deadly, but
they did not think that was their problem, and they don't like to
pay to maintain upgraded crossings, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   All railroads stopped paying for upgrades after federal and
state subsidies for them were introduced in 1973, Davis told
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   He summarized the railroad's attitude since: ``It's not our
deal; it's not our duty; we don't have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell them otherwise, Davis asked jurors, and he requested a
punitive damage award of up to $689 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, several jurors told Davis in unison that
something has to be done about the railroads before others are
maimed or killed in crossing accidents. ``Today!'' one juror
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, a Union Pacific spokesman, declined to comment on
the verdict.

ACLU QUESTIONS DEPICTION OF MOSES, BURNING BUSH ON KU SEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First it was the fish on the city seal in
Republic. Now it's Moses and the burning bush on the University of
Kansas seal.
</P>
<P>
   Republic stopped using the fish symbol this summer after the
American Civil Liberties Union argued that it was the equivalent of
a municipal endorsement of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ACLU's KU chapter in Lawrence, Kan., is questioning
Chancellor Robert Hemenway about the university's seal.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter this month, the ACLU said the depiction of Moses and
an accompanying Bible inscription might violate the Constitution's
``strict wall of separation between church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemenway responded Monday, saying the seal generally was
interpreted as representing a scholar's quest for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view the seal of the university as one of its valuable
assets, one that has served the university well for over 120
years,'' Hemenway wrote in a letter. ``I will not hesitate to
defend fully the continued use of the seal.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU is not threatening to sue at this time, said Dick
Kurtenbach, the group's executive director for Kansas and western
Missouri. The KU case, however, is similar to the Republic case in
some ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle is certainly the same: whether or not a
governmental entity can _ and to what extent _ endorse a particular
religious belief. That was clearly the issue in Republic, and
that's what this issue with the university is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fish has been a symbol of Christianity since the time of
ancient Rome. City officials in Republic, in southwest Missouri,
argued that the fish was intended only to send a message of moral
values and to promote ``a universal symbol of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Springfield ruled in July that the portrayal
of the fish ``impermissibly excludes other religious beliefs or
nonbeliefs and _ intended to or not _ depicts Christianity as the
religion recognized and endorsed by the residents of Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about KU's seal came up recently, Kevin Sivits,
president of the ACLU's KU chapter, said Tuesday. Someone called
the chapter to ask about the seal, and an ACLU attorney was asked
about it on a radio program.
</P>
<P>
   As word has spread, the KU chapter has received almost a dozen
calls from students who say the seal offends them, said Sivits, a
KU senior.
</P>
<P>
   Hemenway's letter said there was no ``definitive information
about who designed the seal or what the intent of the designer was
in choosing the depiction of the seal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latin inscription that surrounds the seal translates to ``I
will see this great sight _ why the bush is not consumed,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   A KU spokesman said fire symbolized knowledge in many stories
over the years. Moses is thought to represent the humble attitude
of the scholar who recognizes the unquenchable nature of the
pursuit of knowledge, spokesman Todd Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   University departments and staff may use the seal on their
letterhead and business cards, Cohen said. It is also used on
diplomas and other official documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seal has been around longer than the Jayhawk, and it's
pretty deeply ingrained in the university's culture,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sivits said he did not know what the seal meant before his
chapter began looking at it. A lot of people probably do not know
what it means, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that ``just because it's obscure doesn't mean
it's all right.''

NORTH TEXAS STAR KICKOFF RETURNER STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Even when North Texas was 3-8 last season, the
Eagles' kickoff return capabilities were enough to concern any
opposing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the return of Broderick McGrew, however, that threat
hasn't continued. McGrew, the nation's leading kickoff returner
last year with an average of 32.6 yards per return, is averaging
17.7 yards on nine returns this season.
</P>
<P>
   UNT's opponents have used a variety of tactics to negate his
impact. Some have kicked away from him, either at freshman Aaron
Holly or short. LSU kicked it as deep as possible, forcing McGrew
to field the ball more than five yards into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one area that needs to come on,'' UNT coach Darrell
Dickey said. ``All the other teams know about Broderick McGrew from
last year, and they are spending more time containing him and
working on keeping us from breaking a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrew's longest return this year is 35 yards. Last year he had
a 100-yarder, a 64-yarder and a 46-yarder. As a team, UNT is
averaging 13.9 yards per return, next to last in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good returns,'' Dickey said. ``We just need to
provide a little bit better field position for that \Roffensive\S
unit.'' Briefly The UNT volleyball team remains winless in Big West
Conference play. The Eagles, 4-10, dropped their 23rd and 24th
consecutive conference matches last week despite winning the first
two games of Thursday's contest against Boise State. ``The Boise
match was by far the best match we've had all season,'' UNT coach
Donna Martin said. ``Inexperience maybe created some doubts or
questions as to whether we could win that match.'' UNT's last
conference victory came in 1997 when it knocked off Cal State
Fullerton in five games. Tennis coach Dan Traxler has no problem
setting an early standard for his team. ``I guarantee this will be
the best year we've had since I've been here,'' said Traxler, who
is in his third season. If that's the case, UNT will have to
overcome quite a bit of inexperience. The Eagles open their season
Friday and Saturday as the host of the UNT Invitational. UNT has
seven newcomers, including 15-year old Siayareh Rambally, a
freshman who graduated from Allen High School three years early.

JINGOISM? YOU BET. NOW, GET OVER IT.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On behalf of the ``United Slobs of America,'' as London's
``Daily Mirror'' so smugly named us Monday, let me say this to our
media cousins across the big pond:
</P>
<P>
   Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup is over. Your lads gagged and lost. Rent ``Happy
Gilmore'' for the night, take two aspirin and send your wrinkled
kilts to the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   But by all means, get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Though sometimes best played on a Sunday morning, golf is not
church. Decorum standards are relative. One man's royal and ancient
traditions are another man's Phoenix Open. If jingoism and
flag-waving are so disdainful, why pair off into teams in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, listen to Tuesday's whining:
</P>
<P>
   ``America won back the Ryder Cup,'' wrote the ``London
Express'', ``and the ugliest galleries in all of sport went home
feasting on their restated superiority over guys with funny names
and funny accents.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the same newspaper: ``History will show that the
USA won the 33rd Ryder Cup but lost the esteem of the rest of the
golfing world ... Some of the dreadful scenes that occurred in this
genteel Boston suburb dragged the Royal and Ancient game into the
gutter ... Listening to their grudging apologies later was to
realize that largely they are a crass and classless bunch intent on
winning at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep. We're awful, aren't we?
</P>
<P>
   We like to win. At times, we are even passionate about it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing we Yanks are so fervent and emotional
about things, or you blokes across the pond might today be speaking
Russian or German.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving after a hasty retreat via the Concorde, European
captain Mark James stiffly predicted, ``A lot of players will not
be bothered competing in America again. Certainly that is the case
with me. It's not something I would look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. But I have a feeling that the Ryder Cup is going to go
on without him.
</P>
<P>
   That was sport at its rawest and best over the weekend. It
happened to be golf. It could have been a foot race, or a tennis
match, or two sides pitted in an afternoon of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest that we Americans know all about boorish behavior
at athletic events. We didn't invent it. Teams from the United
States have been putting up with louts and jingoistic crowds at
Davis Cup matches and Olympic Games for years. One of the worst
arenas is the Pan American Games, where the issue usually boils
down to Uncle Sam against Everyone Else.
</P>
<P>
   We deal with it. We try not to whine. We move on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup was ripe for Monty-baiting and flag-waving long
before it reached Brookline, Mass. We love challenges, and the way
the Ryder teams are stacked makes for an ever-intriguing test of
gamesmanship, as far as the Americans are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   To U.S. fans, reared on the NFL and the NBA, the Ryder format
accomplishes something that the PGA Tour annually fails to deliver.
It puts a human face on golf.
</P>
<P>
   That face may have looked ghastly to stunned Euro-journalists,
as they watched their home side's gaping lead crumble Sunday. But
there was fist-shaking and impromptu celebrating taking place from
both sides throughout the weekend _ and, dare I say it, as far back
as the previous four Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating anarchy here. The ``kid'' who allegedly spit
in James' wife Jane's face should have been escorted off the
Brookline premises. And future Ryder venues should think about
placing a limit on the amount of alcohol that's sold (With Michelob
scheduled to be a future sponsor, that may be impossible).
</P>
<P>
   But I find it hard to muster much sympathy for a Colin
Montgomerie, whose petulance plays right into the American
galleries' hands. He is what we call, of course, a ``rabbit-ears,''
and once we know he is listening, we find ourselves vicariously
plugged into the very event. Big mistake, Monty.
</P>
<P>
   If Montgomerie would just ignore the peanut gallery and continue
to radar home those incredible putts, the drunks would wander off
in search of a new target.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and Jose Maria Olazabal became the losing side's
tragic heroes of the Ryder Cup. And a lot of Euro-journalists,
faced with the prospect of chronicling their side's historic
collapse, chose instead to cop out and focus on the Americans'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. You cheated your readers.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, your place. Eh, comrade? nn

COWBOYS' TRAINING-CAMP DECISION EXPECTED NEXT MONTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team will
probably make a decision about the 2000 training camp site some
time next month.
</P>
<P>
   And it will either be Wichita Falls or in the Rio Grande Valley,
where McAllen, Edinburgh and Mission have joined forces to build an
elaborate sports complex with the hopes of luring the Cowboys, and
several major-league baseball teams for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites, polar opposites in the far north and far south parts
of the state, have their advantages and disadvantages. But this
decision will likely come down to which site offers more: more
fans, different fans, more interest, more money.
</P>
<P>
   And the more Jones talks, the more it looks like the Cowboys
will start the next decade like they did the last with a new
training camp home. Jones ended 27 years of training camps in
Thousand Oaks, Calif., when he moved the site to Austin in 1990,
where the Cowboys stayed for eight years before moving to Wichita
Falls after the 1997 camp.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's all contingent on whether Rio Grande Valley
consortium can get a facility built in time, but Jones likes the
prospects of moving to South Texas. The fans there don't get to see
the Cowboys that often and will likely be more rabid about seeing
them, and in turn, spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wichita Falls is closer to Dallas,'' Jones said. ``But on the
other hand, we could go to an area of the state where people don't
come to games as much as people who are closer to the area. That's
one of the things I think training camp should be about. They have
a lot of fans in that area that can create an exciting
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's the other X-factor. The training camp will be
close to the Mexican border, giving the Cowboys access to more
dollars _ excuse me, I mean giving fans in Mexico a chance to see
their beloved Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the exposure to Mexico; I like that,'' Jones said. ``We
could get quite a bit of interest. That's a direction I'm trying to
take the Cowboys, as evidenced by the fact we've very aggressive
about playing games in Mexico. We really do want to take our team
and really address the fact that Vaqueros De Dallas is very much
sensitive to the fan support of our Hispanic base.''
</P>
<P>
   Wichita Falls has great facilities and the support of the
players and coaches. Both are likely cringing at the idea of
traveling so far south, which would make off-day trips home more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   However, 50,000 fans attended training camp in Wichita Falls
this year _ roughly half of what the Cowboys drew in Austin every
year, which means that marketing numbers were down, T-shirt sales
were down and money was down. With more than $137 million in
contracts committed to Troy Aikman and Deion Sanders, maximizing
financial potential is a must. Coryatt gives money back The Cowboys
have finally completed their business with departed linebacker
Quentin Coryatt. The former Texas A&AMP;M star, an off-season
free-agent signee who decided to retire a couple of weeks ago
because of chronic injuries before even playing a game with the
Cowboys, returned the team's $1 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt will count $225,000 on the team's salary cap this
season. However, the Cowboys will get credit for that amount on
next year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about this story is that is was so non-combative.
But Coryatt, who didn't want to be accused of getting paid for not
playing, was very cooperative. A lot of players wouldn't have been.
Of course, it helps when you have a bank account strong enough to
return $1 million. Inspiring cheerleaders Much has been made about
the United States' spectacular Ryder Cup victory. What has not been
talked about locally is the role the Cowboys cheerleader's played
in Sunday's amazing comeback.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting Saturday night, the U.S. team, along with their
families and Texas Governor George Bush, shared inspirational
stories that brought many to tears. Later during that same meeting,
the players were shown taped messages from the Cowboys cheerleaders
and actress Pamela Anderson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the U.S. team made history.
</P>
<P>
   Jones joked that he will keep that in mind when the Cowboys get
into a tight situation. Cardinals have long way to go Regardless of
whether the Cardinals beat the Cowboys on Sunday _ and that looks
unlikely _ they still have a long way to go in their drive to
become an elite team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Any momentum the Cardinals gained in last season's playoff
victory over the Cowboys was fumbled away with three holdouts: Rob
Moore, Mark Smith and L.J. Shelton. And though the players are all
aboard now, not having everybody pulling in the same direction at
the start of training camp could prove to be a setback this young
team might not get over.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody surprised they are 1-2 and showing no evidence of
improvement from a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   Yardsticks First down During the 1990s, the Cowboys have an 8-2
record in games following a bye week. That mark includes seven
consecutive victories and a 5-0 mark at home. East streak The
Cowboys have won nine consecutive regular-season games against NFC
East teams dating to last season. The record for consecutive NFC
East victories is 14, set by the Cowboys in 1993 and 1994. Third
and short Looking for a key to the Cowboys' success this year? The
stats say credit the run, not the highly publicized passing game.
The Cowboys rank first in the league in rushing but only 12th in
passing after two games.

THREE CHARGED IN DEATH OF MISSOURI TEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 16-year-old Northland boy begged for his
life before he was stabbed to death by an acquaintance Saturday
night as three teen-agers stood nearby, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Weber was killed because some in a loose-knit group of
friends in a Kansas City, North, neighborhood believed he was going
to tell authorities about a planned armed robbery of a grocery,
said Clay County Sheriff Bob Boydston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, a fistfight would have broken out over
something like this,'' Boydston said. ``Now, they think about
planning a murder. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Three adults, all former Winnetonka High School students, were
arraigned on murder charges Tuesday in Clay County Circuit Court.
Pleas of not guilty were entered for all three, who were being held
in the Clay County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   - James W. Boyd III, 19, of 4605 N.E. Chouteau Drive, is accused
of repeatedly stabbing Weber in the torso with a knife, according
to a probable-cause statement.
</P>
<P>
   - Brett L. Johnson, 18, is accused of conspiring to murder Weber
and helping to lure him into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   - Lindsay Harper, 19, is accused of conspiring to lure Weber
into the woods. Harper is a student at Central Missouri State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County Prosecutor Don Norris said Tuesday that he would
seek the death penalty for those convicted of the killing. Norris
said he planned to ask a grand jury today to return capital murder
charges. He also will seek to have a 16-year-old boy certified to
stand trial as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   A Clay County deputy spotted Weber and three of the suspected
attackers together at 5 p.m. Saturday in a traffic stop, Boydston
said. The sheriff said the killing probably occurred shortly
afterward, sometime before sunset, on an isolated hilltop in a
wooded area east of Northeast 36th Street and North Brighton
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was planned several days before it occurred,''
Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   Weber's body was found Monday. A witness was shown the body
Sunday by one of the men charged and later led authorities to the
scene, Boydston said.
</P>
<P>
   Weber's family could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boydston said Boyd had planned to rob a grocery. For a reason
unknown to authorities, he believed Weber planned to tell
authorities about the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd answered questions quietly in the arraignment. He told the
judge he was unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's lawyer, Sean O'Brien, said his client was a normal kid
who once swam for a church swim team.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien recently helped reduce death-penalty convictions to life
in prison for Faye Copeland, believed to have been the nation's
oldest woman to sit on death row, and for Missouri's youngest
death-row defendant, Heath Wilkins, who was sentenced to die at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim told the police he didn't do it,'' O'Brien said. ``As far
as I can tell, he's got two people pointing the finger at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told authorities he was to distract another witness so
she would not see the murder. He told police he tripped over
Weber's legs as the group left the scene and that he watched Boyd
throw the knife used in the murder into a lake. Norris said the
knife had not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said he was unemployed. His bond was set at $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Harper told police she was with the group in the woods when
Johnson pulled her aside to look at the scenery. She told police
she heard Weber scream, ``Jim don't do that, please don't do that,
I will do anything,'' according to court records. Johnson then told
her, ``You know Jimmy is not leaving the woods,'' she told police.
Harper told authorities she heard Weber take his final breath as
they walked from the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a victim in this thing,'' said her attorney,
Bill Quitmeier of Parkville. ``She wasn't part of the planning and
didn't know it was going on until it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper was frightened and feared for her life, Quitmeier said.
She was present because she was friends with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel she's innocent,'' he said. ``She's a tender-hearted
kid and would not be part of it. She's cooperated totally with the
police. I counsel people to be careful about the company they
keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper was a member of Winnetonka's 1997 volleyball team and a
member of the choir in 1998, according to the school's yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Her bond is set at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   - The 16-year-old boy, who is over 6 feet tall and the biggest
of the defendants, stood behind Weber so he could not escape when
the attack started, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said the youth was in juvenile custody. A hearing to have
the boy certified to stand trial as an adult is Oct. 28, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weber was in a car with Boyd when a deputy stopped them on
Saturday because he suspected they might be drag racing, Boydston
said. No citations were issued. Johnson and the juvenile walked
from a house to the car, and they drove off together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a loosely knit group that ran together,'' he said.
``The roots of their association are in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   No gang activity or drug activity was involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of all of three charged expressed shock over the case,
saying the defendants appeared to be nice, normal teens.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Harbin of Kansas City, North, said her 17-year-old son
used to ``hang out'' with Boyd, Johnson and the juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Harbin described Johnson as shy and ``happy-go-lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbin, however, said Boyd was ``a creepy kid'' who had books on
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Boydston said Weber's body might not have been found in such a
remote location had the witness not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   The witness contacted his attorney, who contacted the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did a very brave thing,'' Boydston said about the
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd asked the witness to help bury the body and led him to the
site, the sheriff said. Boyd also told the witness that they had
been planning to kill Weber for a month, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted to bury the body but failed because of rocky
ground, Boydston said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd told the witness he intended to cut the body up for
disposal, according to court records. Two other witnesses told
authorities they were present when Boyd and Johnson conspired to
kill Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little surprised by the viciousness of it,'' Norris
said.

TRIPLE-OVERTIME LOSS TO TAR HEELS IN '57 IS ONE THAT GOT AWAY FOR
KU
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With less than a minute to play in the 1957 NCAA men's
basketball championship, Kansas led North Carolina by five points.
Game over, right?
</P>
<P>
   Sure ... three overtimes later.
</P>
<P>
   On that evening of March 23 in Kansas City's Municipal
Auditorium, the two teams, battled in one of the longest, and
closest, basketball games in NCAA history. Despite sophomore Wilt
Chamberlain's 23 points and 14 rebounds, the Jayhawks lost to the
Tar Heels, 54-53.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any game I ever played with Wilt, he was dominating,''
former Kansas co-captain John Parker said. ``They did like anyone
else and they sagged all over him, and the officials didn't call
all the fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive three-overtime game the undefeated
Tar Heels had played, and it took a minor miracle for them to force
one overtime, let alone three, against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after all these years that's a hard game to forget
because we really should have won,'' Parker said. ``We never
thought we were going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   UNC managed to rally from the five-point deficit in the final
minute to force a 46-all tie. The teams scored two points apiece in
the first and second overtimes combined, setting the stage for a
frantic final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas led, 53-52, with six seconds remaining, when the
Jayhawks' Maurice King was whistled for a foul on Joe Quigg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never saw King foul anybody, and if they had ESPN then I
bet we would have seen that play 100 times on TV that night because
he never fouled him,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Quigg sank both free throws and then blocked the
ensuing pass-in attempt to Chamberlain to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Chamberlain was named the tournament's Most
Outstanding Player, prompting an altercation between him and UNC's
Pete Brennan. That galvanized a heated exchange between KU coach
Dick Harp and Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire. But things did calm
down, and the KU players managed to keep their compusure during the
awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got into the locker room after that we all started to
cry and let our emotions flow,'' Parker said. ``You don't get very
many chances to win a national championship, and we had just lost
one.'' Tomorrow: Don Budge wins first Grand Slam in 1938

CITY COUNCIL DELAYS LANDFILL VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the face of vehement opposition from more than
75 residents _ fearful of hazardous waste, groundwater
contamination and dust storms _ the Los Angeles City Council put
off a decision Tuesday on allowing the revival of the Sunshine
Canyon landfill in suburban Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, residents complained about the history of
the landfill, closed a decade ago, and said they feared the
proposal to reopen it could allow it to become the nation's largest
dump - unfairly burdening them with trash from the fast-growing
northern region of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have destroyed the heart of the canyon, and they want you
to believe they want to preserve the area,'' said Esther Simmons, a
member of the North Valley Coalition fighting the reopening of the
394-acre landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more pollution, more dust and contaminating the
drinking water, and more sickness among children and the elderly.
All in all, it's a bad deal for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills residents also got support from people who live
near the Lopez Canyon landfill, like Phyllis Hines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely unfair for the people who surround that
landfill to have to live with this. Use some common sense and give
these people a break,'' she implored council members during the
public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Council members delayed a final decision until Oct. 26 after
staff members testified they were still working with city agencies
and Browning Ferris Industries over mitigation proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed reopening of the landfill on city property would
allow it to eventually take in 55 million tons of trash over 26
years. Opponents said that could make it the largest - in size and
volume - in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   BFI, which has lobbied heavily for the reopening, remained
confident an agreement would be worked out with the city, said
spokesman Arnie Berghoff. He said BFI representatives chose to
await city staff recommendations on the mitigation proposals before
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area and lives south
of the landfill, said current mitigation proposals don't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This landfill should not be opened,'' Bernson said. ``The
mitigations are a sliver of what's needed. What we really should be
doing is looking at new ways to get rid of our trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is ancient. We're just burying our trash. We
should be looking at ways to develop modern technology to turn this
trash into energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents also criticized the mitigation measures proposed by
Councilman Mike Feuer as failing to address the immediate community
and falling far short.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer proposed having landfill operator BFI provide closed air
conditioning at Van Gogh Elementary School. He also proposed BFI
pay a franchise fee that would generate up to $5 million a year to
be split several ways: community improvements; retrofitting city
and private trucks from diesel to cleaner-burning fuel; and a
portion to the city general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we're concerned about the diesel trucks, but that's far
from the major issue,'' said Mary Edwards, a member of the North
Valley Coalition that has been fighting the landfill for more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition member Wayde Henry also questioned the way the fee
would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean the whole city will benefit at the expense of
this community? It doesn't seem fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said he had offered the proposals as a way to get some
control over the landfill's operation that were not now included
and that he would oppose its reopening unless his suggestions were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking a lot of the residents of the North Valley, and
we can do a better job than what is on the table so far about
addressing legitimate needs and goals for that community and all of
us in the city of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members indicated they would stand with Bernson
in opposing the landfill's reopening, but he said he didn't believe
he would have the 10 votes needed to overturn the recommendation of
the city Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more support than I thought, but I don't think
there are 10 votes there,'' Bernson said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who voiced support for him were Council members
Feuer, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden and Joel Wachs.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Fine, a former member of the city's Solid Waste Advisory
Board, said the city and county have ignored major factors in
considering the landfill permit and what would happen if a joint
powers authority of the city and county was created, as is
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landfills are not good neighbors,'' Fine said. ``Who benefits
from this? Obviously, BFI does. The city will only be putting 2,000
tons of trash in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this landfill can take in 12,500 tons of trash a day and
can go up to 17,500 tons. The additional expansion is not for the
city. It's for the north county area, the fastest-growing area of
the county. The county is providing for 64,000 more residences in
that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said she believes the city Planning Commission should have
required a full environmental impact report addressing the expected
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill closed in 1991 when the city rejected an expansion
plan and later tried to block access to the county portion of the
facility. In losing a legal challenge, the city was forced to open
up the city portion of the landfill.

RANGERS SHUT OUT MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Johnny Oates' vantage point in the Texas
Rangers' dugout gives him a perfect view of two vitally important
things as the season dwindles down: the out-of-town scoreboard and
the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   The former gave the team's manager no satisfaction Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees both won, allowing
the Rangers no chance to make up ground in the quest for home-field
advantage in the first round of the playoffs. If the postseason
started Wednesday, the club would open in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, though, almost made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero, Mike Morgan, Danny Patterson and Danny Kolb
combined to pitch a five-hit shutout as the Rangers routed the
Seattle Mariners, 10-0, at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire pitching staff did a good job,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied the 1977 team for the most victories in club
history, but the record would be more significant if the Rangers
had picked up ground on the Indians or Yankees. They remain two
games behind Cleveland and one behind New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than 93, but we'd like to win enough to get that
home-field role,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The four pitchers who worked Tuesday night would just like to be
in the playoffs, no matter where the Rangers play their first game.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is expected to carry 11 pitchers into the playoffs.
Starters Aaron Sele, Rick Helling, Esteban Loaiza and John Burkett
have four of those spots, and relievers John Wetteland, Jeff
Zimmerman, Tim Crabtree, Mike Venafro and Mike Munoz are assured of
another five.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Fassero, Morgan, Patterson and Kolb battling for the
final two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who pitches is in competition,'' Oates said.
``Everybody we saw pitch tonight, there's a reason for
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   All four gave Oates reasons to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero made his bid first, and pitched four shutout innings. He
allowed one hit, a single by Mike Blowers in the fourth, but walked
four. The bases on balls contributed to a high pitch count, which
prevented him from working the required five innings for a victory.
He was on a limit of 75-80 pitches and was pulled after throwing 73
through the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty good considering I hadn't thrown much in 13
days,'' said Fassero, who had worked only one-third of an inning
since going five in a start against the Minnesota Twins on Sept.
14. ``I walked guys, but I wasn't all over the place. They were
close pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero did his best work in his final inning. He walked Edgar
Martinez, and Blowers followed with his single. But Fassero struck
out Jay Buhner and David Bell and got Dan Wilson on a fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me is the four walks, but the
bottom line is he put four zeroes up there,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan followed with three shutout innings and was credited with
the victory to improve to 13-8. He allowed three hits, all singles,
and didn't walk anyone. It was his first appearance since a
disastrous outing against Tampa Bay on Sept. 19, when he allowed
five runs on five hits in 11/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson followed with a perfect eighth inning that included
strikeouts of Ken Griffey Jr. and Martinez to run his scoreless
streak to six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb finished off the shutout with a shaky ninth _ he gave up a
hit and a walk _ but an injury might knock him out of contention.
He's pitching despite a stress reaction in his right elbow, and he
said he felt it Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got through it, but there's some tenderness there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Oates saw nothing to separate the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pitch well, it just makes it harder for them to make
the decision,'' Fassero said. nn

TEXAS A&AMP;M OFFENSIVE LINE COULD GO WITH BACKUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Through the years, Texas A&AMP;M football
coach R.C. Slocum has referred to plenty of positions manned by
unproven players as ``question marks'' for the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual punctuation mark never appeared on an A&AMP;M depth
chart until yesterday. Now, it's there for all to see at left
tackle: two question marks, next to the phrase ``to be
determined,'' in the No. 2 spot behind starter Tango McCauley as
the fifth-ranked Aggies (3-0, 0-0) prepare for their Big 12 opener
against Texas Tech (1-2, 0-0).
</P>
<P>
   If McCauley is unable to overcome a sprained ankle that limited
his participation in yesterday's practice, ``to be determined''
will describe A&AMP;M's left tackle situation heading into the 6 p.m.
game Saturday in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   A converted defensive lineman, McCauley moved up to No. 1 after
Shea Holder suffered a season-ending knee injury Saturday in a 23-6
victory against Southern Mississippi. Holder, a fifth-year senior
from Lamar High School, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
right knee and will need reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If McCauley can't play against Tech (he's listed as
questionable), the Aggies will protect the blind side of
quarterback Randy McCown with a redshirt freshman who spent last
week playing a position other than left tackle. That description
could fit either Michael Mahan or Taylor Whitley, who have been
shifted from right tackle and right guard, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Aggies managed only 299 yards against
Southern Mississippi, playing with a reshuffled offensive line is
``a big concern'' to tailback Dante Hall, who managed 23 yards on
16 carries against the Golden Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   J.B. Grimes, the Aggies' offensive line coach, said he is
confident in his backups. But none, including McCauley, have much
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern about Tango is consistency. He has great
ability but he needs to do things right all the time,'' said
Grimes, who considers McCauley, a sophomore, his best available
option at left tackle. ``But it takes time to get those
fundamentals down. And he's only played three games at offensive
line in his life.'' Disregarding the hype Although the Aggies have
been installed as 17-point favorites, Slocum said it would be
unrealistic to expect anything but a tight battle against a Tech
team that will be coming off an open date and playing to silence
the critics of embattled coach Spike Dykes. None of the past five
games in this series have been decided by more than seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a close, tough game. The only people who
will be surprised by that are the ones who have their heads stuck
in the sand or don't realize what college football is all about,''
Slocum said. Hardeman improving Slocum said fullback D'Andre
Hardeman, slowed since the season opener because of an ankle
sprain, is close to 100 percent. Hardeman will be available
Saturday, but Ja'Mar Toombs will be the starter, Slocum said.

TCU WANTS TOMLINSON OVERLOAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU finally racked up a 1999 victory last
weekend, largely through the execution of one obviously simple
plan:
</P>
<P>
   Putting the ball in the hands of LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we didn't do at Northwestern,'' coach Dennis
Franchione said, ``but it will be a priority from now on. We need
to put the ball in his hands 25 times a game ... actually, 25 to 30
`touches,' counting pass receptions. It's been a goal, but we
weren't able to do it two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs gave Tomlinson the ball 40 times against Arkansas
State, and he responded with 269 yards and two touchdowns, sparking
a 24-21 victory and earning Western Athletic Conference Offensive
Player of the Week honors.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson is the WAC's leading rusher and ranks second in the
nation at 177.7 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be an increased `LaDainian Watch' in the
future,'' Franchione said. ``Everyone we play is going to have to
try to stop the tailback. But there may be some things we can do to
make sure they don't stop LaDainian.''
</P>
<P>
   This could mean an increased emphasis on the passing ability of
freshman Casey Printers _ who completed 5 of 10 attempts for 88
yards in his first start _ with Tomlinson on the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the WAC officiating crew assessed the Frogs 135
yards in penalties, Franchione quipped, ``I don't know if this is
the Conference USA factor or what, but LT had at least one 50-yard
run nullified.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Printers' debut, Franchione said, ``He certainly did not
put any limitations on himself _ or us _ with his play. He broadens
us with his ability to throw the ball downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione added, however, that Patrick Batteaux's hand is
healed well enough for him to play against Fresno State on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may use both quarterbacks,'' he said. ``There may be
situations in that game where the talents of one or the other will
be best for us.'' Fuller honored Safety Curtis Fuller has been
named to the American Football Coaches Association Good Works Team,
honoring athletes showing exceptional dedication to community
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging because of some of the players I know
whose names are on the list,'' Fuller said. ``This is a special
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Fuller has been involved in a project with
the Richland Hills Church of Christ that sends young people to
various places in Mexico on building projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing we did was putting a new roof on a
church in a place called Valles, in only seven days. It was 108
degrees at 10 a.m. and 115 by three in the afternoon, when we had
to come down off the roof. But we got it done.''

`TERRIFIC' PRACTICES HAVE STARS COACH HITCHCOCK SMILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Practice once again had Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock smiling yesterday. Now, he's just waiting to see that
energy finally translate into a game. ``Our practices have been
terrific all year,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our problems have been in
games. I don't think our players have pushed at all like they're
going to in the regular season.'' He said he hasn't had to say much
though. Players have started feeling that Friday opener creeping up
and have taken appropriate action. ``We're not doing the only
pushing here,'' Hitchcock said. ``The players are really pushing
each other to get those strong details in.'' Sharing secrets Guy
Carbonneau, Brian Skrudland and Derek Plante gathered in a small
circle as practice wound down yesterday. They took turns practicing
faceoffs and sharing tricks of the trade. ``They've taken hundreds
of thousands of faceoffs,'' Plante said. ``Carbo gave me some tips
and so did Brian. I learned so much.'' Did they give him any ways
to cheat? ``I can't reveal these secrets,'' Plante said. Marshall
doubtful for opener Ken Hitchcock said Stars winger Grant Marshall
(groin) is doubtful for Friday's opener against Pittsburgh.
Marshall went through a full practice Monday but was sore
yesterday. ``There is absolutely no regression, no problems with
it,'' Hitchcock said, ``but he felt the effects of his first full
practice.'' Hitchcock said not only was Marshall's conditioning not
good enough, but he wouldn't be able to play his physical style of
game. ``For the way he has to play for us to be effective, he's got
to have no qualms about his ability to play that physical game.
That takes a lot out of you,'' Hitchcock said. ``To me, he has to
go through a lot more to be ready.'' Language barrier Stars winger
Jamie Langenbrunner says he still can't say hello to his newest
linemate, Pavel Patera. ``Somebody told me the word in Czech,''
Langenbrunner said, ``but I can't say it.'' Patera doesn't speak
English. Langenbrunner and Joe Nieuwendyk don't speak any Czech.
Patera doesn't speak any English, although, he's started taking
lessons. ``If Roman Turek can learn \REnglish\S as quickly as he
did then that's a good thing for Pavel,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
learned that English lessons were one thing, and cartoons were the
second thing. Once Pavel and his family get up to speed watching
cartoons things will work out pretty well.'' Until then,
Langenbrunner said hand motions and smiles will have to do. ``We're
working on it,'' Langenbrunner said. ``Hockey is pretty
universal.'' Inexperienced defensemen Ken Hitchcock said don't be
surprised to sometimes see the Stars' two newest and least
experienced defensemen, Alan Letang and Brad Lukowich, paired. ``I
think it depends on the opposition,'' Hitchcock said. ``If we see a
very physical team, that obviously pulls \RJamie\S Pushor into the
lineup, but if we feel that there is going to be more of a speed
game out there, that will change our thinking.'' Hitchcock said
Letang is one of the best passers on the team and might make the
Stars a better transition team.  &LR; tagtop:Jennifer Floyd, (817)

WETTELAND GENEROUS AFTER REACHING MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ John Wetteland went through his usual routine
after striking out the final batter to preserve the Texas Rangers'
3-2 victory against the Seattle Mariners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He exchanged a hug with catcher Ivan Rodriguez, shook hands with
his teammates and looked for a youngster in the stands to give the
ball to.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did he hear public address announcer Chuck Morgan say
that Wetteland had just converted his Rangers-record 43rd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was a club record while I was trying to hand the
ball to a fan,'' Wetteland said. ``At that point it was too late. I
had already picked her out.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had realized it was a club record, he might have kept the
ball instead of handing it to a young girl. But he didn't really
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cool with that,'' he said. ``I like it that way. That
means I truly was taking it one day at a time like I always say and
just preparing that day as if it were just another day. That's the
beauty of it. She gave me a big hug. It was great.'' RECORD NOT
IMPORTANT
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have 94 victories, one short of setting a club
record. With five games remaining, there's a good chance they will
get it.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, though, is secondary to passing the Cleveland Indians
or New York Yankees and securing home-field advantage for the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of an afterthought,'' first baseman Lee Stevens
said. ``We could set a record for victories and not get home-field
advantage. That wouldn't do us any good.''
</P>
<P>
   The record is important only if it keeps the Rangers home for
the first two games in the divisional round. ALICEA FACING DEADLINE
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea did some light jogging Tuesday but appears no closer
to being ready to play. The reserve infielder has been out since
Sept. 13, when he pulled his right calf muscle during a game in
Kansas City, and time is running out for him to return in time for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he'll be able to play this weekend,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``I think it would be very important he could play some
before Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Alicea will be considered for the postseason roster,
even if he doesn't play, if the club's medical personnel are
convinced he's healed before the Rangers open the playoffs Tuesday
or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if he can play a couple of games, but it's
not imperative,'' Oates said. ZEILE HURT
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile strained a muscle in his right lower
chest wall on a checked swing during his at-bat in the fifth inning
and was unable to play the field in the sixth. He was replaced by
Jon Shave.
</P>
<P>
   The injury raises a red flag because Zeile, who never asks out
of the lineup, said he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here over a year and never said anything negative
about being hurt,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile is listed as day-to-day. NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   _ Rafael Palmeiro tied Juan Gonzalez's club record when he hit
his 47th homer of the year in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ivan Rodriguez's single in the fifth inning was his 194th hit
of the season, breaking a tie for second for the most hits by a
major-league catcher. He was deadlocked with Ted Simmons ('75
Cardinals) and Joe Torre ('64 Braves). He is seven behind Mike
Piazza ('97 Dodgers) for the record. nn

AFTER SUMMER WITH STANLEY CUP, STARS HAVE PLENTY OF MOTIVATION TO
REPEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Strange what you find in the trophy case. For
some it is the Stanley Cup. For Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, it is a
reminder of how to convince his championship team that it is time
to stop dwelling on the magic carpet ride that led to the
franchise's first NHL title last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go anyplace where I don't run into the Stanley Cup,
and I'm to the point where, like \RMonday\S at a golf tournament,
I'm sick of seeing it,'' Hitchcock said. ``I've seen more of the
Cup than I've seen of my wife. I think the players are to the point
where this thing, by it being around so much, might have helped us.
We're all like, `Enough is enough, let's play.' I think that's the
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Stars will be reminded once again of their recent
glory when the championship banner is unfurled and the players are
introduced at Reunion Arena before the season opener against the
Pittsburgh Penguins. When the opening puck finally drops, the Stars
will begin the long, arduous task of defending their NHL title.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Stars can't get on with the business of defending
the title until the memories from last spring are filed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went through an incredible run in May and June and
somehow, we have to let that go and try and get your game at a high
level again,'' said center Joe Nieuwendyk, who was on the 1989
Calgary title team that failed to repeat. ``That's a tough thing to
do because everyone wants to talk about last year. You get more
media attention, television, radio. More fans loiter around at the
rink. That will make it harder. But somehow, we've got to put last
year behind us and go play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, only one NHL team, the Detroit Red Wings, and five
professional sports franchises overall, have repeated as champions.
The Stars, just 2 1/2 months removed from that wild, post-midnight
locker room celebration in Buffalo, will attempt to join the Red
Wings by repeating with a roster that includes seven new players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hitchcock figures the task of repeating this season will be
much more mentally taxing. He said he has already seen the
``pitfalls,'' of a club that is not mentally sharp during the
exhibition games, a club that sometimes is, ``not placing
importance of playing strong every night, blowing off poor
performances, taking for granted good play.''
</P>
<P>
   To counteract that, Hitchcock said he has spoken to team leaders
such as Mike Modano, Sergei Zubov, Mike Keane and Derian Hatcher
and implored them to talk to the younger players about keeping
their focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work hard and get results like we had, you like to
have the flowers,'' center Guy Carbonneau said. ``You like to hear
how good you are, but that can be dangerous because that can lead
to being overconfident. And when you go into a game thinking, `Hey,
we won the Stanley Cup,' that's when other teams, who are giving it
a little bit extra, can get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, to keep his players from looking too far ahead,
Hitchcock had the first team meeting in which he specifically
addressed the club's work schedule for the next several weeks. He
worked down to the smallest detail, such as days off and off-ice
training days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five-game segments keep you focussed on the now,'' winger
Brett Hull said, ``because you can't start thinking about the
Stanley Cup on Oct. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock conceded, however, that the club's focus is ultimately
his job. ``I've got to make sure they enjoy the daily \Rstuff\S,''
he said. ``That's my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And it'll be up to the players to play. Each night, the Stars
expect to get the `A' game from an opponent that would love to say
it knocked off the defending Stanley Cup champions. And each night,
the Stars know they must meet the intensity level of their
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a great start,'' Carbonneau said. ``We've
got to go into every game business-like and make a statement like,
`All right, we won the Stanley Cup last year, but we're not done.'
We need to let that word go around the league, that we're not going
to fold, and that we are going to be hard to beat.''

REDS BEAT FULL HOUSE, LEAD ASTROS IN NL CENTRAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Prepare yourself for the surprise of the 1999 baseball
season. The Cincinnati Reds are leading the National League Central
Division with less than a week to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who finished 77-85 and in fourth place a year ago,
assumed that lofty position with a 4-1 victory over the Houston
Astros in the opener of their two-game series at the Astrodome
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 54,037, a record for an Astros game at the Astrodome,
watched in anger and frustration as the Reds outpitched, outhit and
generally outhustled the two-time defending division champions.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Reds a one-game lead over the Astros with
each team having four games remaining. It's the first time they've
held a one-game lead in the division since July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to start jumping up and down in the streets,''
Reds manager Jack McKeon said. ``We're going to stay the same way
we've been all year, calm, cool and collected. They're the ones
that have to live up to their advanced billing, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have lost seven of 10, but it could be worse. They
could be the free-falling New York Mets, who lost their seventh
consecutive game Tuesday night and remained 1 1/2 games behind the
Astros in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking about the Mets,'' second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``We're focused on the division. As long as we have a
chance to win the division, that's what we're fighting for. When
you see the '97 division title banner hanging out there and the '98
division title banner, it makes you want to hang another one.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't unless they can put the brakes on their own slide as
well as do something to halt the Reds' relentless momentum. The
Reds have won seven of their last eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played good baseball tonight,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``We pitched well, but we didn't play well. At some
point, we've got to start playing better, or we won't be in the
playoffs, and we're running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker admitted the Reds are playing with a different mind-set
than the Astros. The Reds, with their paltry $33 million payroll,
weren't expected to contend. The Astros, like the Rangers, entered
the season feeling the need to do better than just win another
division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a young team and you haven't been successful in a
while, you have nothing to lose,'' Dierker said. ``When you've won
a few times and you've had the lead all year and all of a sudden,
you start to lose a few games, then you get that fear, you can't
afford to lose. It's a different psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it seemed Tuesday night. Reds pitcher Pete
Harnisch breezed through eight innings on 75 pitches, allowing just
four hits, before rookie reliever Scott Williamson finished up.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Astros 20-game winner Jose Lima gave up four
runs in the first three innings. Right fielder Derek Bell, who
missed 2 1/2 weeks with a pulled ribcage muscle, made the second
inning worse by letting Eddie Taubensee's single get past him for
an error.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Dmitri Young to score from first, and Taubensee
ended up at third. He scored on Pokey Reese's single, giving the
Reds a 3-1 lead at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing great,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell
said. ``They have momentum, but one win by us (Wednesday) changes
that. Then it becomes a three-game series, and the team that does
the best over the weekend wins the series.'' nn

SENIOR TENNIS TOUR EARNS RESPECT OF GOLFING COUNTERPART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jimmy Connors knows success when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senior PGA Tour started gaining fans, making money and
having competitive golf every week, Connors decided to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to get all the guys I played with over the course
of my career who had been out of tennis for a number of years and
try to get them back into the game,'' said Connors, who won eight
Grand Slam titles in a 20-year career. ``My idea was to be around
my buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior golfers have said a senior tennis tour can be a
part of the landscape in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tennis' start has been great,'' said CBS golf analyst
Gary McCord, who plays on the senior golf tour. ``People grew up
with a lot of these guys in the '70s, and they still want to follow
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Connors and ProServe co-founder Ray Benton formed The
Champions Tour, a series of tennis events for competitors age 34
and older. The tour, in its sixth year, has modeled itself after
golf's Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fans that come out just like they do,'' said Henry
Brehm, executive producer of what is now called the Worldwide
Senior Tennis Circuit. ``We have some comparisons to senior golf,
like the money and the big-name players. If you look at senior
golf, a lot of those guys didn't think they'd end up where they are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior tennis tour, which makes a stop at the Four Seasons
Resort at Las Colinas for the second consecutive year starting
tonight, had a slightly faster start than senior golf but doesn't
plan to grow to the same size.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 _ its first year _ the tennis tour had three
tournaments. With Nuveen as its primary sponsor, the tennis tour
offered total prize money of $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   The senior golf tour, which was born when corporate sponsorships
weren't such a big part of professional sports, started in 1980
with two events and $250,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis tour has 21 events this year, and the golf tour has
45, including some of the unofficial stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're kind of maxed out as far as events,'' Brehm
said. ``I don't think we want to have as many events as the senior
\Rgolf\S tour. The guys can't go from week to week like when they
were younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior golf events offer larger purses and more money for the
champions. Tom Watson took home $195,000 by winning the Bank One
Championship in Dallas earlier this month, and this weekend's
singles champion in Irving will win $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senior golfers have traditionally resisted the notion of their
tour being pure nostalgia. Senior tennis players appear to be
preparing a similar case for their tour.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, said he plays to
win every tournament. Connors, before injuries slowed him down at
age 47, dominated the tour in its early stages. The two players are
still fierce competitors.
</P>
<P>
   After Connors' victory against McEnroe in last year's final at
Four Seasons, the pair refused to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the guys are still playing at a high level,''
said Jimmy Arias, who opens the Four Seasons event tonight against
Mel Purcell. ``I don't think the play would be the same if, say, we
were 50 years old. But I still think a lot of us are competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Players under 40 are beginning to assert themselves in senior
tennis, as seen with Mats Wilander, 35, beating Mikael Pernfors,
36, to win the BTI Champions of Atlanta tournament last week. But
the tour must have the bigger _ and older _ names to survive,
several players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour needs a Connors and a McEnroe to keep this thing
going,'' Arias said. ``Back in the 1970s, these guys saved tennis.
It's because of them \Rthat\S people come out to events.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour has been everywhere this year _ from New York to St.
Petersburg, Russia _ yet it hasn't been a success at every site. In
Irving and Atlanta, ticket sales have been sluggish because fans'
entertainment budgets have been stretched by the many options for
professional sports, Brehm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some markets are more successful than others,'' he said.
``We've had good success in New York and had a terrific event in
Chicago. There are some tough sells ... but we've tried to build
small stadiums so the fans can be right up on the action.''
</P>
<P>
   At Four Seasons, the capacity will be 2,100. In last year's
final, at the same site, a crowd of 2,827 showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a good time, but when we walk on the court we
want to win,'' said five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg, who
will not play this week in Irving. ``It is a great atmosphere
around the tournaments and that is why all of the players support
the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Connors organized it.

MARINERS PLAY GAME TO FORGET IN 10-0 WAXING BY RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Before he talked with reporters Tuesday
night, John Halama talked with Jamie Moyer. For at least 15
minutes, the rookie and the veteran analyzed what had happened: a
10-0 loss to the Texas Rangers in which Halama lasted four innings,
allowing six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Halama was disappointed in the outing, his seventh loss in his
last nine decisions. He asked Moyer if he was reading into it too
much, or if his problems were just a matter of location.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I was just up in the zone and couldn't get it down,''
Halama said. ``I was up in the zone more than I was all year.
Usually you adjust and start getting the ball down, and today I
just battled. One of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Halama pitched at The Ballpark in Arlington, it
was one of his best days _ he threw a shutout. This time, he gave
up two homers, including Rafael Palmeiro's 47th, and three runs in
the fourth, then allowed three singles before being lifted in the
fifth. All three runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made adjustments, and I didn't make them today,'' Halama
said. ``They got me. It's a learning experience. It's been a year
of a lot of schooling, whether it be from opposing hitters, from
Jamie or other pitchers _ even Jeff helped early, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be former Mariner Jeff Fassero, who threw four
shutout innings in his start for Texas. Fassero, pitching for the
first time in 13 days, allowed four hits but was not sharp, walking
four. If he makes the Rangers' postseason roster _ which is by no
means guaranteed _ it will probably be as a long reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know definitely going into the winter, I'm going to change
some of my workout routines, do some extra stuff,'' said Fassero,
who has a 6.06 earned-run average since being claimed off waivers
Aug. 27. ``I know the velocity's still there, there's just
something missing, and I'm going to try to get it back this winter.
I'm going to get back to where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama's drop-off has not been nearly as dramatic, but he has
not had the same results in the second half as he had early on. At
the All-Star break, Halama was 7-2 with a 2.89 ERA. Since then, he
is 4-7, 5.76. He has lasted six innings while allowing no more than
three earned runs just three times in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggled here his last half-dozen starts,'' said manager
Lou Piniella. ``He's gotten the ball up more than he was early in
the year. Remember, he's not a power pitcher. We were a little
concerned about September for a few or our younger pitchers.
They've never pitched this late in the season. He's a little tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first full year in the major leagues as a
hitter, I never thought September would end _ you get tired, and
then you know what to expect. It's a good experience for him, for
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama (11-9), who is scheduled to start the season finale
Sunday but may be replaced to give Ken Cloude or Denny Stark an
audition, said he didn't feel tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched last year until Sept. 25 (in the Class AAA
playoffs),'' Halama said. ``I'm not using tired as an excuse. You
find a way to get some energy or whatever up here. It was just a
matter of not getting my pitches down.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mariners to 77-80, meaning they'll have to
win all of their remaining games to finish above .500.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have one more win than they did last year _ so that
goal has been reached _ but .500 is looking more and more like a
lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it means something to me, and I'm sure it means
something to the team,'' Piniella said. ``We're trying, (but)
leaving home one game under .500 and playing good teams on the road
is not the best possible scenario. We had chances at home and we've
had chances all year. It seems like every time we get to that
number, we take a step backward.''

DODGERS BLOW OUT CANDLES AT CANDLESTICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe the key for the Los Angeles Dodgers is to
create more turmoil. In the 18 tumultuous months of the Fox Group's
unstable ownership of the club, nothing seems to make the Dodgers
perform like chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Five benchmark events occurred inside a season since Rupert
Murdoch took over, and the Dodgers won four times. The latest was a
6-3 Dodgers win at the rival Giants following Tuesday's firing of
president and CEO Bob Graziano. Rick Welts, president of Fox Sports
Enterprises and the man who fired Graziano, said the change in
leadership had nothing to do with the Dodgers' dismal on-field
performance. But many of the on-field personnel felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see someone in management fall because of the 25
guys in (the clubhouse),'' catcher Todd Hundley said. ``It's not
his fault. It's ours. We have to win baseball games. We have to be
held responsible, and be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won the day after Mike Piazza was traded last season
but lost the day following manager Bill Russell's and general
manager Fred Claire's firing. This season they won after pitching
coach Charlie Hough was fired, after Raul Mondesi lashed out at
management and after Graziano's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The much-hyped Dodgers, with an $80 million payroll, haven't
been above .500 since they were 28-27 on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure our performance got a lot of people fired,'' said
left fielder Gary Sheffield, who hit a pair of home runs. ``We
didn't save anyone's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Chan Ho Park was the emergency starter because
Ismael Valdes returned Monday to his home near Victoria Tamps,
Mexico, to be with his father, who was injured in a car accident
Sunday. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he wasn't sure if Valdes
was going to return to the club this season, but he did say lefty
Jeff Williams would start the 3Com Park farewell Thursday. In his
place, Park (13-10) won his career-high seventh straight decision
after allowing one run in six innings. He struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray (Valdes) got there and his father is OK,''
said Johnson, who was then asked about Graziano. ``Any time in this
business, when things don't go well, there's going to be changes. .
. . It's tough. But when you don't perform up to expectations,
changes are going to be made.''

FORMER MAVERICKS BALLBOY HAS CHANCE TO MAKE THE ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Nine years ago, Robert White worked as a ballboy for
the Mavericks, a job in which he had to mop the sweat off the
Reunion Arena floor during games.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a glamour detail would come along, and White would
get to rebound for Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone or Patrick Ewing
during pregame shootarounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, White has a shot to play against Olajuwon, Malone and
Ewing, among others. The Lancaster resident has gone from Mavericks
ballboy to Mavericks team member. He is going to training camp with
the team next week and seems to have a shot of making the team's
12-man roster.]
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got NBA size, and he certainly has athleticism,''
Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``But with him, he's
got to bring his A-game consistently. Sometimes he'll slip back
into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's got the size, the stroke and the skills.''
</P>
<P>
   White, 23, still has a way to make the NBA. But the 6-foot-7,
215-pounder _ he doubles as a small forward and shooting guard _
impressed the Mavericks coaching staff so much that they included
him as part of an Athletes In Action team they sent to London to
play this past summer. That came after he impressed them with his
play in pro summer leagues in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   White's saga seems more befitting a ballboy than a ball handler
at the elite level. But the 1995 Lancaster High School graduate has
put in the sweat to reach the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say when I was sitting under the basket as a ballboy,
I was thinking, `Man, I wish I could play in the NBA,' '' White
said. ``At that age I was intimidated to see all of those big guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then I've had a dream and desire to one day get there.
But at that age I was so caught up in never being in a big arena
like that before, and there I was standing next to big Karl Malone,
Terry Davis and all these players. At that time I was thinking, `I
have a ways to go to get up to their level.'''
</P>
<P>
   White made a splash at this level in July, when he played for
the Momentum Sports in the Los Angeles Summer League. That team was
coached by the first draft pick in Mavericks history _ former NBA
All-Star Kiki Vandeweghe.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets were so impressed with White's performance
that they invited him to play for their summer league team in the
Rocky Mountain Revue in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In the LA Summer League, White was sometimes pitted against the
likes of Phoenix rookie Shawn Marion, who was the ninth pick of the
June NBA Draft. The former ballboy more than held his ground .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think getting out to LA was great for him, because he had a
chance, number one, to be coached by Kiki Vandeweghe,'' said Mark
Slough, White's agent. ``The second thing is out in LA he played
against Shawn Marion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Robert and Shawn are 6-7, and Robert's like, `Hey, I can
play with this guy.' When he was out in LA his confidence just
grew.''
</P>
<P>
   White was drafted by the New Mexico Slam of the International
Basketball League _ a first-year pro league that is perhaps a level
below the Continental Basketball Association, the NBA's
developmental arm _ this summer. He is negotiating to play for that
franchise. But it is clear that his eyes are set on making it in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time I never did want to play basketball,'' White said.
``I always liked soccer, and I never really showed any concern that
I could do anything in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was able to overcome some obstacles and I kept putting
in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   White grew from a 5-foot-8 eighth-grader to a 6-3 freshman. As a
high school senior, he only averaged eight points for a Lancaster
team that lost to Lincoln in the '94 regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   White wound up playing for tiny Southern Nazarene University in
Bethany, Okla. As a junior at the NAIA school, he averaged 15
points and five rebounds, and this past season he averaged 17
points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   White was able to parlay both of those seasons into honorable
mention All-America status. Now he's looking for a much higher
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would be as far as I am right now,'' White
said. ``But you always have your hopes, your dreams and your drive,
and with that drive, God gave me the opportunity, and it came to
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson genuinely likes White's chances of making an NBA roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really in a good position that he can be a real
attractive two-guard,'' he said. ``I talked to the coach of the IBL
team that drafted him and told him what I thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like him, and he's close to being in the NBA.''

FIRST-ROUND PICK PLANS TO STICK WITH MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie Leon Smith said he plans to sign a three-year, $1.7
million guaranteed contract with the Dallas Mavericks within the
next two weeks, but he's not sure whether he'll be in Dallas when
training camp starts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday from his home in Chicago, Smith said he is busy
trying to hire an agent to represent him. He said he recently fired
agent Dan Fegan, who also represents free-agent forward Shandon
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I needed somebody more geared toward giving
me some more personal attention,'' Smith said. ``He didn't tell me
what was going on. I was left hanging out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've narrowed it down now to between two agents, and I'll
probably make a decision sometime next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mavericks have said they prefer Smith go through a
year of seasoning in the Continental Basketball Association or
International Basketball League, assistant coach Donnie Nelson
wouldn't rule out the possibility of Smith securing a roster spot
with Dallas this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent thing is up in the air, and it could be very well
that he decides to do something different,'' Nelson said. ``It
could also be that he decides to stay (with the Mavericks). But
that's also up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he signs his contract, he comes to training camp
and he gets paid this year. But he needs to have some kind of an
adjustment period between high school and the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who graduated from Chicago's Martin Luther King High
School this year, said he has had no conversations with
representatives from the CBA or the IBL. But the 6-foot-11 forward
did say he can't wait to discuss his future with Mavericks
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be talking to the Mavericks within the next couple of
days,'' Smith said. ``Coming to the Mavericks' training camp sounds
good, but I really don't know what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks acquired Smith in a draft day trade with the world
champion San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs selected Smith with the final
pick of the first round, then traded him to the Mavericks for a
pair of second-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Smith acquitted himself well two months ago when the
Mavericks participated in the Los Angeles Summer League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people saw him actually in action in Los Angeles, they
saw what he's capable of,'' Nelson said. ``And the more people had
a chance to kind of get to know Leon, they found out he wasn't a
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 18, had been a ward of the state of Illinois since he was
four years old. He bounced from group home to group home, but is
now on the verge of living the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon's basically a good guy that, forced into a situation, had
to make a decision,'' Nelson said, referring to Smith's decision to
turn pro or go to college. ``He had no propensity or no skills of
the academia areas, so it was a hard decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the fact that he's got all this information, and
when you see his basketball skill level, I don't think you want to
bet against Leon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he arrives in Dallas won't be soon enough for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working out, I'm in good shape, and I want to be in
Dallas this season,'' Smith said. ``I just want to be the best
player that I can be and work as hard as I can and really show the
fans that I was worth being drafted.'' nn

CONNORS, WILANDER HEAD IRVING EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A total of 21 Grand Slam titles will be
represented during the PricewaterhouseCoopers Champions senior
tennis event starting today at the Four Seasons Resort and Club at
Las Colinas.
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 event, which will award $40,000 to the singles
champion, will be headlined by defending champion Jimmy Connors.
Play starts at 7 p.m. today with two matches and concludes Sunday
with the singles and doubles championships, both starting at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Connors is joined by former ATP Tour players Guillermo Vilas,
Mats Wilander, Mikael Pernfors and Andres Gomez. Bjorn Borg, a
winner of 11 Grand Slam titles, pulled out of the event last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwide Senior Tennis Circuit's Irving event is the 13th
of 21 on the $3.6 million tour. The 1999-2000 season includes
events in Tokyo, London, Paris, New York and St. Petersburg,
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Wilander won his second senior tour title of the season Sunday
with a three-set victory against Pernfors at the BTI Champions of
Atlanta. Wilander defeated Connors in the semifinals of the Atlanta
event.
</P>
<P>
   Connors' opening match this week is at 7 p.m. tomorrow against
the winner between John Lloyd and Jose-Luis Clerc.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's final at Four Seasons, Connors defeated John
McEnroe in a spirited match that had both players yelling at either
the fans or the line judges. Connors eventually stormed off the
court after an exchange with a fan, and McEnroe had to persuade him
to return and finish. When the match was over, the players left the
court without shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   Some local players are involved in this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   Val Wilder of Euless will team up with two-time Australian Open
singles champion Johan Kriek in doubles. Their opening match is at
7 p.m. tomorrow against Mansour Bahrami and Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our chances,'' Wilder said. ``I think Johan is a very
quick doubles player, but I will need to play well. If I can hold
my serve, I think we can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Poorman and Michael Grossman of Dallas will team up to
face veterans Mel Purcell and Tim Wilkison at 7 p.m. Friday. The
winning doubles team will receive $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity of a lifetime,'' said Poorman, who
works at the new Southlake Tennis Center. ``I've watched these guys
throughout their careers. I think we've got a shot to win, but we
have to play aggressively. I mean, we are playing against Dr. Dirt
\RWilkison\S and Purcell. It's going to be tough.''

PLAYOFF LOSS TO CARDINALS STILL GALLS COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey is not Knute
Rockne inside the locker room, but even Rockne might have skipped
the big pep talk this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Arizona Cardinals return to Texas Stadium for the
first time since delivering a 20-7 knockout punch in the first
round of the playoffs Jan. 2 and, in effect, trashing the Cowboys'
NFC Eastern Division-sweeping season. Gailey does not have to
remind his team about what happened then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever forget that game,'' Gailey said
Tuesday. ``Revenge' or `payback' is not a war cry ... but anybody
who was in that locker room after the game remembers what it felt
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey still has not been able to watch the videotape of that
game from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the whole thing,'' said Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   How far has he gotten?
</P>
<P>
   ``Far enough,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey isn't real talkative when it comes to re-enacting the
accounts and images of that Jan. 2 game. Jake ``The Snake'' Plummer
and the Cardinals basically came to town and had their way with the
Cowboys' defense, while Gailey's then-struggling offense failed to
even put up a fight because of personnel lapses and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But nine months later, it's the Cowboys who are 2-0 with weapons
galore, and it's the 1-2 Cardinals with the offensive problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's Plummer, with one touchdown and nine interceptions, who
ranks last in the NFC and next-to-last behind only Baltimore's
Scott Mitchell in the NFL in passer efficiency rating.
</P>
<P>
   It's Arizona with the injuries. Just as Deion Sanders returns to
the Dallas secondary, Cardinals big-play wide receiver Rob Moore
will miss Sunday's game because of a strained hamstring, which he
suffered in Monday night's 24-10 home loss to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's place will be taken by fifth-year journeyman Andy
McCullough, a former NFL Europe standout who spent last season with
four NFL teams _ Miami, Detroit, New Orleans and Arizona _ mostly
on their practice squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to have (McCullough) play more like a veteran than
a rookie,'' Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin tried to explain away Plummer's difficulties by saying
that his quarterback hasn't had much practice since suffering a
sprained thumb on his throwing hand Aug. 21 during a preseason game
against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get more practice this week ... and that ought to
help,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody is feeling sorry for the Cardinals around Valley
Ranch. Especially not Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there was any chance that he worried that his
players may be overconfident about this game in light of how the
Cardinals have been playing, Gailey replied, ``None.
</P>
<P>
   ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this has everything to do with the Jan. 2 game,
Gailey replied, ``Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said that the playoff elimination game
against Arizona led directly to the off-season signing of center
Mark Stepnoski, along with the drafting of pass-rush specialists
Ebenezer Ekuban and Peppi Zellner, because of Plummer's
twice-a-year presence in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepnoski was the key move,'' Jones said Tuesday. ``We got him
(as an unrestricted free agent from Tennessee) so we could be more
effective both in (pass) protection and the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also did something as subtle as draft (seventh-round tight
end) Mike Lucky because of his ability to block in double-tight end
situations. And because Plummer likes to buy time by stepping up in
the pocket, then going outside and behind the pass rush, we drafted
Ekuban and Zellner to take away those running lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones doesn't enjoy looking back at the Jan. 2 loss to the
Cardinals. But he has watched it on videotape several times.
</P>
<P>
   Just not alongside his head coach. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Right tackle Erik Williams (strained quadriceps) is expected
to practice with the rest of the Cowboys on Wednesday, while right
guard Everett McIver (strained hamstring) remains more iffy, Chan
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Kevin Smith is expected to resume team practice
today. He hasn't played since the Aug. 9 Hall of Fame game in
Canton, Ohio, because of a bulging disk in his back. As far as
being ready for Sunday, Smith has been put ``more in the McIver
category,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Deion Sanders will put his left big toe (late April
surgery) to the test at right corner and on punt returns Sunday.
This will be Sanders' first game action for the Cowboys since the
Jan. 2 playoff game. nn

CAN KINGS ZIG-ZAG TO PLAYOFFS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New arena, new coach, new scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Old baggage.
</P>
<P>
   That best describes this season's Los Angeles Kings, who have
failed to make the National Hockey League playoffs for five of the
past six years and who open the regular season on Saturday in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings leave the Forum for the state-of-the-art Staples
Center, and they bring along new coach Andy Murray and former New
York Islanders scoring star Zigmund (Ziggy) Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   But how do they handle the baggage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my credibility is on the line with these players,''
said Murray, former coach of the Canadian national team who vows to
use players who are performing, regardless of name or contract
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Credibility) is all you really have in this business,''
Murray said. ``I'll never compromise that just to please people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fresh faces, the Kings are fundamentally unchanged,
haunted by the same questions that have dogged the franchise since
it advanced to the 1993 finals and came, perhaps, one illegal stick
away from the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Kings play the type of premier defense needed to be
successful in a league that demands it of its best teams? After
winning the Norris Trophy for best defenseman in '97-98, Rob Blake
had a sub-par season in '98-'99.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Kings have the speed to compete in a league that becomes
faster each year? Can they score? Particularly, can they conquer
their power-play demons? And will players respond to a coach who
has yet to prove himself on the NHL level?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try new things,'' said winger Glen Murray.
``Nothing worked last year, so the way we look at it, trying new
things is good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also find themselves embroiled in another contract
dispute with a defenseman. Last year Aki Berg sat out the entire
season, opting to play in Finland. This year Mattias Norstrom has
not come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a step forward and making the playoffs two years
ago, the Kings took two steps back in a nightmarish season that
ultimately cost coach Larry Robinson his job.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a nice guy whose ability to motivate and discipline
players was often questioned, is contrasted nicely by Murray. He
plans practices to the minute, has motivational slogans posted in
the dressing room and already has shown a willingness to let his
players know just where he stands.
</P>
<P>
   In exhibition play, Murray hasn't backed down from anybody. He
got into a shouting match with Craig Hartsburg when he felt the
Mighty Ducks coach wasn't controlling his players in the
brawl-filled finale at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He also made it very clear to Bryan Smolinski, who was acquired
from the Islanders in the Palffy trade, that he expected more
effort and dropped him to the fourth line, promoting journeyman Len
Barrie to the second.
</P>
<P>
   Murray hasn't been afraid to put some pressure on Smolinski, who
has scored as many as 31 goals in a season but slumped to 13 and 16
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we are getting with Palffy,'' said Murray. ``The
unknown is Bryan Smolinski. The success of the (Palffy) trade
hinges on Smolinski.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings finished 11th in the 13-team Western Conference with a
32-45-5 record last season and the fans stayed away in droves _ not
exactly the kind of momentum management was looking to build on as
it prepared to move into the spacious Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings weren't just bad, they were slow and boring. Los
Angeles scored just 189 goals, the third fewest in the league. Luc
Robitaille scored 39 of those, nobody else more than 18. The lack
of scoring and excitement forced general manager Dave Taylor to
make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who last coached a prep school team in Minnesota, was
the unlikely choice as coach and 11 players from last year's team _
including regulars Ray Ferraro, Doug Bodger, Russ Courtnall, Yanic
Perreault and Olli Jokinen _ are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen, the team's first-round pick (third overall), was dealt
to the New York Islanders in Taylor's move to bring the Kings some
goal-scoring and star power in the form of Palffy, a three-time
40-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   So there is a new look and a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is great so far,'' Robitaille said. ``The energy is
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the always optimistic Robitaille knows the Kings will
be treading water without Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' he acknowledged, ``is great except for Matty.''

DUCKS EAGER TO MAKE AMENDS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks were satisfied simply
to make the Stanley Cup playoffs last season. Perhaps too
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the home stretch with a 1-5-2 record, they were
swatted aside by the Red Wings in a four-game sweep that left them
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't feel good about making the playoffs, about how we
lost to Detroit . . . how we finished,'' Teemu Selanne said. ``We
were horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't close to winning a game and if you can't win a
game, how are you going to win a series? We have to have more grit,
be smarter, (have) more discipline _ everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Craig Hartsburg has lectured on those very topics
throughout training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to become a more tenacious team,'' Hartsburg said.
``We took steps last year, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's habits. You don't win doing things once in a while, you
win by doing it every night. Character is no excuses, it's about
winning the 1-0, 2-0 games and showing up for a game after two
weeks on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   After going 26-43-13 and missing the playoffs in 1997-98, the
Ducks improved to 35-34-13 last season and finished sixth in the
Western Conference. But they squandered a chance to finish fourth
or fifth with their late-season swoon. Instead of playing a Phoenix
team they matched up with well, the Ducks were wasted by the Red
Wings in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a learning process,'' Selanne said. ``We learned
how much it really takes to have success in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players and management learned that lesson. The Ducks
didn't make a lot of changes over the summer, but general manager
Pierre Gauthier and Hartsburg realized the defense needed more
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a plain-wrap style during the regular season, the
defensemen helped the Mighty Ducks cut their goals-against total
from 261 to 206.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Red Wings it was all too obvious the Ducks'
defense needed to move the puck more quickly, make better outlet
passes to relieve the pressure caused by Detroit's forechecking,
and get the puck to Paul Kariya and Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day, Gauthier, with the aid of Phoenix, addressed that
issue. He traded the Ducks' first-round draft choice and center
Travis Green to the Coyotes for former Ducks No. 1 pick Oleg
Tverdovsky, who had been traded away in the deal that brought
Selanne to Anaheim. In the third round, Gauthier selected Swedish
veteran Niclas Havelid.
</P>
<P>
   Havelid should get plenty of playing time this season, but it's
Tverdvosky who could make a big difference if he plays to the
potential the Ducks saw when they made him the No. 3 overall pick
in 1994. The 23-year-old should give the Ducks their first
defenseman capable of jumping into the play and carrying the puck
out of the Anaheim zone on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier also signed 1998 first-round pick Vitaly Vishnevski, a
defenseman. He will start the season at Cincinnati, but it wouldn't
be surprising to see the hard-hitting 19-year-old Russian in
Anaheim before the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier's only other major move in the offseason was trading
minor-league goalie Patrick Lalime to Ottawa for veteran winger Ted
Donato, who is expected to fill the hole left on the second line by
Tomas Sandstrom's return to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some changes but not too many because we want to keep
this team together,'' Gauthier said. ``We didn't want to disturb
the chemistry. Chemistry and team play are more important in
hockey, more than other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier and Hartsburg are depending on young players like Matt
Cullen, Antti Aalto, Ruslan Salei and Mike LeClerc to continue
their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youngsters had ups and downs last year,'' said Gauthier.
``This year should be a breakthrough year for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to be better as a team, our young players have to be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the veterans and coaches will make sure nobody gets
too satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes . . . myself, Paul, Teemu, Steve
(Rucchin),'' said goalie Guy Hebert, who knows returning to the
playoffs is no sure thing.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
After 35 years of hosting Houston baseball, the Astrodome
presumably will close up shop after the postseason. It appears,
however, the Astros can't wait that long to shut it down.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although nothing in their demeanor or rhetoric suggests the
Astros are done, very little in their play over the past two weeks
indicates they have enough left in their tanks to beat the
Cincinnati Reds to the finish line in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds reclaimed sole possession of first place Tuesday with a
4-1 victory before 54,037 fans, the largest crowd ever to watch a
baseball game at the Astrodome. The Astros had been in first place
in the NL Central since July 9, and they had spent only five days
out of the top spot since April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's a good thing,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``Now, we don't have to worry about holding them off, because
we don't have the lead anymore. Let them see how it feels for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' residency atop the NL Central will be permanent if the
Astros don't turn things around over the final four games of the
season. Dierker's team has lost eight of its last 11 games.
Meanwhile, the Reds have won eight of 10 to take control of the
division. If the past two weeks are any indication, the only thing
standing between the Astros and an early vacation are the Mets, who
are in the midst of an even more pitiful stretch-drive performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lost to Atlanta on Tuesday, have dropped seven in
a row and trail the Astros by 1{ games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned, because I don't want to play all this way and
not go to the playoffs,'' Dierker said. ``I'd be happy to get in as
the wild card. I don't care how we get in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see us getting in, although it might not necessarily
be on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way they have responded to the playoff race, the
Astros are well aware that words such as collapse and choke are
just waiting to roll off the tongues of observers near and far.
Nevertheless, they insist they don't feel pressured by the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to say what they want to say,'' Astros second
baseman Craig Biggio said. ``When you're not winning, it looks like
you're tight, but we're not tight.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as pressure, few people have a way with words quite
like Astros center fielder Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as pressure,'' he said. ``The only
pressure I know about is in tires. We need to forget about all the
hoopla and just play our games. Too much is being made about this.
We've been playing like Little Leaguers. We have a great team; we
just haven't been playing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult to look like a great team
considering the way Pete Harnisch pitched Tuesday night. The
sore-armed righthander held the Astros to four hits in eight
innings. Harnisch, pitching despite shoulder tendinitis, threw only
74 pitches, 58 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty amazing,'' Astros left fielder Bill Spiers said.
``When you only throw 16 balls, you had pretty good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, who is 4-0 against the Astros this season, retired 23
of the 27 batters he faced and made Reds manager Jack McKeon look
like a genius for pushing his start back to this pivotal series.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Jose Lima wasn't at his best, but he pitched well
enough to keep the Astros in the game. A costly second-inning error
by right fielder Derek Bell helped the Reds score two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them a couple of runs, and in a 2-1 game you could do
some things differently than you might in a 4-1 game,'' Dierker
said. ``But you have to tip your hat to Harnisch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey's solo homer gave the Reds a 1-0 lead in the first
and took some of the initial steam out of the fired-up Astrodome
crowd. Lima (20-10) has allowed a staff-high 30 home runs, four shy
of his club record from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the score in the bottom of the inning when
Biggio hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Jeff
Bagwell's ground ball to shortstop. The Reds' two-run second inning
went unanswered, as did the single run they posted in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young and Eddie Taubensee led off the second with
back-to-back singles, with Young scoring from first when
Taubensee's hit rolled under Bell's glove and to the right-field
wall. Pokey Reese singled home Taubensee, who added an RBI single
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball that got by Derek certainly hurt us,'' Dierker said.
``Any time you make an error in the outfield, it usually costs you
two or three bases instead of just one. It's a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third error Bell has made in 200 chances this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to blame me for this loss, I'll be a man and
accept it,'' Bell said. ``I'll take responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima was gone after six innings, marking the third time he has
lasted less than seven innings in five starts this month. He
allowed four runs (three earned) on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros appeared close to rallying against Harnisch (15-10)
in the seventh, putting runners on second and third with one out.
But Harnisch struck out Ken Caminiti, and All-Star shortstop Barry
Larkin threw out Bell on a dandy play on a ground ball up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year candidate Scott Williamson, a Friendswood
native, retired all three batters he faced to earn his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think anyone is panicking,'' Bagwell said.
``People are going to say it's the pressure or whatever, but I
don't see that. It has nothing to do with pressure. Tonight, we
just got a great game pitched against us.''

PATIENT DIES WHILE UNDERGOING GENE THERAPY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A patient has died while undergoing gene therapy in a trial
study at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment itself should prove to be the cause of his
death it would probably be the first by someone undergoing gene
therapy and could be a severe setback for the experimental
technique, whose fulfillment has long fallen short of its high
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, Jesse Gelsinger, was an 18-year old from Arizona
who suffered from a genetic defect that prevents the correct
metabolism of ammonia. He was part of a group of 18 patients who
were being tested with different doses of a virus carrying a
corrective gene. He and another patient, who was unaffected,
received the highest dose being given in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger died on Sept. 17, four days after a dose of
genetically engineered virus was injected into one of the main
arteries of his liver, so as to deliver the highest possible dose
of a corrective gene to the cells where it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, known as adenovirus, is one of the causes of the
common cold and usually causes only a mild fever. It has been used
in many previous gene therapy trials. Gelsinger's death was first
reported in Tuesday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all devastated by this,'' said Rebecca Harmon, a
spokesperson for the University of Pennsylvania. `'Jesse truly was
a hero in advancing the cause of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harmon said Gelsinger's was the first death to have occurred
among the 130 patients who have been treated at the university's
Institute of Gene Therapy. The institute, headed by Dr. James M.
Wilson, is one of the leading gene therapy centers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Raper, the principal scientist in charge of the trial,
said that the timing of the treatment and Gelsinger's death
suggested a possible relationship but that the cause had not yet
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major impact of Jesse's sacrifice,'' Raper said, is that
safer viruses may need to be developed. ``Gene therapy,'' he said,
``still holds tremendous promise for a variety of diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   To get corrective genes into cells, gene therapists have to rely
on viruses, which specialize in exactly this task.
</P>
<P>
   Adenovirus is used partly because it causes such a mild gene.
Results have been generally disappointing, however, because the
body's immune system usually roots out and destroys the virus after
six weeks, along with the beneficial genes it has inserted. Well
before Gelsinger's death, gene therapists had been trying to
develop more suitable viruses as vectors.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's disease, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, is
usually inherited but Gelsinger had a rare form in which his gene
mutated after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's father, Paul Gelsinger, 47, a licensed handyman in
Tucson, Ariz., said his son became interested in the experimental
gene therapy after he had begun to rebel against the restrictive
nonprotein diet and the 50 pill-a-day regimen that mitigated his
symptoms. He faced a life of increasingly larger doses of
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a a rebellious teenager who thought he could manage his
own illness,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse was especially interested in the gene trial since it
promised dramatic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse was also interested because the particular phase of the
trial he was in might benefit newborns who get the worst form of
the disease that kills in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gelsinger and Jesse, who at 18 was the actual person giving
consent for the trial, were told the largest risks from the trial
would come from possible hepatitis and blood clots. The cause of
death has not been determined, Gelsinger said, ``but it's obvious
it had to have been the procedure itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger does not have hard feelings toward the doctors in the
trial. ``The doctors are as devastated as I am. It was because of
these men that I had my son for 18 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse died on Sept. 17, when artificial life support was
discontinued, but his vital signs began to fail the second day
after the introduction of the modified gene on Monday, Sept. 13.

A'S STAVE OFF ELIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Randy Velarde admitted coming back to Anaheim
this week would have been a lot sweeter if his Oakland A's had a
legitimate shot at making the playoffs. Instead, the A's were on
the verge of being eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde and the A's staved off elimination for at least one more
day with a 9-3 victory over the Anaheim Angels Tuesday before
17,981 at Edison Field. Mo Vaughn's 31st homer of the year gave the
Angels a 2-0 lead in the first inning, but the A's Jason Giambi
snapped a 2-2 tie with his 33rd homer of the season to give the A's
a 4-2 lead in the fifth. Giambi, a 1989 graduate of South Hills
High, reached base five times with three hits and two walks. The
A's broke the game open with a four-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the win, the A's still need to win their remaining five
games and hopgames to forge a tie for the A.L. Wild Card spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels traded Velarde and pitcher Omar Olivares to the A's
for three minor leaguers on July 29, all but signaling the end of
the season for the Angels and creating new life for Velarde and
Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was exciting to leave the situation in Anaheim,'' said
Velarde, who went into Tuesday's game hitting .314 with 16 homers
and 71 RBIs. ''I went from a team that pretty much came to the
field, played the game every day and had no emotion, to going to a
team that was in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was quick to add that he didn't think the Angels weren't
playing hard. It's just that there was nothing to play for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think effort was ever in question,'' Velarde said.
''Injuries were a common denominator here. Injuries are always a
part of a season, but to be decimated the way these guys were the
years I was here was confusing. You lose three or four marquee guys
... you take away three or four marquee guys, that will cripple any
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was one of the players that had problems with former
manager Terry Collins. When asked about Collins, Velarde at first
declined to comment, then relented.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough job,'' Velarde said. ''The manager takes a lot of
responsibility. Nobody questioned his heart or enthusiasm for the
game. It all comes down to production and getting guys ready to
play. And that wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde said he never expected to be traded by the Angels. In
fact, he said he was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ''My name was never mentioned in rumors,'' he said. ''The day I
was traded my mother-in-law had a heart attack. It all happened in
a 12-hour span. I was on an emotional roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, who is a free agent after the season, said his agent
has talked to the A's about returning to Oakland next season. But
he wouldn't rule out anything, even returning to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing I've learned in this game is never say never,'' he
said. ''It all comes down to if Oakland wants me back, or if
Anaheim wants me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disparity in the standings, Velarde said he doesn't
see much difference between the A's and Angels of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see a lot of similarities between this team and Anaheim,''
he said. ''They're both young and talented. The biggest difference
is this team's power production is more consistent than
Anaheim's.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, who will start tonight's game for the A's, has gone
7-2 with Oakland since the trade and is 15-11 overall. He, too,
will be a free agent at the end of the season and hasn't ruled out
returning to Anaheim if the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to come back and see the guys,'' he said. ''I liked
it here in Anaheim, but Oakland has been great to me too. I do like
the team here (Anaheim) ... we just had a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad a year as it was for the Angels, they were in a position
to knock the A's out of the race. Angels interim manager Joe
Maddon, however, said there was no added motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't even thought about that,'' Maddon said. ''What our
agenda should be is to play as well as we can, period. If we knock
somebody out of it, great. We just played three totally intense
games (in Seattle). I can't imagine paying with any more intensity.
If we play these games with that level of intensity, I'd be
happy.''

   ANAHEIM. Calif. _ Mo Vaughn said recently the Anaheim Angels
players should not forget this season and what it's felt like, so
they'll do everything they can not to let it happen again. For
general manager Bill Bavasi, however, the 1999 season ended and was
forgotten after July 31.
</P>
<P>
   That was the date of the trading deadline, and the time Bavasi
and his staff began looking to the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the players' point of view, (Vaughn's) right,'' Bavasi
said. ``They have to suffer with it, let the pain set in and let
the throb go away in the off-season. Realistically, for myself,
(assistant GM) Ken Forsch and (director of scouting) Bob Fontaine,
Aug. 1 was the day we started evaluating and preparing for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the end of the season gets closer, I immerse myself in
preparing for next season, they (the players) I have made that
trade (Omar Olivares and Randy Velarde to the A's for minor
leaguers) if I wasn't looking to next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival was expected to meet with trainer Ned
Bergert and team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum after Tuesday's
game to decide on Percival's availability for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, who has been bothered by a sore right shoulder, says
he wants to keep pitching through the end of the season. But the
Angels are likely to shut him down and not take any chances on
furthering the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Garret Anderson has been bothered by a sore left foot
the past couple of weeks, but has remained in the lineup. An MRI
revealed no abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went into Tuesday's game leading the team in games
played (151), at-bats (599), runs (84), hits (180), total bases
(278) and doubles (34).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he does is undervalued,'' Angels interim manager
Joe Maddon said. ``He's somebody who answers the bell every day.
It's an undervalued asset. His arm gets sore, his leg gets sore,
but he plays through it. I think he's under-appreciated. He has a
certain gate about him sometimes, but he cares, he wants to win.
He's done a great job this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and A's play the second game of their three-game
series tonight at 7:35. Brian Cooper (1-1, 4.30 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Oakland's Omar Olivares (15-11, 4.08).

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHAT the Astros need right about now is Ben Crenshaw _ if not his
sweet swing, then some inspiring words.
</P>
<P>
   What once looked like a better team than the Reds, wasn't. What
once played like a better team than the Reds, didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Astros bats went dormant. Jose Lima found the rough. And Derek
Bell misread the green in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Bell thought the baseball would break to the left,
but really it rolled through his legs and broke the Astros' backs.
Somebody must have stepped on his line.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the span of one week an Astros division lead that once
was 3{ games has turned into the Astros suddenly finding themselves
one game behind the Reds with just four left. What once was a team
that could tear off 12-game winning streaks has turned into one
that has lost eight of its last 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the best thing we've got going for us is that the
Mets are playing as poorly as we are,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   That much is true, if not the kind of inspiring words that will
have Dierker answering to the name ``Knute'' any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of the Astros' 4-1 setback to the Reds on Tuesday night
was cushioned by the Mets' 9-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves. The
Mets' loss means the playoffs remain a possibility for the Astros
no matter how bad things get in their four remaining regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can back into the postseason as a wild-card entry if
they can stay ahead of the struggling Mets. Some might even say the
Astros would be better off earning the wild-card spot over the
division title, because it would mean they likely wouldn't have to
twice face Diamondbacks ace Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But something is wrong with this Astros picture.
</P>
<P>
   What once was considered a team of destiny, with Lima talking of
``angels'' in the clubhouse assuring postseason success, has become
stagnant and uninspired, to say nothing of uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle Ben even would rage if he saw what a Dome-record 54,037
fans saw Tuesday night. In a word, the crowd was spectacular. The
wild fans cheered every moment, chanted names, brought banners,
called out the Reds and gave the game a legitimate postseason
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   There was a prevalent feeling on this night it would be Lima
Time. There was a feeling Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Co.
somehow would find a way; that the Astros would put these upstart
Reds in their place, all right.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, after so much Pete Harnisch magic and
questionable Astros decisions on and off the field, maybe the
Astros put the Reds in their place.
</P>
<P>
   First place.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost in what led to the disappointing effort, you have to
look at the decision to start Bell in right field. Certainly, you
can understand why Dierker would want Bell in the lineup if Bell
was sharp and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are not Bell's biggest fan, you have to admit Bell
has seen plenty of big games and his defense in right field is as
good as the Astros can get.
</P>
<P>
   But why put him in the starting lineup on his first day back
from a rib-cage injury? Why start Bell in this critical game when
all he has had in terms of rehabilitation was a few swings in the
Instructional League?
</P>
<P>
   It was Bell's second-inning error in what was then a 1-1 game
that led to a pair of Reds runs and a 3-1 edge that Harnisch never
relinquished. One inning later, the Reds scored another run when
Lima, who was decent after a rocky first couple of innings, left
one too many pitches over the plate. Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee
singled and drove in Barry Larkin, who opened the inning with a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also grounded into a double play, ending all hopes of a
rally, after Ken Caminiti opened the fifth inning with a single and
got the crowd riled up. Bell finished 0-for-3, and the Astros never
had a chance, but don't blame just Bell or just a lineup that
mustered only four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker should _ and did _ share the blame for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them a couple of runs,'' he said. ``If it's a 2-1 game
(in the late innings), then maybe there are some things we could do
differently. As everyone could see, Derek didn't look like he was
ready to catch up to this kind of pitching. Probably, I shouldn't
have expected him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Astros, this poor effort was not the end of
the playoff chase. Tonight, with Mike Hampton on the hill, things
could turn around and this race could be all square again.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody call Gentle Ben.

 EXPERTS BARE HOSPITAL INFECTION HAZARDS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some of the hazards of health care were on
display Tuesday at a meeting here of medical experts, as
researchers discussed the latest findings on hospital-acquired
infections and the dangers of supposedly life-saving medical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Such infections have long been recognized as a huge, if
underappreciated, problem. The latest statistics show that about
200,000 to 400,000 people pick up some kind of infection in
hospitals every year, and 70,000 of the infections are fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual suspects of germ-laden catheters and unwashed
hands, doctors delved into some lesser-known risks Tuesday during
the annual scientific meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, which ends Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the menace of fake fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shelly McNeil and colleagues at the University of Michigan
decided to examine the problem after noticing that about 12 percent
of the university hospital's staff nurses were sporting trendy
acrylic nails, sometimes extending an inch or more beyond the ends
of their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary study showed that 73 percent of nurses who were
wearing the fake fingernails harbored harmful bacteria on their
hands, compared with just 32 percent of nurses without the acrylic
nails.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil then found that even rigorous hand washing did little to
rid the enhanced fingertips of potentially nasty bugs: Ninety-four
percent of those who had bacteria on their hands while wearing the
nails still had a pathogen present after hand washing.
</P>
<P>
   She recommended the hospital adopt an official policy to
``discourage'' acrylic nails, but she said this involved ``a huge
political issue'' that has yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing experts noted that the study looked at a relatively
small number of hands _ only 41 nurses were enrolled in the
Michigan study _ and did not determine whether any patients
actually contracted an infection at the hands of a nail-wearing
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken a stance on this,'' said Kay McVay,
president-elect of the California Nurses Association. ``One study
does not make it necessarily true or untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies showed risks seemingly lurking behind every corner
in the hospital. At Tuesday's conference, two long aisles full of
posted research summaries on so-called nosocomial, or
hospital-acquired, infections amounted to a health care chamber of
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli research team found that even after years of
education, only about 75 percent of staff washed their hands. In
the typical health care establishment, the compliance rate on hand
washing is an abysmal 40 percent or so.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Witt, head of infection control at Kaiser Permanente's
South San Francisco medical center, said keeping everything clean
is sometimes taken for granted even in the best-run facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of day-to-day, very mundane things, like getting
everyone to wash their hands, or showing people how to change
dressings right, how to use antibiotics wisely, isolating people
with drug-resistant infections,'' he said. ``It's a challenge. We
tend to annoy people. We're seen as neurotic sometimes. But the
fact is, infection control is an underrecognized issue in
determining quality of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being transferred from one hospital to another, or even
from one ward to another in the same facility, can be hazardous to
your health, according to research by a French team.
</P>
<P>
   Of 89 patients with infections who were investigated in that
study, 55 percent had been transferred from another ward or
hospital. The risk of infection in the transferred group was five
times that of patients who stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Another study found ``a serious problem'' of bacterial
infections caused by pacemakers, with little research to suggest
how to handle the problem. The study found 17 infections in 1,182
patients _ for a relatively high infection rate of about 1.2
percent. Experts concluded that the only effective way to cure such
infections is total removal of the pacing system.
</P>
<P>
   Medical-device makers are now coating some products with
anti-microbial compounds to eliminate the problem. But some devices
tend to be ignored as risk factors not worth doing anything about.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Dr. Eric Van Wijngaerden showed three infections for
every 1,000 patients receiving an arterial catheter, which unlike
venous catheters are not usually coated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant risk,'' he said. ``There are some novel
techniques that can be used to reduce this kind of risk, but it's
not being done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Technical skill can make a big difference in how effectively
infections are kept at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's biggest trauma center, for example, documented only
44 fungal infections in 21,267 patients examined over a four-year
period, a rate of just 0.2 percent. That compares with about 6
percent to 10 percent at most trauma units, said Dr. Manjari Joshi,
who presented the results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the low rate of trouble to rigorous cleanliness
and deliberate underuse of anti-infective agents, which can make
problems worse by breeding drug-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
   Another European study looked at whether infections were reduced
after a hematology ward was moved into a new facility operated
under strict isolation protocols, in which visitors had to wear
surgical caps and masks.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that infections were getting worse. Study authors
attributed the problems to a changeover to less-experienced
physicians, who were evidently taking longer to insert catheters.
That appeared to increase the chance of bacteria on the skin making
their way to deeper tissue, said the lead study author, Dr. J.L.
Nouwen.
</P>
<P>
   That supposition is still being investigated, but in the
meantime, the strict isolation of patients was dropped when it was
found that patients were being infected by bacteria they were
carrying on their own skin, not germs picked up from anyone else.

 BLOWING MAY BE BAD NEWS FOR YOUR NOSE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Blowing your nose during a cold may increase the
risk of sinus infections, doctors reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be the most elaborate analysis ever done on
the subject, top cold experts and a mechanical engineer at the
University of Virginia set out to find the source of infectious
agents discovered lurking in the usually sterile sinus cavities of
cold sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Results showed the average nose-blow produced far more pressure
inside the nose than did sneezing or coughing. The pressure was
more than enough to propel quantities of germ-laden mucus the
opposite direction intended _ into the inner recesses of the nose
where they could cause infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to find nose-blowing produced such
substantial intranasal pressure,'' said Dr. Birgit Winther, who
presented the results Tuesday at a scientific meeting of the
American Society for Microbiology in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A further check with CT scanning techniques confirmed the
movement of mucus into the sinuses. Still, the study authors
stopped short of recommending that millions of cold sufferers try
to avoid blowing their noses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen,'' conceded Dr. Jack Gwaltney. ``You
just can't expect someone with a cold is not going to blow his
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he recommended early treatment of colds with an
antihistamine and one or two tablets of over-the-counter-strength
ibuprofen in order to cut down on nasal secretions. But some
experts say that antihistamines can make matters worse once a cold
is in full swing by making mucus thicker and harder to clear.
</P>
<P>
   Further studies are needed to clear up the matter of which
nose-blowing techniques might pose the greatest risk. The Virginia
researchers did not attempt to distinguish one nose-blowing style
from another, although Gwaltney said the study has already toned
down his personal method of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blowing my nose much less vigorously lately,'' he
said.

 NOTHING TO LOSE BUT OUR CHAINS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These are the climes that fry men's soles.
</P>
<P>
   Women are smarter (stop the presses!); they put on sneakers for
the walk to work.
</P>
<P>
   When it gets this hot in San Francisco, it can mean only one
thing: Baseball season is over.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a warm morning Tuesday that I decided to stroll up
Market Street. Started at the Embarcadero, not far from the future
site of the 60-foot statue of Cupid's bow and arrow, to be sculpted
by Claes Oldenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Market Street is Java Junction, the world capital of
coffee stands. There is approximately one coffee-oriented retail
outlet for every person who works in the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Between First and Fifth, I passed four Starbucks, and I was
starting to worry that maybe the heat had gotten to me and I was
walking in circles.
</P>
<P>
   So I began dropping doughnut crumbs. Then I looked behind me and
saw that I had created a pigeon conga line.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, you know, has its own CDs, its own magazine, its own
language  &UR; (barista, grande),  &LR; maybe its own Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no Starbucks near where you work in the FiDi, call
'em, they'll come out and build one.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to San Franstarbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Starbucks. The only businesses that aren't
taken over by the chains are shoe-shining and prostitution,
although I later saw some hookers who are part of a corporate
entity.
</P>
<P>
   And soon we will be getting our shoes shined at Starshine (TM)
stands, by genial  &UR; buffistas. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS ONLY 10 o'clock, but already it was hot enough to make me
dizzy, especially considering the caffeine buzz and the sugar rush
from the doughnuts, and I was starting to feel like Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers quarterback has taken more hits than the lingerie Web
site of Willie Brown's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   We'll know Steve's in serious trouble, concussion-wise, when the
49ers center starts wearing a cue card on his rear end _
``Hut-hut!''
</P>
<P>
   Market Street is a sociological journey. As people walk up the
street, money leaks out of their pockets and they gradually sink
into despair and disrepair. Between Second and Sixth, their
pinstriped suits and jaunty walks become raggedy shirts and
defeated trudges.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you get past Seventh to U.N. Plaza, you can be
pretty sure that if anyone tries to sell you anything, it won't be
an IPO or a Frappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE PLAZA, I ran into a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam _ of
shopping carts. The next city crisis: A shortage of parking spaces
for shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the carts were piled amazingly high with a wild
assortment of objects (one had an electric fan, a child's toy,
magazines). The Plaza looked like a SFMOMA exhibit of cart art. Who
needs Oldenburg?
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of folks were relaxing in the shade of the plaza trees,
but don't tell the anti-homeless crusaders. They'll discover Dutch
elm disease in the poplars and show up at the plaza with chain
saws.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza's fountain had no water. What, the heat has sucked the
fountain dry?
</P>
<P>
   Dave, a worker from the DPW, told me the fountain pumps have
been busted for a long time, the water had become green and
stagnant, generally not a good thing, and the DWP was fixing it,
``So the homeless will have a place to cool off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the plaza, a flock of pigeons was dining on a buffet of
popcorn and bread. Starving people; stuffed pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeons might be a nuisance, but at least we don't have turkey
vultures like the ones that are plaguing Merced, pooping and
barfing on cars and people. What is that, a vulture fraternity?
</P>
<P>
   WALKING BACK down Market, I encountered a quartet of hookers
chatting among themselves on the traffic island at Jones St. They
didn't look like typical Tenderloin trollops, but rather like
Hollywood starlets dressed as hookers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what they were. A film crew was shooting a scene at the
corner and the girls were extras, relaxing between takes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Hollywood: Go to the city's hotbed of prostitution and
BYO hookers. Coulda hired the real thing at a fraction of the cost.

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   A home
without a library lacks diversity of voices, opinions and world
views. When you read a book, you enter another person's
perspective. And because a reader can put the book down and think
about what the author has said, a good reader enters a dialogue
with the author or the characters created by the author. One can
reread passages and linger over thoughts or ideas or savor the
deliciousness of the language.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television, even at its best, lacks diversity; lacks the ability
for a viewer to carry on an inner dialogue with the speakers or the
author of the program. Books encourage thinking. A reader must
create images from the words the author has supplied, must imagine
the events described, must track the plot or the logic of the
writer and must visualize the main characters in the mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The book is in your hands. You can return to passages if there
is something you don't understand. You can argue with the author in
your head; you can nod in agreement. You learn, unconsciously, the
way words can fit together _ sometimes so well that they seem
inevitable and irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The book is in your hands and so, too, is the right to read.
There are many in our nation who would restrict this right.

   A survey of 1,001 adults conducted in March for the First
Amendment Center in Nashville, Tenn., indicates that the free
speech and free press rights guaranteed by the Constitution are in
jeopardy. More than half of the survey respondents believe the
press has too much freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The press includes book publishers as well as newspapers. And
nearly one-third believe the First Amendment goes too far in the
rights it guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association set aside the week of Sept. 25
to Oct. 2 as Banned Book Week to remind us how precious this right
to read and the right to express our thoughts are to our society.
</P>
<P>
   Reading stimulates the mind to grow, to comprehend, to adapt, to
change attitudes, to question. Studies have shown copycat behavior
that can be blamed upon a book is rare, indeed, and can only come
from the most brutish level of reading. To read, the mind must be
active _ it translates words into emotions, into doubts, into a
walk alongside the author as a friendly companion who has his or
her own thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, sister and I grew up surrounded by my father's
library. My father was a military man with over 30-years service.
He was politically conservative, but socially progressive; and read
eclectically, favoring historical fiction as well as thoughtful
novels and actual histories.
</P>
<P>
   When I, as a young boy, asked him if I could read one of the
books in his library, his advice to me was: ``If you think you can
understand it or want to, then it's yours to read.'' That was good
advice then. It is now.
</P>
<P>
   The first book I read from my father's library was Erskine
Caldwell's ``God's Little Acre,'' and then Caldwell's ``Tobacco
Road.'' Both had been banned somewhere in the United States during
those years. John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' graced my
father's library shelves. I read it, too, while I was still in
junior high. ``Of Mice and Men'' continues to be one of the most
challenged and banned books in America _ and considered one of the
most beloved books by those who have actually read it.
</P>
<P>
   Only years later did I realize that a significant number of
those books my father allowed me to read before I had graduated
from high school had been banned in various states and educational
institutions: Thomas Wolfe's ``Of Time and the River,'' Aldous
Huxley's ``Brave New World,'' George Orwell's ``1984,'' Bram
Stoker's ``Dracula,'' Sinclair Lewis' ``Elmer Gantry,'' Mark
Twain's ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ``The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes,'' Ernest Hemingway's ``A Farewell to Arms'' and
``The Sun Also Rises,'' Walter Van Tilburg Clark's ``The Ox-Bow
Incident,'' Charles Dicken's ``Oliver Twist'' and Theodore
Dreiser's ``An American Tragedy.'' I tried to read all of Edward
Gibbon's ``The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire,`` but it was too tough for me at that stage of my life.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to think that any one educated in the United
States has not read most of these books and grown with the
readings.
</P>
<P>
   I read my first William Faulkner novel from my father's library,
``A Fable,'' and it began a lifelong love affair with Faulkner's
novels and his writing style _ more importantly, for me, it began
my own love affair with language. ``A Fable,'' an allegorical novel
about World War I, won the Pulitzer Prize. It wasn't banned, but
two of Faulkner's greatest works were _ ``As I Lay Dying'' and
``The Wild Palms.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the publisher Modern Library released a list it
entitled the ``100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.'' Nearly
one-third of those novels were banned at one time or another. Six
of the top 10 on the Modern Library list were threatened or removed
from bookstores, libraries and schools.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to celebrate our constitutional right to
read by reading a banned book. Give your child your favorite banned
book to read. Tell your child why you would miss the book that some
would ban forever. Visit your public library and check out a banned
book. It will be good for you.
</P>

Read Foundation Board, the litigating arm of the American Library
Association.)

   Not all fashion trends begin on the runway or on the street.
Sometimes they start on the movie screen, where a new look or
hairstyle can inspire millions of imitations. Hollywood's star
hairstylists are well aware of their power _ to keep it, they're
willing to put up with all sorts of problems that ordinary stylists
never have to face.
</P>
<P>
   Consider continuity. ``One Fine Day'' takes place over the
course of about 24 hours, but the filming took three months. Louis
Licari of the bicoastal Louis Licari Haircolor Group had to make
sure that Michelle Pfeiffer's hair was the same color throughout
the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tricky,'' says Licari. ``Most people's haircolor can
vary _ no matter how slightly _ with each visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger's upcoming film, ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' takes
place over the course of about 10 years, but it was shot in just a
few months. Jonathan Antin colorist Lorri Goddard racked up the
frequent flyer miles _ first to Africa, then to Italy _ every time
Basinger needed a different shade of blond.
</P>
<P>
   Period pieces come with their own unique hurdles. Jewel's very
contemporary 'do didn't fit into Ang Lee's upcoming Civil War
drama, ``Ride With the Devil,'' so hairstylist Jonathan Antin
straightened out the layers to make the style more '60s _ 1860s,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an actress must be drabbed down for a role. When Susan
Sarandon played the ailing ex-wife in ``Stepmom,'' Licari couldn't
wait for her copper color to tone down naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is called color removal, but we speed things along
using hot oil treatments,'' he explains. ``They help lift the
pigment faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant color changes can sometimes be too much for an actress
to bear. Ashley Judd was in tears when Candace, the colorist at
Beverly Hills' Sublime Salon, showed up on the set of ``Norma Jean
and Marilyn'' for an emergency fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her hair was supposed to be dark brown, but it was pink,''
recalls Candace. When someone goes from blond to brown, hair needs
to get a ``filler'' first to fill in the porous hair, so the darker
shade will take. Obviously someone had skipped this step with Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Licari has gone through a similar series of extreme color
changes with Cate Blanchett. After going dark brown for ``Oscar and
Lucinda'' and deep red for ``Elizabeth,'' Blanchett went very blond
for a film she was working on at the time of this year's Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get it progressively lighter,'' he says. ``It's
gentler on the hair if you have that luxury of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-time champion of color changes may be Helen Hunt. Since
she had to film ``As Good As It Gets'' simultaneously with her
sitcom ``Mad About You,'' she went from Carol Conelly drab to Jamie
Buchman blond ``practically every other day,'' remembers stylist
Darrell Redleaf-Fielder of Nubest &AMP; Co. ``I had to mix two shades
to cut through that golden blond hair. Then she'd wash the brown
out the next day. When I saw that movie for the first time, I
practically bit all my nails off.''
</P>
<P>
   A subtle color treatment may be crucial to making a character
believable, but it's a great new cut that can spark a big trend in
the real world _ and make a star out of its creator as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Bruce Paltrow went for his usual trim at
L.A.'s Prive Salon, he brought along his daughter, Gwyneth. Owner
Laurent started asking her about the character in her next film,
``Sliding Doors,'' and suggested a drastic cut. The next day,
Paltrow was back with then-boyfriend Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was more nervous than she was,'' laughs Laurent.
``But that haircut really changed my whole career. I was in every
magazine after that haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are very confident when undergoing a new look,'' says
John Freida hairstylist Sally Herschberger, who's responsible for
Meg Ryan's flopsy-mopsy hairstyle. ``They get it. They're excited
about the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, says L.A. salon owner Allen Edwards, actors'
motives are similar to those of salon clients everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real people are constantly reconsidering how they want to look
to those around them,'' he says. ``How different is that from what
actors and stylists do for a role? We're all playing our own
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ours don't usually come with a rigid production
schedule. Then again, we don't have our own trailers, either.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An increasing number of elite athletes seem to be
spending almost as much time designing the clothes they wear as
performing in them.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in a market that traditionally builds brands _ not
high-profile designers _ activewear makers like Reebok are trying
to personalize their images by having the athletes they sponsor
help out with design.
</P>
<P>
   From choosing fabrics to sketching items, the athletes are
taking a hands-on approach to product development instead of merely
assessing new products.
</P>
<P>
   Take Olympic snowboarder Shannon Dunn, who designed Burton's new
``Feel Good'' snowboards and is now working on designs for the
brand's first streetwear collection, or tennis star Venus Williams,
who talks about design in Reebok's current radio campaign. Or
Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, who chose the lilac color and
tinted rhinestone butterfly motifs for her new signature skating
dress for Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   These women represent a new breed of athlete, someone who wants
to win, look good and help build business. They know a canned photo
of them smiling is not enough to sell T-shirts to media-savvy
teen-agers. The athletes, after all, are themselves part of the
very audience activewear makers want to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having athletes help with design gives brands more
credibility, and it shows they're not just using their athletes'
photos and signatures. It goes beyond name association; it's their
expertise as well,'' said Liz Livingstone, head designer for
Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   Known for competing in fashion-forward looks such as the gold
racerback tank dress she wore at this year's French Open, Anna
Kournikova, an Adidas-sponsored athlete, is ``definitely more
interested in the design process'' than she has been in the past,
said Simon Cartwright, international product manager for tennis at
Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer difficult to get her to schedule time for Adidas
designers. She's now calling them, because ``she wants to have more
of a say in what she's wearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is an athlete's ability. But we live
in such a multimedia age where everything is visual and the average
attention span is about 30 seconds, you have to have an image to go
along with that ability. It's a necessary part of the industry,''
said Nate Brown, tennis product line manager for Adidas. ``They're
using athletics as a launching board to market themselves and their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Jordan is taking a closer look at the women's
activewear business. He is considering launching women's activewear
through his label at Nike next year instead of in 2001, a Nike
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   More hands-on than most athlete-designers, Jordan critiques a
full range of products with his name on them, selects colors and
fabrics, discusses fashion in general with Nike designers and hosts
fashion shows for his brand. At Jordan's request, designers for his
brand have been flown to Chicago to check out his newest car and
his closet for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Capezio's skating dress for Lipinski has a certificate with the
Olympic gold medal winner's autograph and photograph. To build
brand awareness, Capezio is offering only 150 units of the item,
which retails for $300, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski selected the design from 12 that were presented to her,
and she also chose the double-strap-camisole silhouette,
Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara's an Olympic medalist. But there's value in that beyond
what she has accomplished as a skater. Her (design) knowledge is
steep,'' she said. ``Skaters have always been very resourceful
about what they wear. We can glean some knowledge about how some of
her other dresses were made and what materials were used to try to
perfect what we're doing. It helps us make more of a custom-made
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ongoing ``Skate With the Stars'' 10-city tour,
Lipinski has been sharing her design insight with young skaters.
Capezio will introduce another signature dress for Lipinski next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike this year's print ad campaign for Capezio, which includes
several models in addition to Lipinski, next year's campaign will
focus solely on the figure skater, Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Olympic figure skater, Kristi Yamaguchi, routinely
offers fashion tips to Celanese executives, a company spokeswoman
said. Last year Yamaguchi arranged to have some of the pro skaters
on the ``Stars on Ice'' tour perform in acetate-blend outfits, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus William helped Reebok designers develop seven outfits for
this month's tennis U.S. Open _ one for each round. Williams plans
to take her first fashion design course this fall and aims to work
in design professionally, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for us that Venus is so involved. It makes our
marketing efforts that much easier. She feels very comfortable
wearing the product and she played a part in creating it,'' Hayes
said. ``It's a two-way street. It's important for an athlete to
care about the growth and success of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' younger sister, Serena, who seized the United States
Open singles championship on Sept. 11, is also interested in
design. Serena, who has an endorsement deal with Puma, helped Puma
designers update their tenniswear with snugger silhouettes and more
color. She is also interested in bridal design.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena may have a strong future together in the
fashion business. They certainly work well with each other, having
recently won the women's double final. They are the first sisters
to win an Open doubles championship in 101 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike set up its first athlete advisory council _ 20 athletes
from various sports _ to help with product development of Inner
Actives, performance-oriented innerwear that bowed at retail this
summer. The feedback was ``so valuable'' that the company plans to
organize other advisory councils for other categories, said Carey
Portzline, senior apparel designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cared a lot about it because it was something they were
dissatisfied with,'' she said. ``As one athlete said, `This was a
piece of equipment for them.'''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Nike-sponsored U.S. women's soccer team readily
offers product feedback about product, said Julia Meschter, senior
product designer. They're more approachable and critical about
products than some of the male athletes who sponsor Nike, she
added. &QL;

   From choosing fabrics to sketching items, the athletes are
taking a hands-on approach to product development instead of merely
assessing new products.
</P>
<P>
   Take Olympic snowboarder Shannon Dunn, who designed Burton's new
``Feel Good'' snowboards and is now working on designs for the
brand's first streetwear collection, or tennis star Venus Williams,
who talks about design in Reebok's current radio campaign. Or
Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, who chose the lilac color and
tinted rhinestone butterfly motifs for her new signature skating
dress for Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   These women represent a new breed of athlete, someone who wants
to win, look good and help build business. They know a canned photo
of them smiling is not enough to sell T-shirts to media-savvy
teen-agers. The athletes, after all, are themselves part of the
very audience activewear makers want to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having athletes help with design gives brands more
credibility, and it shows they're not just using their athletes'
photos and signatures. It goes beyond name association; it's their
expertise as well,'' said Liz Livingstone, head designer for
Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   Known for competing in fashion-forward looks such as the gold
racerback tank dress she wore at this year's French Open, Anna
Kournikova, an Adidas-sponsored athlete, is ``definitely more
interested in the design process'' than she has been in the past,
said Simon Cartwright, international product manager for tennis at
Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer difficult to get her to schedule time for Adidas
designers. She's now calling them, because ``she wants to have more
of a say in what she's wearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is an athlete's ability. But we live
in such a multimedia age where everything is visual and the average
attention span is about 30 seconds, you have to have an image to go
along with that ability. It's a necessary part of the industry,''
said Nate Brown, tennis product line manager for Adidas. ``They're
using athletics as a launching board to market themselves and their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Jordan is taking a closer look at the women's
activewear business. He is considering launching women's activewear
through his label at Nike next year instead of in 2001, a Nike
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   More hands-on than most athlete-designers, Jordan critiques a
full range of products with his name on them, selects colors and
fabrics, discusses fashion in general with Nike designers and hosts
fashion shows for his brand. At Jordan's request, designers for his
brand have been flown to Chicago to check out his newest car and
his closet for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Capezio's skating dress for Lipinski has a certificate with the
Olympic gold medal winner's autograph and photograph. To build
brand awareness, Capezio is offering only 150 units of the item,
which retails for $300, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski selected the design from 12 that were presented to her,
and she also chose the double-strap-camisole silhouette,
Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara's an Olympic medalist. But there's value in that beyond
what she has accomplished as a skater. Her (design) knowledge is
steep,'' she said. ``Skaters have always been very resourceful
about what they wear. We can glean some knowledge about how some of
her other dresses were made and what materials were used to try to
perfect what we're doing. It helps us make more of a custom-made
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ongoing ``Skate With the Stars'' 10-city tour,
Lipinski has been sharing her design insight with young skaters.
Capezio will introduce another signature dress for Lipinski next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike this year's print ad campaign for Capezio, which includes
several models in addition to Lipinski, next year's campaign will
focus solely on the figure skater, Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Olympic figure skater, Kristi Yamaguchi, routinely
offers fashion tips to Celanese executives, a company spokeswoman
said. Last year Yamaguchi arranged to have some of the pro skaters
on the ``Stars on Ice'' tour perform in acetate-blend outfits, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus William helped Reebok designers develop seven outfits for
this month's tennis U.S. Open _ one for each round. Williams plans
to take her first fashion design course this fall and aims to work
in design professionally, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for us that Venus is so involved. It makes our
marketing efforts that much easier. She feels very comfortable
wearing the product and she played a part in creating it,'' Hayes
said. ``It's a two-way street. It's important for an athlete to
care about the growth and success of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' younger sister, Serena, who seized the United States
Open singles championship on Sept. 11, is also interested in
design. Serena, who has an endorsement deal with Puma, helped Puma
designers update their tenniswear with snugger silhouettes and more
color. She is also interested in bridal design.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena may have a strong future together in the
fashion business. They certainly work well with each other, having
recently won the women's double final. They are the first sisters
to win an Open doubles championship in 101 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike set up its first athlete advisory council _ 20 athletes
from various sports _ to help with product development of Inner
Actives, performance-oriented innerwear that bowed at retail this
summer. The feedback was ``so valuable'' that the company plans to
organize other advisory councils for other categories, said Carey
Portzline, senior apparel designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cared a lot about it because it was something they were
dissatisfied with,'' she said. ``As one athlete said, `This was a
piece of equipment for them.'''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Nike-sponsored U.S. women's soccer team readily
offers product feedback about product, said Julia Meschter, senior
product designer. They're more approachable and critical about
products than some of the male athletes who sponsor Nike, she
added. &QL;

<P>
   In an instant, your body betrays you. You feel you are floating,
but you are dropping, powerless, to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mrs. Moy in vehement Cantonese, described the most
unsettling sensation of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hooked up to cardiac, blood pressure and oxygenation
monitors, with an external pacemaker's oversize pads gummed to her
chest, she felt safe. But she refused to sit up, much less walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she gestured. ``Dizzy ... so dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been sent from her cardiologist's office, the first stop
after a fainting episode at home. His note read, ``67 y.o. with
syncope and bradycardia. Diagnosis: Sick sinus syndrome. Admit for
pacemaker insertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Syncope means faint, and bradycardia means slow heart rate. Sick
sinus syndrome is a grab-all diagnosis that implies the heart's own
pacemaker can't keep time because of disease or old age.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the United States in the late 1990s, where
bradycardia is more likely to be inflicted by a doctor than nature.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have unleashed a swarm of cardiovascular drugs,
each one touted better and more potent than the last.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room at New York University Downtown Hospital sees
medication-induced bradycardia so often that young doctors in
training aren't allowed to think the words sick sinus syndrome
until they first hunt down every drug a patient is taking.
</P>
<P>
   On the overhead monitor, Mrs. Moy's heartbeat trudged along in
the mid-30s; 60 to 100 is normal. Her P-waves, the small blips made
when the sinus node fires, had disappeared; a natural backup
pacemaker, nestled at the junction of the atria and the ventricles,
had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   But when this backup timer takes over, the rate is slow and
fixed, it won't speed up to compensate for low blood pressure. And
Mrs. Moy's was now ominously low.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous case histories take time. Faced with dangerous
bradycardia, doctors want to fix everything in a hurry, before
whatever is slowing the pulse stops it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution is a pacemaker. External pacemakers are
wide electrode pads gummed to the skin of the chest. They prod
nerves to fire and contract the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   But getting zapped 60 times a minute is uncomfortable and
unreliable _ often the heart stops responding.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary internal pacemakers can work, but a wire must be
threaded through the jugular vein in the neck or the subclavian
vein under the collarbone all the way into the right ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a half milligram of atropine. The drug would speed up
Mrs. Moy's heart by blocking the vagus nerve, which normally holds
the pacemaker in check. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lisa, my fellow attending physician who is
Chinese-American, talked with Mrs. Moy's daughter about her
mother's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter dug a scrap of paper out of her purse. Lisa showed
it to me: ``Posicor. Her cardiologist started her on it nine days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Posicor is a calcium channel blocker,'' said Peter, our
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started it nine days ago,'' I mused. ``At 100 milligrams,
the highest dose, and she's a small woman. What's causing her
bradycardia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium channel blocker toxicity?'' Peter ventured.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers slow the flow of calcium ions across
certain cell membranes. Some slow firing by pacemaker cells and
weaken heart contractions; others reduce blood pressure by dilating
narrowed blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But all calcium channel blockers can slow the heart's pacemaker,
and that is how Mrs. Moy got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote, neatly enough, is calcium.
</P>
<P>
   We injected an ampoule of calcium. Mrs. Moy's heart rate came up
slightly. Ten minutes later we gave her another. At that point, her
blood pressure rose and her P-waves reappeared, indicating the
pacemaker cells had come out from under the Posicor. But her heart
rate wouldn't budge above 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does she feel?'' I asked Mrs. Moy's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of Cantonese, she said, ``Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The calcium, however, was only a short-term solution. We could
give one or two shots a day to keep her heart steady until the
Posicor cleared from her system.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had enough experience with Posicor to predict how many
days that would take, so it would be tempting to install a
permanent pacemaker. But only a month ago I'd seen a pacemaker put
into an elderly woman with a sluggish heart. The next day her heart
was ticking merrily to its natural pacemaker; her beta-blocker
medication had worn off
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dream of putting a pacemaker in this woman,'' I
badgered the admitting resident. ``Posicor has a half-life of over
</P>
<P>
   24 hours. You won't know whether it's her or the drug for at
least five days.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, Mrs. Moy's heart rate still hovered in the
50s. Her cardiologist was antsy. The coronary-care unit costs
$1,000 a day, an expensive way to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's resident, who had also suspected Posicor, was now
drifting into the sick-sinus-syndrome camp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mrs. Moy's room, the daughter was resigned: ``She's
still scared. She'll feel better with the pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the Posicor,'' I said, ``but the decision
is up to her cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped by the next day, the telltale pacer spikes,
unlike any natural electrocardiogram wave, blipped on Mrs. Moy's
monitor. She'd gotten her pacemaker. But most of the beats were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers have a demand mechanism that waits for a normal
heartbeat; they only fire in its absence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moy looked relieved. She thanked me, little knowing I had
</P>
<P>
   opposed her magic cure to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, I consoled myself, the pacemaker was a $10,000 to
$15,000 placebo: Now she would step out of her house energetic and
unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the New York Times ran an article, ``Heart Drug
Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal.'' Dozens of reports
about serious side effects, including ``dangerously low heart
rate,'' had prompted the FDA to withdraw Posicor from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The critical-care resident found me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' he admitted graciously. ``That was nasty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I shrugged. ``Lots more miracle drugs where
that came from. Someday you'll get to play the old skeptic too.''

   &UR; GOOD-BYE DOLLY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the circus procession of cloned sheep, cows, mice and
goats in the past couple years, humans seemed likely to join the
list soon. Now this sobering news: A cloned calf in France dropped
dead seven weeks after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The calf appeared healthy until days before her death. She then
developed severe anemia and collapsed. An autopsy revealed a
withered thymus gland, where white blood cells mature, suggesting
that her immune system never started working.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Renard of the National Institute for Agronomic
Research in Jouy-en-Josas, who cloned her, thinks a defective donor
cell might be at fault. He points out that the cloning process can
work fine _ other clones produced with his technique are thriving _
but concedes that 30 percent to 50 percent of cloned calves die
shortly before and immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to apply this technique outside of research,''
Renard says, ``such a high rate of abortion and mortality will not
be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure is actually the norm in the cloning business. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii has had perhaps the
greatest success, producing five generations of cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he created the first male clone, also a mouse. Yet
Yanagimachi and his team had to transplant 274 embryos just to
produce three live male mice, two of which died almost immediately.
That's not much of an improvement over the 276 failures that
preceded Dolly the sheep, the first mammal clone.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of trouble. The cloned mice were born with
mild breathing problems. More disturbing is that Dolly's
chromosomes are worn down at the edges, possibly showing signs of
premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if she will die early. For now, she appears
healthy and has given birth to four lambs, also doing fine. But
Margaret Mellon of the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned
Scientists warns: ``There are many things that could be seriously
wrong with her that would be very difficult to detect.''

   In their quest for kinder cutting, physicians increasingly rely
on endoscopic surgery, replacing large scalpels and clamps with
cameras and flexible tools that snake into the body through tiny
holes. The technique is far less traumatic for patients but
exhausting for the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I asked you to pick up a noodle from a plate,'' says
engineer Sunil Singh, ``but I put the plate inside a box with two
holes on top and asked you not just to go in and pick it up but to
cut and stitch it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Singh and his colleague John Wen of Endobotics and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed Endobot, a robot that
can take over much of the mundane stitching and slicing during
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot features two movable arms that have interchangeable
tools attached. Once the arms are in position, the surgeon flicks a
switch _ or in a future version, barks out an order _ and the tools
begin to cut, grasp, suture or drill. Those procedures are perfect
for hernia repair, gallstone removal and one day even heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our technology, the robot can synchronize its motion with
the heart and suture it while it's beating,'' Singh says.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot is expected to be used on humans in clinical trials this
fall.

 &UR; ASTEROIDS AMOK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all natural hazards facing us, an asteroid impact is
potentially the deadliest, and the most unpredictable. The latest
news is not heartening. Wyn Evans has discovered an asteroid belt
hovering just a few million miles beyond Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Most asteroids circle the sun in a wide band between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, but some nestle in zones of stability in the
outer solar system. Evans, a physicist at Oxford, wanted to see if
similar pockets of small asteroids could exist closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mathematical simulation running on 20 desktop computers,
he looked at the fates of imaginary objects plopped in orbits
between the sun and Mars. Gravity from a passing planet usually
swept the body from the solar system. But Evans found that
asteroids could survive for billions of years in orbits some 8
million to 30 million miles outside the orbit of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Evans thinks there may be as many as 1,000 asteroids in this
near-Earth asteroid belt. He has already identified three
candidates. Although they generally stay in place, these objects
will occasionally get knocked loose by the gravity of Earth and
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some danger,'' Evans says, ``because there are ways
to eject objects out of the belt. But any Earth-crossing asteroid
is potentially dangerous no matter where it came from.''
</P>

 &UR; BABY BIG BANGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least once a day, a brilliant flash of gamma rays appears
from a random direction. After a three-decade hunt, astronomers may
have tracked down the sources of these blasts of energetic,
invisible radiation. A pair of gas clouds in a nearby galaxy
appears to be the tortured remains of two ancient gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wang, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, was
studying images of the Pinwheel galaxy, or M101, when he noticed
the two unusual objects. They looked like the remains of
supernovas, rare and powerful stellar explosions, but were far too
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Wang believes he has spotted the aftermath of hypernovas,
theoretical events in which dying stars blow off their outer layers
and collapse into black holes. They may be the fiercest blasts
since the beginning of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   When gamma-ray bursts were first detected by military satellites
in the 1960s, nobody knew where they came from. Scientists have
since deduced that they occur in the most distant corners of the
cosmos and have wondered what could possibly power them. Hypernovas
could do the trick. These explosions probably occur among young,
massive stars, so gamma-ray bursts may contain a hidden message
about how galaxies evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the distribution of gamma-ray bursts, we may be able to
infer the history of star formation in the universe,'' Wang says.

   &UR; GOOD-BYE DOLLY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the circus procession of cloned sheep, cows, mice and
goats in the past couple years, humans seemed likely to join the
list soon. Now this sobering news: A cloned calf in France dropped
dead seven weeks after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The calf appeared healthy until days before her death. She then
developed severe anemia and collapsed. An autopsy revealed a
withered thymus gland, where white blood cells mature, suggesting
that her immune system never started working.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Renard of the National Institute for Agronomic
Research in Jouy-en-Josas, who cloned her, thinks a defective donor
cell might be at fault. He points out that the cloning process can
work fine _ other clones produced with his technique are thriving _
but concedes that 30 percent to 50 percent of cloned calves die
shortly before and immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to apply this technique outside of research,''
Renard says, ``such a high rate of abortion and mortality will not
be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure is actually the norm in the cloning business. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii has had perhaps the
greatest success, producing five generations of cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he created the first male clone, also a mouse. Yet
Yanagimachi and his team had to transplant 274 embryos just to
produce three live male mice, two of which died almost immediately.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Take your shoes off and set a
spell
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Friends in Bryan-College Station, Texas, were
telling me about a young couple from there who recently moved to
Lufkin. It seems they're having their problems adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   Do tell?
</P>
<P>
   I was born here 58 1/2 years ago. I'm still having trouble
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   What it was for them, they ate out at one of our finer diners
recently and were surprised to see people at the next table who
weren't wearing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the young couple had failed to note the sign at the
door of the restaurant:
</P>
<P>
   ``No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we're laid-back hereabouts, even by backwoods standards.
</P>
<P>
   Our city motto reflects as much. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're gonna live in Lufkin, get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, I personally find it a sad commentary on our community
when someone from that citadel of sophistication, Bryan-College
Station, home of the Texas Aggies, would find Lufkin somehow
lacking in couth.
</P>
<P>
   People everywhere have heard of the Aggies, even though they may
have a hard time believing what they've heard.
</P>
<P>
   One quick example: When Texas A&AMP;M installed artificial turf at
its football stadium, Aggie engineers couldn't figure out why it
had cost $100,000 more than a similar field at the University of
Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   UT engineers, called in as consultants, spotted the difference
right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours,'' they explained to their A&AMP;M cohorts, ``didn't include
a sprinkler system.''
</P>
<P>
   But my purpose here isn't to tell Aggie jokes. It just so
happens that my oldest daughter is an Aggie grad, and that's no
joke. Leastwise, I'm not laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'll tell you a Lufkin story _ not a joke, but true and
correct.
</P>
<P>
   This was some years ago when I was still editor of the Lufkin
Daily News. Back then, perhaps more than now, the paper ran
pictures of dead things.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly during deer season, we ran pictures of dead deer _ almost
always with their tongues hanging out _ along with the proud
hunter. Sometimes the hunter's tongue would be hanging out, too,
but not always.
</P>
<P>
   In season and out, we printed pictures of other dead trophies as
well.
</P>
<P>
   I remember when a couple of fellows brought in the last black
bear ever killed in East Texas, shot while trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind they had no bear hunting license. It made no
difference to them, hunters that they were. It sure didn't make any
difference to the bear.
</P>
<P>
   But my best story is about the old boy who brought in a couple
of wolves he'd killed, loaded up in the bed of his pickup truck. I
still have that picture. The look on his face tells you how proud
he was of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad I didn't see the picture before it ran in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't take notice of it until the next day when I heard that
the fellow's neighbor was angry at the newspaper about the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he want to be in the picture, too?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, heavens, no,'' I was told. ``Them was his two German
shepherd dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes will happen in the newspaper, but I always thought that
was one we could have avoided. The flea collars should have tipped
us off.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, we try our best to make our newcomers feel at home.
They're always easy to recognize. They're the ones wearing shoes.

   IS LIGHTER SKIN AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY? Being a mestiza can be
a mixed blessing, writes Sabrina Margarita Alcantara-Tan, a
Pilipino American, in this article from A. magazine. Many Pilipinos
look on her paler complexion with envy, believing that it makes it
easier to assimilate into American society and to land a job. In
fact, her mother even encouraged her to marry a white man,
suggesting it would be ``easier on the children.'' On the other
hand, some fellow Pilipinos treat her as if she were ignorant of
her country's language and heritage, or even deny that she is a
``real Pilipina.''

<P>
   RACIAL FAVORITISM CAN LINGER ON AND ON _ EVEN IF YOU'RE BLACK.
Cheering on Serena Williams as she won the U.S. Open this summer,
Vernon Jarrett was conflicted. Was it racist for him to root for
Serena just because she was black, like him? The match meant so
much to him and other blacks that on the occasion of his son's
wedding they were sitting in front of the television urging her on.
In this column Jarrett recalls sports heroes of the past such as
Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson and how much their achievements meant
to him and other black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LATINO BOYCOTT, NOT A GOOD TACTIC. When the television networks
announced their new fall schedule, Latino characters and Latino
actors were nonexistent in the 26 new shows. Latino activists and
commentators were startled at the absence of characters and
immediately complained to the networks and were ignored. A caucus
of Latino organizations is currently boycotting network television.
Boycotts by themselves are worthless unless coupled with economic
punishment. Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on the boycott and what
he feels is a better tactic.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TIME TO EXHIBIT TRUE CHRISTIAN COURAGE. When the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, of recent Teletubby fame, has dinner next month with 200
gay people and their allies in his hometown, one topic of
conversation wills be anti-gay violence. Columnist Chuck Colbert
thinks that's a great idea and holds ``the potential for stemming a
shameful trend: ugly inflammatory rhetoric, leading to violent even
deadly action against people perceived to be gay, lesbian and
transgendered.'' The celebrated October dinner party came about
through the efforts of the Rev. Mel White, who used to be Falwell's
ghost writer. ``Mel sincerely wants to lower the rhetoric on both
sides. That is exactly what we want,'' Falwell told his hometown
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A DRY WHITE EMMY SEASON. At the Emmy awards, two weeks ago,
several nominees, presenters and winners criticized the new TV
season, which has been dubbed ``a dry white season.'' Of the 26 new
series on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, only NBC's ``Third Watch''
features people of color in lead roles. The lack of actors of color
is a perennial problem. It should come as no surprise, then, that a
national coalition of Latino groups is calling for viewers to
boycott the networks from Sept. 12 through Sept. 26. ``It is time
for us all to diversify our lives. If television does not then
reflect that diversity, writers, producers, directors and actors
must try again. The industry and the actors need to start taking
action,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa.

   IT'S TIME TO EXHIBIT TRUE CHRISTIAN COURAGE. When the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, of recent Teletubby fame, has dinner next month with 200
gay people and their allies in his hometown, one topic of
conversation wills be anti-gay violence. Columnist Chuck Colbert
thinks that's a great idea and holds ``the potential for stemming a
shameful trend: ugly inflammatory rhetoric, leading to violent even
deadly action against people perceived to be gay, lesbian and
transgendered.'' The celebrated October dinner party came about
through the efforts of the Rev. Mel White, who used to be Falwell's
ghost writer. ``Mel sincerely wants to lower the rhetoric on both
sides. That is exactly what we want,'' Falwell told his hometown
newspaper.

   A DRY WHITE EMMY SEASON. At the Emmy awards, two weeks ago,
several nominees, presenters and winners criticized the new TV
season, which has been dubbed ``a dry white season.'' Of the 26 new
series on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, only NBC's ``Third Watch''
features people of color in lead roles. The lack of actors of color
is a perennial problem. It should come as no surprise, then, that a
national coalition of Latino groups is calling for viewers to
boycott the networks from Sept. 12 through Sept. 26. ``It is time
for us all to diversify our lives. If television does not then
reflect that diversity, writers, producers, directors and actors
must try again. The industry and the actors need to start taking
action,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa.

   IS LIGHTER SKIN AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY? Being a mestiza can be
a mixed blessing, writes Sabrina Margarita Alcantara-Tan, a
Pilipino American, in this article from A. magazine. Many Pilipinos
look on her paler complexion with envy, believing that it makes it
easier to assimilate into American society and to land a job. In
fact, her mother even encouraged her to marry a white man,
suggesting it would be ``easier on the children.'' On the other
hand, some fellow Pilipinos treat her as if she were ignorant of
her country's language and heritage, or even deny that she is a
``real Pilipina.''

   RACIAL FAVORITISM CAN LINGER ON AND ON _ EVEN IF YOU'RE BLACK.
Cheering on Serena Williams as she won the U.S. Open this summer,
Vernon Jarrett was conflicted. Was it racist for him to root for
Serena just because she was black, like him? The match meant so
much to him and other blacks that on the occasion of his son's
wedding they were sitting in front of the television urging her on.
In this column Jarrett recalls sports heroes of the past such as
Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson and how much their achievements meant
to him and other black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LATINO BOYCOTT, NOT A GOOD TACTIC. When the television networks
announced their new fall schedule, Latino characters and Latino
actors were nonexistent in the 26 new shows. Latino activists and
commentators were startled at the absence of characters and
immediately complained to the networks and were ignored. A caucus
of Latino organizations is currently boycotting network television.
Boycotts by themselves are worthless unless coupled with economic
punishment. Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on the boycott and what
he feels is a better tactic.

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Bolton Landing, N.Y.) _ I was at the annual

the conference building to pick up my bag of complimentary gifts
such as corporate golf shirts and pens and God knows what other

dressed in a white robe and wearing a halo, popped up on my right

 &HT;    The view of reality is magnet
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I shouldn't even let myself (ITAL) think (END ITAL) about
getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those infatuations where you can see the end miles
ahead of you, and it can only end one way: tears, recriminations,
abandonment. I know. It has always ended this way before.
</P>
<P>
   Dare I hope this time might be different?
</P>
<P>
   After ``Northern Exposure,'' I vowed, never, ever to get
involved with a television show again. For once, I had fallen in
love with a hit show _ not one of those one- or two-season wonders,
``Homefront'' and ``My So-Called Life'' _ and still I had been
deserted with little warning.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I would flirt with commitment, but only flirt. At the
first sign of emotional engagement, I'd be outta there, proving how
easily I could live without that cad, television.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time in recent years I have entertained a mild
crush, more manufactured than real, as crushes tend to be. There
was the occasional Tuesday night dalliance with the amusing ``Spin
City,'' or the Monday night date with ``Chicago Hope,'' which
seduced me with a fabulous cast and good writing, but ultimately
turned me off with its unbelievable, over-the-top plot lines. (An
episode begins promisingly, for instance, with three women stranded
in a cabin during a storm, unsnarling knots in their friendship,
only to end with their killing an intruder. Yep, happens to me all
the time.)
</P>
<P>
   There was no longer anything on prime time TV that resembled my
life, any life I had ever lived, or any life anyone I knew had ever
lived.
</P>
<P>
   But one indolent evening early last season, that changed. After
watching ``Spin City,'' I tuned into ``Sports Night,'' a new series
about the lives and loves and impossible longings of the staff of
an ESPN-style nightly cable news show.
</P>
<P>
   Here were characters I recognize, situations that resonate. They
were more glamorous, true, with better bodies and hairstyles and
one-liners, but they reminded me of being young and working in a
newsroom. It could be any staff that is young, clever, ambitious,
simultaneously insecure and too-full-of-themselves. It could be any
group of young people consumed by both career and romance,
feverishly trying to sort out their personal and professional
lives.
</P>
<P>
   When I talked ``Sports Night'' up to my friends, it was a
naysayer, ironically, who hit on the show's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all about (ital) relationships, (END ITAL)'' he
groused. ``How realistic is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's not as realistic as shootouts in emergency rooms
or any of the other highly probable events you're likely to see on
prime time. Who wants to watch a show about relationships when you
could be watching court battles over who invented the face-bra?
</P>
<P>
   Silly me, to become wrapped up in the romantic intrigues of Dana
and Casey and Dana and Gordon and Dan and Rebecca and Dan and
Bobbie and Natalie and Jeremy. This week, the new season premieres
and forces a decision: Do I stay with these people or not? Last
time I let this happen, I became attached to the quirky yet utterly
believable populace of ``Northern Exposure's'' Cicely, Alaska. And
then they dumped me, without so much as a post card since.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'll tune in. With dialogue this good, characters
this real, I won't be able to resist a relationship with my TV this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I know, sure as Rhett knew Scarlett, it will all
come to a bad end.

 &HT;    Since 1776, Britain hasn't quit griping
 &HT;    EDs: Moving in (k) Commentary and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Is there any group outside of an elementary
school swing set who can whine as spectacularly and annoyingly as
the British? What a bunch of crybabies.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits, which conveniently rhymes with twits, got a major
itch in their tweeds when the Europeans hawked up a big one and
lost golf's Ryder Cup to the American team.
</P>
<P>
   What really soured the Brits' Earl Grey was the Americans
streaming prematurely onto the 17th green after Texan Justin
Leonard sewed up the match by making a 45-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   The British media got their noses out of joint because the
Americans _ wives, caddies, fans _ ran onto the green before
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal could putt. Yes, the Americans pulled a
no-no in golf. They tramped all over Olazabal's putting line before
he'd had a chance to finish.
</P>
<P>
   But to hear the Brits howl about it, you would have thought the
Americans had mooned Buckingham Palace. Which is a pretty good idea
because it would make for a great European vacation slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy of Ugly Victory Brings Out the Ugly American,'' said the
Guardian. ``Let us be painfully honest about it,'' wrote columnist
Matthew Norman in the London Evening Standard. ``Yes, (Americans)
are repulsive people, charmless, rude, cocky, mercenary, humorless,
ugly, full of nauseatingly fake religiosity, and as odious in
victory as they are unsporting in defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, mister, eat my easy-iron khakis. If it had been a British
sports demonstration, instead of screwing up his putt the British
would have trampled Olazabal like a June bug on the back porch.
Don't take my word for it. Follow any stampede in England and see
how often it breaks out into a football match.
</P>
<P>
   At least Americans don't stomp on one another unless there's a
good reason _ like a Beanie Babies sale at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the British are so upset is that they used to be big
_ back when having season tickets to weekend beheadings was a big
deal. Since then, the country has been largely irrelevant. The
British haven't had anybody who was worth a pack of tea bags since
Winston Churchill, except for those two TV cooking show loads, the
``Two Fat Ladies.'' And one of them just passed away, leaving
England one fat lady short of a full load.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the royal family. Is there a larger group of
deadbeats? Three words come to mind when I think of the queen of
England: GET A JOB. What does this broad do to rate such a big
house? I keep expecting the queen to show up with a cardboard sign
that says, ``Will wave for food.''
</P>
<P>
   They say there will always be an England. Why? Because someone
has to come in second. It's been a bad 200 years for the English.
In that time they have accomplished only two major invasions _ the
Beatles making it onto Ed Sullivan, then the taking of the Falkland
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Falklands. That's not the sort of achievement that makes you
want to rush into the streets shouting, ``We're number one,'' is
it?
</P>
<P>
   How are you going to make a T-shirt out of whipping the Falkland
Islands? What would it say on the front? ``We Kick Sheep Butt''?
That's not exactly bragging rights. And why do they call it Jolly
Old England anyway? Do they enjoy getting their fannies
paddled?John Kelso writes for the Austin American-Statesman,

 &HT;    Courting Pat Buchanan not worth Bush's time in White House race
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If Patrick Joseph Buchanan isn't a racist, fascist
and bigot, then he needs to stop imitating those traits.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush should reconsider his
request that Buchanan stay in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   People have to bend over backwards to make even the weakest
argument that Buchanan is a misunderstood patriot. If it looks like
a duck, quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck and has feathers,
it's a duck.
</P>
<P>
   For years _ decades _ Buchanan has carefully chosen his words
right up to the narrow edge or racism and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is intelligent enough to use his skills as a precise
writer and a gifted speaker to appeal to the worst instincts in
human nature and still give himself just enough room to deny the
obvious bigotry of his words.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger does not want Buchanan to attack him as as he
did Bush the elder. Bush also fears losing the votes Buchanan might
take with him if he leaves the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush should not stoop to cater to votes Buchanan might bring
to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a bigot's man through and through. He's made a
career appealing to white supremacists, anti-Semites, isolationists
and lock-and-load yahoos.
</P>
<P>
   The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. In this case, Pat
Buchanan says he was greatly influenced by his father, William
Baldwin Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan the elder was a devoted follower of the America First
Committee, a pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic, nativist and isolationist
movement. The elder Buchanan also admired fascist dictator
Francisco Franco of Spain and America's infamous red-baiter Sen.
Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Buchanan also has expressed admiration of fascist
dictator Franco and has described Hitler as ``an individual of
great courage ... extraordinary gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The man Bush doesn't want to leave the Republican Party is an
admirer of the ``Boer Republic'' and once applied to be ambassador
to South Africa's white racist government that routinely tortured
and murdered citizens of the ``wrong'' color.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wants to use immigration laws to block entry to the
sort of people who will water down the European white culture in
America. He has supported stationing U.S. troops across the
1,900-mile border with Mexico and referred to Mexican immigrants as
``Jose.'' At the same time, he has invited white people in Canada
to become U.S. citizens. He has said ``Englishmen'' will assimilate
better than ``Zulus.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Buchanan has supported Nazis accused of war crimes
while belittling Holocaust reports. He has called Congress
``Israeli-occupied territory.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who once referred to AIDS as ``nature's awful
retribution'' against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's campaign co-chairman in 1996 made repeated speeches
to neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a new book, Buchanan argues against going to war with
Spain, getting into World War I and believing that Hitler was a
threat to the United States. He even implies that the
Nazi-controlled government in France wasn't so bad and might have
been hunky-dory elsewhere as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should have taken his lead from Sen. John McCain, another
Republican presidential candidate. When told of Buchanan's latest
published demagoguery, McCain told Buchanan to take a hike and take
his tainted votes with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' should not include having
compassion for Hitler, anti-Semitism, racism and grotesque
intolerance in exchange for a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should show that as president, he would put principles over
politics. He should say adios to Buchanan.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Do hurricanes south of the Equator spin clockwise, and if so,
why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, they do. The Coriolis force (sometimes called the
Coriolis effect) is the reason. In 1835, French scientist
Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis determined that as air begins flowing from
high to low pressure, the Earth rotates under it, making the wind
follow a curved path. In the Southern Hemisphere, the wind turns to
the left of its direction of motion, but it's slightly overbalanced
by the pressure gradient force, which points toward the center of
the force. The result: Hurricane winds flow clockwise around a low.
It's just the opposite in the Northern Hemisphere, where the winds
flow into a low-pressure area in a counterclockwise direction.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, some people think the Coriolis effect explains what
makes the water in a sink or toilet rotate one way as it drains in
one hemisphere, the other way in the other hemisphere. Others argue
the Coriolis force is noticeable only for large-scale motions, such
as winds, and that other forces account for the drain effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of information can be found online at these sites:
www.sunynassau.edu/users/fanellis/oceanology/Coriolis.htm and
www.usatoday.com/weather/wcorioli.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems to me that rain from hurricanes would be salty,
since they pick up salt water after passing over oceans. Is that
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's likely that rain produced by hurricanes does contain
some degree of salinity, because they have drawn in droplets
whipped off the ocean surface. But hurricanes also draw in water
that has evaporated off the ocean, diluting any salinity that might
be present. Also, once hurricanes leave the ocean and move over
land, the amount of salinity in the rain probably would decrease. A
spokesman at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said that, to
his knowledge, the salinity in rain resulting from a hurricane has
never been measured, so statistics are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The lighthouse on Cape Hatteras, N.C., was moved inland
recently. How did it do in the two hurricanes, Dennis and Floyd?
</P>
<P>
   A: It did just fine, said Paul Winegar of the National Park
Service. The tower's relocation, 2,900 feet inland from its
original location, was completed in July. It was a good thing, too,
Winegar said, because the original site ``got a lot of high
water.'' While Dennis dumped a lot of rain on Cape Hatteras, Floyd
wasn't as bad because it went to the west of the lighthouse and the
national park.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse's relighting ceremony, originally scheduled over
Labor Day weekend, was canceled because of storms. It's now
scheduled for Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the religions of the world with the most
adherents?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers in several sources vary and aren't up to date,
but they are the latest available and should give you an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Among Christian religions, World Book Encyclopedia (1999), lists
Roman Catholic followers at 1.04 billion; Protestant, 382 million;
and Orthodox, 173.6 million. Among non-Christian religions, it
lists Islam at 1.01 billion; Hinduism, 751.3 million; Buddhism, 334
million; Chinese folk religion (a system of beliefs including
Confucianism and Taoism), 141 million; Judaism, 12.9 million; and
Shintoism, 3.3 million. World Book notes that its figures are from
1993, and credits them to World Christian Encyclopedia and the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   World Almanac (1999) lists, among Christians, Roman Catholics
with 1.04 billion; Protestants, 391 million; and Orthodox, 223
million. Among non-Christians, it lists Muslims, 1.15 billion;
Hindus, 747 million; Buddhists, 353 million; Chinese folk religion,
363 million; Jews, 14.9 million; and Shintoists, 2.7 million. It
dates the statistics to mid-1997 and credits as its source the 1999
Encyclopedia Britannica Book of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of Records (1999) calls the Baha'i faith, with
about 6 million people, the ``biggest religion without any rites.''
World Almanac, meanwhile, indicates 7.67 million Baha'is, while
World Book Encyclopedia lists 5.5 million Baha'is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can kudzu be used for animal feed or for any other commercial
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cows, goats and other animals love it, says Wayne McLaurin,
horticulturist with the University of Georgia Extension Service.
Kudzu, a legume, is nutritious for cud-chewing animals, and letting
them eat it is one of the few ways to get rid of it. Kudzu has a
very large tuber underground that resprouts each year. When it's
eaten back, the tuber is weakened and eventually killed. It takes a
long time, McLaurin adds, but it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   While the tuber is used in commercial starch production in
Japan, other commercial uses are limited. Kudzu can't be baled, for
example, because it tangles up in the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson still
receive his multimillion-dollar salary, now that he is injured and
most likely out for the remainder of the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. His salary _ $32 million over five years _ is guaranteed
by contract. Falcons spokesman Aaron Salkin said there was a time
when teams used a split contract, paying one amount if the athlete
played the normal full schedule and another if placed on the
injured reserve, but that doesn't happen any more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is considered the richest person in the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Guinness Book of Records 1999 reports that Microsoft
Corp. chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is now No. 1, bumping the
Sultan of Brunei to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the states where all the Miss America winners
have come from, how many women were from each, and the years? It
seems like a lot have come from a few states.
</P>
<P>
   A: California crowns the Miss America sweepstakes with six
winners (1925, '41, '43, '46, '55, '83).
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Pennsylvania are next with five each: Ohio ('22, '23,
'38, '63, '72, '78; the same contestant won in '22 and '23); and
Pennsylvania ('24, '35, '36, '40, '54).
</P>
<P>
   Four states have had four: Illinois ('27, '69, '91, '98);
Michigan ('39, '61, '70, '88); Mississippi ('59, '60, '80, '86);
and Oklahoma ('26, '67, '81, '96).
</P>
<P>
   Five states have had three: Colorado ('56, '58, '74); Kansas
('66, '68, '97); Minnesota ('48, '77, '89); New York ('45, '76,
'84); Texas ('42, '71, '75).
</P>
<P>
   Eight states and the District of Columbia have had two: Alabama
('51, '95); Arizona ('49, '65); Arkansas ('64, '82); District of
Columbia ('21, '44); New Jersey ('37, '84); South Carolina ('57,
'94); Tennessee ('47, '87); Utah ('52, '85); Virginia ('79, '99).
</P>
<P>
   And eight have had one: Connecticut ('33); Florida ('93);
Georgia ('53); Hawaii ('92); North Carolina ('62); Missouri ('90);
Wisconsin ('73).
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky got its first winner ('00) last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In an item about past Miss America winners from various
states, Q&AMP;A listed two for 1984, one from New York and the other
from New Jersey. How could that be?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original 1984 Miss America was Vanessa Williams,
representing New York. She relinquished her title July 23 of that
year when it was revealed that nude photographs of her would appear
in Penthouse magazine. It was the first time in the pageant's
history that a Miss America had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant officials in Atlantic City, N.J., immediately named
Suzette Charles, who as Miss New Jersey had been first runner-up,
as the new Miss America. She served out the remaining two months of
the 1984 reign.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now known professionally as Vanessa L. Williams, went
on to become a singing, dancing and acting star. Charles, who has
done some entertainment work and briefly hosted a TV show in
Atlanta in the early 1990s, married a doctor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The new Miss America was called the first Kentuckian to win
the title. But I remember that Venus Ramey of Stanford, Ky., won
the title years ago. What state did she represent, if not Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ramey, the 1944 Miss America, did indeed hail from Kentucky,
but won the title representing Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One more beauty queen question: Q&AMP;A reported that Heather
Renee French, the newly crowned Miss America, was the first
Kentuckian to win the title. I thought Phyllis George was first. Am
I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: George, from Denton, Texas, was Miss Texas before winning the
Miss America title in 1971. She became the first lady of Kentucky
when her husband, John Y. Brown Jr., was elected governor in 1979.
Brown made his fortune with Kentucky Fried Chicken. George later
went on to work in network TV news and sports, write two books, and
found By George, a food products company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu recently quoted
Mohandas Gandhi as saying something to the effect that politics
cannot be without conscience, science without humanity, wealth
without work. Can you give me the exact quote?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's from a list that the Indian nationalist leader
(1869-1948) once said caused all violence in human life: wealth
without work; pleasure without conscience; knowledge without
character; commerce without morality; science without humanity;
worship without sacrifice; politics without principle; and rights
without responsibilities. The list was publicized widely when it
was quoted at Hubert H. Humphrey's funeral by President Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bill Gates is pledging $1 billion for minority scholarships.
Can you define who are the qualifying minorities, and how one
applies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scholarships and fellowships will be available through the
Gates Millennium Scholars Program for 20 years, starting in the
fall of 2000, for outstanding low-income African-American, Native
American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American students. The United
Negro College Fund will administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   Students must be nominated by a high school principal or

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former President Jimmy Carter recently stated that he was one
of the last people to speak with Elvis Presley before he died. I
have never heard or read anything about this. Do you have any
details about this meeting?
</P>
<P>
   A: They didn't meet on that particular occasion. What Carter
told students at Emory University in Atlanta at a recent town hall
meeting was that he was one of the last people to speak with
Presley before the singer died on Aug. 16, 1977. The conversation
was by telephone, when Presley called Carter at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carter biographer Douglas Brinkley, Carter's White
House diary showed that the conversation took place between 5:18
and 5:24 p.m. June 14, 1977. Carter had met Presley previously,
backstage at the Omni in Atlanta, when Carter was governor of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone conversation took place during what was said to be
the ``roughest part'' of Presley's life. In the conversation,
Presley asked Carter to pardon a sheriff friend of his in Memphis
who was in trouble. Carter explained that a person who hadn't yet
been tried or convicted could not be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   After Presley died just two months later, Carter issued an
official White House statement. At the time, it was unheard of for
a president to make an official statement about a rock star's
death. Carter called the singer ``unique, irreplaceable and a
symbol the world over of the rebelliousness and good humor of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Mikhail Gorbachev and his late wife, Raisa, have any
children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, one. As reported after Raisa Gorbachev died of leukemia
Sept. 20, the couple had a daughter, Irina.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the Social Security Administration begin payroll
deductions from employers and employees? What was the percentage
rate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Act was signed by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt on Aug. 14, 1935. Taxes were collected for the first time
in January 1937. Between 1937 and 1949, the tax rate was 1 percent
each from employer and employee, said Social Security
Administration spokeswoman Patti Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard on numerous occasions about a secessionist
movement in Hawaii on the part of people there who think statehood
was a bad thing. Do you have any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a movement toward sovereignty among descendants of
native Hawaiians, but how significant in size and strength it is
remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 73 percent of Hawaiians who voted in the Native
Hawaiian Vote favored an election of delegates to propose a native
Hawaiian government. Last July 27, delegates of the Native Hawaiian
Convention began their next step toward self-determination, a
convention with 79 delegates whose plan _ with no specific
timetable _ was to develop a constitution on a form of native
Hawaiian government that then would have to be ratified by all
native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, such ratification is
a lofty goal, since only 41 percent of Hawaiians statewide
participated in the 1996 vote, while just 8.6 percent cast ballots
in an election of delegates last January. But a survey released
last month by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs stated that one-third
of all residents support the restoration of Hawaii as an
independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Some non-native Hawaiians, meanwhile, claim that the 1996
referendum discriminated against non-native Hawaiians and was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the overthrow on Jan. 17, 1893, of the Kingdom of
Hawaii, a fact that was recognized by U.S. Public Law 103-150, the
``apology resolution'' to native Hawaiians. It was passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton on Nov. 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sovereignty movement have established a Web
site _ www.hawaii-nation.org _ where more information on their
cause can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what has happened to Allan Nairn, the American
journalist detained by the Indonesian military? He gave an
interview by cell phone to ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' Sept.
14 and I haven't heard anything further.
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the few Western journalists to remain in Dili, East
Timor's provincial capital, in recent weeks, Nairn was arrested
Sept. 14, questioned by the Indonesian military, and deported. He
flew from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Singapore on Sept. 20, where he
told reporters that he hoped to return to East Timor as soon as
possible. Immigration officials in West Timor said Nairn had
entered the country illegally, listing on his visa that he was a
tourist, rather than saying he was a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was arrested and deported, Nairn, 43, of New Jersey,
had been interviewed by NPR's ``All Things Considered'' and had
described in detail the rampaging and terrorism he said he saw
being conducted by the Indonesian troops and their militia
auxiliaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nairn had been in trouble with Indonesian authorities before
with his reporting on Timor violence, including being banned from
Indonesia and occupied East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the recipients of this year's Kennedy Center Honors is
Sean Connery. Aren't they for American artists only?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The lifetime achievement awards are given to those who
have contributed ``a body of work in the United States,'' and
aren't restricted to U.S. citizens or people born in the United
States, said a Kennedy Center spokesman. Actor Connery, who was
born in Edinburgh, Scotland, is one of two honorees this year not
born in the United States; the other is comedian and pianist Victor
Borge, a native of Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of precedent. Since the honors were established
in 1978, other foreign-born honorees have included, in 1978,
pianist Arthur Rubenstein, who was born in Lodz, Poland; pianist
Rudolph Serkin, 1981, Eger, Bohemia; opera composer Gian Carlo
Menotti, 1984, Cadegliano, Italy; violinist Isaac Stern, also 1984,
Kreminiwez, Russia; cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,
1992, Baku, Azerbaijan; and conductor Georg Solti, 1993, Budapest,
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners this year are dancer Judith Jamison, actor Jason
Robards and musician Stevie Wonder. The awards will be presented
Dec. 4, followed by a gala performance the next day which will be
televised in late December.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I served on the escort carrier CVE 71, USS Kitkun Bay, in
World War II. Do you know its final disposition?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kitkun Bay (named after a body of water in Alaska), which was
launched Nov. 8, 1943, in Vancouver, Wash., was scrapped early in
1947 after an illustrious career in the Pacific. It suffered damage
in two incidents, with 17 total dead and 38 wounded. In addition to
the Presidential Unit Citation, Kitkun Bay earned six Battle Stars
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our youth group is trying to put on a safe trick-or-treat
carnival, and all of us grown-ups can't agree on what night
Halloween is observed when Oct. 31 falls on a Sunday. Some say it
never is on a Sunday, and others say it's always the last night of
October. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Halloween, the occasion for trick-or-treating, isn't a
holiday whose observance is established by law; it's a tradition.
And the tradition is that it is Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween developed from ancient new year festivals and
festivals of the dead. In the 800s, the Christian church
established All Saint's Day on Nov. 1 so people could continue an
observance they had celebrated before becoming Christians. The
evening before All Saint's Day became known as All Hallow's Eve, or
All Hallowe'en. The observance also is traced to the Celtic
festival of Samhain. The Celts' new year began on Nov. 1, with a
celebration beginning the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly those who don't want a trick-or-treat carnival to be
on a Sunday can stage it on another day. Some people, needless to
say, don't approve of it all, no matter the day or date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ken Bode was an excellent moderator for the PBS program
``Washington Week in Review,'' but he left the show earlier this
year without any explanation. What was the reason?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bode's five-year run as host of the venerable program came to
a sudden end in February because, he said, the new programming
chief of the PBS station that produces the program wanted to take
it in ``a different direction.'' He said he disagreed with changes
in the show pushed by Dalton Delan, a former cable programming
executive who had worked at HBO, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The New York Times, Bode was edged out in a
search for ``more edge and attitude'' by station executives at the
PBS Station. Sharon Percy Rockefeller, WETA-TV president, said
there was never any intention of diminishing or compromising the
program. She added that all 50 national programs produced by WETA,
including ``Washington Week in Review,'' are being analyzed at the
behest of the station's board.
</P>
<P>
   While Rockefeller said Bode was not forced out, adding that his
contract wasn't renewed ``in the way he wanted it to be,'' Bode
himself said this to The Chicago Tribune: ``I've never been fired
before. Journalists always have to quit on principle or be fired on
principle. I just don't know which one happened to me.'' Bode, by
the way, is dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Do hurricanes south of the Equator spin clockwise, and if so,
why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, they do. The Coriolis force (sometimes called the
Coriolis effect) is the reason. In 1835, French scientist
Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis determined that as air begins flowing from
high to low pressure, the Earth rotates under it, making the wind
follow a curved path. In the Southern Hemisphere, the wind turns to
the left of its direction of motion, but it's slightly overbalanced
by the pressure gradient force, which points toward the center of
the force. The result: Hurricane winds flow clockwise around a low.
It's just the opposite in the Northern Hemisphere, where the winds
flow into a low-pressure area in a counterclockwise direction.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, some people think the Coriolis effect explains what
makes the water in a sink or toilet rotate one way as it drains in
one hemisphere, the other way in the other hemisphere. Others argue
the Coriolis force is noticeable only for large-scale motions, such
as winds, and that other forces account for the drain effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of information can be found online at these sites:
www.sunynassau.edu/users/fanellis/oceanology/Coriolis.htm and
www.usatoday.com/weather/wcorioli.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems to me that rain from hurricanes would be salty,
since they pick up salt water after passing over oceans. Is that
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's likely that rain produced by hurricanes does contain
some degree of salinity, because they have drawn in droplets
whipped off the ocean surface. But hurricanes also draw in water
that has evaporated off the ocean, diluting any salinity that might
be present. Also, once hurricanes leave the ocean and move over
land, the amount of salinity in the rain probably would decrease. A
spokesman at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said that, to
his knowledge, the salinity in rain resulting from a hurricane has
never been measured, so statistics are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The lighthouse on Cape Hatteras, N.C., was moved inland
recently. How did it do in the two hurricanes, Dennis and Floyd?
</P>
<P>
   A: It did just fine, said Paul Winegar of the National Park
Service. The tower's relocation, 2,900 feet inland from its
original location, was completed in July. It was a good thing, too,
Winegar said, because the original site ``got a lot of high
water.'' While Dennis dumped a lot of rain on Cape Hatteras, Floyd
wasn't as bad because it went to the west of the lighthouse and the
national park.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse's relighting ceremony, originally scheduled over
Labor Day weekend, was canceled because of storms. It's now
scheduled for Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the religions of the world with the most
adherents?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers in several sources vary and aren't up to date,
but they are the latest available and should give you an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Among Christian religions, World Book Encyclopedia (1999), lists
Roman Catholic followers at 1.04 billion; Protestant, 382 million;
and Orthodox, 173.6 million. Among non-Christian religions, it
lists Islam at 1.01 billion; Hinduism, 751.3 million; Buddhism, 334
million; Chinese folk religion (a system of beliefs including
Confucianism and Taoism), 141 million; Judaism, 12.9 million; and
Shintoism, 3.3 million. World Book notes that its figures are from
1993, and credits them to World Christian Encyclopedia and the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   World Almanac (1999) lists, among Christians, Roman Catholics
with 1.04 billion; Protestants, 391 million; and Orthodox, 223
million. Among non-Christians, it lists Muslims, 1.15 billion;
Hindus, 747 million; Buddhists, 353 million; Chinese folk religion,
363 million; Jews, 14.9 million; and Shintoists, 2.7 million. It
dates the statistics to mid-1997 and credits as its source the 1999
Encyclopedia Britannica Book of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of Records (1999) calls the Baha'i faith, with
about 6 million people, the ``biggest religion without any rites.''
World Almanac, meanwhile, indicates 7.67 million Baha'is, while
World Book Encyclopedia lists 5.5 million Baha'is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can kudzu be used for animal feed or for any other commercial
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cows, goats and other animals love it, says Wayne McLaurin,
horticulturist with the University of Georgia Extension Service.
Kudzu, a legume, is nutritious for cud-chewing animals, and letting
them eat it is one of the few ways to get rid of it. Kudzu has a
very large tuber underground that resprouts each year. When it's
eaten back, the tuber is weakened and eventually killed. It takes a
long time, McLaurin adds, but it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   While the tuber is used in commercial starch production in
Japan, other commercial uses are limited. Kudzu can't be baled, for
example, because it tangles up in the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson still
receive his multimillion-dollar salary, now that he is injured and
most likely out for the remainder of the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. His salary _ $32 million over five years _ is guaranteed
by contract. Falcons spokesman Aaron Salkin said there was a time
when teams used a split contract, paying one amount if the athlete
played the normal full schedule and another if placed on the
injured reserve, but that doesn't happen any more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is considered the richest person in the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Guinness Book of Records 1999 reports that Microsoft
Corp. chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is now No. 1, bumping the
Sultan of Brunei to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you list the states where all the Miss America winners
have come from, how many women were from each, and the years? It
seems like a lot have come from a few states.
</P>
<P>
   A: California crowns the Miss America sweepstakes with six
winners (1925, '41, '43, '46, '55, '83).
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Pennsylvania are next with five each: Ohio ('22, '23,
'38, '63, '72, '78; the same contestant won in '22 and '23); and
Pennsylvania ('24, '35, '36, '40, '54).
</P>
<P>
   Four states have had four: Illinois ('27, '69, '91, '98);
Michigan ('39, '61, '70, '88); Mississippi ('59, '60, '80, '86);
and Oklahoma ('26, '67, '81, '96).
</P>
<P>
   Five states have had three: Colorado ('56, '58, '74); Kansas
('66, '68, '97); Minnesota ('48, '77, '89); New York ('45, '76,
'84); Texas ('42, '71, '75).
</P>
<P>
   Eight states and the District of Columbia have had two: Alabama
('51, '95); Arizona ('49, '65); Arkansas ('64, '82); District of
Columbia ('21, '44); New Jersey ('37, '84); South Carolina ('57,
'94); Tennessee ('47, '87); Utah ('52, '85); Virginia ('79, '99).
</P>
<P>
   And eight have had one: Connecticut ('33); Florida ('93);
Georgia ('53); Hawaii ('92); North Carolina ('62); Missouri ('90);
Wisconsin ('73).
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky got its first winner ('00) last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In an item about past Miss America winners from various
states, Q&AMP;A listed two for 1984, one from New York and the other
from New Jersey. How could that be?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original 1984 Miss America was Vanessa Williams,
representing New York. She relinquished her title July 23 of that
year when it was revealed that nude photographs of her would appear
in Penthouse magazine. It was the first time in the pageant's
history that a Miss America had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant officials in Atlantic City, N.J., immediately named
Suzette Charles, who as Miss New Jersey had been first runner-up,
as the new Miss America. She served out the remaining two months of
the 1984 reign.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now known professionally as Vanessa L. Williams, went
on to become a singing, dancing and acting star. Charles, who has
done some entertainment work and briefly hosted a TV show in
Atlanta in the early 1990s, married a doctor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The new Miss America was called the first Kentuckian to win
the title. But I remember that Venus Ramey of Stanford, Ky., won
the title years ago. What state did she represent, if not Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ramey, the 1944 Miss America, did indeed hail from Kentucky,
but won the title representing Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One more beauty queen question: Q&AMP;A reported that Heather
Renee French, the newly crowned Miss America, was the first
Kentuckian to win the title. I thought Phyllis George was first. Am
I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: George, from Denton, Texas, was Miss Texas before winning the
Miss America title in 1971. She became the first lady of Kentucky
when her husband, John Y. Brown Jr., was elected governor in 1979.
Brown made his fortune with Kentucky Fried Chicken. George later
went on to work in network TV news and sports, write two books, and
found By George, a food products company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu recently quoted
Mohandas Gandhi as saying something to the effect that politics
cannot be without conscience, science without humanity, wealth
without work. Can you give me the exact quote?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's from a list that the Indian nationalist leader
(1869-1948) once said caused all violence in human life: wealth
without work; pleasure without conscience; knowledge without
character; commerce without morality; science without humanity;
worship without sacrifice; politics without principle; and rights
without responsibilities. The list was publicized widely when it
was quoted at Hubert H. Humphrey's funeral by President Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bill Gates is pledging $1 billion for minority scholarships.
Can you define who are the qualifying minorities, and how one
applies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scholarships and fellowships will be available through the
Gates Millennium Scholars Program for 20 years, starting in the
fall of 2000, for outstanding low-income African-American, Native
American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American students. The United
Negro College Fund will administer the program.
</P>

<P>
   Q: Former President Jimmy Carter recently stated that he was one
of the last people to speak with Elvis Presley before he died. I
have never heard or read anything about this. Do you have any
details about this meeting?
</P>
<P>
   A: They didn't meet on that particular occasion. What Carter
told students at Emory University in Atlanta at a recent town hall
meeting was that he was one of the last people to speak with
Presley before the singer died on Aug. 16, 1977. The conversation
was by telephone, when Presley called Carter at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carter biographer Douglas Brinkley, Carter's White
House diary showed that the conversation took place between 5:18
and 5:24 p.m. June 14, 1977. Carter had met Presley previously,
backstage at the Omni in Atlanta, when Carter was governor of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone conversation took place during what was said to be
the ``roughest part'' of Presley's life. In the conversation,
Presley asked Carter to pardon a sheriff friend of his in Memphis
who was in trouble. Carter explained that a person who hadn't yet
been tried or convicted could not be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   After Presley died just two months later, Carter issued an
official White House statement. At the time, it was unheard of for
a president to make an official statement about a rock star's
death. Carter called the singer ``unique, irreplaceable and a
symbol the world over of the rebelliousness and good humor of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Mikhail Gorbachev and his late wife, Raisa, have any
children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, one. As reported after Raisa Gorbachev died of leukemia
Sept. 20, the couple had a daughter, Irina.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the Social Security Administration begin payroll
deductions from employers and employees? What was the percentage
rate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Act was signed by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt on Aug. 14, 1935. Taxes were collected for the first time
in January 1937. Between 1937 and 1949, the tax rate was 1 percent
each from employer and employee, said Social Security
Administration spokeswoman Patti Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard on numerous occasions about a secessionist
movement in Hawaii on the part of people there who think statehood
was a bad thing. Do you have any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a movement toward sovereignty among descendants of
native Hawaiians, but how significant in size and strength it is
remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 73 percent of Hawaiians who voted in the Native
Hawaiian Vote favored an election of delegates to propose a native
Hawaiian government. Last July 27, delegates of the Native Hawaiian
Convention began their next step toward self-determination, a
convention with 79 delegates whose plan _ with no specific
timetable _ was to develop a constitution on a form of native
Hawaiian government that then would have to be ratified by all
native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, such ratification is
a lofty goal, since only 41 percent of Hawaiians statewide
participated in the 1996 vote, while just 8.6 percent cast ballots
in an election of delegates last January. But a survey released
last month by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs stated that one-third
of all residents support the restoration of Hawaii as an
independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Some non-native Hawaiians, meanwhile, claim that the 1996
referendum discriminated against non-native Hawaiians and was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the overthrow on Jan. 17, 1893, of the Kingdom of
Hawaii, a fact that was recognized by U.S. Public Law 103-150, the
``apology resolution'' to native Hawaiians. It was passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton on Nov. 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sovereignty movement have established a Web
site _ www.hawaii-nation.org _ where more information on their
cause can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what has happened to Allan Nairn, the American
journalist detained by the Indonesian military? He gave an
interview by cell phone to ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' Sept.
14 and I haven't heard anything further.
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the few Western journalists to remain in Dili, East
Timor's provincial capital, in recent weeks, Nairn was arrested
Sept. 14, questioned by the Indonesian military, and deported. He
flew from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Singapore on Sept. 20, where he
told reporters that he hoped to return to East Timor as soon as
possible. Immigration officials in West Timor said Nairn had
entered the country illegally, listing on his visa that he was a
tourist, rather than saying he was a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was arrested and deported, Nairn, 43, of New Jersey,
had been interviewed by NPR's ``All Things Considered'' and had
described in detail the rampaging and terrorism he said he saw
being conducted by the Indonesian troops and their militia
auxiliaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nairn had been in trouble with Indonesian authorities before
with his reporting on Timor violence, including being banned from
Indonesia and occupied East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the recipients of this year's Kennedy Center Honors is
Sean Connery. Aren't they for American artists only?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The lifetime achievement awards are given to those who
have contributed ``a body of work in the United States,'' and
aren't restricted to U.S. citizens or people born in the United
States, said a Kennedy Center spokesman. Actor Connery, who was
born in Edinburgh, Scotland, is one of two honorees this year not
born in the United States; the other is comedian and pianist Victor
Borge, a native of Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of precedent. Since the honors were established
in 1978, other foreign-born honorees have included, in 1978,
pianist Arthur Rubenstein, who was born in Lodz, Poland; pianist
Rudolph Serkin, 1981, Eger, Bohemia; opera composer Gian Carlo
Menotti, 1984, Cadegliano, Italy; violinist Isaac Stern, also 1984,
Kreminiwez, Russia; cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,
1992, Baku, Azerbaijan; and conductor Georg Solti, 1993, Budapest,
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners this year are dancer Judith Jamison, actor Jason
Robards and musician Stevie Wonder. The awards will be presented
Dec. 4, followed by a gala performance the next day which will be
televised in late December.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I served on the escort carrier CVE 71, USS Kitkun Bay, in
World War II. Do you know its final disposition?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kitkun Bay (named after a body of water in Alaska), which was
launched Nov. 8, 1943, in Vancouver, Wash., was scrapped early in
1947 after an illustrious career in the Pacific. It suffered damage
in two incidents, with 17 total dead and 38 wounded. In addition to
the Presidential Unit Citation, Kitkun Bay earned six Battle Stars
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our youth group is trying to put on a safe trick-or-treat
carnival, and all of us grown-ups can't agree on what night
Halloween is observed when Oct. 31 falls on a Sunday. Some say it
never is on a Sunday, and others say it's always the last night of
October. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: Halloween, the occasion for trick-or-treating, isn't a
holiday whose observance is established by law; it's a tradition.
And the tradition is that it is Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween developed from ancient new year festivals and
festivals of the dead. In the 800s, the Christian church
established All Saint's Day on Nov. 1 so people could continue an
observance they had celebrated before becoming Christians. The
evening before All Saint's Day became known as All Hallow's Eve, or
All Hallowe'en. The observance also is traced to the Celtic
festival of Samhain. The Celts' new year began on Nov. 1, with a
celebration beginning the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly those who don't want a trick-or-treat carnival to be
on a Sunday can stage it on another day. Some people, needless to
say, don't approve of it all, no matter the day or date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ken Bode was an excellent moderator for the PBS program
``Washington Week in Review,'' but he left the show earlier this
year without any explanation. What was the reason?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bode's five-year run as host of the venerable program came to
a sudden end in February because, he said, the new programming
chief of the PBS station that produces the program wanted to take
it in ``a different direction.'' He said he disagreed with changes
in the show pushed by Dalton Delan, a former cable programming
executive who had worked at HBO, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The New York Times, Bode was edged out in a
search for ``more edge and attitude'' by station executives at the
PBS Station. Sharon Percy Rockefeller, WETA-TV president, said
there was never any intention of diminishing or compromising the
program. She added that all 50 national programs produced by WETA,
including ``Washington Week in Review,'' are being analyzed at the
behest of the station's board.
</P>
<P>
   While Rockefeller said Bode was not forced out, adding that his
contract wasn't renewed ``in the way he wanted it to be,'' Bode
himself said this to The Chicago Tribune: ``I've never been fired
before. Journalists always have to quit on principle or be fired on
principle. I just don't know which one happened to me.'' Bode, by
the way, is dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism.

 &HT;    Jewish Sukkot celebration and its outdoor meals became the
foundation of Thanksgiving
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've caught sight of neighbors dining in a
makeshift backyard hut this week, chances are they're celebrating
the ancient Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day fall festival, which began Friday night,
commemorates the 40 years the Jewish people wandered in the
wilderness after fleeing Egypt. The sukkah (booth) that families
around the world construct for the holiday are reminiscent of the
temporary structures in which their ancestors lived in the desert.
The little booths also were used by farmers in ancient Israel to
save time during the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, was the most important
thanksgiving festival,'' explains Marc Gruber, senior rabbi at
Dayton's Temple Israel. ``The Pilgrims modeled their Thanksgiving
on Sukkot.''
</P>
<P>
   The sukkah is a place for festive gatherings: Families often eat
meals there during the holiday and invite friends to share the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each Jewish holiday has special foods associated with it and
has aspects that are religious, historical and seasonal,'' says
Gruber, who last year invited his entire congregation to an open
house in his sukkah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's traditional at Sukkot to use seasonal foods and to put
everything in a casserole so you can carry it from your kitchen to
the sukkah,'' says Gruber.
</P>
<P>
   A one-dish meal has other advantages: It typically remains hot
throughout the meal and also keeps the family warm on a chilly fall
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Typical dishes might include beef or lamb stews, sweet-and-sour
stuffed cabbage, noodle kugel or puddings, goulash, vegetable
tzimmes (made with sweet potatoes and carrots), seasonal fruit
salads and filled pastries.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy these one-pot recipes at
this time of year. They're great for a tailgate party or
neighborhood potluck.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, who's been cooking since he was a child and does much of
the cooking for his family, became a vegetarian in 1972 and labels
himself the ``veggie rebbe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to cook with my mom and learned to read with the 'Betty
Crocker Children's Cookbook,' `` he recalls. ``I have early
memories of making apple crisp and serving it with cream or ice
cream.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy these one-pot recipes at
this time of year. They're great for a tailgate party or
neighborhood potluck.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber says he tries to eat two meals each day in the sukkah
during the holiday. He and his wife, Renee, have three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids like the holiday because it's fun,'' he says. ``It's
picnicky, campy. It's filled with sights, sounds and senses.'' Some
families even sleep in the sukkah.
</P>
<P>
   The little booths typically are decorated with gourds, fruits
and vegetables, strings of cranberries and popcorn, Indian corn.
</P>
<P>
   These days there are modular and fiberglass sukkahs, canvas
versions with zippers and windows, and portable sukkahs for travel.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of families still prefer creating their own. Renee
Gruber notes her husband's sukkah-building skills have improved
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began building sukkahs when we lived on Long Island in
1985,'' she remembers. ``It was windy there because it was near the
ocean and it was always hurricane season, so the sukkah would look
good when we first put it up but it would collapse with the first
strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rochester it was so cold that you could freeze in your
sukkah and be eating in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's fall weather is more conducive to sukkah-building.
``Eventually, we figured out the best construction and our sukkahs
have been standing ever since,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Micah Gruber, 12, says Sukkot is his favorite Jewish holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was real young I've always helped my dad put up the
sukkah,'' he says. ``I like being out there. Now that I'm older, I
know more about the holiday and I still like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Gruber gets a kick out of sharing a story that took place
some years ago when his family was living on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always buy strings of twinkly lights at the end of December
and save them to light our sukkah,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Queried Micah, age 5, one wintry night: ``Hey, why does everyone
have sukkah lights on their houses?''

 &HT;    Holiday recipe resources
 &HT;    c. 1999 Dayton Daily News
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number of new Jewish holiday cookbooks recently have hit the
shelves. Here are a few highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The New Jewish Holiday Cookbook: An International Collection
of Recipes and Customs by Gloria Kaufer Greene (Times Books,
$27.50) is organized by holiday. Chapters include histories of each
holiday and recipes ranging from traditional to nouvelle. This
revised cookbook is filled with 260 recipes drawn from many
countries, including Algeria, Greece and Cuba. Each recipe is
clearly marked as dairy, pareve or meat. Recipes for Sukkot include
fruit-and-vegetable tzimmes, cranberry relish and instructions for
making a gingerbread sukkah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first created a gingerbread sukkah many years ago because
our family did not yet have a life-size sukkah of our own,'' the
author writes. ``I figured that if my family couldn't eat in a
sukkah, at least we could eat a sukkah!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jewish Holiday Style: A Beautiful Guide to Celebrating the
Jewish Rituals in Style by Rita Milos Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$27.50). Brownstein is a Jewish Martha Stewart who has come up with
lots of creative ideas for enhancing your holiday table. Recipes
are included, but the emphasis is on projects: The book contains 85
full-color photos and step-by-step project illustrations. Here's
your chance to observe sukkot with a seaside motif, create a matzo
vase or guest pillows for Passover, make Purim graggers
(noisemakers) and tzedakah (charity) boxes for collecting coins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Light Jewish Holiday Desserts by Penny Wantuck Eisenberg
(William Morrow, $25): Calculate the fat and cholesterol in the
typical Jewish holiday meal and you'll know why this cookbook is a
winning idea. Eisenberg's book is organized by holiday, and she's
come up with light versions of classics such as Rosh Hashanah honey
cake and Hanukkah latkes. She celebrates Sukkot and the autumn
harvest with Pear Varenikes in Chocolate Sauce, Cranberry Pear
Fluden (or ``flat cake'') and a Lemon Mousse Charlotte that has
only one gram of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shabbat Shalom: Recipes and Menus for the Sabbath by Susan R.
Friedland (Little Brown, $24.95) will help Jewish families move
beyond brisket and roast chicken as they commemorate the Sabbath
each Friday night and Saturday. Friedland is the author ofThe
Passover Table, and all of her recipes are kosher.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Couple swaps Florida for Fairbanks
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _

<P>
   FAIRBANKS, Alaska - In 1996, Terry and Jane Reilly forsook their
homes in West Palm Beach, Fla., to live much of their lives in
brutal cold and unending darkness. And when I say forsook, I mean
forsook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accepted a 60 percent cut in income to move here,'' says
Jane, 44, a longtime sunny Florida resident and former insurance
agent with her family's business, Sam Irvine &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came for the job, not the weather. Terry teaches
Shakespeare at the University of Alaska. We love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't particularly care for the winters that average 20 and
30 degrees below zero, nor are they fond of days that begin at 11
a.m. with a 40-watt sunrise, followed by a return to pitch darkness
at 2 p.m., and no relief until spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a weird place,'' says Terry, 45, who
coached girls' soccer in Florida and taught home-bound students.
``Winters are dark and you kind of go into hibernation mode, and
now you've got midnight tee times and you see people painting their
houses at 2 a.m. People don't sleep in summer. The sunlight
energizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme cold isn't so bad, the Reillys say. But their
protests sound suspiciously like Arizonans' apologies for their
``dry'' heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dry cold,'' explains Terry. ``And Fairbanks is in a
valley sheltered by two mountain ranges, so there's very little
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when you check the temperatures and see that it's 60
below in Fairbanks, you've got to understand that that's at the
airport, the lowest point in the valley where the coldest air
sinks. Up on the ridge overlooking the city and the magnificent
Alaska range, the temperature might be only 30 or 40 below.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even cancel school at 40 below,'' Terry says. ``How
bad could it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad, if, as a tour guide told me, at 50 below zero you
throw a cup of scalding coffee in the air and it freezes into a tan
ice fog that floats away.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad if, as a political canvasser told me, when you open
the door on a minus 45 degree day, the cold air flowing into the
house hits the warm air inside creating a heavy cloud that covers
the cat and then rises to obscure the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad if, as Jane told me, at 70 below zero last winter,
tires froze so solidly that when driving was attempted the tires
fell away from the rims.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 45-degree day in late May as Jane explains that her
commitment to raising her 5-year-old son, Casey, in Fairbanks is
conditional on her returning to Florida every
</P>
<P>
   December to get her personal solar cells recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I miss,'' she says, suspending a forkful of the smoked
Alaska king salmon she and her son caught last summer, ``is diving
under a wave in Florida and coming
</P>
<P>
   up in bright, hot sunlight and feeling the sunlight on my body.
It's the intensity of sunshine, the feeling of it on my back and
face, that I really miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmistakable signs of Alaska
</P>
<P>
   You recognize three kinds of roads: under construction, under
repair, shouldn't have been built in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   You take for granted the ``cabin culture'' of university
students who live without plumbing or electricity, ride their bikes
to school, shower at the gym and charge up their laptop computers
to go home to study by kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
   You design Halloween costumes to fit over a snowsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy lingerie is a flannel nightgown with only eight buttons.
</P>
<P>
   People hoard airline miles by charging everything possible, and
some have even arranged credit card mortgage payments to reap the
travel bonus.
</P>
<P>
   You aren't asked ``What do you do,'' which would probably be
answered with something like ``hunt'' or ``fish.'' Instead, it's
``What do you do for money?''
</P>
<P>
   Your water costs 6 cents a gallon and it's hauled by a water
dealer and pumped into your 1,500-gallon underground reservoir.
(Some folks save by fetching it
</P>
<P>
   themselves for 2 cents a gallon.)
</P>
<P>
   You see a file cabinet in someone's back yard and assume it's
where ice cream is stored. In cold weather, folks simply throw
their frozen food in the trunks of their car, sometimes forgetting
about it for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   People refer to ``outside'' and mean anywhere outside of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   You come to recognize the 5-gallon buckets many students and
some professionals carry around as Alaskan brief cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was moosed-in'' is a common reason, not an excuse, for
getting to work late. If there is a moose between you and your car,
you wait.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of too many people going into the woods to winter
in a tent heated by a wood stove to think it remarkable. It may not
be understandable, but it is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a 10-year-old 5-wheel drive with stuck windows, a
cracked windshield and a bent coat hanger for a radio antenna will
ask $6,000 and get it.
</P>
<P>
   Dog owners who don't want a bear infestation on their property
and a decline in the dog census quickly learn to lock up their dog
food.
</P>
<P>
   You know four seasons: Winter, still winter, not winter, poor
sledding.
</P>
<P>
   Your snow blower gets stuck on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The high ratio of men to women has been reduced to this
observation for husband-seekers: ``The odds are good, but the goods
are odd.''

throw a cup of scalding coffee in the air and it freezes into a tan
ice fog that floats away.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad if, as a political canvasser told me, when you open
the door on a minus 45 degree day, the cold air flowing into the
house hits the warm air inside creating a heavy cloud that covers
the cat and then rises to obscure the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad if, as Jane told me, at 70 below zero last winter,
tires froze so solidly that when driving was attempted the tires
fell away from the rims.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 45-degree day in late May as Jane explains that her
commitment to raising her 5-year-old son, Casey, in Fairbanks is
conditional on her returning to Florida every
</P>
<P>
   December to get her personal solar cells recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I miss,'' she says, suspending a forkful of the smoked
Alaska king salmon she and her son caught last summer, ``is diving
under a wave in Florida and coming
</P>
<P>
   up in bright, hot sunlight and feeling the sunlight on my body.
It's the intensity of sunshine, the feeling of it on my back and
face, that I really miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmistakable signs of Alaska
</P>
<P>
   You recognize three kinds of roads: under construction, under
repair, shouldn't have been built in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   You take for granted the ``cabin culture'' of university
students who live without plumbing or electricity, ride their bikes
to school, shower at the gym and charge up their laptop computers
to go home to study by kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
   You design Halloween costumes to fit over a snowsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy lingerie is a flannel nightgown with only eight buttons.
</P>
<P>
   People hoard airline miles by charging everything possible, and
some have even arranged credit card mortgage payments to reap the
travel bonus.
</P>
<P>
   You aren't asked ``What do you do,'' which would probably be
answered with something like ``hunt'' or ``fish.'' Instead, it's
``What do you do for money?''
</P>
<P>
   Your water costs 6 cents a gallon and it's hauled by a water
dealer and pumped into your 1,500-gallon underground reservoir.
(Some folks save by fetching it
</P>
<P>
   themselves for 2 cents a gallon.)
</P>
<P>
   You see a file cabinet in someone's back yard and assume it's
where ice cream is stored. In cold weather, folks simply throw
their frozen food in the trunks of their car, sometimes forgetting
about it for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   People refer to ``outside'' and mean anywhere outside of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   You come to recognize the 5-gallon buckets many students and
some professionals carry around as Alaskan brief cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was moosed-in'' is a common reason, not an excuse, for
getting to work late. If there is a moose between you and your car,
you wait.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of too many people going into the woods to winter
in a tent heated by a wood stove to think it remarkable. It may not
be understandable, but it is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a 10-year-old 5-wheel drive with stuck windows, a
cracked windshield and a bent coat hanger for a radio antenna will
ask $6,000 and get it.
</P>
<P>
   Dog owners who don't want a bear infestation on their property
and a decline in the dog census quickly learn to lock up their dog
food.
</P>
<P>
   You know four seasons: Winter, still winter, not winter, poor
sledding.
</P>
<P>
   Your snow blower gets stuck on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The high ratio of men to women has been reduced to this
observation for husband-seekers: ``The odds are good, but the goods
are odd.''

   LIFE IN AMERICA: Couple swaps Florida for Fairbanks
</P>
<P>
   FAIRBANKS, Alaska _ In 1996, Terry and Jane Reilly forsook their
homes in West Palm Beach, Fla., to live much of their lives in
brutal cold and unending darkness. And when I say forsook, I mean
forsook. ``We accepted a 60 percent cut in income to move here,''
says Jane, 44, a longtime sunny Florida resident and former
insurance agent with her family's business, Sam Irvine &AMP;
Associates. ``We came for the job, not the weather. Terry teaches
Shakespeare at the University of Alaska. We love it here.'' The
extreme cold isn't so bad, the Reillys say. But their protests
sound suspiciously like Arizonans' apologies for their ``dry''
heat. ``It's a dry cold,'' explains Terry. ``And Fairbanks is in a
valley sheltered by two mountain ranges, so there's very little
wind.'' (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post)

WORK BEGINS ON AMERICAN INDIAN MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL CRAIG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sounds of Indian drums and ceremonial chants
echoed on the National Mall a few hundred yards from the Capitol
dome as ground was broken for the National Museum of the American
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   The 250,000-square-foot building is scheduled to open in 2002.
Its estimated cost is $110 million, of which $36.7 million has been
raised from more than 250,000 individuals, corporations and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is the latest addition to the Smithsonian Institution
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking ceremonies on Tuesday were opened by a color
guard of Indian military veterans marching to the beat of a large
drum manned by the White Oak Singers, a ``powwow group'' of
Native-American men living in the Washington area. The site was
blessed through elaborate traditional rituals in native languages
by members of the Piscataway tribe, which originally inhabited the
area, representing the East; by Quechuas from Peru, for the South;
by native Hawaiians representing the West; and by an Inuit woman
from Canada for the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for native people throughout the Western
Hemisphere,'' said Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who
appeared on the podium in full tribal regalia. ``We are asking the
Earth Mother to loan us a small piece from her bosom to build this
museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers included Smithsonian officials and Sen. Daniel K.
Inouye, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   They paid tribute to those who worked to create the museum and
expressed the hope that the building will provide a place for
others to learn not only about the past of Native-American
cultures, but about their present and future contributions.
</P>
<P>
   W. Richard West, the museum director who is a member of the
Southern Cheyenne tribe, echoed a sentiment heard from Indians in
the audience, many in traditional dress, when he said that the
museum ``will show the world what we truly are.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum was established by Congress in 1989 to acquire the
800,000 Native-American objects assembled from 1903 to 1957 by the
late George Gustav Heye, a wealthy New Yorker. It is one of the
world's largest collections of such material and includes objects
dating from 8000 B.C. to the mixed-media design prepared for the
cover of the groundbreaking program.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the collection is from North America, the
rest from South and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The museum includes two other facilities: the Heye Center, an
exhibition and education facility opened in 1994 in the U.S.
Customs House in lower Manhattan, and a cultural resources center
finished in 1998 in Suitland, Md., to store the bulk of the
collection and to house a library and archives.
</P>
<P>
   The curving architecture planned for the Mall building was
designed in consultation with Native Americans and represents
natural land forms. The grounds on the 4.25-acre site will be
landscaped with indigenous trees and plants.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at Fourth Street and Independence Avenue, is described
as the last plot on the Mall that is suitable for a museum. Urban
archaeologists working there in recent years uncovered the colorful
past of the area, which was a notorious 19th-century neighborhood
until it was cleared as part of a beautification effort.

Amtrak this week demonstrates the problems with fixing rail
crossings. Despite warnings and accidents, it can take years to get
lights and gates on dangerous crossings. That's because the system
is so complicated. Railroads wait for government to pay them to put
in the signals. Missouri only has enough money to pay for 40
signals a year and more than 2,000 crossings need them. Railroads
say they spend money on safety programs and it's the state's
responsibility to put in crossings. Experts say parceling out the
responsibility results in deaths. Joe Lambe. 25.

NEW CHASE ACQUISITION WAS PACESETTER IN SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the last three months of 1980, investment
bankers Hambrecht &AMP; Quist of San Francisco took Genentech and then
Apple Computer to the public market in back-to-back coups.
</P>
<P>
   Then over the years came Adobe Systems, one of the stellar
performers in software, Amazon.com and Netscape, and 650 other
emerging growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist provided research, sales and
trading services, merger and acquisition advice and venture capital
_ and a seat at the tables of power in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   If the company that grew to some 900 employees after its
founding in 1968 carried an air of independence, that is gone now.
The Chase Manhattan Corp. on Tuesday acquired Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for
$50 per share in cash, a total of $1.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist becomes the third San Francisco-based
investment bank within two years to be acquired by a large
commercial bank on the East Coast. BankBoston Corp. bought
Robertson Stephens Inc. last year and NationsBank _ now BankAmerica
Corp. _ bought Montgomery Securities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that West Coast underwriters have been in the heart
of the action and have grown with the technology industry and are
natural targets for acquisition by a bank seeking underwriting
capability,'' said Michael Flanagan, an analyst at Financial
Service Analytics in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple, Genentech, Netscape _ those are watershed events,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist was founded by William R. Hambrecht, then a
securities dealer at A.C. Allyn &AMP; Co., and George Quist. They used
their own money and funds from investors drawn to the excitement
and the risk of Silicon Valley's computer and technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fortune magazine, one of the first venture
capitalists, Arthur Rock, a former investment adviser for the
Rockefellers, moved to San Francisco and together with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist formed a syndicate called ``The Group,'' which helped fund
start-ups like Teledyne, Memorex and Scientific Data Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist had a lead in the Internet field by being one
of the first venture capital outfits to invest in Netscape
Communications, which created a wildly popular commercial Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the investment, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist was suffering
from a serious public relations problem: Employees of one of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's technology companies, MiniScribe Corp. of
Longmont, Colo., had shipped bricks rather than hard drives in an
attempt to boost sales figures. ``A bad thing to do unless you are
in the brick business,'' wrote Netscape co-founder Jim Clark.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's investment banking
division was hurting because of the publicity and ``they needed a
high-profile deal to become a major player again.''
</P>
<P>
   Quist died in 1982 and Hambrecht left the company in 1998 to
start W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., which uses the Internet to raise money
for small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist went public in August 1996. It is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange. It now has offices in San Francisco,
New York, Boston, Atlanta, Newport Beach, London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Change for H&AMP;Q was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the real advent of the electronic underwriter and
we have seen increased strength from existing bank underwriters,''
Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist added to the Chase portfolio, ``it
is not enough,'' he said. ``I believe H&AMP;Q is a little too small
(the 11th largest of its kind) to satisfy all of Chase's investment
banking needs.''

ARDIE DAVIS WRITES BBQ BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ardie Davis has been hitting the barbecue sauce pretty hard.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is he has probably drunk a swimming pool's worth of the
stuff over the years yet still always manages to keep enough sauce
on hand to fill up a good-sized bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   While working on The Great BBQ Sauce Book (Ten Speed Press,
$15.95), Davis was on a first-name basis with the UPS driver who
dropped off ``hundreds'' of long-neck bottles, funky flasks, clunky
moonshine jugs and mayonnaise jars containing the condiment on the
doorstep of his Roeland Park home.
</P>
<P>
   As traditional tomato-based, vinegar-based and mustard-based
sauces duked it out with more exotic gourmet versions spiked with
raspberries, papaya, mango or Scotch bonnet peppers, Davis ended up
collecting so many bottles of the stuff that his wife, Gretchen,
felt compelled to ``allot a certain amount of space'' in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   As readers flip through Davis' 160-page illustrated guide,
they'll find descriptions of more than 300 commercially available
barbecue sauces are divided into ``sweet,'' ``tangy'' and ``fiery''
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone looking to buy a sauce, they want to know if it is
sweet or tangy, and if it was going to bite them,'' Davis says.
``Regions don't make sense anymore because we're so global, and you
can find just about any sauce on Web sites or through catalogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Published last month, The Great BBQ Sauce Book already has sold
10,000 copies and has gone into its second printing. This is Davis'
second book. He is also author of The Kansas City BBQ Pocket Guide
(1992, Pig Out Publications).
</P>
<P>
   Like fine wine, Davis says, the best sauces have their own
distinct nuances. Some sauces are ``hickory-kissed'' while others
finish with a ``peppery heat.'' There are sauces spiked with a hint
of garlic or ``embellished with molasses.'' Some ``make your mouth
feel mellow'' while others are ``hot enough to make your tongue
tingle.''
</P>
<P>
   From the gritty taste of Kansas City's legendary Arthur Bryant's
to Big Bob Gibson's Bar-B-Q Original White Sauce, an oddly speckled
mayonnaise indigenous to parts of Alabama, Davis says he didn't
find any sauce so disagreeable that he was forced to spit it out,
although he concedes that he tasted ``plenty that were just
so-so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if anybody in this city, including myself, has tasted
and judged as many sauces as he has,'' says Rich Davis, inventor of
the original K.C. Masterpiece and no relation to Ardie Davis. ``No
one has focused that finely on the barbecue sauce world.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctoring the sauce
</P>
<P>
   Davis grew up in Oklahoma City, where his dad, a backyard
barbecuer, used to buy the most inexpensive barbecue sauce on the
supermarket shelves and doctor it up to suit the family's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he moved to Kansas City in 1977 that Davis
discovered his passion for barbecue sauce. In 1984, on the patio
and deck of his home, he organized the first Diddy-Wa-Diddy
National Barbecue Sauce Contest, featuring 104 commercially
available sauces.
</P>
<P>
   ``What triggered the idea for the contest was reading Jane and
Michael Stern's Road Food,'' Davis says. ``They listed 80-some
barbecue restaurants in the book. I knew I wasn't ever going to be
able to travel to all those restaurants so I started writing them
and asking for their sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1987 the contest had grown so large it was renamed the
American Royal International Barbecue Sauce, Rub &AMP; Baste Contest.
The 16th annual contest, sponsored by the Kansas City Barbeque
Society, will be held Saturday at the Governors Exposition Building
at the American Royal complex and is expected to feature more than
400 sauces, including several from foreign countries, making it the
largest sauce contest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I started the (barbecue sauce) contest, I just had my
radar out for sauces, and word of mouth just got out,'' Davis says.
``People would send me sauces and want me to taste them and give my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   At Davis' urging, Karen Putman finally decided to bottle her
raspberry-flavored barbecue sauce. A red-headed woman who in the
early days sweated it out with her mostly male competitors at
barbecue contests, Davis dubbed her the Flower of the Flames, a
name that stuck and now appears on the label of her barbecue sauce
which she bottles in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a really wonderful palate,'' Putman says of her
friend and mentor. ``Plus he loves barbecue. He can eat barbecue
for breakfast, lunch and dinner _ and snacks in between. No matter
where he goes or what he does, he always picks up more sauces to
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people maybe taste as many sauces, but sometimes they're
overly critical,'' says Brian Heinecke, director of public
relations for the National Barbecue Society. ``They tend to narrow
their focus to only sweet ketchup, tomato-based tastes. Ardie has
an appreciation for the breadth of styles ... so people seem very
open to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People put a lot of ego into their sauces,'' Davis says, ``so
when I'm writing about them I was always mindful that it is
precious stuff to the people who make it. It's sort of `love me,
love my sauce.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alter-barbecue-ego
</P>
<P>
   A shy, soft-spoken, thoughtful man, Davis re-creates himself
through barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   By day he commutes to Topeka, where he is the commissioner of
advocacy services at the Kansas Department on Aging, a position
appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But on the weekends he transforms himself into the gregarious
Remus Powers, Ph.B., a persona that pays tribute to the stories of
Brer Rabbit and a man he knew simply as ``Powers'', a ``James
Dean-type'' automobile mechanic Davis admired while growing up. The
Ph.B. denotes a ``doctorate in barbecue'' _ an honor conferred on a
handful of experts ``who have made a significant contribution to
barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   His alter-barbecue-ego is easy to spot at barbecue contests. He
wears a black derby, bow tie and a white apron with three rib bones
pinned to it. A white ceramic spoon on a gold string tied to his
apron is at the ready whenever a spontaneous sauce tasting presents
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a charter member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society, has
another passion: writing. For the last decade he has written a
monthly column for the organization's newsletter under the pen name
Remus Powers, Ph.B.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wears the costume when he administers the oath he wrote
for judges at the American Royal Invitational Barbecue Contest,
part of which pledges to preserve ``truth, justice, excellence in
barbecue and the American way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I love barbecue is it's a community builder, and I
think barbecue brings people together in a positive way,'' Davis
says.
</P>
<P>
   From his home office _ a room in a basement that is no wider
than most men are tall _ Davis has literally carved out a niche for
himself. The stone walls of his tiny shrine//office are covered
with a mishmash of barbecue memorabilia _ pins, newspaper
clippings, cartoon pigs and the odd empty barbecue sauce bottle.
</P>
<P>
   He's known to his friends as a sort of barbecue philosopher.
Carolyn Wells, longtime friend and executive director of the Kansas
City Barbeque Society, sums up his dual passions this way: ``He's
transferred his love of barbecue into the book. It's obvious it's
part of his soul.''

THERE'S MORE TO THE NET THAN THE WEB, LIKE INTERNET RELAY CHAT, FOR
INSTANCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently stopped using America Online and signed up with a
local Internet provider. I like it a lot so far, but there's one
thing I really miss from AOL _ chat rooms. A friend of mine pointed
me to chat Web sites, like www.talkcity.com, but they're just not
the same. He also suggested I check out IRC. I tried but was
completely bewildered! Can you tell me about IRC and how to use it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's fascinating about the growth of the World Wide Web is
how it has overshadowed and even consumed other aspects of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a lot of newcomers to the online world think the Web is
the Net. But many of these other components still exist, and they
are just as useful.
</P>
<P>
   IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, and it's very similar in the
way it looks and works to the chat rooms on America Online. But the
trick is that you have to connect to a server somewhere on the
Internet first before you can enter an IRC ``channel,'' the
equivalent of a chat room. This is like plugging into a switchboard
before you can place a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   There's another complicating factor. There are different IRC
networks, and each one has its own set of channels. For example,
there might be a channel called games on EFNet, another on DALnet
and a third on the Undernet. So, if you are trying to find someone,
or arrange a meeting with IRC, you will need to decide which
network to use.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen a network, you'll need to pick a server. You
can find a server via the Web pages of the various networks, and a
good list of the networks is at NewIRCusers.com. (It's an excellent
place to get started if you're new to IRC.)
</P>
<P>
   In order to get online, you'll need software. Just as you needed
to get separate e-mail and Web browser software when you left AOL,
you'll also need a program _ called an IRC client _ to get onto
IRC.
</P>
<P>
   There are several good ones for both Windows and Macintosh
systems. One of the most popular for Windows is mIRC, available at
www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6000/index.html. Another chat
client, MSN Chat, comes with Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0.
Macintosh users can try Ircle at www.ircle.com or MacIRC at
www.macirc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've set up this software and pointed it at a server and
a network, it will display a list of channels to join. Most IRC
clients let you either double-click on a channel, or you can join
it by typing /join channelname, where channelname is the name of
the channel you want to join.
</P>
<P>
   If you can to create a channel that doesn't exist, just do a
/join channelname, where channelname is the name of a channel that
does not exist, and it will be created for you.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that there is no global moderating service for IRC
channels, as there is for AOL's chat rooms. If someone does or says
something offensive online, you can complain to a channel's
operator _ if he or she is present. Some channel operators have set
up software-based moderators, called 'bots, that may watch for
offensive language or online behavior, but that's usually not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've got Windows 98 on my computer and I was wondering if it
comes with any kind of FTP program or utility.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it does, but it's not one you'll want to use _ unless
you like text-based FTP programs, which are dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Bring up an MS-DOS window (there should be an MS-DOS Prompt icon
in your Programs folder off the Start Menu) and enter FTP sitename,
where ``sitename'' is the name of the FTP site you want. You'll see
that it's pretty primitive. Unlike a browser-based FTP connection,
you even have to login on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet, if you'd rather not use a browser, is to grab a
shareware FTP program, such as CuteFTP (www.cuteftp.com) or WS-FTP
Pro (www.ipswitch.com). They are much easier to use.

SPEED OPENS UP NEW USES FOR NET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt about it: Life is different in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, I wrote a column describing what it's like to
have high-speed Internet access at home. After about a month of
living with a cable modem connection, I'm finding that the way I
use the Net is changing, and that applications I once didn't
consider _ or considered impractical _ are suddenly useful.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also finding that it remains a technology with some bugs to
work out.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, fast online connections come in two flavors _ one
from cable TV providers and the other from telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Net junkies have to decide which one they want. In some cases,
they may have no choice, because availability is spotty for both
technologies. For example, I can get cable modem service at my
house, but I'm too far away from my phone company's central office
to get ADSL. (I tested ADSL, or Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber
Lines, via a connection at work.)
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion I made was this: When high-speed access works,
it's heavenly. When it doesn't, it's hellish. I found Southwestern
Bell's version of ADSL, dubbed FasTrak, generally more reliable
than Time Warner Communications' cable modem service, RoadRunner.
That was largely due to a mysterious problem that has since been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   I was getting a rhythmic lagging, or latency, with RoadRunner.
Every five to 30 seconds or so, my connection would suddenly stop
responding, then pick up again. It took Time Warner more than 10
days to get a technician to my house to check it out. After seeing
everything was OK on my end, he discovered that a device called a
sweep, which checks cable TV signals for problems, had been
improperly installed, interfering with the frequencies used to
deliver Internet service. He changed some settings, and my problem
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm a much happier camper. RoadRunner also has tweaked its
Houston network and added another connection to the outside world.
Things are much zippier, though there are still small network
outages of various types that happen too frequently, and the system
still slows down noticeably during the evening, prime-time hours.
It's frustrating having your online experience swing rapidly from
exhilarating to depressing and back again.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when I turned on my computer this morning,
RoadRunner was down _ I was unable to get e-mail or access to the
Web. But a half-hour later, I downloaded a 46-megabyte file in just
a few minutes at a speed of 150 kilobytes a second. That's more
than 11 times faster than my old ISDN connection, and 30 times
faster than most 56K modems. Yowza!
</P>
<P>
   Despite these ups and downs, I am discovering that high-speed
Internet access is indeed a very different beast than the dial-up
species. When you have a fast, always-on connection, you tend to
think differently about it and use it in ways that you would have
avoided in the past.
</P>
<P>
   I am becoming more interested in being able to view streaming
video on my PC. I've been checking out music videos, online
interviews and small movies that have been created just for the
Web. The other night, I was fascinated by a 30-minute filmed
conversation with actor Peter Falk, best known for his role as the
rumpled detective Colombo. I would never have watched something
like that with my slower ISDN connection, and certainly not via
dial-up.
</P>
<P>
   I also have been playing around with more programs that work
best when a PC is connected to the Internet on a full-time basis.
These same programs are irritating with a phone-line connection
because _ depending on your system's configuration _ a dial-up box
appears when they want to access the Net and the PC is not online.
</P>
<P>
   _ SocketWatch 3.2, $10, Locutus Codeware: I've long had a
version of SocketWatch on my computer, and used it only
occasionally to reset my PC's internal clock. Now, I leave it
running all the time, and it keeps me continuously on time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that personal computers are fairly
sophisticated devices, they have one interesting flaw that harkens
back to the time of mechanical timepieces _ their built-in clocks
tend to lose a few seconds or even minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   SocketWatch fixes this problem by connecting to atomic clocks
linked to the Internet, grabbing the correct time and resetting
your PC's clock accordingly. The shareware version you can download
at www.locutuscodeware.com will automatically update your PC's
clock a few times, and then you must do it manually. Once you
register, it will update regularly at intervals you set.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a dial-up connection, you have to be connected
when it wants to access an atomic clock. With an always-on
connection, your PC's time is always right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guru.Net, free, Guru International: This is one of the most
intriguing uses of the Web I've ever seen. The folks I've shown
this combination program and Web site are usually astounded _ and,
of course, they must have it.
</P>
<P>
   First, you download a small program from www.guru.net that
places an icon in your Windows 95/98/NT system tray. Then, when you
hold down the ALT key and click on any word, you get a dictionary
definition of that word in a small pop-up window.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool enough by itself, but there's more. If the word has
some specialized meaning, it might draw the definition from a
technical dictionary. If there's an encyclopedia entry for it,
you'll get that, too. You also get Web site links for some words.
</P>
<P>
   And if you alt-click on the name of a public company, you get
the latest stock quote, a stock chart and other financial details.
</P>
<P>
   This works in any Windows application that has standard text _ a
browser, a word processor, e-mail, a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's most useful with an always-on Internet connection.
If you have to dial in to a provider just to check the meaning of a
word, it's almost a nuisance.

A Y2K TEST OF BANK ACCOUNT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a question about an e-mail forwarded to
me on testing my PC for Y2K compliance. It says to test whether
Microsoft has missed setting the ``Short Date Sample'' to a
four-digit year (mm/dd/yyyy). I found that my system was set for
two y's, causing application software to roll over to the year 00
instead of 2000. Is this a problem, or is this hype to get a
consultant to come in and earn his pay?
</P>
<P>
   _ Double-Digit Dilemma
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOUBLE: I'm deeply troubled by your cynicism. Do you really
think that anybody would take advantage of all the confused and
undereducated computer owners all over the world already inundated
with apocalyptic Y2K drivel? Hmmmm. I wonder if it's too late to
become a Y2K con man. Uh, I meant ``consultant,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail you received is completely bogus. I've seen about a
hundred copies of it so far, and it generally starts with ``Every
copy of Windows will fail on January 1st unless you fix it now.''
Big deal. Millions of copies of Windows fail every day anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail tells you how to set the Short Date Style so that it
displays a four-digit year, and nothing about the instructions will
actually harm anything. It's a waste of time, though, since Windows
already stores and processes all dates in a four-digit format.
Short Date is a display setting only. As long as you've been
keeping up-to-date on Windows service releases and patches, the
only thing you have to worry about on New Year's Day is where you
left your car keys.
</P>
<P>
   What's disturbing is how gullible people can be when it comes to
these e-mail hoaxes. Sprinkle a smattering of meaningless
technobabble and a few phony quotes into a letter, and pretty soon
there's a Net-wide panic about some imaginary new software bug or
virus. As a general rule of thumb, never believe anything you read
in an unsolicited e-mail, unless it's that one from me describing
my inexpensive Y2K services.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4100C scanner.
I would like to know how to e-mail scanned items. These scanners do
not come with any written directions, and the CD doesn't give any
information. I called HP support, and they want $25 an hour to talk
to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scan Scam
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SCAM: You seemed to have forgotten to include your $50
check or money order for my consultation fee. You can owe me,
because I bought the 4200 and was appalled to find _ instead of a
manual _ a single sheet of pictographs obviously intended to
instruct some distant alien race how to phone home. The
accompanying text was borrowed, I believe, from my first-grade
primer. See scanner. See scanner run.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned, easy-to-use books just aren't cost-efficient.
Manufacturers would rather distribute manuals in electronic form,
leaving it up to you to print them. A classy company like HP puts
just about everything you need to know about your scanner on its
Web site. I suppose it just assumes everybody has Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   I found most of what you need to know in a couple of minutes at
www.hp.com (go into the Support section), but you can probably do
just as well by trial and error. Basically, scan a picture, save it
somewhere, and use your e-mail program's attachment option to stick
it in a letter. If you're starting with a printed page, your
scanner software has an option to convert the scan into editable
text. But, you know, the printed word is highly overrated. I think
next week's column will be done with stick figures instead.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay's editors prefer to think that only his
printed words are overrated. Reach him at
drbombay(at)star-telegram.com or via snail-mail at Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101. Fax: (817) 390-7257.

A REAL MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. attorneys had a busy time of it Tuesday of last
week, desperately trying to convince a federal judge that the
company isn't a monopoly. Microsoft is talking nonsense, of course
_ and thank heaven for it.
</P>
<P>
   Over 90 percent of the world's desktop computers run some sort
of Microsoft operating system. However, this is mainly due not to
Microsoft's undeniable mean streak but to the ineptitude of Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM Corp., which were well-positioned to compete
against Microsoft, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, monopolies have their uses. Having Windows as a
near-universal software standard makes computing a lot easier for
the clueless masses. Consumers were bound to standardize around one
favorite operating system for simplicity's sake. And software
developers benefit because they can save the cost of writing
different versions of their products. Just write a Windows version,
and you can sell to nearly everybody.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the talk about the liberating effects of technology,
it's obvious computing as we know it wouldn't exist without a
number of well-placed monopolies _ institutions that set standards
that nearly everybody relies on.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows is such a standard, and has gained its
monopoly for exactly that reason. I'm at a loss to see any harm to
the public in this. Indeed, I believe it was bitter rivals, like
the deceased Netscape Communications Corp., whose whining to the US
Justice Department spawned this antitrust suit in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's something in the American character that winces
at the sight of powerful organizations that exercise vast sway over
us, even when they are indispensable to our high-tech lives. That's
why I've been getting so much hostile e-mail about a different sort
of monopoly _ ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A Web page address is actually a number up to 12 digits long.
You don't actually type in the numbers. Instead, you might type in
``globe.com,'' and the name is converted into numbers. What makes
this process simple is the Domain Name System or DNS. It's a
monopoly, of course; the naming system has to be standardized so it
works worldwide. And until a year ago, DNS was run by precisely one
guy _ Jon Postel, a gray-bearded computer whiz so respected and so
powerful that his nickname was ``God.'' But last October, Postel
died, and now his duties have been taken over by ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly or no, there were few protests when the revered Dr.
Postel was in charge. That's largely because he concentrated on
ensuring that DNS worked. But in its first year of existence, ICANN
has been the target of furious criticism from Internet businesses
and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, ICANN tried to charge a $1 fee for each Internet
domain name to fund its operations, enraging Internet service
providers who complained it had no legal right to levy such a fee
and spawning a congressional hearing. In addition, the agency has
moved slowly to introduce new Internet domains to supplement the
overstuffed ``.com'' domain. Lots of entrepreneurs think they can
get rich selling selling ``.sex'' or ``.trade'' Internet addresses.
Not yet, says ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   There's even concern ICANN wants to bar the purchase of domain
names that might resemble well-known corporate names. That's a job
for lawmakers, not ICANN's 10-member high priesthood, says David
Post of Temple University Law School. Post even says that recording
industry groups are urging ICANN to deny Internet domain names to
people who post copyrighted music files on their sites. That would
transform ICANN from a vital technical service to a kind of
Internet cop.
</P>
<P>
   An ICANN spokeswoman says most of the criticism is being
inspired by agents of Network Solutions Inc., the company charged
by the federal government with controlling the hugely lucrative
.com domain, at least until next year. She said undermining ICANN
might ensure that Network Solutions will get an extension on its
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But ICANN is not Microsoft. In a sense, it's more
powerful. Microsoft's monopoly isn't airtight. I can always buy a
Macintosh or Linux computer. But to get a Net domain name, I'll
have to play by the rules of ICANN, a nonprofit organization that
will never have competition. As monopolies go, ICANN may be more
worrisome than Microsoft.

WTO FOR CHINA IS A GOOD THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trade specialists believe China's eventual entry
into the World Trade Organization will be good for the economies of
that country and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The expected boost in trade when China enters the WTO is rooted
in standardized rules binding the 134 member states, according to
Joe Harrison, president of the California Council for International
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When China is a member of the WTO, it must have a level
playing field in its domestic market for foreign companies,''
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that would mean greatly reduced tariffs for
California's important agricultural exports, said Ann Veneman, a
Sacramento lawyer and former Secretary of the California Department
of Foods and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presently, China's tariffs on U.S. foodstuffs average 20 to 40
percent, compared to U.S. tariffs on imported food that stand at 5
percent,'' Veneman said.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, established in 1994, has power to oversee trade
agreements, enforce trade laws and settle disputes between
countries over such issues as tariffs. China is the only major
economic power that is not a member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   WTO rules would mandate a reduction in China's tariffs to an
average 17.5 percent by 2004, should China be admitted to the world
body at the WTO's November meeting in Seattle. No one on the panel
was willing to say that China's admission was certain.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Veneman were among the specialists who participated
in a panel discussion sponsored by the Commonwealth Club of
California. The meeting was called to focus on China and the
California economy. As the international trade lawyers and
businesspeople in attendance made clear, expansion of the
California's trade with China is closely linked to WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
   China, which has included Hong Kong since 1997, accounted for
$16 billion in two-way trade of merchandise for California alone in
1998, according to Harrison, who said the state exported $6 billion
in goods to China and imported $10 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   A planned meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade officials on
China's entry into the trade organization was called off Tuesday
when China's lead negotiator did not attend the meeting in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be another meeting. We just haven't figured out the
logistics of when,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States have been wrestling for years over
China's entry into the WTO. Negotiations have been stalled recently
in part by Beijing's anger over the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade this spring, and political opposition in
Congress. Harrison described it as an ``absurd coalescence of the
Far Left and the Far Right voting against China.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Beijing's centralized command economy
is loosening, creating opportunities for foreign and Chinese
entrepreneurs, said Robert Theleen. Theleen is chairman of
ChinaVest, a venture capital fund that owns 160 Domino's Pizza
outlets in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company deals much more with municipalities and the
private sector than with the national bureaucrats in Beijing,''
Theleen said.
</P>
<P>
   Standardization of intellectual property law in China is
crucial, given that high-tech and entertainment companies lose
billions each year to piracy, said Chinese-born intellectual
property lawyer Janie Fong.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of such rules, ``nontraditional enforcement, such
as inspectors dropping in on factories'' often works better than
lawsuits, Fong said.

   Rayjay is a self-described African-American lesbian mother
living in ``tiny town USA.'' XXPat is a minister in Michigan who
moonlights in a rock 'n' roll band. Both Ginger in Austin and BigT
III in Atlanta are happily married to partners of different races.
Betty, meanwhile, is a retired chemist in New Jersey who will tell
you she ``is not opposed to interracial marriages or dating but was
never given the opportunity to try.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these people have ever met in person, but for the past
week, they have been revealing emotional details about their
personal lives in a unique online forum. Spurred by the engaging
PBS documentary series, ``An American Love Story,'' these intimate
strangers have volunteered to participate in an ongoing dialogue
about race, relationships, prejudice, and other provocative topics.
It's an experiment masterminded by a New York operation called Web
Lab, which aims to show that the Internet, despite its crass
commercialism, can foster intelligent communication among diverse
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Love Story,'' the 10-part series that concluded
Thursday (Sept. 16), highlighted the unvarnished story of Bill Sims
and Karen Wilson, an interracial couple living in Queens, N.Y.;
there was something extraordinarily compelling about the
ordinariness of lives played out against a backdrop of racism and
intolerance. The online forum is proving to be just as
irresistible. As the participants become more vulnerable, they are
unwittingly creating a fascinating study of American attitudes
about race and relationships that is as engrossing as the
documentary itself _ uncensored, honest, and raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from the tradition of using a film as a catalyst for
getting people to think and talk about things in different ways,''
says Web Lab founder Marc Weiss, a former filmmaker who also
founded the PBS program ``Point of View.'' ``We wanted to create a
safe place on the Web for people with historically profound
differences to create a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum, at www.pbs.org/weblab/lovestories/dialogues/, is not
a typical chat room or bulletin board, where the discussion often
degrades to inanity or profanity. Participants fill out an
application form, and then Web Lab staffers create small groups of
people who agree to join for at least three weeks. After the group
is formed, the members moderate their own discussions, which are
posted publicly on the Web site. ``Most of what happens on regular
posting boards is random at best,'' says Weiss. ``We call it
drive-by postings, with people who post once and never come back to
engage in a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide a combination of anonymity along with
accountability. Participants submit a bio, in which they reveal as
much as they choose. They are also bound by the group ethos to
remain civil, despite any disagreements. So far, the ``Love Story''
discussions have politely tiptoed around controversy. But Weiss,
who has overseen similar online discussions about the Vietnam War
and the Starr Report, predicts that the boards will heat up as
people become more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking people to leave their emotions at the door,''
says Weiss. ``Ordinary people can find a way to talk about the
things they disagree on without blowing each other away or
obliterating their opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Anthony Fontana hopes will happen. He
joined the discussion because he is a white man married to a black
woman and is naturally interested in the dynamics of the
discussion. ``I tend to deal in the extreme; I'm not a
middle-of-the-road kind of guy,'' says Fontana, who runs a
construction business in Atlanta and uses the screen name BigT III.
``I don't allow people to stay in their comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the groups are lingering in the comfort zone, with
most of the postings expressing a kind of ``We are the world''
mentality. But both Weiss and Fontana note that the discussions
will generate an edge as time goes by. In Fontanta's group, for
instance, some members have already begun challenging each other.
Consider this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've experienced more and more blacks with a chip on their
shoulder regarding relationships or contacts with whites,'' writes
a retired educator in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm white, married to a young, black Christian man,'' responds
Ginger in Austin. ``He has been stopped by police several times for
doing things I take for granted. . . . Yes, I do think that some
black people have a chip on their shoulders. But as a white person
who has seen firsthand what it's like to be black in America, I can
understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Betty in New Jersey retorts, ``My chip is that I resent
the fact that black men marry white women and leave eligible black
women alone, to remain single all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These are ordinary people sharing everyday triumphs and woes,
similar to the Sims-Wilson family in ``American Love Story.'' At a
time when entrepreneurs are tripping over each other trying to
figure out how to turn a profit from the Internet, some folks are
trying to carve out a public interest niche online, a sort of
uncorrupted PBS of the Web. ``I'm not against commercialism,'' says
Weiss, ``but the Web needs to have a soul.''

WEB BANKING COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I got an upsetting letter from my credit card company last
weekend. The letter, from First USA, informed me that the way I do
my on-line banking was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The change really started about a year ago, when First USA
bought First Card, the company that sponsors my Mileage Plus
MasterCard. I've had my Mileage Plus First Card for more than three
years. The best thing about the card, besides the fact I get a
frequent-flier mile for every dollar I spend, is that I can
automatically download a record of my purchases into Quicken. Since
then, I've used the credit card for all my expenses, and I've
gotten an uncannily accurate picture of where I spend my money.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken's One Step Update feature is pretty cool. Every time I
start up my copy of Quicken 2000, the program automatically
contacts these companies over the Internet, checks to see if I have
new pending transactions, and automatically downloads them into my
register.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I'm in the minority. According to David Webster, a
spokesperson with First USA, only a tiny number of the company's
customers are using Quicken's One Step Update. First USA's Web site
is far more popular; more than 500,000 customers have registered to
review their First USA credit card accounts over the Web. So First
USA has discontinued One Step Update in favor of making information
available over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based home banking actually lets companies such as First USA
offer far more services to consumers than they ever could do
through Quicken's proprietary interface. As with Quicken, the First
USA Web site shows me the date of each charge, the amount, the name
of the merchant, and a category of the transaction. But I also can
see ``authorizations'' _ that is, the amount of credit that has
been reserved on my credit-card pending a settlement. I can even
click on a link and dispute a charge, all without having to pick up
the phone or write a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial institutions also are bypassing direct
integration with Quicken and moving straight to the Web. In the
process, they are offering new services and features to their
customers. My bank, the Cambridge Trust Company, lets me use their
Web-based bank statement to pay bills with electronic payments and
balance my checking account statement on line. The Web-based system
gives customers who aren't using Quicken _ the majority of the
bank's customers _ an easy way to manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine is so enamored with his bank's on-line services
that he has decided to move to a ``paperless statement.'' Instead
of getting his credit card statement in the mail each month, he
gets an e-mail message telling him that the statement is ready to
download. He then clicks to the Web site, downloads the statement,
and saves it on his hard drive. A few more keystrokes and he has
programmed in a payment on the credit-card bill from his on-line
checking account. This is great for my friend, who travels a lot.
It's also great for the credit card company, which does away with
the expense of sending out the paper bill.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are already using Quicken, these Web-based
systems can be something of a step backward _ or they can be a step
forward. It all depends on how the bank sets up its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most financial companies that have set up Web-based services let
customers export their transactions into a file. The data in this
file then can be imported into Quicken. It used to be that the only
file format that Quicken supported was something called a ``QIF
File.'' QIF stands for Quicken Interchange Format; it's a simple
technique that Intuit created years ago for moving data in and out
of the Quicken application. But starting with Quicken '99, Intuit
created a new file format called Web Connect. The reason that the
letter from First USA upset me so much was that the letter said
that I would have to download my statement using QIF. As it turns
out, the letter was wrong: First USA supports the Web Connect
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In general, importing transactions with QIF is something that
consumers should avoid. Using QIF, it's all too easy to import your
transactions into the wrong Quicken register, or to accidentally
get double transactions in your register. Once when I imported a
QIF file from Cambridge Trust I had to spend more than an hour
trying to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken's Web Connect system, on the other hand, works just as
well as the company's One Step Update. You just click a button and
Quicken transfers the data into the correct register and lets you
compare these numbers with the rest of your statement. If your
financial institution doesn't offer Web Connect, tell them that
they should. Don't trust your finances to a QIF!
</P>
<P>
   One lingering fear I have regarding this is that some crook or
identity thief might get access to my account over the Internet and
start spending my money. Alas, this is a problem many financial
institutions need to address. At Cambridge Trust, for instance, I
had to get a paper application, send it in, and then wait for the
company to send me my username and password by US mail.
Unfortunately, when I got the letter, I discovered the bank had
used my Social Security number as my username. That's not very
secure, since there are many ways to discover a Social Security
number.
</P>
<P>
   First USA, on the other hand, allowed me to set up my Web
account electronically. All I had to do was to provide my
credit-card number, my birthday, my mother's maiden name, and the
zip code where my credit card statements are sent. The whole
process took less than three minutes. I guess I'm lucky that I
activated my credit card's on-line account and set up a password
before somebody else _ an identity thief, for instance _ did it
using my account.

FREELANCE WRITERS WIN APPEAL IN COPYRIGHT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a copyright decision that establishes the new
rules of the electronic road, a federal appeals court in New York
has ruled that three major publishers cannot include the work of
freelance contributors in electronic databases without the
freelancers' permission.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel in the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling that had
agreed with the arguments of New York Times Co., Newsday Inc. and
Time Inc. Magazine Co. and their co-plaintiffs, University
Microfilms International and Mead Data Central Corp., the former
owner of the Lexis-Nexis databases.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers had argued that the electronic databases like
Nexis were analogous to anthologies or other ``collective works''
that can be revised without the permission of the individual
copyright holders. But the appeals panel held that ``the privilege
afforded authors of collective works'' under existing law ``does
not permit the publishers to license individually copyright works
for inclusion in the electronic databases.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, issued Friday afternoon and concerning a lawsuit by
several freelancers, comes as online publishing is exploding and as
many publications are expanding and leaning on freelance
contributors to supplement the work of their regular staff. It
could force the companies to offer retroactive electronic-rights
payments for everything from opinion pieces submitted for op-ed
pages to full-length magazine pieces, and for photographs and
graphics. Alternatively, it could force the publishers to go into
their databases and pull out any freelance work covered by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Recent work, however, is less likely to be subject to the
ruling, since a number of media companies, including New York Times
Co., Newsday and Time Inc., have for several years required
freelance writers to sign contracts that allow electronic
republication of the work without additional compensation. Other
companies _ it is unclear how many _ have not, relying on contracts
that make no mention of electronic rights or handshake agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the decision on media companies could be
``devastating,'' said E. Leonard Rubin, a former general counsel at
Playboy Enterprises who now heads the intellectual property section
at the Chicago law firm of Gordon &AMP; Glickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publications that have hastened to take advantage of the
electronic age, and have an incredibly vast inventory of
interesting articles and works of fiction, and wanted to post them
on their Web sites and in databases for the sake of researchers,
are now going to have to go back to their databases and make
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be incredibly expensive and time-consuming,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Ralph Winter, writing for the three-judge panel that
made the ruling, held that ``there is no feature peculiar to the
databases at issue in this appeal that would cause us to view them
as `revisions.' Nexis is a database comprising thousands or
millions of individually retrievable articles taken from hundreds
or thousands of periodicals. It can hardly be deemed a `revision'
of each edition of every periodical that it contains.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case refers specifically to publication of material on
electronic databases, lawyers involved in the case said it would
almost certainly apply to publication of material on Web sites as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of technology outpacing the law of
contracts,'' said Elizabeth McNamara, who specializes in copyright
law. ``Arguably, each individual freelancer will be able to go to
the publisher and say you've got to compensate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on copyright law from the 2nd Circuit, copyright
experts say, are given widespread deference around the country
since so many copyright cases are litigated here in the unofficial
capital of the media industry. Lawyers for the three publishers
said Monday that they were studying the decision and had not yet
decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for New York Times
Co., said Monday, ``Certainly in the case of The New York Times,
our complete record is a historical archive. If one takes this
decision at its word it would seem to require, absent an agreement
with the freelancers, that we delete articles that were part of
that historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This opinion's effect appears to be tampering with
the historic record. That is very problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers' Union
and the lead plaintiff in the case, was jubilant Monday at the
panel's decision to overturn the U.S. District Court ruling by
Judge Sonia Sotomayor. ``Every single data provider now is at risk.
We could go into court tomorrow if we wanted and ask to shut down
every database.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters the writers' union sent to 22 publishers Monday,
Tasini argued that the ruling ``potentially puts your company at
great financial and legal risk.'' But, the letter added, ``we want
to emphasize that neither the NWU nor the freelance writing
community is seeking to undermine the distribution of magazine and
newspaper articles via online networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letter urged widespread adoption of a licensing
system that would allow publishers to obtain electronic rights to
works through the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, a group that
already handles licensing issues for some writers. The result,
Tasini said, would be a system analogous to that operating in the
music industry, in which organizations like BMI and ASCAP license
the use of music by anything from dance studios to high school
musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Society of Magazine Editors said
Monday that they had not had time to review the decision and could
not comment on it until they did. And lawyers for the publishers
pointed out that the appeals court sent the case back to the
District Court with orders to craft a final order. ``Of course as
you know we don't have an order yet, so we don't know the precise
contours of our obligations,'' said Robin Bierstedt, the deputy
general counsel at Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Felch, the lawyer for Tasini and the other writers,
disagreed, saying ``the opinion is the opinion,'' and the order
could not modify it, only follow it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the lawyers involved in the case said, the decision
will give freelancers the ability to negotiate richer contracts. As
Rubin pointed out, since the Web knows no geography, electronic
rights are tantamount to worldwide rights. ``Worldwide rights
always cost more than domestic rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, as Rubin and other experts noted, publishers
usually can set their own terms. ``If, in fact, many writers like
to think of themselves as starving, they'll capitulate to the new
terms. Important writers won't.'' Nonetheless, he believes that
publishers may well find themselves readjusting their contract
scales upward as a result of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers started selling their archives to databases like
Lexis-Nexis or Dow Jones Interactive in the early 1980s. Lexis and
Nexis were owned by Mead Data Central when the lawsuit was filed in
1993, but in 1995 were sold to Reed Elsevier PLC, a British-Dutch
conglomerate, which paid $1.5 billion for the electronic legal and
news retrieval business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tasini said in a telephone interview Monday, ``Way back when
this first started they should have been smart and come to writers
and asked permission. Now it's going to cost them more, because
they were arrogant and walked all over us and didn't bother to ask
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But several lawyers for the publishers said that the statute of
limitations on copyright violation lasts only three years; if the
copyright violations were said to have occurred only when the
material was first put into a database, in many cases writers would
have lost their chance to file a complaint.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBARA, Japan _ In the center of this verdant peninsula, just
east of Tokyo, is one of the world's largest computer-screen
factories, where hundreds of humming robots and uniformed workers
in clean rooms assemble 200,000 flat panels a month.
</P>
<P>
   The factory operates around the clock. Workers have taken no
vacations for more than a year. But they still cannot work fast
enough to feed the enormous appetite for the flat-panel screens,
used in computer notebooks, video games, communications terminals
and now, increasingly, in desktop monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are operating nonstop at full capacity, and we
have more orders than we can possibly fill,'' said Zenzo Tajima,
product manager for Hitachi Ltd.'s displays division, which expects
its sales of the flat screens, known as liquid crystal displays, or
LCDs, to more than double this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Business is booming for flat-screen manufacturers across Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan. The main reason is a surge in demand from
consumers and businesses around the world for personal computers
and other electronic devices that feature the flat screens, which
are increasingly appealing because they save space, look stylish
and are technologically capable of providing brilliant color images
and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the screens is so strong that Asian producers cannot
fill 10 percent to 20 percent of orders, industry analysts and
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake that struck Taiwan last Tuesday could worsen the
shortage if manufacturers based there cannot quickly restart
production. Power failures could delay screen-making assembly lines
on Taiwan for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screen makers will see a huge jump in revenues this year,''
said David Mentley, a vice president at Stanford Resources Inc., a
market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the sales of advanced flat screens used
in laptops and desk monitors will reach $11 billion this year, up
from $7 billion last year, and that sales could reach $15 billion
in 2000 and $17 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While the shortfall has been a boon to screen producers after
years of oversupply that depressed prices and profits, it has
created big headaches for computer makers like IBM, Dell Computer
and Toshiba, which are scrambling to satisfy the appetite of
customers for notebook computers and large desktop monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has come at an awkward time. The back-to-school
buying season has been under way for weeks, and the year-end
holiday gift season is just a couple of months away. Many parents
and students are shopping for personal computers. Moreover,
companies are upgrading their computer equipment in advance of the
new millennium. Many want to get rid of the clunky cathode-ray tube
monitors that dominate their desk space and replace them with flat
screens.
</P>
<P>
   But computer industry analysts say that neither large nor small
customers are finding the discounts on notebooks and other computer
equipment that they encountered at this time last year. That partly
reflects the limited supplies of screens, which have helped push up
the prices that screen manufacturers are charging computer makers
by about 20 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also find that they often cannot buy the machine they
want without a long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Maixner, a first-year MBA student at Babson College
outside Boston, said Dell Computer's representatives told her it
would take at least three weeks to ship a popular $2,800 laptop
model with a 14-inch screen. Dell, which helped pioneer direct
sales of computers to consumers, typically can ship an order within
five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they told me, that there's one supplier for the
entire industry for this size screen,'' Ms. Maixner, 26, said.
``And they said, `You're welcome to call anyone else, but you're
going to have the same problem anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Neisha Frank, a spokeswoman for Dell Computer, acknowledged that
the shortage had forced the computer maker to extend its normal
lead time for product delivery. ``Some large corporate customers
cannot get what they want right away,'' Ms. Frank said. ``Yes, we
could be selling more if it were not for the LCD shortage, but
exactly how much more, who can say?''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, corporate customers are waiting several months
for delivery of popular models of computer notebooks and large
desktop monitors with advanced flat screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``All personal-computer makers are feeling the impact of this
shortage, because they can't make or sell as much product as they
would like,'' Masahiro Ono, a Tokyo-based analyst for Wahlberg
Securities, said. ``They also can't offer low discounts that
consumers like, because the companies are paying more for what used
to be an insignificant part of the computer _ the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that the company was experiencing record demand for its
Thinkpad notebooks and that despite the screen shortage, it was
meeting the needs of most long-term customers. New customers,
however, are facing delays, which the company declined to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Rick McGee, an IBM vice president, said that because of the
shortage, IBM was paying 30 percent to 40 percent more for flat
screens but that the increase had not been passed on to consumers,
because the company had significantly reduced the cost of other
components in its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. computer companies said the shortage had affected them
only slightly. ``We haven't had trouble getting a steady supply of
LCDs from our supplier, but it has been hard to get them at a good
price,'' Ray Aldrick, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., said.
``It used to be the processor was the most expensive part of a
personal computer, but now it's the flat panel display.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway Inc., which recently introduced a desktop flat-panel
model, called Profile, said that it had encountered no difficulty
meeting demand for laptops or desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage in flat-screen production is partly rooted in
demand for larger screens in notebooks and desktop computers. At
the same time, Asian manufacturers, hurt by the region's severe
economic slump a few years ago, cannot increase production quickly,
because they failed to make necessary capital investments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, responding to consumer requests for larger screens,
manufacturers shifted production of standard 12-inch displays to
13-, 14- and 15-inch screens. That reduced the number of screens
they could produce from the same raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in consumer tastes and the industry's seeming
inability to foresee it has also contributed to the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers want bigger, finer-looking screens with brighter
colors and less battery power,'' said Aston Bridgman, a spokesman
for NEC Corp., which makes flat-panel screens. ``That's what's
driving this surge in demand for LCDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many panel makers and industry analysts expect the shortage to
continue for another six months to a year, as worldwide demand for
computers continues to grow. Analysts, however, expect the shortage
to abate by the third quarter of 2000, when new factories begin
production. Eventually, supply will once again outweigh demand and
prices will drop, these analysts said.

   The industry shortage underscores how dependent the United
States is on Asia for flat-panel screens. While U.S. companies have
the basic technology to make them, they have been reluctant to
invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build
large-scale factories.
</P>
<P>
   Japan accounts for about 63 percent of global production of the
flat-panel screens, while South Korea contributes 36 percent and
Taiwan about 1 percent, according to an industry study by ING
Barings Securities. The brokerage firm expects those percentages to
shift to 52 percent for Japan, 30 percent for Korea and 18 percent
for Taiwan next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``American computer companies had their chance to invest in LCD
manufacturing years ago, but they chose to let the Japanese and
Koreans duke it out, spending tens of millions of dollars on new
factories,'' Mentley of Stanford Research said. ``I don't think
that the LCD guys have a lot of sympathy for these computer
companies that have been squeezing them all these years.''

AN INDEX-FUND PIONEER TRIES LIFE AS AN ANGEL  
 E-COMMERCE IS GETTING A HIGH-OCTANE PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems a leap across the chasm of investing. A man once called
the king of can't-beat-the-market index funds becomes a partner in
a so-called angel fund, which specializes in picking Internet
start-ups worthy of seed investments.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Grauer, who headed the $575 billion Barclays Global
Investors funds until last year, contends that the two worlds of
investing are not so different. He notes that Barclays Global
Investors has 140 separate funds in its portfolio. ``Each one of
those was essentially a seed-level investment,'' said Grauer, 52.
``So I do have a lot of experience in working with innovative
businesses and getting them off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Grauer is officially starting Monday as a general partner in
Angel Investors LP. And Angel Investors itself is a vivid
illustration of both the changes that the Internet gold rush has
brought to Silicon Valley and the things that remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   For years, an angel investment meant the modest grubstake that a
new business required just to open its doors _ money that often
came from family and friends. The professional financing came
later, from venture capitalists, who would act as mentors to
fledgling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the huge money flows being directed at Internet
start-ups, Angel Investors represents an effort to make seed-stage
investing far more professional. Its first fund, which closed
earlier this year, is $30 million. Its second fund, scheduled to
close on Friday, is expected to raise $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Investors acts as a kind of farm team for the venture
capital firms, which no longer do as much early hand-holding of
young companies as they once did. Angel Investors typically invests
$200,000 to $400,000 in a start-up, nurtures it for three to six
months and then passes it along to the venture capital firms, while
retaining an ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is the importance of the human network that
is Silicon Valley. Angel Investors amounts to an invitation-only
club with four general partners, including Grauer, and nearly 200
investors. The investors in the second Angel fund, for example,
include James Barksdale, former president of Netscape; Marc
Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape; Kim Polese, chief executive of
Marimba; Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, and Esther
Dyson, editor of the newsletter Release 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   Grauer came to know Angel Investors' founder, Ron Conway, years
ago during a fund-raising drive at an elementary school in the
Silicon Valley community of Atherton, Calif. And last year he
renewed the contact when he was helping finance an Internet
start-up. ``I came to Angel Investors the classic Silicon Valley
way _ the network,'' he said.

   E-Commerce Is Getting a High-Octane Push
</P>
<P>
   Talk about self-serve. Tokheim Corp., the United States' largest
maker of gasoline pumps, is about to introduce a new line of
cyberpumps that would let customers get traffic updates, check the
weather and shop online while waiting for their tanks to fill.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, a longtime Tokheim customer, will be the first to test
the new pumps early next year, most likely in metropolitan Chicago
and other parts of the Midwest, said Jacques St. Denis, Tokheim's
executive vice president for worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new pumps, each with a 10-inch liquid-crystal-display
touch-screen, are to be connected to the Web through a variety of
Internet access providers, arranged by individual gasoline
companies and content providers, which would be able to tailor the
services to different markets.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, for example, the pumps might promote merchandise
for sale in the station's convenience store; in others, customers
might be able to print coupons or shop online for mail-order
delivery, using the same credit-card information they have provided
to pay for their gas.
</P>
<P>
   At some stations that are adjacent to fast-food restaurants,
customers might be able to place food orders and have them
delivered to their cars while they are still parked at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   St. Denis said he expected that gas pumps would be able to let
customers check their e-mail and, eventually, to transmit data like
maps and traffic information directly to in-car receivers.
``Anything you can do on the PC, you'll be able to do at the gas
pump,'' he said. Except crash, one hopes.

AT&AMP;T FACES ITS SPINOFF AS A RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, AT&AMP;T Corp. spun off its communications
equipment operation as Lucent Technologies Inc. in an attempt to
remove the crippling conflict among the equipment business and
AT&AMP;T's communications units.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a big success, almost certainly the most trenchant
that Robert E. Allen made as AT&AMP;T's chairman. Lucent, as an
independent equipment company, has gotten new business from
customers, including the Bell local phone operations, that had
grown wary of helping subsidize AT&AMP;T's telephone operation.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for the first time since the spinoff, AT&AMP;T and Lucent
may find themselves in conflict again, this time in the hot market
for communications consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the companies, who still sometimes speak of one
another as if they were in the same corporate family, could still
make a deal to keep everyone happy. But with Lucent and AT&AMP;T each
building consulting operations geared toward corporate clients and
with contracts potentially worth billions on the table, such an
accord could require exquisite diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The looming conflict was precipitated by Lucent's $3.7 billion
deal in August to acquire International Network Services Inc., a
sort of temp agency for high-powered network engineers. Since being
spun off from AT&AMP;T, Lucent has worked closely with its former
parent in a variety of ways. But Lucent intends to use the
International Network deal to bolster its Netcare consulting
operation. John L. Drew, chief executive of International Network,
is to lead the Netcare unit.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years AT&AMP;T has built its own AT&AMP;T Solutions
consulting and outsourcing operation into a multibillion-dollar
business. Moreover, AT&AMP;T has long relied on International Network
to supply engineers and networking experts for many of the big AT&AMP;T
corporate clients that may now become targets for Lucent Netcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very substantial relationship with INS as a supplier
to us, a key supplier to us, in working with us on a number of
engagements for major clients,'' said Jim Byrnes, an AT&AMP;T Solutions
spokesman, declining to comment further on the potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Solutions and Lucent Netcare operations do not appear
to overlap completely, but the companies' public statements alone
make it clear that the two units are approaching the same market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designing, building and managing global networks,'' reads the
headline on AT&AMP;T Solutions' Web site. ``That's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the news release announcing Lucent's deal for International
Network, Drew said, ``Our combined companies will offer customers a
level of service in designing, integrating and managing
next-generation networks that is simply unmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the companies said that AT&AMP;T and Lucent
would probably strike a deal to give AT&AMP;T continued access to
International Network personnel. In exchange, it seems likely that
Lucent would want to become some sort of preferential equipment
supplier to AT&AMP;T Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always partnered with AT&AMP;T Solutions, and when we
acquire INS, that will continue,'' said Kathy Fitzgerald, a Lucent
spokeswoman, declining to comment specifically on how such an
arrangement could be structured.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, however, is Cisco Systems Inc., the data
communications equipment giant that is Lucent's rival. AT&AMP;T does a
lot of business with both Lucent and Cisco, which could make it
tricky for AT&AMP;T to make a side deal with Lucent.

FOUNDER OF YEAR 2000 SERVICE QUITS TO TRY DIFFERENT APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that people are losing interest in efforts to organize
neighborhoods and communities for potential Year 2000 computer
threats, the co-founder of an Internet-based clearinghouse for such
grass-roots activities has resigned as the service's research
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have hit a wall,'' said Paloma O'Riley, who
co-founded the clearinghouse, the Cassandra Project, in June of
1997. Her activism brought invitations to testify before Congress
and made her a leader in the pursuit of grass-roots responses to
potential Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are developing a false sense of security,'' she said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Far from abandoning Year 2000 work, though, Ms. O'Riley said she
was leaving Cassandra to press public officials to prepare more
aggressively for possible disasters. Her new focus on political
advocacy might have jeopardized Cassandra's tax-exempt status had
she stayed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra (www.cassandraproject.org) will continue under
Catherine Moyer, a Denver-based database designer who co-founded
the group and had already assumed much of the public-appearance
responsibilities from Ms. O'Riley in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The clearinghouse is being redesigned to focus more on specific
areas of concern, including preparations at mental health centers
and environmental threats from Year 2000 problems, Ms. Moyer said.
The site lists several hundred Year 2000 community groups in the
United States and overseas, but no one is sure how many are active.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley said advocates of individual and community
preparedness had been undermined by the steadily increasing
drumbeat of optimistic news about the nation's readiness for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow, she said, was the recent assertion by the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that there was a
``negligible'' chance of widespread disruption of banks and other
key institutions in the United States. Greenspan warned that fear
of Year 2000 disruptions was more likely to hurt the economy than
was the computer problem itself, especially if people emptied
grocery store shelves and bank accounts in anticipation of
widespread disasters when computers failed to recognize ``00'' as
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the current atmosphere, Ms. O'Riley said, even those
officials who believe that it makes sense to prepare for
disruptions like loss of power, phones or water are afraid they
will be stymied and exposed to ridicule if they act on those
beliefs. To counter the inertia, Ms. O'Riley is hoping to come up
with ways to make local officials believe that they could face
legal or financial liabilities if their failure to act results in
breakdowns in local services or public safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Davis, a former computer manager for Montgomery
County, Md., who frequently works with community-based Year 2000
programs, said: ``Threatening to hold government officials
accountable is a tough way to get them to act. I wish her luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley, a 44-year-old New York native, became a believer in
the value of self-sufficiency while living in rural Alaska with her
husband and two sons in the 1980s. She first encountered Year 2000
computer issues as a computer security officer at a naval Hospital
in 1990 during the war in the Persian Gulf. A stint as the Year
2000 project manager for Rover Group Ltd. in England several years
later convinced her that disruptions could be global and
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley decided to leave Rover and concentrate on raising
public awareness of the potential Year 2000 threat. She and her
husband, Kevin, chose Colorado as their base of operations. O'Riley
is a mechanical engineer at Maxtor Corp., a maker of computer hard
drives in Longmont, Colo., and is active in that company's Year
2000 program.

THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR MANY INTERNET COMPANIES IS FULFILLING
ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies involved in e-commerce have achieved most-envied
status in the late 1990s business world with their riches from
initial public offerings, gaudy marketing budgets and news
clippings that laud them as pioneers of an industrial
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the glamour, then, it is not a little ironic that the
most important issue facing the industry is the retail function
with the least boardroom cachet: order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Picking, packing and shipping products was difficult enough in
recent years for Internet retailers who had no experience in such
matters. But with consumers' expectations rising and e-commerce
companies preparing to ship a wider array of merchandise to
customers this holiday season, distribution issues now loom even
larger than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is emerging as a huge issue,'' said John Hagel, who leads
the e-commerce practice for McKinsey &AMP; Co., a consulting firm.
``And it's a real bottleneck to growth. Too many companies started
with the assumption that the challenge was getting people to buy
things, when, in fact, the real challenge is getting it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm,
Web retailers will ship roughly 230 million packages this year _
mostly during the holiday season. Large companies like PlanetRx and
Etoys ship more than 1,000 packages daily, while the industry
behemoth, Amazon.com, ships more than 10,000 a day. And last week,
the research firm of Jupiter Communications predicted that the
busiest sites, including Amazon, CDNow and Barnesandnoble.com, may
each reach 58,000 transactions a day in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   That process is rife with potential pitfalls and inefficiencies.
In their infancy, most merchants simply took customers' orders, had
those orders delivered by a distributor and hoped that the items
were in stock and shipped on time to the right people. In those
days, which, in some cases, extend to today, customers could all
but count on e-mail telling them the items they had ordered were
out of stock or would be shipped late.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is starting to halt such practices. To gain customer
allegiance, Internet merchants are seeking more control over the
shipping process. In many instances, most notably in the case of
Amazon, they are building huge warehouses of their own near major
shipping hubs. But because a high-technology distribution center
can take two to three years to complete, Internet merchants are
scrambling to find third parties to handle distribution for them.
Two leaders in this category are Federated's Fingerhut Business
Services Inc. and Hanover Direct's Keystone Fulfillment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone handles fulfillment for Mercata, KBkids and Dress Barn,
while Fingerhut does the same for Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss and Etoys,
among others. Fingerhut's 1.2-million-square-foot distribution
center in Provo, Utah, will employ up to 1,200 workers during the
holiday peak, processing orders, shipping items and handling
returns.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of many e-commerce executives, such arrangements
entail far more than simply writing a check and getting back to the
business of planning the company's initial public offering. Because
consumers are increasingly demanding so-called real time inventory,
which includes access to information about product availability and
shipping status, distribution warehouses must be closely wired to
the merchant's Web operations. Third-party distributors, however,
typically have their own electronic tracking and ordering systems,
which require painstaking efforts to link with the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every order, we have to pass information to their
system,'' said Louis Zambello, senior vice president of Etoys,
which recently began shipping products from Fingerhut's Utah
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warehouse then has to pass it back to us for
confirmation,'' Zambello said. ``When the item ships, that
information goes to us for confirmation. When they get inventory in
stock, that also has to go to our system, and if you do anything
special for the customer, it has to flow from you to the
outsourcer, back to you for confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Integrating the retailer's computer system with the
distributor's, he said, ``takes dozens of people on both sides
working long hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambello added, ``The misconception is that outsourcing is
easier, but it's just different.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Etoys and Fingerhut would not disclose the costs
associated with building warehouses or maintaining outsourcing
relationships, Rakesh Kaul, president and chief executive of
Hanover Direct, said the costs for both options could be steep.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can expect to pay between $60 million and $80 million
to build a one-million-square-foot warehouse, Kaul said, while they
would pay a third-party distributor roughly 10 percent of each sale
to fulfill their orders. In building distribution centers of their
own, e-commerce companies ``have to bear in mind fixed costs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like owning a 747,'' Kaul said. ``You have to be big, or
fortunate enough to fill it, because if you don't fill it and
operate all the time, you're guaranteed to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel of McKinsey agreed. ``Unless you do high volume, it
doesn't make sense to build this capacity in the long run. There
are significant economies of skill and scale in these businesses,''
he said, referring to third-party distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining assistance from fulfillment experts will be even more
critical, Hagel said, as e-commerce companies evolve. Not only will
Web retailers increasingly seek to sell products abroad _ an
exercise that presents logistical nightmares _ but they will also
be pushed by consumers to even greater levels of service, including
customized products.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, though, Hagel said, Internet retailers are
complicating matters by broadening their product selection in an
effort to increase the amount spent by each customer. That means
potentially shipping multiple items from multiple points, using
different shippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, I understand the importance of that as a way to
derive more revenue from customers,'' Hagel said. ``But on the
other hand, if these companies think they've been challenged by
fulfillment issues to date, it's nothing compared to what's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the sudden ascendancy of fulfillment is
vindicating a segment of the business world that has long since
suffered from a lack of respect. ``We used to be those guys in the
dirty suits out there,'' said John Buck, president of Fingerhut
Business Services. ``Would you believe that fulfillment is the
darling of the day? It's actually stunning to me.''

COMPUSERVE, AS AOL'S BRAND NO. 2, IS BEING REJUVENATED

 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a conglomerate-driven world, investors expect big companies
to own more than one brand. Viacom operates MTV and VH1. Coca-Cola
sells Diet Coke and Tab.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this business model can work in the
still-forming and highly volatile market of Internet service
providers. The first such attempt in this industry _ America
Online's ownership of its former rival, Compuserve _ suggests that
the answer is yes, even if serious challenges remain in keeping the
new brand profitable.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said last week that so far in its fiscal first
quarter, which will end on Thursday, the long-struggling Compuserve
added 300,000 subscribers. Although the company declines to give a
total subscribership, industry estimates now place the figure at
2.3 million _ which would still be well below Compuserve's peak of
3.6 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there is an easy explanation for the recent
upswing: Since the quarter began, Compuserve has offered cash
rebates to new subscribers who buy certain brands of computers and
agree to sign up for three years of Internet access at $21.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The rebates notwithstanding, AOL executives consider the surge
in Compuserve subscriptions a sign of healthy growth in a cutthroat
industry, and a measure of redemption. When the company acquired
Compuserve in 1997, it predicted the dawning of a multiple-brand
era in the Internet access market, a view that industry analysts
doubted would be fulfilled so soon.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's premise is that the Internet access market will
fragment into different consumer tiers _ budget or ``value'' tiers,
premium tiers and various other levels in between. The company
considers the America Online brand a premium service, for which
subscribers pay $21.95 a month, without rebates, for fare including
19 separate topic ``channels,'' 15,000 chat rooms and a wildly
popular instant-messaging capability. The company considers
Compuserve, which these days is a glorified Internet access
provider offering a smattering of content and chat, a ``value''
brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Hertz and Budget,'' said Audrey Weil, a senior vice
president of AOL and general manager of Compuserve. ``Hertz is the
largest and most dominant,'' Ms. Weil said, ``but Budget has a
brand name you've heard of and that is a good alternative in the
value space.'' The analogy extends only so far, of course: Hertz
does not own Budget, and in some places, their rental rates are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reasoning differs from the conventional wisdom
about the market for Internet service providers. Until very
recently, many industry executives and analysts predicted that
providing Internet access service was a business that would go the
way of utilities; as with electricity, consumers would care little
who provided access so long as the electrons flowed.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online executives have taken a different view,
especially the company's president and chief operating officer,
Robert W. Pittman. Formerly president of MTV Networks, Pittman
oversaw development of the VH1 brand in 1985 (which at the time he
said he envisioned as MTV for ``old folks, dullard, the not so
hip'') and he is a flag-waver for the many-brand business model.
</P>
<P>
   So is Steve Case, America Online's chairman, who in an interview
cited AOL's acquisitions of Netscape and the instant-messaging
service ICQ. ``We've migrated into being a multibrand company,''
Case said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Compuserve brand specifically will thrive
remains in question. Before the recent rash of Compuserve
subscriptions, membership had been languishing since America
Online's 1997 deal to acquire Compuserve, which had suffered a long
decline under the ownership of H &AMP; R Block. Elsewhere, though, the
Internet access market has been booming _ led by America Online's
own flagship service, which has grown to more than 18 million from
11 million since the company bought Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the purchase, America Online laid off 500
Compuserve employees and began to shift back-room and technology
operations from Compuserve headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, to the
parent company's home in Reston, Va. America Online says that by
sharing such costs, it was immediately able to turn Compuserve
profitable, although it has declined to give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the first real subscriber growth by Compuserve under
its new ownership has come only since America Online began offering
the rebates _ $400 with the purchase of certain computers, if a
subscriber signs up for three years of Compuserve, and $100 with PC
purchases if the customer agrees to a one-year subscription. The
viability of this business model has been questioned by competitors
and some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $400 rebate up front is uneconomical; they're not going to
make any money,'' said Charles Betty, president and chief executive
of Earthlink, which agreed last week to a merger with Mindspring
that would form the nation's second-largest Internet service
provider after America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the rebate offer of $400 a customer _ which does not
include Compuserve's marketing costs _ exceeds the $180 to $200
that Betty said Earthlink pays to gain a new subscriber. But
Pittman, while declining to give specific figures, said Compuserve
can operate in the black under the rebate arrangement because of
its technology-sharing relationship with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after the price buyer,'' Pittman said, adding
that Compuserve would accept lower profit margins than AOL. ``We
will live with the smallest margin we can live with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other outstanding questions. A survey this month by
J.D. Power &AMP; Associates of customer satisfaction among seven top
Internet service providers found that Compuserve ranked second from
the bottom and America Online ranked dead last, according to Peter
Dresch, director of media relations for J.D. Power in Agoura Hills,
Calif. The others, in descending rank of satisfaction, were
Mindspring, Earthlink, AT&AMP;T Worldnet, Microsoft MSN and Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Compuserve, customers ranked the service as below
average in four of the survey's categories: cost and billing,
e-mail services, navigation and ease of use. Ms. Weil, of
Compuserve, said she expected consumer responses to improve with
time.
</P>
<P>
   AOL challenged the survey, asserting that it included few users
of the latest version of Compuserve _ Compuserve 2000, which was
introduced in February. The J.D. Power survey was conducted
starting in July, but the bulk of Compuserve 2000 users, AOL said,
were added after the survey was conducted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two decades old, Compuserve was among the first big-name online
communities, and it was originally populated with technology-savvy,
business-oriented subscribers for whom Compuserve was both a
community and a research tool. It was also among the first services
to substantially expand overseas, but its growth languished as the
emergence of the Internet spelled the end of proprietary online
communities built on the old Compuserve model.
</P>
<P>
   The new crowd of price-oriented users is a different breed.
America Online maintains an existing hourly pricing plan for what
it calls the ``classic'' Compuserve clientele, vs. people who opt
for the Compuserve 2000 service to which the rebates apply.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of America Online's acquisition of Compuserve, there
was much gnashing of teeth by old-guard users about the arrival of
the newbies. But such tensions seem to have passed, said Mike
Bayer, who has been a Compuserve member since 1981 and a volunteer
system operator for Compuserve since 1984 and is now an online
forum leader. The company declines to say how many current
customers are holdovers from the old days, but Bayer estimates that
it is about one-third of the total.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a question about whether Compuserve's success
might be a burden to America Online, if the popularity of the
rebates could cannibalize the premium brand, said Scott E. Reamer,
director of Internet research for S.G. Cowen, the New York-based
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reamer said investors would want to watch the next several
quarters carefully to see if America Online can continue its own
impressive growth while Compuserve grows, too. But right now, he
said, the Compuserve acquisition is starting to look good for
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really expected much from Compuserve when AOL bought
it,'' he said. ``They've turned it around.''

Cox Communications, Liberate Technologies agree on deal 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cable TV provider Cox Communications has inked a deal
with a software developer who will provide such interactive
services as online gaming and Internet access through the company's
digital set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is with Liberate Technologies, a software developer
based in San Carlos, Calif., that makes a product called the
Liberate Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Cox Communications plans to use Liberate's
technology to eventually offer a host of new interactive services.
But the company is still deciding exactly what applications to
offer, at what price and in what cities. It does plan to begin
testing the service by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is good news for another Atlanta-based company,
Scientific-Atlanta. It makes the digital network, called Explorer
2000, that will enable Liberate's technology to be used by Cox
Communications customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox is committed to bringing enhanced entertainment and
information services to its customers,'' says Tom Nagel, the
company's vice president of business development. ``Liberate's
open, customizable (sic) and highly advanced solution will allow us
to provide customers interactive features and services to enrich
their interactive television experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberate is no stranger to either Cox Communications or the
cable TV industry. The company has raised $50 million in financing
from Cox Communications, Comcast, MediaOne and other cable
operators.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in Liberate include America Online, General
Instrument, Lucent Technologies, Nintendo and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   This investment has helped finance Liberate's development of
software that enables interactive services through the cable TV
industry's new digital cable networks. These networks are slowly
rolling out nationwide, including metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is the country's fifth largest cable TV
operator, with 6 million customers nationwide. While based in
Atlanta, the company's only Georgia system is in Macon.

Printing electronic postage stamps at home is an idea that might
stick 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday soon, the conventional lick-it-and-stick-it-on postage
stamp may be as old-fashioned as the manual typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites on the World Wide Web now allow you to buy U.S.
postage stamps online and print the stamps at home, either using
special printers or your regular inkjet. A lot of people think that
e-stamps, as they're called, will eventually become the routine way
to buy stamps. But for now, it's still an infant technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders in the online stamp business is a Web site
called E-Stamp at www.estamp.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the site explains and sells its service: ``With our
Internet Postage service you can buy and print your own postage,
right from your PC. No more trips to the post office. No more
waiting in lines.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign up with E-Stamp, you pay $50 for a little electronic
gadget E-Stamp calls a vault. That's where the electronic credits
for stamps are stored. You also get the software you need to print
the stamps, $25 worth of postage stamps, some mailing labels and a
CD that helps you find addresses and ZIP codes. After you've
started, you can buy more stamp credits from the Web site. You'll
pay what the company calls a ``convenience'' fee of 10 percent over
the face value of the stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The theory with E-Stamp and others is that you'll save money in
the long run because you can print out the right amount of postage
you need instead of just guessing and pasting on stamps until you
feel safe. The other advantage, which applies to all these
services, is the convenience of never running out of stamps (unless
you run out of money to buy more electronic stamps).
</P>
<P>
   The other big player in the electronic stamp arena is Pitney
Bowes (www.pitneybowes.com/). You've undoubtedly heard of that
company and probably associate it with the postage machines it has
sold to businesses for years.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the machines that allow businesses to print out
postage as they need it. In fact, these stand-alone postage
machines are the model for most Internet stamp services.
</P>
<P>
   Things are moving a little slow over at Pitney Bowes when it
comes to online postage. You won't find a mention of the service on
the home page. But if you click around enough (or just go to
www.pitneyworks.com/internetpostage/index.html), you'll find an
explanation of how Pitney Bowes is handling Internet postage.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get to the page, you'll find that the stamp program is
still in the beta test stage there. When checked last week, no new
beta test customers were being accepted. But, based on what the
page has to say about the program, it'll work very similar to the
E-Stamp program. You'll be able to print the stamps out with your
printer.
</P>
<P>
   Still another company offers online postage. That's Compaq, the
Houston-based manufacturer of personal computers. You can read
about the offer (which is identical to the E-Stamp offer, including
the 10 percent ``convenience'' fee) at
www.compaq.com/smb/onlineservices/postage.html. The reason, by the
way, that the two offers are identical is that if you press the
link to buy the Compaq service, you'll be whisked to the E-Stamp
page.

Dell signs multi-billion dollar agreement with IBM 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp., continuing to expand its
offerings beyond the build-to-order personal computers that made
the company famous, said Monday it signed another multi-billion
agreement with IBM Corp. that will help Dell move up the computer
industry's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the world's biggest computer company, will install and
maintain Dell equipment for government agencies, schools and major
corporate accounts in an alliance valued at $6 billion over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   With a separate $16 billion pact announced in March that gives
Dell access to IBM components, Monday's deal adds up to the biggest
alliance in the industry's history, Dell Vice Chairman Kevin
Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as a strategic relationship that will continue to
evolve over time,'' Rollins said during a press conference in New
York. While Dell shows little desire to be Little Blue _ a smaller
version of IBM, _ the Round Rock-based company continues to add
products and services that broaden its appeal beyond the desktop
that launched its business in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Dell has announced a variety of programs _
from Internet access to an auction site for used computers and
accesssories to an online superstore of PC peripherals _ designed
to capture more of the consumer business.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell executives say those moves are a natural extension of
the company's contact with customers, they also provide continuing
revenue beyond the sale of a PC.
</P>
<P>
   What's pushing the changes at Dell _ and similar changes at
other PC makers _ is steadily declining prices for desktop
computers. Average PC prices are down about 13 percent from a year
ago, according to Forrester Research Inc., and after years of
growth, Forrester predicts consumer spending on PCs will begin to
decline next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention focused recently on Dell's overtures to
consumers, the company is only No. 6 in the market, according to
another research company, International Data Corp. Consumers
account for only about 15 percent of Dell's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're ever going to succeed as much as they
would like to in the consumer space,'' said Forrester's Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement is a reminder that Dell's primary focus
remains large corporate, government and educational customers that
accounted for most of the $11.7 billion in sales during the first
two fiscal quarters. Sales of workstations, servers and
data-storage products used by businesses and other organizations
increased by 85 percent in the second quarter over the same quarter
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement surprised some industry analysts more than the
March deal because it means one IBM division will become a key
partner in Dell's efforts to win business that IBM's money-losing
PC division may also be bidding for. Even for a fast-changing
industry that is forcing former foes into strategic alliances, the
Dell-IBM agreement is unusual, said Eric Rocco, an analyst with
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a situation where Dell is using a neck-and-neck
competitor to do its service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has similar service alliances with companies such as
GetronicsWang, Unisys Corp., NCR Corp. and BancTec, which provide
large Dell customers a range of services, from designing and
installing systems to offering simple repairs, known in the
industry as ``break-fix'' repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But with offices in 162 foreign cities, 131,000 employees and
22,000 field technicians, IBM significantly bolsters the services
that Dell can offer. Those services initially will be limited to
U.S. customers when the program is started in the first quarter of
next year, but they will expand overseas in subsequent months,
Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Senior Vice President Rosendo Parra said Monday that many
large customers indicated they would do more business with Dell if
they could get service from IBM. That created the dilemma of
forming a close linkage with someone that Dell regularly bids
against for corporate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers first brought the companies together, it was
very awkward,'' Parra said. ``The thought was, here's one of our
competitors for hardware servicing our machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Monday's deal, IBM had to convince Dell that its
technicians wouldn't favor IBM PCs over Dell machines, Parra said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell executives say computer services can be a $10 billion
business for the company in several years _ up from an estimated
$1.4 billion last year _ they have no plans to grow a large
computer-services organization. Dell's in-house service operation _
small by industry measures _ has only about 3,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives point to Compaq Computer Corp.'s stumble this
spring as vindication for their strategy of partnering with
established service providers instead of acquiring them.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's problems, including staggering losses and the departure
earlier this year of its chief executive and a handful of other top
executives, are blamed in part on Compaq's inability to mesh
Digital Equipment Corp.'s culture with its own.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts nearly unanimously praised Compaq's decision to
purchase DEC in the months following the January 1998 announcement
because Digital had a worldwide services operation. At the time,
many pointedly warned that Dell risked falling behind its top
competitors unless it acquired a service provider such as Unisys or
what was then Wang Global.
</P>
<P>
   That advice is less common these days, as Dell has consistently
been the most profitable and fastest-growing PC company.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with analysts, Chief Executive Michael Dell
reiterated that he thinks his company can make money off the
burgeoning services industry _ expected to be a $500 billion market
by 2003 _ without a large in-house operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the sweet spot of profit opportunity for us is not
deploying arms and legs in a break-fix context,'' he said.

Web cam watchers can see a lot 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Web cams, one guesses, are a lot like a NASCAR race:
People watch to see something interesting happen.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-day race, it might be a wreck. With Web cams, the
most popular of which broadcasts live shots of a woman's bedroom,
it's nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Yahoo Internet Life magazine profiles the
33-year-old woman behind Anacam.com. Since 1997, when Ana put a
camera in her bedroom and broadcast images of her and her boyfriend
having sex, Anacam.com has attracted more and more visitors. She
estimates receiving up to 22,000 viewers every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Life issue also includes lists of Web cameras that
aren't trained on people. One site, www.windows2000.com, is a
compilation of Web cameras divided by state. At www.earthcam.com,
things are organized by subject: traffic cameras, weather cameras,
scenic cameras, and weird and bizarre cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The new issue also lists one Web site serving a niche market:
wired truckers. The site, www.drivernet.com, lists each of its 375
e-mail terminals at truck stops in the continental United States.
The service is free, and it gives truckers a free e-mail address to
use while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Life also examines free Internet connections. Companies
like Microworkz, AltaVista and NetZero offer free connections to
anyone willing to sift through advertising. All you America Online
users might be thinking, ``Hey, I'm already sifting through ads,
and I'm paying $21.95 a month for it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The free ISP service requires you to download software and
register. Once enrolled, a user sees advertisements on his or her
PC screen the whole time they're on the already-ad-riddled
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Europe, the services apparently are selling well. But
Americans have been less likely to be moved to save $10 to $20 a
month while seeing even more online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ The magazine also helps you tell the difference between a bad
e-mailer and a good one. A good e-mailer sends you only the files
you asked for. A bad e-mailer sends you the ``Best Net Jokes of
1998'' with a Microsoft Word virus attached. A bad e-mailer catches
up by writing a simple, ``Hi ... what's up? Write me when you have
a chance.'' A bad e-mailer sends ``a tacky e-mail greeting showing
a) a furry white kitten, b) a hot-air balloon, and c) a kitten in a
hot-air balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   RING OUT THE MILLENNIUM AT TIMES SQUARE SITE
</P>
<P>
   If fear of the Y2K bug is keeping you landlocked this New Year's
Eve and you don't feel like driving to New York, the Internet might
be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   A site, www.timessquare.com/, which was scheduled to open last
week, hopes to be the gathering place for people who can't make it
to Times Square and can't watch the ball drop on television.
</P>
<P>
   The site will broadcast the New Year's Eve celebration,
including the lowering of the ball. In the spring, the site will
become TimesSquareAlive.com, an entertainment and information site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is expected to feature online auctions, ticket sales
and Times Square merchandise. Earthcam.com will place cameras at
different points on Times Square and broadcast the images on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also hope to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadcast the New Year's Eve midnight celebrations in Paris,
London, Tokyo and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer a contest asking the question, ``What are you planning
to do in the last 60 seconds of the millennium?'' Prizes include
New Year's Eve travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer the ability to chat and message during the New Year's
Eve celebration. Some messages will be broadcast on the big video
screens in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING PROTECTION FOR ONLINE PURCHASES
</P>
<P>
   Interested in taking advantage of the price and convenience of
Internet shopping but still leery about buying something you
haven't touched? A company, WebAssured.com, is offering purchase
protection for merchants and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, located at www.webassured.com, is offering what it
claims is the Internet's first online purchase-protection program.
The protection offer is underwritten by Lloyd's of London.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes places where people can make laudatory
comments about online retailers as well as post warnings about
shady companies.

When HTML fails, there's always solitaire 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Rogers e-mails me with an interesting computer
problem. The reason it is interesting, incidentally, is because (1)
It might happen to you and (2) I happen to know the answer. I get a
lot of questions that aren't of much interest, because although (1)
It might happen to you, (2) I don't have a clue about how to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Gateway G6-300 computer, equipped with Windows 98 and
the Word 97 word processor,'' Mr. Rogers writes. ``My problem stems
from opening e-mail and other text from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening it, I mean that sometimes I save e-mail news
articles and other information in my computer. Sometimes, it is a
hassle trying to open some of this information, and sometimes, the
documents will not open at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I save a file is that I go to the File function on the
toolbar, and to Save As on the dropdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the save window, I save in `My Documents' and as HTML
files. The files save, but when I try to open them with Word 97, a
lot of them won't open. Am I doing something wrong, or is there a
better way of saving files off the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Rogers, the only surprise here is that any of them
open. As best I recall, an HTML reader was an add-on feature for
early versions of Word 97. You had to download it, and it would
attach itself to the word processor. Otherwise, Word 97 would be
unlikely to open any HTML file.
</P>
<P>
   HTML, of course, is hypertext code, the simple language with
which Web sites are written.
</P>
<P>
   All you need do is save the file as text instead of HTML. Then
you should be able to open it as a text file.
</P>
<P>
   You can also, obviously, open an HTML file with the browser that
saved it. Just use the Open command in the File menu.
</P>
<P>
   I am getting more and more message attachments couched in HTML.
It's really an aggravation, because Lotus Notes, perhaps the most
misbegotten program ever inflicted upon an unsuspecting public in
the last few years, won't read HTML. For that matter, I don't
believe the e-mail program I use at home _ Eudora _ reads it
either. Most of these messages, I imagine, come from folks using
Navigator or Explorer to send messages.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still getting the occasional epistle regarding solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bunny? She's the lady who told me you haven't lived
until you've run up a big score turning one card at a time. I don't
remember what that score was, but Joy Cawley does.
</P>
<P>
   Joy asks me to tell Bunny that ``I play solitaire against the
clock with the three-card turnover and my best score to date is
8,704 in 87 seconds. She should definitely give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never played one-card turnover solitaire, which sounds kind
of like shooting fish in a barrel, but neither do I play against
the clock or watch the score. I have other things to do for
excitement, such as remembering the way to work every morning. I
play solitaire to relax and contemplate the nature of the universe
and the question of why, after all, frogs weren't given wings to
avoid all that wear and tear on their posteriors.

Windows challengers moving into spotlight 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The battle over which company will control the desktop
computer _ a battle many experts have long believed Microsoft
already won _ is about to heat up again. Many new challengers are
vying to replace Microsoft's Windows operating system. Read about
these systems and their chances for victory in the October issue of
PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Among the operating systems covered are BeOS 4.5 and Linux. The
magazine also takes a close look at the upcoming versions of
Windows, scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's list time again, and some of Atlanta's top entrepreneurs
have made Digitalsouth magazine's top high-tech entrepreneurs.
Topping the list in the October issue is Bert Ellis Jr., the
45-year-old chairman and chief executive of iXL Enterprises. Other
Atlantans on the list are WebMD founder Jeff Arnold, MindSpring
founder Charles Brewer and Media Metrix Vice Chairman Jeff Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a great deal for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its popular Word writing program in a new
package for iMac and iBook users. Called Word 98 Special Edition,
the package includes thousands of new clip art images and 100 new
greeting card templates, as well as Microsoft's free Web browser
and e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package retails for $99, about $200 less than previously
released versions of Word 98.
</P>
<P>
   First it was in movie theaters, then on computer screens. Now
you can experience George Lucas' ``Phantom Menace'' on Sony
PlayStation. LucasArts Entertainment has released a video game
based on the latest ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The latest news organization to join the Year 2000 bandwagon is
the Public Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Its member stations have run a series of stories about the
millennium bug and the potential problems it may cause. You can
read transcripts of these stories, view video clips from them and
research general information about Y2K at a special site PBS has
set up.
</P>

Microsoft's Word 98 a great deal 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't often get deals like this from software
giant Microsoft, which is also the largest developer of Macintosh
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering its popular word processor at a
two-thirds discount. And it's throwing in tons of new stuff to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Word 98, which is also part of the Microsoft
Office suite, was selling for around $330 in the Mac catalogs as a
stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft is offering the same program, with some added
templates, for $99 (after the mailing of a $30 rebate card). The
marketing pitch is that this version of Word is for iMac and iBook
users. But Word 98 Special Edition, as it is called, will work with
any Power Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, but don't know as a fact, that Microsoft lowered the
price to compete against a handful of challengers that have lowered
prices or offered free versions of their word processors.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect, for example, is now available for free via the
Internet. This program offers about 80 percent of Word's features
and was at one time Microsoft's leading competitor in the Mac word
processing market. You'll find this download at
www.corel.com/products
</P>
<P>
   /macintosh/wpmac35/packfreedownload
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus Writer, another first-rate word processor, is also
offering a free download of an earlier version of itself. This
program still has features, such as maintaining multiple
clipboards, that the Mac version of Word has yet to offer.
</P>
<P>
   While Nisus Writer and WordPerfect are each excellent programs,
Microsoft's current offering on Word is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For one, whether you like it or not, Word is the word processing
standard, especially in the office. Word 98 is probably the best
Mac version Microsoft has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Word 98 finally supports full drag-and-drop technology. It also
incorporates the look and feel of Apple Computer's latest operating
system, OS 8. It sports OS 8's platinum look, contextual menus and
extensive interactive help.
</P>
<P>
   Word even adds some small but handy innovations of its own.
Among the better ones are buttons that let you easily jump from
page to page, chart to chart or graphic to graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful feature is the document map, which lets you
easily navigate a book or report through an outline. Other features
include buttons that let you highlight text with a yellow marker
and add comments that appear only when you place your cursor over
marked text.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to sweeten the pot, Microsoft is throwing in with its
special edition of Word thousands of clip art images. There are
also 100 greeting card templates.

</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ I was at a fancy resort on Lake George,
at the annual meeting of the Business Council of New York. I'd just
moderated a panel discussion. Then somebody sent me to a booth at
the back of the conference building to pick up my bag of
complimentary gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The bags were just sitting there, one atop the other, bulging
with corporate golf shirts and pens and God knows what other
goodies. I was just going for mine when a tiny version of me,
dressed in a white robe and wearing a halo, popped up on my right
shoulder. I groaned. It was my pain-in-the-butt conscience.
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: Don't touch that! Don't even think about it. That's
graft.
</P>
<P>
   ME: Graft? Are you nuts? Everybody here gets one of those.
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: You're not a member of this group, are you? You
didn't pay a registration fee. You're a journalist, remember?
Journalists are not supposed to take stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I was just beginning to argue when another tiny version of me
popped up on my other shoulder. This one wore a bright red suit
with horns and a pitchfork. I recognized him instantly. His name is
Temptation. He drops by a lot, actually.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPTATION: Ah, don't be a jerk. You already turned your fee as
a moderator over to charity. You never touched the money. You won't
even get a freaking income tax deduction. Listen, you're in the
clear here. Besides, who'll ever know?
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: Don't listen to him! Has he ever given you any
advice you felt good about afterward?
</P>
<P>
   ME: Well, there was that time, before I was married, and ...
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: Don't even go there, Lynch. Just be a man and walk
away from that bag.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPTATION: Oh, get with the program. Everybody takes corporate
gifts. Just take a look at all those state legislators who got
wined and dined by Philip Morris, the tobacco conglomerate. The
Philip Morris lobbyist bought meals for Shelly Silver, the speaker
of the state Assembly. Also for Joe Bruno, the State Senate
majority leader. Meals were bought for Assemblyman Pat Casale, for
State Sen. Hugh Farley. Jim Seward, another state senator, also got
some good eats from Philip Morris. So did Assemblyman Ron
Canestrari. And you're sweating a lousy bag full of corporate
promotional items? What are you, a monk?
</P>
<P>
   ME: Hey, he's right, Conscience. Very few of our esteemed public
servants seem to harbor any reservations about taking corporate
gifts. So, why should I sweat it?
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: Oh, fine, terrific. So now the conduct of state
legislators is your standard of conduct, too. Isn't that wonderful?
You should be so proud of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ME: Well ...
</P>
<P>
   TEMPTATION: Forget about it, Lynch. It wasn't just the state
legislators. How about Jim Natoli, Gov. George Pataki's director of
state operations, and his family? How about Rap Rappleyea, the head
of the New York state power authority? Philip Morris bought them
fancy meals, too. And you're sweating a windbreaker and a few
corporate memo pads?
</P>
<P>
   ME: Gee, I really don't know.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPTATION: Hey, look at it this way: Twice now, the governor
has made big, fancy trips to Hungary. He got into that Alex Haley
``Roots'' thing, I guess. And who paid for those trips? How about
the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ME: Yeah? So?
</P>
<P>
   TEMPTATION: But who donated 30 grand to the chamber about the
time of those two trips? Philip Morris, that's who. And who'd never
given a nickel to that outfit before George Pataki decided to do
his ``Roots'' routine in Hungary? Philip Morris, that's who. And
you're sweating this little bag _ his little, tiny, insignificant
bag?
</P>
<P>
   ME: Conscience, you're right. I'm not taking this bag.
</P>
<P>
   CONSCIENCE: All right. Good for you, Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ME: Damn straight. I'm holding out for a trip to Ireland.
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Welcome to the new 'hood, and network 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Normally, I hate moving.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was different: I knew a computer network was
hidden in my walls, and it was just dying to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat 5 cable snaking behind the Sheetrock all but screamed at
me while I puttered around, redistributing the contents of unpacked
boxes, shuffling furniture, hanging towel bars and installing
blinds.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks, when we could see parts of the floor between
the piles of belongings, I could contain myself no longer: I had to
test out my wiring and fire up the ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Without really meaning to, I found myself standing in the
networking aisle of the local CompUSA debating quantity vs.
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Quality won out, in no small part because of the e-mails several
readers sent warning me against the perils of skimping on my NICs
and hub. So, even though they were twice _ and in some cases thrice
_ as much as other products, I stuck with 3Com and Intel for my
hardware, just as you all suggested.
</P>
<P>
   About $300 later, I walked out with a four-port Intel hub, a
3Com 10/100 NIC for my main machine and a 3Com LAN PC card _ which
was the real big-ticket item at $180 _ for the laptop.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home with the goodies, I had a simple plan: Wire up
the P166, take the laptop around to all the network jacks in the
house and check the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I plan to set up a client-server network with a
proxy server to be able to share my Internet connection. But for my
tests I didn't need anything tricky or fancy. Both my machines use
Win95, and by all accounts setting up a peer-to-peer network was
supposed to be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   So I installed my NICs, plugged in the hub and promptly hit a
snag.
</P>
<P>
   I had no Network Neighborhood icon on my desktop.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those annoying icons Windows won't let you remove
from the desktop. So, earlier, I had used a program called TweakUI
to get rid of it almost as soon as I bought my trusty old P166 a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once I restored the icon to its preordained place, the first
step was to make sure I had all the necessary clients, adapters and
protocols installed in my network settings.
</P>
<P>
   The Client for Microsoft Networks, Client for Netware Networks,
and file and printer sharing software was already installed by
default. There was also the dial-up adapter, which was put in when
I configured TCP/IP through Win95, and my new 3Com adapter was
listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Now to check the protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Small LANs like mine, which could have up to eight ports if Mrs.
Power User lets me put machines in the kitchen and dining room
(yeah, right), only really need to deal with three protocols in the
networking preferences: TCP/IP, for the Internet; IPX/SPX, used by
many games for speedy LAN play; and NetBUI for LAN file and printer
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A TCP protocol was already set up for the dial-up adapter, and a
second TCP protocol appeared that was bound to my 3Com ethernet
card.
</P>
<P>
   Adding protocols is no more difficult than clicking on ``Add''
and finding them under the subsequent choices for Microsoft. There
can be some confusion when two protocols of each type appear in the
list, but one is for the dial-up adapter and one is for the NIC.
</P>
<P>
   The only real configuration needed is for the TCP/IP protocol,
which requires that each machine on the network have a unique IP
address, such as 10.0.0.1 for computer 1, 10.0.0.2 for computer 2,
etc. If your Internet service provider uses dynamic IP addressing,
which most of them do, you will want to leave the TCP bound to the
dial-up adapter alone and only specify IP addresses for the TCP
bound to your network card. (Also, make sure you don't enable file
sharing on your dial-up TCP protocol, which would open up your
drives _ and printer _ to the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, click the ``File and Print Sharing'' button and check the
box for sharing files. If you have a printer attached to the
machine, click the other box for printer sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to click the ``Identification'' tab to give the
machine a name and assign it to a work group, which should be the
same for all machines on a small network.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you will have to set up the network preferences for
each machine on your LAN, but that's part of the fun of being a
systems administrator, isn't it? Some more fun of being a sysadmin
is that Win95 makes you reboot every time you change anything in
your network preferences, which gets real annoying real quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is to go into Windows Explorer and right click
on each drive you want to share, give it a unique name and set the
sharing permissions to full access. Ditto for each printer.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the whole process _ annoying reboots and testing all
my jacks notwithstanding _ took little over an hour. It would have
taken less except the laptop couldn't find my printer and I spent
20 minutes before I realized the printer wasn't on. (Hey, calling
this column Power User wasn't my idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Although file and print sharing is nice, the real reason for a
peer-to-peer home network is, of course, multiplayer gaming. (You
need a client-server setup with one machine as a proxy server to
share a modem on a LAN.)
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the first thing I did was to set up network
versions of some of my favorites: ``Quake II,'' ``Hexen II'' and
``Dungeon Keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   But my elation at my in-home game network was quickly snuffed
out ... when I realized the only multiplayer gaming I was going to
be doing was running between room to room making my Paladin punch
my Necromancer and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Because, I am sure Mrs. Power User would take a dim view of
recruiting our daughter Emily into a Hexen Deathmatch ... at least
until she turns 6.

Obey Husted's First Law: Leave well enough alone 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I don't know how many computers we have here at the
newspaper _ literally thousands. There are two of them on my desk
at work, another at home. Sometimes I feel as if I belong to a big
dysfunctional family of semiconductors and processors.
</P>
<P>
   Like most dysfunctional families, this family of mine tries hard
to change things to make them better. But often we go about it in
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, for instance, my work e-mail program didn't work.
Then, when I got ready to write this column, I discovered that the
software we use to produce this newspaper has been upgraded once
again. So nothing looked quite right, or worked quite right.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think that this dysfunctional family of mine needs
to sit down and have a good talk.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I am gradually coming to believe about computers.
Lots of times, not just at work, we feel compelled to change things
just because we haven't changed them in a while. There's this
desperate feeling that if we just keep changing that we'll hit the
magic formula ... sort of like the monkeys eventually typing
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   When a new version of Windows comes out, or a new edition of
some popular word processor or e-mail program, I get bombarded with
letters and calls from readers eager to make the change to the
newest version.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that all those computers are just tools. Unless you
are a computer hobbyist (and there's nothing wrong with that), the
only value of your computer is in the work it can do for you. The
less you notice the computer or the software, the better. If you
were building a barn, you wouldn't want to have to think about the
hammer or worry it needed an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Now we get to Husted's First Law of Computing: If the computer
and the software that you have can do the work that you need it to
do, don't upgrade, don't add memory, don't do a danged thing. Your
computer will tell you when it needs an upgrade. You'll sit down
one day and actually need to do something important. And either the
computer or the software won't be up to the job. That's when you
need to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Husted's Second Law of Computing for when
that happens: Know what you are going to do with your computer and
make your buying and upgrading decision based on that, not just by
browsing the ads and buying the most powerful computer available.
This means that if you really and truly are only going to log on to
the Web, do word processing and balance your checkbook, you don't
need a top-of-the-line super computer. For those tasks, you won't
even notice the speed difference except on your credit card
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to put these two laws of computing to work.
</P>
<P>
   First, stop worrying so much about your computer. You don't sit
up nights wondering (or I hope you don't) if a new microwave oven
will change your life in some fundamental way. Think of all the
time you are going to save by not reading all those computer
magazines. And people will enjoy your company more at parties now
that you talk about stuff other than the latest processor from
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't assume that every task in your life requires a
computer. Just because something can be done with a computer
doesn't mean that it should be done with a computer. I am reminded
of this each time I go to one of the big computer shows _ places
where the attendees have access to almost any technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what most of those high-tech hot shots use to take
notes? PalmPilots? Pocket organizers? Sub-notebook-sized computers?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Most of them use scraps of paper and a pen. Maybe it's
time we all learned from the experts.
</P>
<P>
   MY MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   OK. The Y2K bug bit me.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I told you a way to change the date settings in
Windows so that it could handle four-digit dates. I said that, by
doing that, Windows would handle Y2K better.

   That's wrong. Doing what I told you does no harm. So don't
worry. But unfortunately, it does no good. It just changes the way
that Windows displays dates on the screen. It does not change the
way Windows handles dates internally. Luckily, there are few Y2K
problems with Windows anyway.

New hand-held games are made for little kids 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hand-held electronic games are popular with teens
and preteens, but they can be frustrating for smaller children. Big
brothers and sisters hardly ever let the little ones play, and when
they do the games may be too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Games added eight games to its hand-held game line this
year, including six games designed to be played by players 8 years
old or younger. Hand-held games, which are produced by several
companies, are available at most toy and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hasbro's new games for kids are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pooh Flickering Fireflies, ages 3 to 5: Talking fireflies lead
players on a chase through the 100 Acre Wood of the popular Winnie
the Pooh series. The game automatically adjusts to three skill
levels and features four games. Suggested price: $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballzerko, ages 5 and older: This is an electronic pinball
game with an electronic voice, lights, music and sounds for three
fast-paced activities. Suggested price: $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operation: The portable, electronic version of the classic
board game lets players conduct ``operations'' and remove parts
like ``butterflies in the stomach'' from their imaginary patients.
The game has a time to let players race against the clock.
Suggested price: $17.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simon, ages 7 to adult: The original version of this game was
hot in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The game plays a series of four lights and accompanying tones,
and players try to repeat the pattern by touching four colored
buttons in the proper order. Hasbro's portable version has four
skill levels and three ways to play. Suggested price: $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   The other new hand-held games in the Hasbro line this year are
Frogger, Bop It Extreme, Trivial Pursuit NFL Edition and Trivial
Pursuit NASCAR Edition.

`MARIO GOLF' KIND OF ROUGH GOING FOR MARIO GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MALCOLM MAYHEW  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nintendo has never wanted it any other way: Mario is for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Donkey Kong arcade game in the '80s, the
colorful, clumsy plumber has fumbled his way through more than
two-dozen games, all of which have been geared toward young
players. Even the complicated brain-buster Mario 64 is,
essentially, a kid's game.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's so surprising that Mario Golf (Nintendo for N64,
$50, all ages) is so difficult. This is the first Mario game that,
unlike all the other Mario-theme sports titles, you can't just pick
up and start playing. Well, you can, but you're gonna have a tough
time with it.
</P>
<P>
   The premise sounds kinda fun: Mario and all his pals take to the
course. But gamers won't get much enjoyment out of this unless
they're already familiar with the headaches involved in mastering a
golf video game. You gotta get your angle right, know how much
power to use per hit and calculate everything just right or you'll
wind up in the trees or water, or not even hitting the thing; it's
just too complex for nongolf fans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are into golf games will love it, though. The graphics
are well-done and the courses are as interesting as any PC golf
title. For the younger gamer ... hey, what about Mario Putt-Putt?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Planet of the Apes for your 13-year-old. That pretty
much sums up Ape Escape (Sony for PlayStation, $30, all ages), the
first PlayStation game to totally utilize the system's Dual Shock
analog controller (that's another $30, mom).
</P>
<P>
   Escape pits a kid hero against a bunch of unruly baboons who
snuck out of the zoo and are bent on changing humans into Roddy
McDowell. Your job: Round 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   Graphically and game-playwise, this is a little bit like Crash
Bandicoot, only a little harder. It's so tricky, in fact, you gotta
get the strategy guide ($15) to figure everything out. So, for one
game, you're looking to spend $75. Good game, but not $75 good.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the PlayStation, Sony released more details about
its upcoming PlayStation 2 last week. The biggest news: Gamers
won't have to wait till Christmas of next year to get one. Should
be out in the United States by fall of next year. Japan gets 'em
March 4. Over there, they'll go for 39,800 yen, or about $400.
</P>
<P>
   The system will not only play games (both PlayStation 2 and
original PlayStation titles) but also music CDs and DVD movies.
Better, for $400.

WEB MUST PROGRESS TO FULFILL PROMISE, SAYS ITS INVENTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers 
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.) 
 By ROSS KERBER   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1922, the journalist Walter Lippmann imagined a worldwide
``machinery of knowledge'' that would transform society and empower
individuals. Today, as institutions from Congress to bait shops put
themselves on line, the World Wide Web might seem to fulfill
Lippmann's utopian vision.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief skeptic of such a view turns out to be the British
researcher who invented the Web and who now guides its development
from a post at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Weaving the Web,'' Tim Berners-Lee writes
that big improvements are still needed in the Web's underlying
technology before it can give rise to what he calls ``social
engines,'' such as the staging of national elections or political
debates on line.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Berners-Lee writes, the Web is only a tool, ``at once
the great equalizer and the great divider.'' Computers are best
applied, he writes, ``if we use them to create . . . processes in
which the people do the creative work and the machine does the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-written with Mark Fischetti and just being shipped by
HarperCollins, ``Weaving the Web'' comes out at a time of unbridled
enthusiasm for the social and economic possiblities of the new
medium and the riches it has created.
</P>
<P>
   The book combines an explanation of Berners-Lee's goals at the
MIT-based group he directs, the World Wide Web Consortium, with a
history of the codes he wrote to allow computers to exchange text
and images and the partnerships he struck that first gave rise to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It also introduces 44-year-old Berners-Lee as something of a
critic of the hype surrounding the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his contribution, Berners-Lee has remained apart from
the Internet gold rush. His MIT job pays a maximum salary of
$90,000, and in 1998 he won a $270,000 grant from the MacArthur
Foundation. Yet both pale beside the riches that have flowed to
founders of many companies spawned by the Web, such as portal firm
Yahoo Inc. and retailer Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee explains that he has turned down several offers from
the private sector because they would have limited his ability to
direct the Web's design. While he praises the success of many
Internet start-ups, he also expresses concern at the get-rich-quick
ethos of much attention given the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is maddening is the terrible notion that a person's value
depends on how important and financially successful they are and
that that is measured in terms of money,'' he writes. ``If your
requirement is to make a large amount of money, then your options
in life are rather small,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues at MIT have heard this before. Berners-Lee craves
clout more than cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not interested in being filthy rich or (in) doing the
things that are required to get there,'' said Al Vezza, formerly a
top administrator at the school and now president of Fortech
Seminars Inc. in Reston, Va. ``He's come to the conclusion that he
can be most effective by being pure. What's important to him is
having influence. That's his megalomania and his baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee came to MIT by way of Switzerland, where he spent
much of the 1980s as a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted in ``Weaving the Web,'' it was at the CERN physics
laboratory in Geneva that Berners-Lee first began to write programs
designed to allow computers to exchange information via data
networks. Specifically, Berners-Lee developed the software
conventions that are key to the Web's usefulness, with acronyms
like URL (uniform resource locator) and HTTP (hypertext transfer
protocol).
</P>
<P>
   But CERN never fully supported Berners-Lee's projects, and in
1994 he agreed to set up the World Wide Web Consortium, or the W3C
as it is known in techspeak, at MIT's Laboratory for Computer
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The W3C provides a forum for Internet companies to hash out
technical disagreements over code for the Web, the graphics portion
of the Internet. Today members include 355 companies from Boeing
Co. to China Times Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee seems happy in his role as director, a post he took
because it left him ``free to really think about what was best for
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the price of Berners-Lee's job satisfaction is an
organization that fudges tough policy questions. One example
relates to the variety of codes used by Web designers to ensure
that their pages will work with different Web browsers, such as
Microsoft's Internet Explorer or America Online's Netscape
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Web pages should work in all browsers equally,
according to a format recommended by the W3C in December 1996,
known as ``Cascading Style Sheets.'' But in practice, neither
Microsoft nor Netscape browsers support all the W3C's suggestions,
and neither company has faced any sanctions as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The situation vexes some designers, who say it can cost an extra
25 percent to ensure their sites work with all browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if you needed five different televisions to watch
five different channels,'' says George Olsen, who heads the Web
Standards Project, a Los Angeles lobbying group that would like the
W3C to enforce stricter rules.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee acknowledges Olsen's point but says ``that doesn't
mean that W3C should play Web police,'' partly since it can't lean
on companies like Netscape or Microsoft without driving them away.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the body insist on the time-consuming process of
seeking public comment before issuing its decisions. In ``Weaving
the Web,'' Berners-Lee explains that getting agreements requires
``a balancing act, between taking the time to stay as open as
possible and advancing at the speed demanded by the onrush of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of the Web in recent years has made Berners-Lee
a figure of much interest in Cambridge, Mass., where he lives with
his wife and two children. Though he doesn't teach courses at MIT,
he can often be seen biking to work or wandering the halls of the
old Polaroid Corp. building that houses his corner office.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say the scraps of personal data in ``Weaving the
Web'' mark a breakthrough for Berners-Lee, who has never been
comfortable with questions about his private life. He remains so in
many respects, declining even to name his favorite commercial sites
on the Web, except for a few newspapers from home (such as
www.guardian.co.uk or www.the-times.co.uk). He says he must be
reticent to avoid seeming to endorse on-line retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But he will say that he recently began attending a Unitarian
Universalist church, a denomination that reminds him of his ideal
of the Web as a place where ``people think and discuss, argue, and
always try to be accepting of differences of opinion and ideas,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with Berners-Lee say the rare times he loses his
temper involve technical breakdowns, for example, Web sites with
broken links to other pages. Some clunky bank sites also come in
for criticism because they link consumers to older, slower
mainframe systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to him that people think the Web works
as well as the stock market,'' said Dan Connolly, a W3C technical
staffer since 1994. Once, Connolly remembers, Berners-Lee
threatened to boycott a conferences organized by a Canadian data
provider after finding its Web site wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was nothing more serious than their contract for
hosting services had run out, but he was on the phone with them
right away after he noticed it,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Berners-Lee hopes, the W3C's suggestions will enable
companies to post better Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is far from `done,' '' Berners-Lee writes in his book.
``It is in only a jumbled state of construction, and no matter how
grand the dream, it has to be engineered piece by piece, with many
of the pieces far from glamorous.''

BRUINS LOOKING TRIMMER THESE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Slowly, but surely, the Bruins' roster is coming into
much clearer focus.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises as the Bruins got down to 27 Tuesday,
and four more bodies must go by Friday to reach the NHL maximum of
23.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards Eric Nickulas, Andre Savage, and Jeff Zehr, plus
defenseman Elias Abrahamsson, joined Aaron Downey, Peter Ferraro,
Jay Henderson, Joel Prpic, and goalie Kay Whitmore on the road to
Providence. And goalie Andrew Raycroft returns to his junior team
in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they just need a little more time before playing at
the NHL level,'' said Bruins assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell. ``They're just not ready yet. Guys like Prpic and
Nickulas, I think they both have a chance to play here, but just
not now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how the roster shapes up currently:
</P>
<P>
   Goalies: Rob Tallas and John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen: Ray Bourque, Hal Gill, Jonathan Girard, Kyle
McLaren, Brandon Smith, Don Sweeney, Mattias Timander, and Darren
Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   Centers: Jason Allison, Shawn Bates, Mikko Eloranta, Marquis
Mathieu, Sean Pronger, and Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Left wings: Dave Andreychuk, P.J. Axelsson, Ken Belanger, Joe
Hulbig, Antti Laaksonen, and Sergei Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
   Right wings: Anson Carter, Rob DiMaio, Steve Heinze, Cameron
Mann, and Landon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   So, who goes? Who stays?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns has been using lines of
Allison-Carter-Andreychuk, Thornton-Heinze-Samsonov,
Eloranta-Axelsson-DiMaio, and Wilson-Belanger-Bates. That means
Pronger, Hulbig, and Mann could find themselves on the outside
looking in. Laaksonen, who sprained his ankle Saturday against
Buffalo, is likely to be sent down once he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also likely that Girard, the Bruins' top pick (second
round, 48th overall) in the 1998 entry draft, will stick _ at least
for the first 10 games. If he plays more than that, it's counted as
a year against his contract. He started last year with the Bruins,
too, and played in three of eight games before being returned to
his junior team. That means Timander and Smith could be fighting it
out if Burns decides to keep three defense pairings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word out of Harry Sinden's office regarding free agent
goalie Byron Dafoe is, well, there's no word. Dafoe said earlier
this week that he and his agent, Ron Salcer, were putting together
some sort of proposal to present to Sinden this week. As of
Tuesday, nothing had crossed Sinden's desk . . . Burns hasn't made
it official, but there's little doubt that Tallas will be between
the pipes when the Bruins open their 76th season Saturday against
Carolina at the FleetCenter. John Grahame, 37-9-1 last year at
Providence, will be his backup. Together, they combined for a 5-0-2
exhibition season record with a 1.82 goals-against average . . .
Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt has been named the Bruins' ``captain of
the millennium'' and will drop the ceremonial first puck Saturday.

   For a retired stunt man who has broken his back twice, it would
seem that Travis Tripp's days of living on, and off, the edge are
over. Better not tell that to Tripp. But the 32-year-old probably
wouldn't hear it anyway, hurtling downhill at 72 miles per hour on
an 8-foot-long board called a street luge. ``I'm totally addicted
to adrenaline,'' he says. ``I need a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, extreme athletes of a similar ilk are getting
braver, bolder, and crazier. Extreme sports have taken on a whole
new degree of extremity, it seems, and today, ``extreme'' is what
used to be thought of as ``insane.'' Whether it's freeflying (a
speedier, less disciplined form of skydiving) or free soloing
(scaling mountains and icy ledges with no harnesses or ropes), why
do people take the risk?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not doing it for popularity or publicity,'' says
Jennifer Taylor, a sports psychologist. ``They do it to challenge
themselves physically and mentally to see if they can withstand the
pressure and . . . get in touch with who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes that risk their lives are masters of their crafts, with
exceptional mental and physical brawn, she adds. They push the
limits to test their skill. These sports, says Taylor, even provide
some with a spiritual sensation or an inner peace _ ``they're doing
something larger than themselves by meeting a challenge that other
people aren't up to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor does find it difficult to justify the gamble these
athletes take with their lives. ``Part of me says that these people
are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme athletes test their mettle by jumping out of planes,
soaring off mountains, diving to the ocean floor, racing down
hills, and climbing rock faces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't skydiving extreme enough? Instead of falling through the
sky belly-first in the conventional manner, freeflyers fall head
first, or upright, or sideways _ or any other way they can think of
to achieve midair nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeflying is whatever you want to do in the sky,'' says Jay
Moledzki, 26, a skydiving instructor at Airborne Adventures in
Northampton, Mass. ``It's about freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   From altitudes of up to 14,000 feet, jumpers jettison themselves
from small propeller planes: in conventional skydiving, which
harnesses more air resistance, they fall for about 70 seconds at
speeds up to 120 miles per hour; in freeflying, jumpers reach
speeds up to 200 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my problems go away when I'm in freefall,'' says Jeff
Sherk, 31, skydiving instructor at Airborne Adventures, who
identified his problems as ``daily nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never happier than when I'm in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherk and Moledzki have more than 2,000 jumps each, a quarter of
which were in freeflying mode. ``I got tired of the discipline
involved in belly flying,'' says Moledzki.
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvering in freefall is no easy task, especially in the midst
of a 200-mile-an-hour dive. ``Everything is happening so fast, it's
a challenge,'' says Sherk. In 1998, according to the United States
Parachute Association, there were 47 skydiving deaths, or 1.44
deaths for every 100,000 jumps. (The association does not keep
separate statistics for freeflyers.)
</P>
<P>
   While they agree that freeflying is extreme, neither man sees it
as death-defying. ``Skydiving is perceived as dangerous, but it's a
lot safer than other sports,'' says Sherk. ``Hang gliding and
riding motorcycles scare me. I'll jump out of planes anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although hang gliding has become somewhat mainstream over the
last 25 years, a handful of extreme athletes _ or ``X-letes'' _
find their way to the summit of Mount Washington on the few days a
year when the weather permits to take an extreme sport to a higher
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nicolay, 46, director of Morningside Flight Park in
Charlestown, N.H., has flown off the ``Big W'' on a hang glider 20
times, the first instance in 1975, from the east side of the
mountain near the 6,288-foot summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary place to launch from,'' says Nicolay. ``Your legs
shake, your arms shake, your mouth is dry, and everyone behind you
is telling you to hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The week around Labor Day is considered optimum launch time, he
says. The site is often too windy, which could send gliders into
the jagged rocks or onto the thick woods on the valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction is to emulate the birds,'' says Nicolay. ``It's
a solo experience, a person alone with the elements.'' During
placid flights when he has time to observe his surroundings, the
valley below him resembles the moon, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Niemi, 54, has flown off the ``Big W'' 34 times since
1974. ``Every single time, I get an adrenaline rush. It's the
tallest mountain in the area,'' he says. ``You know this mountain
means business, so you better mean business. It's very unforgiving.

<P>
   In the summer, with strong currents and water temperatures
around the wreck in the mid-40s, divers use anchor lines off
chartered boats to guide them to the bottom. They wear dry suits
for the descent, which takes four minutes. It's complicated and
perilous, with divers breathing tri-mix, a combination of helium,
nitrogen, and oxygen (oxygen alone can becomes toxic at depths
below 200 feet). After 25 minutes of searching for artifacts, the
ascent takes up to an hour, with periodic decompression stops to
avoid air bubbles in the blood stream.

UEFA CHAMPIONS CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Union des Associations Europeennes de Football always has
seemed to be a relatively benign organization. In theory, it is
among the five continental confederations that compose FIFA, the
world governing body of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA seemed to know its place, subservient to FIFA and
potentially subject to the demands of the powerful clubs it
ostensibly presided over. UEFA leaders seemed more symbolic figures
than hands-on dynamos. They allowed domestic competitions to run
themselves, and UEFA organized the European Cups and European
Championships, and collected a percentage from international
friendlies.
</P>
<P>
   But UEFA's hand has been forced in recent years, with the
emergence of a new breed of club owner and emergence of
television's influence. The threat of a European Super League
forced UEFA either to modify its competitions or cease to be even a
ceremonial factor. The stakes were increasing. Estimates of
soccer's value range as high as $500 billion, and 80 percent of the
game's money is invested in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling suits of UEFA have adjusted, creating their answer
to a Super League _ the UEFA Champions League, which is attracting
huge interest, despite being a watered-down, ``decaffeinated''
version in the words of Johann Cruyff. Advertisers are paying $83
per thousand viewers for the Champions League, according to the
Sunday Independent, 12 times as much they pay for Formula One
racing.
</P>
<P>
   The Champions League is capitalizing on the novelty effect and
intriguing matchups such as Wednesday's Manchester United-Olympique
Marseille game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UEFA seems poised to take on FIFA itself as the word
``friendly'' might no longer be a part of the UEFA vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Lennart Johansson, the UEFA president who was defeated by Sepp
Blatter for FIFA presidency, has proposed a competition for
European clubs that will eliminate ``friendly'' matches and also
end FIFA's proposal for a biennial World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has football been as popular in Europe as it is
today,'' UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said during a UEFA
conference in Geneva last week. ``This evolution has been taking
place for some 20 years, and the reasons for it lie not least in
the successful partnership with television as well as in the power
of attraction that football exercises like never before over the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the steep rise of club football has clearly
somewhat reduced the importance of the national teams. And no team
unites the interest of a country's people as much as the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Competing influences
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona has been nicknamed ``Barcajax'' because of the
influence of former Ajax coach Louis Van Gaal and criticized
because the team's Dutch players outnumber Castellanos. But the
club still has a Spanish influence, exemplified by Dani Garcia, who
scored three times in a 4-1 victory over Real Betis as Barcelona
moved into first place in the Primeira Liga. Dani converted the
rebound of a blast by Rivaldo in the 43d minute to tie the score
and finished a pass from Sergi Barjuan two minutes later. Luis
Enrique and Dani scored in the fourth and fifth minutes of the
second half. Barcelona also leads Group B of the Champions League
but faces a difficult challenge from Arsenal . . . Practice might
be important for most players, but Romario apparently can excel
without it. Last week, Romario was fined for missing training by
Flamengo's director of football, Gilmar Rinaldi. But on Sunday,
after the intervention of club president Edmundo Santos Silva,
Romario was in the lineup against Vitoria and scored twice in a 5-2
victory. Flamengo is tied for first place with Corinthians with an
8-3-1 record in the Campeonato Brasileiro. Corinthians tied at
Recife, 0-0, and apparently has been struggling. Colombian
midfielder Freddy Rincon is suspended for a game after an
altercation with Palmeiras's Paulo Nunes and coach Luiz Felipe
Scolari. Palmeiras is in seventh place, 6 points out of first,
after a 1-1 tie with Santos. Paulo Rink set up Dodo for Santos's
goal in the eighth minute of the second half, and Evair tied the
score 12 minutes later . . . Brazilian professional leagues often
appear chaotic and poorly organized. There are 14,400 registered
players in Series A and B, plus another 400 a year who transfer
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Honduras produces
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston aficionados probably appreciate Honduran soccer because
of the success of local amateur clubs, which sometimes included
players from the 1982 World Cup finals team. Honduras has not been
prominent in soccer lately but is still producing successful
players. Eduardo ``Balin'' Bennett missed a penalty, but set up a
goal as Argentinos Juniors upset River Plate, 2-0, in Argentina;
Milton ``Tyson'' Nunes is among the leading scorers in Uruguay;
Carlos Pavon Plummer, once a target of Revolution recruiting,
scored three goals as Atletico Celaya took a shocking 5-0 victory
over Chivas in Guadalajara; and Oscar David Suazo made his Serie A
debut with Cagliari in a 1-1 tie with Venezia in Italy. The Central
Americans who have had success in Serie A have been Julio Cesar
Dely Valdes of Panama and Hernan Medford of Costa Rica . . . The
first African to perform for a professional sports team in Boston
was Tewfik Abdallah, an inside right forward from Egypt who played
for Providence in the American Soccer League. Abdallah, nicknamed
``Toothpick,'' was in the starting lineup in the Boston
WonderWorkers home debut at the Walpole Street Grounds Sept. 13,
1924. Abdallah ``is a very aggressive player who uses the short
passing game and dashes into every play at top speed,'' according
to the Globe's George M. Collins. ``He is also a very deadly
shot.'' But Abdallah apparently missed a point-blank shot at an
open goal, ``sending the ball away over the tracks,'' as Boston
won, 2-1. Those were presumably more innocent times. Abdallah was
24 when he moved from International Sporting Club in Cairo to Derby
County in England in 1920. Lately, though, European clubs have been
exploiting much younger African talent and the alarm is being
sounded louder against this practice. ``FIFA has to introduce
something that will end the expropriation of young African soccer
players,'' Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation Africaine
de Football, told a convention of player agents in Florence
recently. ``Agents take them for two lire, export them to Europe
with a tourist visa in a real trafficking of humans with the
illusion that they will play with a big club, then one is sold for
millions and they leave the others in the middle of a street.
Africa is being sacked without any recourse, the big agents make
dizzying profits, the system increases racism and soccer in general
loses.'' FIFA officials promised to make stricter regulations
during their convention in Las Vegas this week, held in conjunction
with the CONCACAF Champions Cup tournament.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's enough to make a hardened newshound
weep.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-Town News, the world-famous newsstand in the heart of
Harvard Square, packed with more than 3,000 different newspapers
and magazines from Africa to South America, is falling victim to an
era where readers are trading their ink-stained fingertips for
instant, fresh news on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   From the Los Angeles Times and Miami Herald to the Irish
Independent and Jerusalem Post, sales at the venerable purveyor of
international journalism are down as readers flinch at paying high
prices _ up to $9.95 for the Sydney Morning Herald, for example _
for newspapers, particularly foreign ones that are often a day or
two old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a customer of Out-of-Town News for 25 years,''
said Carol Baroudi, the author of the popular ``Internet for
Dummies.'' ``But explain why I would go there for an international
newspaper, which is usually a day late and exorbitantly costly _
and get a ticket trying to park in Harvard Square _ when I can get
the news, current and for free,'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the explosion of online publications has cut
into Out-of-Town News' very reason for living _ hawking newspapers.
During World War I when the kiosk was in its infancy, its founders,
the Cohen family, sold newspapers at what is now the entrance to
the Harvard Square transit station, using a cigar box as a cash
register.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though magazine sales are steady, the kiosk is having
to rely more on other things to make a buck such as candies,
souvenirs, paperbacks, lottery tickets, and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even three weeks ago, I never thought I would be saying it,
but I now hear myself tell people, `Did you check the Internet?' ''
said Richard O'Connor, the kiosk's supervisor, wearing a blue,
cotton apron that recalled the old days of hawking newspapers on
city streets. ``We can't afford to just order one or two of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're a souvenir shop lately,'' added the kiosk's
assistant manager, Danielle Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Just four or five years ago, the kiosk had no problem selling
120 Sunday editions of the Los Angeles Times or 100 of the Miami
Herald, for example, to people who combed through real estate and
employment sections as they prepared to relocate, said Out-of-Town
News general manager Fred Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cohen lamented, he orders just 10 Los Angeles Times and
about eight Miami Herald's each week.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to give specific dollar figures, Cohen said that
since 1989 he has lost 60 percent of his newspaper retail income.
</P>
<P>
   Even The Boston Globe and The New York Times are not doing so
hot. Sales of those papers have dropped by 75 percent since the
early 1990s, he says, because of the Internet, increased home
deliveries and news boxes sprouting on more street corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom has just fallen out,'' Cohen said Tuesday. ``It is
a serious concern for us. I grew up in the business. I am oriented
to newspapers, and that is what makes me sad. We used to sell
thousands of Globes and New York Times every Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people, even college kids, who used to flock to Harvard
Square after classes to buy his newspapers, are now getting their
news from cable television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As for foreign newspapers, Cohen still enjoys a monopoly but it
may only be a matter of time, he said, before that market begins to
dry up. He still continues to order a steady number of foreign
papers because many are not on line _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clock is ticking,'' he said. ``People just aren't willing
to pay. I mean, a London Sunday Times costs $7.95.''
</P>
<P>
   This past Monday, that day's Irish Independent newspaper and The
Jerusalem Post were already on line, whereas Out-of-Town News still
had Friday's editions of each on the stand for $3.25 and $4.50
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ugo Della Croce, a professor and researcher from Italy working
at Harvard Medical School, said he used to regularly spend $2.50
for a copy of La Repubblica, one of Italy's national daily
newspapers. But that was the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it is on the Internet, I just take a quick look. It is
great for keeping up with the news,'' said Della Croce, 34, who
lives in Brighton. ``But if I want to read deeper, I prefer the
newspaper to bringing print-out sheets home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, editors at international newspapers say their on-line
readership is exploding, although they also say they have seen
little change in their international sales.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Post publisher Tom Rose, for example, said Tuesday
that his on-line readership is more than doubling each year, and
that the Post's web site gets an estimated 175,000 visitors each
day.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of ``our international edition remains flat,'' he said
in an electronic mail. ``We suspect two different classes of
readers: Younger ones on line, and older readers have the printed
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cohen said there is no danger that one of the
country's premier newspaper kiosks is in danger of closing, but
still he continues to struggle with ways to keep it from straying
too far from its beloved core mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I am here,'' Cohen said, ``I will always emphasize
the magazines and newspapers.''

MANY BUY INTO A HARLEM REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take a walk through Harlem on any work day, on
practically any block, and you see the signs of a community
lumbering back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian brownstones, long abandoned and crumbling, are being
restored to their former luster. Art Deco apartment houses, wrecked
by defacement and neglect, are being gutted and rebuilt to a shine.
Trash-strewn lots are being cleared for construction of houses and
shops. Streets are being repaved, stoops resurfaced, cornices
replaced, cracks repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades have passed since the riots and recessions that
turned Harlem into a symbol of urban despair. Government
``renewal'' programs have done little but deepen the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But now, things seem to be changing. The romance of Harlem _ its
appeal as an African-American sanctuary _ never dimmed entirely.
This was where blacks first settled freely in great numbers, about
1910, where they formed elites, and nurtured artists _ Langston
Hughes, Duke Ellington, Jacob Lawrence, James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects a rebirth of the Harlem Renaissance, but many are
talking about a revival of hope and normal life. It is happening
not just on West 125th Street, the celebrated strip where retailers
like Starbucks, Pathmark, and Blockbuster have laid down stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known but more dramatic, it is happening deep within,
on streets where people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are coming back to Harlem,'' said Karen Ansis,
properties manager for the New York Landmarks Conservancy, which
arranges financing for renovation. ``In many cases, it's people who
grew up here, moved away, and now want to live here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlem is changing so rapidly that some worry that it is
changing too rapidly, that, just as the economic boom is starting
to lift the fortunes of long-term residents, ``gentrification''
will price them out of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its outcome, the revival is happening for several
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --The drop in the crime rate, which has been particularly
dramatic in Harlem (murders are down 81 percent from six years ago,
compared with 65 percent citywide).
</P>
<P>
   --The skyrocketing real-estate prices elsewhere in Manhattan
($400,000 buys a mansion in Harlem, but barely a one-bedroom condo
downtown).
</P>
<P>
   --A radical shift in thinking about urban policy, away from
arm's-length goverment aid and more toward hands-on private
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in this predominantly Democratic city and even more
Democratic neighborhood, two Republicans helped set the stage for
this shift.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, shortly after being elected mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani
decided to sell off buildings that the city government had
condemned and taken possession of long ago, but then did nothing to
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Governor George Pataki killed the Housing and
Urban Development Corp., a state agency that was created in the
1970s to funnel government dollars into Harlem but that ended up as
a power tool for Harlem's political bosses and their cronies.
</P>
<P>
   One former housing official described the bosses' set-up thus:
``These guys said, `Nothing gets done unless it gets done our way,
with our contractors, our pals.' So, nothing got done. These guys
singlehandedly set back housing and commercial development in
Harlem 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Kathryn Suggs, a top Harlem real-estate broker, said:
``When the city said, `Let's get rid of our housing stock,' and
then the HUDC was put out of its misery, the floodgates roared
open. Everything changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the number of city-owned properties in
Harlem has been slashed in half, from 12,161 to 6,265. In the past
two years, sales of private homes in Harlem have quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Ford was one of Suggs's early clients. A corporate
lawyer at a Park Avenue firm, Ford bought and renovated a
dilapidated four-story house on West 144th Street in 1984, a full
decade before the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, now 49, was born in Harlem, moved away as a child, went to
Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, then decided to move
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered it culturally important, politically significant,
and socially comfortable to settle here,'' he said. ``You'd see a
different story in the development of Harlem if more Harvard Law
School graduates or Columbia Business School graduates wound up
living in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, few black professionals of Ford's age find Harlem
alluring. But he does notice a huge wave of black _ and some white
_ professionals, in their 20s and 30s, heading his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people moving to Harlem who, 10 years ago, would have
moved to New Jersey or Westchester County,'' Ford said. ``People
are coming with children.'' Ford married since arriving, and has a
2-year-old son. ``That creates a different kind of interest in the
community, a commitment to the future of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Jeffrey Ewing, black actors who live a few blocks from
Ford, moved here with their two daughters four years ago. At the
time, most of the neighboring houses were abandoned shells. Now,
they have all been bought and spruced up. The block association
petitioned the city to repave the sidewalks and plant trees. A pool
hall down the street, on West 143d and Broadway, was a big drug
hangout not long ago. The police shut it down, and the spot now
holds a nice new restaurant, one of several in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved here, friends thought we were crazy,'' said
Nancy Ewing. ``Now they come visit us, and they say, `Oh! This
looks nice!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not just rich and middle-class blacks are benefiting from the
resurgence. A half-mile southeast, on West 140th Street between
Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell boulevards, Mary Berry
lives on a block once dubbed the worst in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, nearly every building on the street was burned
out, on the verge of collapse, surrounded by hustlers and drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrible block,'' Berry said, sweeping the porch of
her apartment house. ``You couldn't sit out on your stoop, you
couldn't go down to the corner store, without being afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the buildings have been gutted, scoured, and restructured
into tidy one- to four-bedroom apartments, and residents can relax
outside all day.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation is the result of a private-public partnership
that lets local developers bid for city-owned buildings, then puts
the winners together with bankers, architects, and inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants who already live in these buildings pay no more than 30
percent of their income in rent; the rest is subsidized by the
city. New tenants can be charged more.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, tenants can take over the buildings themselves.
They each pay the city $250 _ and they own the apartment. (If they
sell it later, the city earns the capital gain.)
</P>
<P>
   In another program, developers buy city-owned brownstones for $1
each, then draw on neighborhood groups or brokers to market the
properties.
</P>
<P>
   John Cross bought 30 brownstones, all abandoned shells. He
priced them from $169,000 to $499,000, renovated them to each
buyer's desires, and sold them all in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Suggs was Cross's broker. ``We socked it to the buyers in
areas where prices were getting high anyway, and made them cheap in
places where they weren't,'' Suggs said. ``I had my vision of what
I want my neighborhood to look like. I want the mix of people to
stay the same _ private houses owned by people who have money,
right near apartments rented by people who don't, all riding
shoulder-to-shoulder on the subway. Harlem is going to get nice for
everybody, but it's not going to turn into SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone even to mention Harlem in the same breath as
fashionable downtown SoHo is a measure of how far things have come.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Wright, as Giuliani's housing commissioner, conceived of
many of the new policies, then chaired the Upper Manhattan
Empowerment Zone, which oversaw the area's retail development. She
is now president of Carver Savings Bank. Wright raises the same
issue as Suggs, but more as a question. ``The real tension now is:
How long will Harlem be economically diverse?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, a brownstone on Hamilton Heights, always one of
Harlem's grander areas, sold for $650,000. Similar sales followed,
and Suggs said one house is about to close for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the bell, ringing away,'' Wright said. ``Pretty soon,
low-income housing could exist just as a balancing act,'' to keep
Harlem from becoming a land for yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Wright added, it is also possible that the advances
of the past few years could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem is a vast neighborhood and large chunks of it are still
barren or harrowing. Until a supermarket opened near his house this
year, Wallace Ford had to ride 30 blocks in a taxi to buy
groceries. Until a Dominos opened a few months ago, he could not
order pizza because no parlor would deliver to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   This situation is changing, and it will keep changing because
more people like Ford will demand that it does. But these changes
take time and Wright wonders if Harlem will get the time it needs.

   ``The economy is pretty far out on the business cycle,'' she
said. ``Black or white, people with money aren't going to buy
houses unless they've got amenities in the neighborhood. And to get
enough of them, the business cycle has to last for a couple more
years. The question of the moment is: Will it?''

STUMBLE, AND YOU'RE PUNISHED MERCILESSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stumble, and you're punished mercilessly
</P>
<P>
   It was just five months ago that we wrote a column marking the
day EMC Corp. edged longtime king of the hill Gillette Co. to
become the most valuable public company in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, EMC stock was worth a total of $72.3 billion,
according to data supplied by Bloomberg News. Gillette shares were
worth $40.1 billion, or about 45 percent less. If EMC stock
increased another $10 per share (it has in fact jumped more than
$11 in the last four weeks), EMC would be worth about double
Gillette's stock value.
</P>
<P>
   The startling stock trends affecting Boston-based Gillette, a
suddenly down-on-its-luck global consumer-product company, and EMC,
the data-storage powerhouse based in Hopkinton, say a great deal
about a broader market that swoons over technology and high-powered
earnings growth at the expense of practically all else.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction to glamorous tech giants, like Microsoft Corp.
and Cisco Systems Inc., seems so powerful that staggering stock
valuations are practically ignored. Stocks that thrive without a
sterling profit story are usually clustered among companies working
on the Internet, in telecommunications, or in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been in most other stock market segments, too bad.
Among the broad losers of 1999: financials, utilities, health care,
and consumer staples.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, growth-oriented companies of any kind that stumble
are punished without mercy. Gillette stock, which lost $1 per share
Tuesday on another company warning of weak quarterly sales, is down
22.6 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many market analysts believe popular stocks have become so
expensive that investors must flock to an ever-shorter list of
companies with the most earnings power or prospects. And a fall
from grace is a long fall indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is chasing sources of assured earnings growth,''
said Jim Weiss, chief investment officer for equities at State
Street Research and Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the economy remains perfect, the market isn't
wildly overvalued,'' he said. ``When individual companies don't
live up to expectations, and that is the definition of the absence
of perfection, they get hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at a sampling of other struggling local stocks with
a value of at least $1 billion. There are lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Keane Inc. (down 41.6 percent so far this year), American Tower
Corp. (down 32.3 percent), United Asset Management Inc. (down 32.2
percent), Staples Inc. (down 26.7 percent), and Harcourt General
Inc. (down 22.2 percent) have all been steamrolled because of some
disappointment or a perceived threat to their earnings power.
</P>
<P>
   The best local performers are overwhelmingly tech-oriented,
including Internet businesses (CMGI Inc. is up 267.8 percent and
Lycos Inc. is ahead by 73.8 percent), semiconductor companies
(Teradyne Inc., up 85.5 percent), and biotech entries (Biogen Inc.,
up 97 percent, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, up 143.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the long-established investment strategy of
diversification is taking it on the chin. Mutual-fund portfolios
can look pretty pokey next to soaring tech stocks and the
explosions of Internet initial public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some frustration among mutual-fund
investors,'' said Cambridge-based investment adviser Marc O'Brien,
who directs his clients money mostly into funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minority of clients are wondering why their accounts are
flat when they hear about how much money other people are making,''
he said. ``There's a disconnect between what people are reading in
the media and what they are experiencing in their portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only months ago that value-oriented stocks seemed to be
staging a comeback and investment managers hoped for a broadening
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Returns at value funds that had taken a beating for several
years, like Vanguard Windsor, suddenly perked up. But the winds
shifted again when a market jittery over interest rates ran back to
a select few stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The average diversified US stock mutual fund had lost 5.7
percent for the third quarter, as of last week. Of 15 separate
stock fund categories, every one of them suffered some decline in
value during that period.
</P>
<P>
   But believers in a broader stock market, and a climate that
again embraces value investments, still think their day will come
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think the ingredients for a broadening into value are
there,'' said Steve Oristaglio, deputy head of investments at
Putnam Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Value has really been about consolidating and restructuring.
We remain positive overall that these forces will ultimately find a
way into the stock market,'' he said.

SO FAR, CLEVELAND STICKS BY ITS STRUGGLING TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All Chris Palmer has to do to realize he's not in New England
anymore is turn on his radio.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year head coach of the first-year Cleveland Browns has
a radio show on WMJI, the team's flagship station, and from time to
time he hears from listeners. But despite the Browns' 0-3 start,
which includes a 17-10 loss to the hated Former Cleveland Browns
(alias: Baltimore Ravens), not once has he heard anything like he
might have been bombarded with on WEEI in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   No ``Whaddya, outta ya mind wid dat call?'' Not a single charter
member of the whiner line saying, ``Get outta heah wid da
shotgun!'' Not even Butch from the Bowling Alley calling in to dub
him Palmer the Poodle or Chris the Crock.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff is reserved for men who coach in New England,
especially men who coach the Patriots. It is what Pete Carroll has
heard for three years and still hears from some corners even though
his team is 3-0 and leading the AFC East over the 2-0 Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   While Carroll's ears turn red even when he wins, the coach of
the 0-3 Browns never has heard a discouraging word because the
skies are not cloudy all day in Ohio. At least not for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate to coach in Texas, Florida, and Northern
Ohio,'' Palmer said Tuesday from his office in Berea, Ohio, during
a break from his preparation of Sunday's game plan. ``Those are
hotbeds of high school and college football. They're places where
the fans are well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 0-3, and on the radio people are telling me to stick
with the young guys because they'll get better. The fans here have
been very reasonable. They understand the game here. They
understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the process has been a predictably slow one in which
his team was embarrassed on opening day by the Pittsburgh Steelers,
stymied by the Tennessee Titans a week later, and improved but
still fell 7 points short against the hated Ravens. Now he must
prepare for an undefeated team whose powerful offense he knows
well, too well to kid himself about what's probably coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Perkins (the Browns tight ends coach and former Patriots
offensive coordinator) and I were talking about them today,''
Palmer said of the Patriots. ``It's amazing that they only have 23
guys left from when we went to the Super Bowl, but that's the NFL
today. They still have seven of the 11 (offensive) starters,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who went through the building stage there at
New England, we take pride in what they're doing. They're a mature
team that is playing excellent right now. I'm happy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Palmer, he probably is, but he's not so happy for his
own young team, which will try to match a very hot offense with its
own tepid pass rush, troubled secondary, oft-confused rookie
quarterback, and struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   This game would seem to be a disaster in the making even under
the best of circumstances, but this week has been anything but that
because the first chinks in the wall of solidarity in Cleveland
have surfaced. After Sunday's loss in Baltimore, several young
Browns criticized Palmer's offensive approach. Wide receiver Leslie
Sheppard claimed his coaches were not making the necessary
adjustments to avoid predictability (where have we heard that
before?), and tackle Lomas Brown insisted that rookie quarterback
Tim Couch should not have been put in a shotgun formation on third
and 26 from the Browns' 13.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, Sheppard forgot to mention the two passes he
dropped (including one on third down with the Browns trailing,
10-3) and Brown failed to point out that had his man, Peter
Boulware, not blown by him and flattened Couch, it would not have
caused the fumble that set up Baltimore's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard said, ``Right now, we're not doing a good job of making
adjustments on what they're throwing at us.'' Asked if he was
saying Palmer's offense had become predictable, he replied, ``I
won't say that. I've got to watch what I say. You live and learn.
Sometimes you get in different places and you say different things
and they get twisted and turned. A better way to put it is we've
got to go out and execute better. I don't want to start
second-guessing his play-calling. He'll say, `Shep, catch that ball
on third down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apprised of this, Palmer laughed and said, ``I'll take the high
road on that. It's not a matter of adjustments as much as it is
execution. I think it's a good thing the players are frustrated
after a close loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure he does, as long as they keep their opinions to themselves.
When your offense is averaging 6.3 points a game after three weeks,
the only execution the players need to be concerned with is their
own if things don't improve. Yet in typically Northern Ohio
fashion, Palmer looked at his team Tuesday and saw progress, not
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Slow progress perhaps, but progress all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're such a young team the guys are still just trying to find
their way out of the huddle,'' Palmer joked. ``I'd like things to
be a little bit better but I think things are playing out pretty
much the way we thought. We've improved each game on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you want to do it overnight but you can't do all
the things we need to get done at once. If this was as easy as
A-B-C, we'd all have winning programs.''
</P>
<P>
   His point is painfully true. In an age of rampant parity (which
is mediocrity under a different name), the four teams that played
in the conference championships just eight months ago do not have
winning programs at the moment (a collective 1-11). So what did
they expect would happen in Cleveland three weeks into the Browns'
inaugural season?
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much what's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot we've done that's been effective,''
fullback Marc Edwards said after the Ravens game. ``What is our
bread and butter? We haven't found that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us back to the critics of Palmer's play-calling.
When asked again how his internal critics could say a team is
predictable when its own players admit they don't know yet what
they do best, Palmer did what they do in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's predictable is that it's very tough to win in this
league,'' Palmer said. ``It's tough for everybody. It's tougher for
a young team like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, people in Ohio with radios understand that.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now.

TO ERR IS HUMAN; TO RUN A CORRECTION IS JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Katherine Powers is in a terrible pickle. She is mired
in Correction Hell.
</P>
<P>
   It is, alas, a hell of her own making. A few weeks ago, in her
Sunday Globe book column, she wrote that the name of Magdalene
College, Cambridge, Mass., was correctly pronounced ``maudlin.'' A
grandee from the World's Greatest University (Harvard; more risible
than usual in this context) ``corrected'' Katherine. Letting slip
that he had studied at Oxford, this man proclaimed that it was
Magdalen College, Oxford, that pronounced its name strangely, not
its Cambridge counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine dutifully published a correction. And that was her
first mistake. Two Boston University toffs leaped to correct her
correction. ``Your corrector is incorrect,'' quoth old pal Chris
Ricks, correctly. So Katherine had to publish a second correction.
The names of both colleges are indeed pronounced ``maudlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, editor of Microsoft's on-line magazine Slate,
once wrote: ``We asked Bill Gates what should be done when people
complain about factual errors in Slate. His advice was `Have them
killed.' '' Good for Bill! I let a local bureaucrat ramrod an
inaccurate correction into my column a year ago, and believe me, I
haven't forgotten, Mr. Dunfey. (Or is it Dunphey?) On the other
hand, John Updike's film agent, Ken Sherman, whom I called ``Dan''
in a recent column, politely asked me to correct his name in a
future article. And I have.
</P>
<P>
   I am no stranger to the correction box. I don't know any
reporter who tries to make mistakes, or any editor who tolerates
them, but mistakes are made. I used to write a column called
``TGIW'' in addition to ``TGIF.'' After an embarrassing string of
miscues, one of my colleagues said the column initials stood for
This Guy Is Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example of a mistake I made, and the consequences. I
wrote: ``There's a nice flap brewing at One Devonshire Place, the
32-story polished-steel monstrosity erected on the site of the old
Boston Globe plant.'' Apparently, this angered the building
management, because several days later, we published this helpful
note to our readers: ``CORRECTION: One Devonshire Place is not a
`32-story polished steel monstrosity' (TGIF, Sept. 9). The building
is 42 stories tall.''
</P>
<P>
   I am a pioneer in this field. While on leave from the Globe a
couple of years ago, I wrote an article for Slate that placed the
US-Canadian border at the 48th parallel. In fact, it is at the
49th. Now, in a digital medium like Slate, this kind of
typographical error could have been emended for all time with just
a few keystrokes. But instead of taking Bill Gates's advice and
having my critics executed, Kinsley wouldn't be denied ``the
opportunity for healthy self-flagellation that a correction notice
provides.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, my work is the subject of perhaps the first
cyber-correction in intergalactic history. Slate ``humbly
apologizes to all the United States citizens above the 48th
parallel, who we implied were living in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you wonder: What is the Greatest Newspaper Error of All
Time? The Guardian of London had a habit of misspelling its own
name. To this day, it is mocked as the ``Grauniad'' by the
satirical weekly Private Eye. In 1990, The New York Times published
this doozie of a correction about former drug czar William Bennett
and US Representative Charles Rangel: ``It was Mr. Bennett who
called Mr. Rangel a `gasbag,' not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Wall Street Journal, arguably the nation's
greatest newspaper (memo to file: write column on the adverb
``arguably,'' unwieldy synonym for ``not,'' as in: ``Titus
Andronicus, arguably Shakespeare's greatest play''), published a
grievous whopper. A front-page article about a softball team in
Weston, Mass. noted that the team, ``like the Boston Red Sox . . .
has never gone all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox of course won four World Series up to 1918, five
even, if you count the 1903 victory of their precursor team, the
Boston Pilgrims. The mistake will be corrected in Wednesday's
paper, according to a Journal spokesman. By way of an explanation,
he said: ``It has been so long since the Red Sox . . .'' But that's
when I put down the phone.

 UNDATED: ... blood stream.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1981, Stan Bielenda, 63, has counted 12 Andrea Doria
diving deaths, including two this summer, and two off his own
charter diving boat in the 1980s. ``That's too many,'' he says.
Despite having certification, he says, divers are often too
inexperienced for this technical dive.
</P>
<P>
   One diver died of a massive embolism when he ran out of air at
50 feet and surfaced without decompressing. The other died of what
Bielenda calls ``china fever'' _ he got trapped in wires looking
for the ship's china. Bielenda estimates that 200,000 pieces of
china still lie in the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Chapski acknowledged that ``it's an extreme dive, absolutely.
It's physically strenuous.'' Yet the extreme sport he fears is
street luge _ ``I wouldn't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wearing shoes with an inch of motorcycle-wheel tread as soles,
full-body leather suits, and helmets, street luge riders get set
and go. They careen down hills at speeds of up to 75 miles per
hour, shifting their body weight to turn and stop using only their
feet (the rubber platform shoes come in handy).
</P>
<P>
   At a recent practice session on a steep hill in Gilmanton, N.H.,
the Fire Department was on hand to control traffic and to offer aid
in the event of an accident. ``If you hit a tree at 70 miles per
hour going on that little board, chances are you're gonna need some
help,'' says Mark Wholey, a firefighter and emergency medical
technician.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kayer, 36, co-founder of Subterfuge, a street luge store in
Loudon, N.H., says the sport evolved from skateboards about 20
years ago. Kayer has a metal plate in his knee from an accident in
which he also broke his right hand and chipped a bone in his left
hand. All this for hitting a bale of hay that served as a course
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just a bunch of yahoos in the back yard,'' he says.
``No motor, no gas, no fumes. It's a pure sport in the sense of a
gravity sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Tripp, 32, co-founder of Subterfuge, competes
professionally. This year he hasn't placed lower than third in
seven meets and was the first New Englander to win a competition
out West.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Michael, 12, also competes. He doesn't worry about his
father because he knows he's in control and he's used to extreme
conditions. ``It's just normal for our family, I guess.'' Tripp,
who has bungee jumped, skydived, and jumped motorcycles, is a fan
of the extreme. But, he says, ``I wouldn't solo rock climb.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Synnott is someone who thrills in free-solo rock climbing
and ice climbing, which many athletes rate as possibly the
quintessential extreme sport.
</P>
<P>
   There are no ropes or harnesses in free soloing. There are few,
if any, second chances if someone slips climbing up rock or ice
faces. ``You can't fall,'' says Synnott, 29. ``Not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wellesley, Mass. native who lives in Jackson, N.H., Synnott is
a member of The North Face climbing team. ``I think about
mortality, more than death. Everyone's going to die,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That inspires me to get the most out of my life, and these
adventures make my life better . . . I might as well really go for
it. I'm not banking on the afterlife. For me this is it, these are
my glory days.''
</P>
<P>
   Synnott has an 8-month-old son; his wife, Lauren, worries when
Mark free-solos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just drive myself crazy if I dwelled on it,'' she
says. ``If something were to happen to him, I'd want it to be
climbing, because that's just who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   He first began free soloing at 14, when he and a friend climbed
up 500 feet of a moderately difficult rock face. Most of his free
solos these days are on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Synnott's climbing partner broke his back when he
plumetted 75 feet, bouncing off rocks and ledges on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could die,'' he acknowledges, ``but I say `I'm not gonna,'
and I get this charge and grapple with it, hands-on. And prevail.''

MAKING THE COFFEE CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Starbucks may not have invented the status latte, but as Mark
Pendergrast documents in his book ``Uncommon Grounds: The History
of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World'' (Basic Books),
Seattle's caffeine kings did much to reposition coffee as a chic,
upscale refreshment. That's just one subplot to Pendergrast's
sprawling 522-page history of the beverage that, along with oil,
ranks as one of the world's two most valuable traded commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrast, the Vermont-based author of acclaimed books about
Coca-Cola and recovered memory, considers coffee from a wide
variety of angles, from the seriously sociopolitical to the purely
whimsical. We chatted recently over a decaf cappuccino at Borders
bookstore cafe in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why coffee?
</P>
<P>
   A. Coffee is really just the pit of a tree that grows wild in
Ethiopia. It's a nonnutritional substance and the world's most
widely taken psychoactive drug. Yet every time the price of coffee
climbs precipitously, we hold governmental hearings on who's to
blame. How and why coffee became so valuable involves a lot of
interesting characters, issues, and locations. Coffee is a perfect
way, for instance, to look at the troubled relationship between
Latin America and North America.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you know much about coffee before this project?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really. I didn't write this book because I was a coffee
nut; I became a coffee nut because I wrote this book. The coffee I
first drank, when I was in college, was terrible stuff. It was
typical of America in the 1950s, when everything was ``modern'' and
``instant,'' including instant coffee. Back then the technology was
so poor that it didn't matter whether processers used good beans or
bad beans. Naturally they used bad beans _ robusta beans, not the
superior arabica variety _ because they were cheaper. At the same
time, housewives were brewing their coffee weaker in order to save
money. So for a long time most Americans were brewing swill and
drinking dishwater.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What makes a good cup of coffee?
</P>
<P>
   A. The four key elements are taste, aroma, body, and acidity.
Acidity does not refer to pH levels, incidentally, but to snap or
brightness on the palate. It's rare to find a coffee variety that
balances all four in one cup, which explains why a lot of coffees
have to be blended to be much good. Two of the best are Jamaican
Blue Mountain and Hawaiian Kona. Guatemalan Antigua and Costa Rican
Tarrazu are also excellent and don't cost as much.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The most exotic coffee?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the most expensive coffee I've run across is Kopi Luwak
coffee, which costs $300 a pound and is highly prized in Indonesia.
The reason it costs so much is because the bean or pit is harvested
from luwak poop. It literally travels through the gut of the civet
cat and comes out the other end. I didn't care for the taste much.
I've described it elsewhere as ``gutsy,'' which I'm rather proud
of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you devote so many pages to the geopolitics of coffee
production?
</P>
<P>
   A. Coffee by definition grows in some of the world's most
beautiful places, tropical paradises like Guatemala and Costa Rica
that are also incredibly poor places. And while it's grown in
almost universally poor places, it's consumed in almost universally
wealthy places. The irony that we can drink a $3 latte and be
paying the equivalent of the daily wage for a Central American
coffee picker is a profound one, in my view. I'm wary of knee-jerk
liberalism. I did not begin my research assuming that the evil
North has been exploiting the poor old South. But, in fact, that's
pretty much the case.
</P>
<P>
   I should add that there's nothing the matter with coffee per se.
It's a perfectly nice product. I just wish it were not such a
troubled industry that presents so many problems for the people who
rely on it for their living.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there varieties of coffee that are both good for the
palate and good for the soul, politically speaking?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fair trade coffee strikes me as a good idea. To be labeled as
such means growers are guaranteed at least $1.26 a pound for
processed green beans. Right now the billing rate is about $1 a
pound, which is terrible. Unfortunately, there's not a huge market
there yet. Shade-grown coffee is another. This is coffee grown
under a shade canopy, which provides an important habitat for
migratory birds. Too often growers have been cutting down shade
trees to grow inferior coffee, a double-edged disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who or what changed Americans' attitude toward coffee,
specifically our appreciation of good coffee?
</P>
<P>
   A. Alfred Peet did more than anyone. Peet came along in the
'60s, when there were small bastions of other specialty roasters
around but none quite like Peet. A cult developed around his
Berkeley store. He became an enormous influence on others in the
business, including George Howell, who started the Coffee
Connection here in Boston, and Jerry Baldwin and pals, who started
Starbucks in 1971 and later bought out the Coffee Connection.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what Starbucks has done. They have no national
advertising, but they have presence and they have image _ a lesson
coffee people failed to learn from Coke and Pepsi. Starbucks sells
a lifestyle, not just a beverage. If you drink their coffee, it
means you're hip and intelligent and believe in good causes. I
criticize them for some things, like their tendency to open new
outlets next to locally owned businesses. But they deserve a lot of
credit, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You contend that a lot of coffee advertising has been
misguided in the past. How so?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's been too negative and defensive. When Postum came along,
the message was, ``Our coffee doesn't give you coffee nerves.''
That's dumb. Chase &AMP; Sanborn had a cartoon ad that began with a
husband throwing hot coffee on his wife because the coffee's no
good. In the last panel, she's wearing a catcher's mitt and a
shield. Really, what kind of a message is that? There was this
sexist theme going that if you don't make good coffee, your husband
will divorce you. Or beat you. It continued with Folger's Mrs.
Olson and Maxwell House's Aunt Cora, played by Margaret Hamilton _
a fine actress otherwise known as the Wicked Witch of the West.
General Foods picked Robert Young to sell Sanka. Its message:
Coffee makes you irritable and ruins your marriage. The Juan Valdez
campaign and Taster's Choice ads, on the other hand, have been both
clever and effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what have you learned from your own research?
</P>
<P>
   A. I make my coffee properly now, in a French press pot that
mixes the coffee directly with the water and then separates the
grounds by plunger. And, of course, I use only arabica beans,
freshly ground. I've even gotten into roasting my own beans at
home. All you need is a little aluminum pan with holes in it. You
roast the beans in a 450-degree oven for about 11 minutes. If you
can make cookies, you can roast coffee.

WELFARE FOR BILL AND HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Responsibility President obviously feels no responsibility
to lead by example. In the twilight of his term and the sunrise of
his wife's candidacy for the Senate in New York, Bill and Hillary
Clinton needed a new address in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on a five-bedroom house in Chappaqua, N.Y. No one
expected Bill and Hillary to trade in the White House for a housing
project, but as they got deeper into the deal, it turns out they
were a little over their heads. The price was $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Owing $5 million to lawyers for the Whitewater and Monica
Lewinsky cases, Bill and Hillary apparently assumed that no bank
would give them a mortgage. If they were ordinary citizens, they
would be expected to pay down their debts. Or pick a less expensive
house. Or rent a pied-a-terre.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Bill and Hillary had to have this house. It was time to
go on welfare. They had $350,000 for the down payment. They needed
a mortgage for $1.35 million. They hit up their friends.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, they asked _ through indirect
means _ former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former chiefs of
staff Erskine Bowles and Thomas McLarty to lend them the money.
Despite a reported combined net wealth of about a quarter of a
billion dollars, all three men turned Bill and Hillary down.
</P>
<P>
   The first family was stressed out. A source told The New York
Times: ``It weighed very heavily on Hillary. She was very worried
that they were going to lose the house. She was distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my. As if there were no other acceptable homes available in
woodsy, wealthy Westchester. This moment of self-absorption told a
lot about Bill and Hillary. This is the same first family that
boasts about kicking 6.5 million women off welfare, whether they
had decent paying jobs or not, whether they had decent housing or
not, whether they had decent meals or not.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, in boasting how the nation has cut the welfare
rolls almost by half, Bill said, ``Six and a half years ago, I
asked the American people to join me on a crusade to transform our
system of welfare into a system of work; to transform a system of
dependence into a system of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   A crusade it was. For six and a half years, Bill never missed a
chance to exploit perhaps the key issue that stole the centrist
candy from the Republicans. In 1994, Bill said, ``There's no
greater gap between mainstream American values and modern
government than we find in the welfare system. . . . For millions
and millions of people, the system is broken badly, and it
undermines the very values, work, family, and responsibility that
people need to put themselves back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bill continued, ``I have always felt it was critically
important to fix our broken welfare system. It doesn't honor our
values of work and family and personal responsibility. . . .
Welfare reform must be about responsibility. . . . That way, we can
have a race to independence, not a race to the bottom. . . . It's
time to make responsibility a way of life. . . . Let's end the old
system that fosters dependence and let's give the American people a
new one based on independence, work, responsibility, and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary ended the old system for low-income women with
uneven results. In some states, the welfare rules are so Draconian
that thousands of women were forced out of college _ the fastest
route to financial stability _ to take menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first family, it's the same old system of finding
someone to enable their dependencies. Democratic fund-raiser Terry
McAuliffe agreed to guarantee the $1.35 million mortgage for the
first family. Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for
Public Integrity, told the Times: ``This is a president who has
never had any compunction about going around with a tin cup. Most
people would have a very, very difficult time asking someone to
write a check for $1.3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would never think to ask in the first place. Most
Americans take their lumps while paying the bills and putting their
house on the line to secure home equity loans to send their
children to college. For six and a half years, Bill, the master of
the feel-your-pain handshake and hug, acted as if he felt this
angst. ``We have to change the welfare system so that it demands
the same responsibility already shouldered by millions and millions
of Americans who already get up every day, go to work, and struggle
to make ends meet and raise their children.''
</P>
<P>
   As we see Bill and Hillary pass around the tin cup, it is clear
that the medicine for low-income women was beneath them. Bad
publicity over McAuliffe's guarantee forced Bill and Hillary to try
to get a conventional loan. Buying a $1.7 million house is not the
same as being kicked off welfare for a $7-an-hour job. Still, it is
a chance for Bill and Hillary to make responsibility a way of life
not just for the poor _ but for themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For those trying to score tickets to the last
San Francisco Giants game at Candlestick Park on Thursday, Sherry
Davis has a question: ``Where were you on a cold Tuesday night
against Montreal?''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Giants' biggest fan with the loudest yet gentlest
voice at Candlestick Park, also said, ``They could have gone this
past weekend. It was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a big crowd is a better crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we have a full house of 40,000 people it isn't
as good a crowd as when we have 8,000 people,'' she said. ``Some of
our best crowds are the small ones. Then you have the really
responsive fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has been the Giants' home game announcer for seven
years, the only female announcer in Major League Baseball, has
never had much security in her job. Now that the Giants are moving
to Pacific Bell Park, her future is more uncertain than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This is a subject Davis doesn't talk about out of loyalty to the
Giants. She preferred to talk about Candlestick, and how it is that
anyone can be sentimental about the place.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of Candlestick in terms of home, where the plate has
been for four decades, and where the heart is.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've made it and you're in this perfect environment of
a home, you start to miss the old home with holes in the roof,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where you grew up and your character was formed. You
achieved something. You have a sense of accomplishment, of having
lived through it, having persevered in it, and survived in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Candlestick, you definitely had to persevere, to earn a
badge of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentimentality is often written off as a cheap emotion, but at
Candlestick it is priceless and hard-earned.
</P>
<P>
   There are all the great players who have made their home on the
windy fields of Candlestick, guys like Joe Morgan and Willie Mays.
``On Sunday, I stood there and cried like a baby for the all-time
team,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke proudly of the crowds that will never boo classy
former Giant Matt Williams, crowds that know how to appreciate
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she didn't mention the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Those night-game crowds of 8,000 knowledgeable fans always stuck
together, although perhaps the verb should be ``huddled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one place where you want a really big person sitting
next to you to block the wind,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   She told me some of her only-in-Candlestick stories, such as the
time an umpire invoked the infield fly rule for a pop-up, but the
wind carried the ball so far that the infield fly was caught in the
deep outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time a sea gull was trying to fly against the
wind outside her booth, and deposited ``a foul pop-in,'' as she
called it, through the window and all over her program.
</P>
<P>
   The weather at Candlestick isn't so bad when you consider some
alternatives, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get rain in our area. I was in Chicago for the recent
series against the Cubs. One fan drove all the way from South
Dakota to a game, and it was rained out.''
</P>
<P>
   When I called Davis at home, she started to answer the phone by
saying, ``P.A. booth.'' That's how important her little
home-within-a-home inside Candlestick has been, a place where she
and a small crew coordinate music, scoreboards and Jumbotron video
like a live, unscripted accompaniment to (apologies to jazz) the
most beautiful of American art forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a couple of ballets that tried to capture
baseball,'' Davis said. ``They couldn't come close to capturing the
beauty of a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about her voice that irks a lot of fans.
Something feminine, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone doesn't like my announcing style, that's fine,''
Davis said. ``If you don't like me because I'm a woman, then you've
got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are a lot of guys with problems who call
sports radio talk shows, guys who say they don't go out to the
ballpark to listen to women. Make that women as voices of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are 44 percent of the attendance,'' Davis said. ``If
there weren't women at the ballpark, there wouldn't be any baseball
at all.''

LOVELY CUISINE, BUT HOW TO EAT IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hazards of dining for a living would seem to be internal _
too much to eat leading to an expanding waistline or an upset
tummy. But lately the most frequent threats are not intestinal or
arterial, but sartorial. Food seems to be getting harder to handle,
and humiliation lurks for the awkward diner.
</P>
<P>
   Take the soup dilemma. Splashing is always the perilous part of
eating soup; one wants to sip the soup daintily without dots of the
liquid landing on one's shirt. (Dipping a tie into the soup is also
a danger for unfortunate males.) Usually, though, the risk can be
minimized by careful, slow manipulation of the spoon.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer I encountered soups with rafts _ tasty tidbits
forming little islands in the liquid. In one instance, clear, pale
green cucumber broth filled a large shallow bowl at 29 Newbury in
the Boston's Back Bay. Standing in it, adding to the eye appeal and
giving the cool broth a little heft, were two hollowed-out lengths
of cucumber filled with finely chopped tomatoes. Teensy watermelon
balls floated in the broth. Those were easy to scoop up, but the
cucumber towers were another matter. Too big to eat in one bite,
they weren't easily cut with a soupspoon either. In fact, a tower
fell over, creating a little fountain. In the end, the little
edifices were ignored, cute but a pain to try to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The morsels in the coconut dessert soup at Radius were too
enticing to leave behind _ miniature scoops of Thai basil ice cream
afloat on tuile cookie rafts. Sacrificing one's attire when the
soup splashed seemed a small price to pay for the haunting flavor
and scent of the basil. But I was thankful not to be dressed in
black that day.
</P>
<P>
   Soup's not the only hard-to-handle item in today's restaurants.
The current craze for height can create stacks of ingredients that
almost defy the diner to put fork to plate. This seems especially
true with appetizers _ but at least at the beginning of the meal,
the eater is still alert. That's a big advantage when deciding how
to approach an appetizer of fried tempura vegetables atop a
shredded mound of cucumbers at Atlantica in Cohasset. Chopsticks
would have helped here, since the thin curls of fried zucchini and
carrots skittered off the tines of the fork. The vegetables tasted
good, once they were wrassled into the mouth, but it was touch and
go for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   That was easy, though, compared to the napoleon, the latest
craze in stacking any sort of element. Last year, Amanda Hesser
wrote in The New York Times about napoleons fancifully constructed
of pastry and fruit, and those with layered meat and potatoes, and
rice wafers layered with peeky-toe crab salad. The Times, ever
thorough, ran an accompanying article describing exactly how to
plunge the fork into the napoleon so that it would stay intact and
not smoosh as each bite was taken.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge, all right, to handle the implements just right
so you look elegantly knowledgeable while eating one of these
constructions. Perhaps it might be best to take the instructional
article along and read it aloud at table: First plunge the fork
straight down near a corner, then repeat at a slight angle to the
first, resisting the impulse to slant the tines, etc., etc., etc. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   No wonder chefs have begun to lower the bar a little, leaving
towers behind in favor of turban-like fabrications that often
involve complicated weaving patterns. Confronted with a salad that
looks like a bird's nest, the diner might be apprehensive. But
since the turban, or nest, or even a terrine, is usually two to
three stories, comparatively speaking, instead of a skyscraper,
it's much less obvious when the woven lettuces, or roasted
vegetables, or potato slices wrapped around fish start to
deconstruct. Just eat the scattered ingredients discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   None of this compares to the terror that Asian food can inspire.
You can take your embarrassing tales of swirling spaghetti that
refused to stay on the plate; your woeful stories of brittle-topped
desserts that shoot up into the light fixtures when you try to get
to the creme brulee; your sagas of struggling with boiled lobsters.
These don't hold a candle to the slithery ingredients of hotpots
and other Chinese delights.
</P>
<P>
   Successfully maneuvering chopsticks is one of those talents best
learned young, something I, like many Americans, neglected to do.
Although I can use them without disgracing myself, I watch my much
more proficient 13-year-old with envy. And no matter how
assiduously I practice, I can't figure out how to cut meat with
chopsticks. Of course, all around me at Chinatown restaurants,
Asian diners almost magically down chunks of pork or beef without
any trouble. I carefully watch and never see anyone struggling with
this, as the chopsticks fly back and forth across the dishes. Cold
jellyfish strands also present problems, akin to the spaghetti
dilemma, since the slightly bouncy strands often resist staying
firmly between the chopsticks. And those dumplings that spurt soup
when you bite into them take a special sort of grace under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Simonds, who writes cookbooks on Asian food, explains that
if the food is in a bowl, ``it's a combination of a short distance
(to the mouth) and using the bowl to maneuver the food.'' Which
doesn't quite solve the large-bite question. A bigger mouth?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's sushi, a delight to the palate but a puzzle to the
awkward hand. You can eat sushi with your fingers _ it's perfectly
proper _ but to me it always seems to scream ``amateur.'' Holding a
curl of tuna over rice between the chopsticks is tricky, and woe to
you if you foolishly dip the rice into the soy-wasabi sauce,
instead of dipping the fish. Then you're left with drenched,
crumbled rice all over the table and a piece of fish in the
chopsticks. After a few times of ending up red-faced while others
stare, the fingers make obvious sense.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm going to be huddled in Chinatown, trying to figure out a
dignified way to eat soup dumplings.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For those trying to score tickets to the last
San Francisco Giants game at Candlestick Park on Thursday, Sherry
Davis has a question: ``Where were you on a cold Tuesday night
against Montreal?''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Giants' biggest fan with the loudest yet gentlest
voice at Candlestick Park, also said, ``They could have gone this
past weekend. It was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a big crowd is a better crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we have a full house of 40,000 people it isn't
as good a crowd as when we have 8,000 people,'' she said. ``Some of
our best crowds are the small ones. Then you have the really
responsive fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has been the Giants' home game announcer for seven
years, the only female announcer in Major League Baseball, has
never had much security in her job. Now that the Giants are moving
to Pacific Bell Park, her future is more uncertain than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This is a subject Davis doesn't talk about out of loyalty to the
Giants. She preferred to talk about Candlestick, and how it is that
anyone can be sentimental about the place.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of Candlestick in terms of home, where the plate has
been for four decades, and where the heart is.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've made it and you're in this perfect environment of
a home, you start to miss the old home with holes in the roof,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where you grew up and your character was formed. You
achieved something. You have a sense of accomplishment, of having
lived through it, having persevered in it, and survived in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Candlestick, you definitely had to persevere, to earn a
badge of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentimentality is often written off as a cheap emotion, but at
Candlestick it is priceless and hard-earned.
</P>
<P>
   There are all the great players who have made their home on the
windy fields of Candlestick, guys like Joe Morgan and Willie Mays.
``On Sunday, I stood there and cried like a baby for the all-time
team,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke proudly of the crowds that will never boo classy
former Giant Matt Williams, crowds that know how to appreciate
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she didn't mention the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Those night-game crowds of 8,000 knowledgeable fans always stuck
together, although perhaps the verb should be ``huddled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one place where you want a really big person sitting
next to you to block the wind,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   She told me some of her only-in-Candlestick stories, such as the
time an umpire invoked the infield fly rule for a pop-up, but the
wind carried the ball so far that the infield fly was caught in the
deep outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time a sea gull was trying to fly against the
wind outside her booth, and deposited ``a foul pop-in,'' as she
called it, through the window and all over her program.
</P>
<P>
   The weather at Candlestick isn't so bad when you consider some
alternatives, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get rain in our area. I was in Chicago for the recent
series against the Cubs. One fan drove all the way from South
Dakota to a game, and it was rained out.''
</P>
<P>
   When I called Davis at home, she started to answer the phone by
saying, ``P.A. booth.'' That's how important her little
home-within-a-home inside Candlestick has been, a place where she
and a small crew coordinate music, scoreboards and Jumbotron video
like a live, unscripted accompaniment to (apologies to jazz) the
most beautiful of American art forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a couple of ballets that tried to capture
baseball,'' Davis said. ``They couldn't come close to capturing the
beauty of a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about her voice that irks a lot of fans.
Something feminine, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone doesn't like my announcing style, that's fine,''
Davis said. ``If you don't like me because I'm a woman, then you've
got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are a lot of guys with problems who call
sports radio talk shows, guys who say they don't go out to the
ballpark to listen to women. Make that women as voices of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are 44 percent of the attendance,'' Davis said. ``If
there weren't women at the ballpark, there wouldn't be any baseball
at all.''
</P>

THE RISE OF PRISON INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Watson seems no different from any other factory worker.
But she is. After soldering circuit boards all day, she spends her
nights behind bars at the Federal Correctional Institution in
Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is one of 21,000 inmates nationwide earning 23 cents to
$1.15 an hour as part of a federal prison work program that is
reigniting debate around the country.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: the proposed expansion of Federal Prison Industries
Inc., a unit of the US Justice Department. Its inmates make
electronic components, furniture, clothing, and other items while
serving sentences in 94 federal prisons. Last year, FPI reported
nearly $540 million in sales. Its only customers: federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. Competing bills heading to Congress could
have a lasting impact on FPI. Under a bill known as the Prison
Industries Reform Act, which is garnering Republican and corporate
support, FPI would compete directly for private contracts while
phasing out its relationship with the government over seven years.
A key goal, say sponsors, would be to bring manufacturing back to
the United States (and away from sweatshops overseas) by offering
the use of cheap prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contend that expanding prison industries to include
private-sector work would prevent idleness among the nation's
burgeoning prison population while reducing recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   But critics charge that paying prisoners only a fraction of the
minimum wage to produce goods previously made offshore, and then
selling those goods on the open market, would create an unfair
competitive advantage that could drive some US firms out of
business and put thousands of American employees out of work.
</P>
<P>
   FPI has its own agenda. Last year, it proposed to its board of
directors that it expand by providing services, as opposed to
manufacturing, to private-sector industries. Laws in place for
decades restrict interstate sales of goods made by prisoners, but
do not mention services. As a result, FPI argued, its inmates
should be able to do data entry, kit assembly, packaging, anb U".2 &Cx12; 
services being done overseas.
</P>
<P>
   After the plan to provide services won board approval in
January, 100 female inmates at a Fort Worth prison began keying
data for Chicago-based CCC Information Services, which provides
used-car price reports to auto insurers. The work had been done in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The FPI expansion has brought together an unlikely group, from
unions to the US Chamber of Commerce, to back a second bill filed
by US Representatives Peter Hoekstra, a Michigan Republican, and
Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank. The measure would end FPI's
status as the sole supplier of goods and services to federal
agencies, giving small and mid-sized firms a crack at lucrative
government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that FPI is out of control,'' said Jack Morgan, a
spokesman for the American Apparel Manufacturing Association, which
represents about 250 US firms. Currently, US apparel firms produce
85 percent of all clothing sold wholesale in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, FPI has mandatory source preference, which means if
the US Army wants to buy T-shirts and FPI has them, regardless of
speed of delivery or even price, the Army has to buy it from FPI,''
said Morgan. ``Meanwhile, FPI keeps growing. Originally, it was
supposed to minimize its impact on the private sector. That isn't
happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, he added, the association's members doubled
production to meet military needs. ``If our companies go bankrupt,
can FPI meet the demand? We don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Hoekstra-Frank bill enjoys wide support,
observers say the Prison Industries Reform Act, sponsored by
Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, stands a better
chance of moving ahead. It has the backing of Illinois Republican
Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and McCollum
chairs a House subcommittee on crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, McCollum said the bill ``will benefit American
companies by providing a reliable labor source for those companies
that can't find enough workers in today's low unemployment economy,
and it will help reduce labor costs so that companies can remain
competitive with foreign competitors and generate greater profits
for their stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For American companies that have resorted to using foreign
workers,'' he said, the bill ``will provide a means for them to
compete using Americans to make their products and also save the
shipping costs, time delays, and the uncertainty that comes with
manufacturing products in a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   What would prevent a company from replacing American workers
with inmates? Under the bill, said McCollum staffer Susan Dryden,
private businesses would be required to maintain their present
level of employment of regular workers for at least 18 months after
entering into a contract to hire FPI inmates. But after that, union
leaders counter, companies could do as they please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are banning goods made by prison labor in China
from being sold in the United States,'' said Frank. ``But here, in
the United States, we are giving prison labor a virtual monopoly. I
want to see prisoners rehabilitated, but don't undercut companies
that are trying to employ workers here by competing against them in
the government market.''
</P>
<P>
   For Steve Schwalb, chief executive of FPI, the bill cosponsored
by McCollum and Virginia Democrat Robert C. Scott could not come at
a better time. He says the nation's federal prison population will
increase 50 percent by 2006 to almost 200,000, from 130,000
currently. Of those, about 30,000 prison workers will come under
Schwalb's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longer federal sentences, the elimination of parole at the
federal level, and a continued emphasis on drugs and border patrols
are responsible for the growth we are seeing now and expect in the
future,'' said Schwalb. ``So, this is a dilemma for us. How do we
achieve enough jobs to keep prisoners employed, keep them occupied,
and prevent recidivism?''
</P>
<P>
   The McCollum bill would require FPI to pay minimum wage to all
inmates who make products sold on the open market _ a requirement
that angers unions, which have fought to raise workers' wages and
benefits. Even worse, say union officials, companies that bring
back their manufacturing from overseas could pay inmates only a
fraction of the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Danbury facility, Lisa Watson spends most of her week
building electronic cable assemblies and harnesses for the
Department of Defense. Of the 1,200 women housed at the facility,
about 250 are working, according to Ken Kaz, associate warden of
industries and education. The prison records $7.5 million to $8.5
million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the aspects of the McCollum bill is that inmates would
make more wages, which means we could extract more money from them,
and they could send more home and pay more on their court
assessments,'' said Kaz.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had not heard about either bill, but she understands the
advantages of being in the FPI work program.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 37, a former day-care staffer, was mired in debt when,
two years ago, she walked into her local bank, handed over a note
at the teller window, and walked out with $3,700.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested after a bank employee wrote down her car's
license plate number. Now serving the last year of a 37-month
sentence, Watson believes her work experience will make a
difference when it's time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working for Mickey Mouse money, but it will help me in the
long run,'' she said of her job, which pays 92 cents an hour. ``It
gives you pride in what you do. An outside company wants to certify
us in soldering techniques. That will help me find a decent job
making more than the minimum wage when I get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over privatizing prison work is hardly new. Labor
unions have long argued against it. Over the last two decades, more
than 30 states have passed legislation allowing prisoners to work
for private companies, said Gordon Lafer, a labor professor at the
University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Oregon, prisoners can be leased for $3 per day, regardless
of the industry,'' Lafer said. Convicts book flights for TWA in
California, he said, while in Ohio, prisoners make automobile parts
for Honda, earning $2 per hour rather than the $20 to $30 hourly
wage negotiated by the United Auto Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   Although FPI has no prison factories in Massachusetts, some
local unions and small businesses are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Federal Prison Industries expansion issue is a
threat to private-sector employment in the United States and right
here in Massachusetts, especially among textile companies who
manufacture uniforms for the military,'' said Michael Cavanaugh,
secretary-treasurer for the Union of Needletrade, Industrial and
Technical Employees (UNITE) in New England.
</P>
<P>
   At Sterlingwear of Boston Inc., chief executive Jerome Danin
worries that the privatization of FPI would have a negative impact
on his business. The 30-year-old East Boston firm employs 200
unionized piece workers who make apparel for the US Air Force and
pea coats for the US Navy. Sterlingwear employees earn, on average,
$9.50 per hour as well as health, pension, and vacation benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, 50 percent of all camouflage uniforms are made by
prisoners, and the two to three companies that used to do that work
are now making our products,'' said Danin. ``So, there's been a
domino effect. We used to employ 400 people. Now, we are constantly
on the verge of being put out of business because the US State
Department is buying less. If they privatize FPI, it will affect us
and a lot more companies.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    UNITED NATIONS _ Blue helmets decorated with U.N. flags, the
gleaming horizontal General Assembly building, feverish midnight
debates in the Security Council: These are well-known public images
of the United Nations at work. Behind the scenes, however, is an
equally far-reaching site of intense activity: the press room,
known as Room 226.
 &HT;    At the moment, Room 226 is under threat by a move that could
muzzle reporters.
 &HT;    In December, the General Assembly adopted a resolution, ``United
Nations Public Information Policies and Activities,'' which
contains a paragraph _ specifically, number 12 _ allowing diplomats
into the news briefings. A new resolution is calling on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enforce the December vote.
 &HT;    ``It's absolutely ridiculous,'' one Western diplomat said about
the measure, which was initiated by Algeria, and strongly supported
by Syria and Cuba.
 &HT;    I'm told that so far, no diplomats have tried to enter Room 226,
and that if they do, they'll be turned away.
 &HT;    To be perfectly clear, the press room is the site of conferences
on any number of hot issues of the day: Iraq, Kosovo, East Timor,
the World Bank, global crime, humanitarian relief, the threat of
landmines, famines and epidemics. The noon briefings are given by
Fred Eckhard, the chief U.N. spokesman, or a deputy. Other
sessions, which must be cleared through his office, are often
conducted by presidents and prime ministers, other top government
officials or U.N. experts on subjects ranging from nuclear weapons
to global infant mortality.
 &HT;    Within the U.N. press corps _ about 150 resident correspondents
and thousands of others accredited from international media
organizations _ there's the free press (major U.S. networks, the
BBC, The Times of India, etc.) as well as official government news
agencies (from China, Indonesia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, etc.).
 &HT;    I spoke to one Third World journalist who said she believes the
diplomats want to be in Room 226 to spy. She feels it would be like
Big Brother taking notes. She says that some reporters already feel
they're at personal risk for not always portraying their political
leaders in a glowing light.
 &HT;    Other colleagues, particularly from authoritarian regimes, fear
being isolated or tagged as traitors or troublemakers. They don't
want to be seen asking ``hostile'' questions whose answers might
put their states in a bad light. They say they fear that such
behavior might prompt a call to return home for reprisal or
dismissal.
 &HT;    In any country, government officials make their displeasure
known. For example, I got a call from a Western European diplomat
complaining about my characterizing his country as an ``ally'' of
Iraq. Instead, he said, it was merely a ``supporter.'' Other
correspondents have more frightening stories of harassment to tell.
 &HT;    The new measure is all the more ironic because the U.N.
briefings are not secret proceedings. A camera is posted in back of
the rows of chairs to broadcast events live over the U.N.-TV
system, on the Internet and on local cable television. Monitors are
scattered around the headquarters _ at the delegates' entrance, in
the main lobby near the newsstand. A live audio feed runs to the
diplomatic missions. Transcripts are on the Net at www.un.org.
Every afternoon Eckhard, or his deputy, repeats the sessions for
diplomats, including the questions asked by reporters and the
responses.
 &HT;    True, the live broadcasts do not show the journalists' faces as
they ask questions. Only their voices are heard. But isn't that
enough?
 &HT;    Even now, without a camera in their faces, the more vulnerable
reporters will pass a tough question to a Western colleague to ask.
They fear voice recognition or the chance that a diplomat will
check around later to find out who asked what.
 &HT;    If the doors to Room 226 were open to all, the news briefings
might well turn into battles between advocates of clashing points
of view on the most politically sensitive, life-and-death issues
facing the world's people, rather than a forum in which you can
gather facts, figure out what's news and try to find the truth.
 &HT;    At times, bureaucrats or lobbyists or people from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) try to slip into the room,
but a U.N. staffer at the door rejects anyone without proper press
credentials. For security problems, a uniformed officer is shouting
distance away in the nearby diplomatic corridor.
 &HT;    The week of Sept. 20, when the General Assembly opened, there
were sessions on such issues as the death of a Western journalist
in East Timor, the rescue of Taipei earthquake victims, combatting
drug trafficking in Colombia, and Pakistan's case against India in
the International Court of Justice over the shoot-down of an
unarmed Pakistani aircraft. In a Sept. 22 meeting, journalists
questioned President Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria about Costa
Rica's stance against the Cuban embargo.
 &HT;    Clearly these aren't lunch-time chats.
 &HT;    Should diplomats from Indonesia be at a news briefing on East
Timor, ready to challenge whatever the press spokesman is saying?
Should those from Pakistan be able to try to advance their own
national agenda at a briefing about India?
 &HT;    I asked one member of the Information Committee, the key U.N.
group that introduced the resolution, why his colleagues who
support a free press didn't refuse to go along with paragraph 12 or
try to negotiate it out of the whole package.
 &HT;    At the time, he told me, there was concern, but there were
``bigger fish to fry'' _ by which he meant, at least in part, that
it was more important to avoid a power struggle and keep the
committee on track and running smoothly by consensus than to stand
up and fight for press rights.
 &HT;    Historically, this committee has been a site of contentious
debate. The members from East and West, and First and Third Worlds,
who have been reared in traditions that range from censorship to
freedom of speech, hold widely divergent views on what sort of
information should be made public _ all of it, part of it, none of
it or an official version of it.
 &HT;    A few members of the U.N. Correspondents Association are trying
to raise a red flag because buried as paragraph 12 is in the
original resolution, the demand to open the press-room doors hasn't
even been read yet by the majority of people it would most directly
affect.
 &HT;    If the new resolution passes _ it's on track for adoption by
November or December _ it could well provoke a major confrontation.
High-level U.N. officials say that Annan _ who dearly respects
freedom of speech and has called press freedom ``a cornerstone of
human rights'' _ will never allow diplomats the press-room access
they seek.
 &HT;    If the secretary-general rides in on a white horse to save the
day, he should do it. The problem is, nobody knows what the next
secretary-general will be inclined to do.

 &HT;    UNITED NATIONS _ Blue helmets decorated with U.N. flags, the
gleaming horizontal General Assembly building, feverish midnight
debates in the Security Council: These are well-known public images
of the United Nations at work. Behind the scenes, however, is an
equally far-reaching site of intense activity: the press room,
known as Room 226.
 &HT;    At the moment, Room 226 is under threat by a move that could
muzzle reporters.
 &HT;    In December, the General Assembly adopted a resolution, ``United
Nations Public Information Policies and Activities,'' which
contains a paragraph _ specifically, number 12 _ allowing diplomats
into the news briefings. A new resolution is calling on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enforce the December vote.
 &HT;    ``It's absolutely ridiculous,'' one Western diplomat said about
the measure, which was initiated by Algeria, and strongly supported
by Syria and Cuba.
 &HT;    I'm told that so far, no diplomats have tried to enter Room 226,
and that if they do, they'll be turned away.
 &HT;    To be perfectly clear, the press room is the site of conferences
on any number of hot issues of the day: Iraq, Kosovo, East Timor,
the World Bank, global crime, humanitarian relief, the threat of
landmines, famines and epidemics. The noon briefings are given by
Fred Eckhard, the chief U.N. spokesman, or a deputy. Other
sessions, which must be cleared through his office, are often
conducted by presidents and prime ministers, other top government
officials or U.N. experts on subjects ranging from nuclear weapons
to global infant mortality.
 &HT;    Within the U.N. press corps _ about 150 resident correspondents
and thousands of others accredited from international media
organizations _ there's the free press (major U.S. networks, the
BBC, The Times of India, etc.) as well as official government news
agencies (from China, Indonesia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, etc.).
 &HT;    I spoke to one Third World journalist who said she believes the
diplomats want to be in Room 226 to spy. She feels it would be like
Big Brother taking notes. She says that some reporters already feel
they're at personal risk for not always portraying their political
leaders in a glowing light.
 &HT;    Other colleagues, particularly from authoritarian regimes, fear
being isolated or tagged as traitors or troublemakers. They don't
want to be seen asking ``hostile'' questions whose answers might
put their states in a bad light. They say they fear that such
behavior might prompt a call to return home for reprisal or
dismissal.
 &HT;    In any country, government officials make their displeasure
known. For example, I got a call from a Western European diplomat
complaining about my characterizing his country as an ``ally'' of
Iraq. Instead, he said, it was merely a ``supporter.'' Other
correspondents have more frightening stories of harassment to tell.
 &HT;    The new measure is all the more ironic because the U.N.
briefings are not secret proceedings. A camera is posted in back of
the rows of chairs to broadcast events live over the U.N.-TV
system, on the Internet and on local cable television. Monitors are
scattered around the headquarters _ at the delegates' entrance, in
the main lobby near the newsstand. A live audio feed runs to the
diplomatic missions. Transcripts are on the Net at www.un.org.
Every afternoon Eckhard, or his deputy, repeats the sessions for
diplomats, including the questions asked by reporters and the
responses.
 &HT;    True, the live broadcasts do not show the journalists' faces as
they ask questions. Only their voices are heard. But isn't that
enough?
 &HT;    Even now, without a camera in their faces, the more vulnerable
reporters will pass a tough question to a Western colleague to ask.
They fear voice recognition or the chance that a diplomat will
check around later to find out who asked what.
 &HT;    If the doors to Room 226 were open to all, the news briefings
might well turn into battles between advocates of clashing points
of view on the most politically sensitive, life-and-death issues
facing the world's people, rather than a forum in which you can
gather facts, figure out what's news and try to find the truth.
 &HT;    At times, bureaucrats or lobbyists or people from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) try to slip into the room,
but a U.N. staffer at the door rejects anyone without proper press
credentials. For security problems, a uniformed officer is shouting
distance away in the nearby diplomatic corridor.
 &HT;    The week of Sept. 20, when the General Assembly opened, there
were sessions on such issues as the death of a Western journalist
in East Timor, the rescue of Taipei earthquake victims, combatting
drug trafficking in Colombia, and Pakistan's case against India in
the International Court of Justice over the shoot-down of an
unarmed Pakistani aircraft. In a Sept. 22 meeting, journalists
questioned President Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria about Costa
Rica's stance against the Cuban embargo.
 &HT;    Clearly these aren't lunch-time chats.
 &HT;    Should diplomats from Indonesia be at a news briefing on East
Timor, ready to challenge whatever the press spokesman is saying?
Should those from Pakistan be able to try to advance their own
national agenda at a briefing about India?
 &HT;    I asked one member of the Information Committee, the key U.N.
group that introduced the resolution, why his colleagues who
support a free press didn't refuse to go along with paragraph 12 or
try to negotiate it out of the whole package.
 &HT;    At the time, he told me, there was concern, but there were
``bigger fish to fry'' _ by which he meant, at least in part, that
it was more important to avoid a power struggle and keep the
committee on track and running smoothly by consensus than to stand
up and fight for press rights.
 &HT;    Historically, this committee has been a site of contentious
debate. The members from East and West, and First and Third Worlds,
who have been reared in traditions that range from censorship to
freedom of speech, hold widely divergent views on what sort of
information should be made public _ all of it, part of it, none of
it or an official version of it.
 &HT;    A few members of the U.N. Correspondents Association are trying
to raise a red flag because buried as paragraph 12 is in the
original resolution, the demand to open the press-room doors hasn't

<TEXT>
<P>
   Iconomy.com is expected to announce a strategic alliance this
week that may make it easier for children and teens to buy books,
CDs, and other items on line.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows kids buy enough merchandise in the real world
these days _ consumers in the 12 &UR;  &LR; to &UR;  &LR; 19 age group spent $141
billion in 1998, according to Teen Research Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   But while teens may spend as much time on the Internet as they
do at the mall, only a fraction of their money goes to e-commerce
Web sites. That's because Web purchases are mostly made with a
credit card, something most young folks don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just in time for the holidays, several companies, including
Iconomy.com, have come up with ways that could transform teens and
children into on-line big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, West Coast outfits such as RocketCash and
DoughNet are already offering parents a way to give their children
an Internet spending allowance, a sort of on-line debit-card
account that would let their children shop the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to do something similar, Iconomy.com, of Cambridge,
Mass., is teaming up with iCanBuy.com of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, iCanBuy has technology that enables parents to
create on-line debit cards for their children, and Iconomy.com
provides retail Web space where young consumers can use those debit
cards to make parentally approved purchases.
</P>
<P>
   For Iconomy.com, the deal is the latest for a company looking to
find its niche by creating customized on-line stores for
established content Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with iCanBuy, retail sites will be screened so
some items may be off-limits, says iCanBuy chief executive Paul
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't necessarily be able to get the South Park CD,'' he
says, referring to a controversial TV show and movie.
</P>
<P>
   When opening debit-card accounts, parents can set guidelines for
what children may buy and how much they can spend, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents may permit a 17-year-old son to buy certain rap
CDs, but bar their 12-year-old from shopping the on-line music
store's R-rated aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that an estimated 18 million young Americans
are wired to the Internet, analysts are unsure how many of them
will take advantage of alternative-payment methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how big a market this is going to be, probably a
small but interesting segment,'' says Alan Alper, an analyst at
Gomez Advisers Inc. in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some parents may decide that giving their children a
debit account with a $50 limit on it makes more sense than turning
junior loose on the Net with Dad's Visa card, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At Illinois-based Teenage Research Unlimited, vice president
Michael Wood wonders whether kids are ideal Internet consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens are impulse buyers, who prefer to get something from
the mall today rather than wait the three days or so it takes for
an e-commerce site to ship an item to a buyer's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want instant gratification,'' Wood says of teens.
</P>
<P>
   And parents still leery of shopping on the Web themselves are
unlikey to let their kids do it, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in fears, warranted or not, that kids may attempt to use
an Internet allowance to load up on X-rated fare, and it's hard to
say how quickly these new payment methods may catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps looking to allay some of these concerns, iCanBuy bills
itself as a Web site that teaches teens about money management.
Young consumers can use their debit-cards to make charitable
donations and, someday, to invest in mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as on-line financial training wheels,''
Herman says.
</P>
<P>
   For Iconomy.com, an alliance with iCanBuy.com is the latest step
for a company that began life in 1995 as ``an Amazon.com wannabe,''
says Iconomy chief executive Aaron Day.
</P>
<P>
   Under a previous name of BuySafe.com, the company opened an
on-line mall with more than 20 stores, selling everything from
perfume to cigars.
</P>
<P>
   BuySafe.com was responsible for the Web technology; vendors
supplied the goods, shipping purchases to the mall's customers.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it was a swell plan. Unfortunately, the mall often
looked like the on-line equivalent of an empty parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Having raised $7 million from private investors, the company
lacked the resources for a big ad campaign to drive traffic to its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to become profitable some day, the company hit upon a
new strategy. Instead of running an on-line mall, Day and cofounder
Paul Govereau went into the business of building and operating
e-commerce stores for popular Web sites that didn't have them.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, many of the dozen or so Web sites that are now
Iconomy.com clients thought they could make money by selling
information, much as a magazine charges readers subscription fees.
But with so much free information available on the Web, only a
handful of these so-called ``content Web sites'' have succeeded at
persuading consumers to pay them, says analyst Ken Cassar at
Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for revenues, many content sites next looked to make
money by selling space for so-called banner advertising that would
be displayed on their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't worked either, and now many of these sites are
pinning their hopes on revenues generated by e-commerce, says
analyst Blaine Mathieu of Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But making the transition to e-commerce isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce requires an expensive infrastructure of warehouses
and delivery systems. It also often requires time and expertise
that many content Web sites don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Unable, or unwilling, to make this investment themselves, many
content sites are turning to companies such as Iconomy.com to build
``private-label'' e-commerce stores for them.
</P>
<P>
   One such company is EGreetings.com, which once thought it could
sell e-mail greeting cards on the Web. Now when a consumer visits
the site to send a now-free electronic birthday card, the consumer
can also buy a present, thanks to a gift shop that Iconomy.com has
installed on EGreetings' Web site. Proceeds from the sale are split
between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on this theme are becoming more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Marlborough-based Be Free Inc. will help set up links that
automatically transport visitors to a content Web site to a
merchant site selling related products. For example, a consumer who
visits the Web site for Scholastic Inc., the US publisher of the
Harry Potter series of children's books, can link to Toysmart.com,
a Be Free client, to make related purchases.
</P>
<P>
   If a consumer then makes a purchase, Toysmart, or Waltham,
Mass., says it kicks back 20 percent of the sale to Scholastic.
Through Be Free, Toysmart says it has established links to
``thousands'' of content Web sites such as Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Iconomy.com, this may work fine for the e-commerce
sites such as Toysmart.com, but there may be some drawbacks for the
hosting content site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time the consumer goes on line, he goes right to the
merchant site'' and the content site can see its traffic wither
away over time, Iconomy.com's Day contends.
</P>
<P>
   Iconomy.com takes a different approach. When a customer wants to
buy a gift from EGreetings, the customer is still on the EGreetings
Web site when the transaction is completed. This allows EGreetings
to learn more about its customers and craft marketing and branding
programs that encourage customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   For Iconomy.com and EGreetings, this alliance is a marriage made
on the Internet; each supplies what the other once lacked.
</P>
<P>
   EGreetings provides Iconomy.com with the customer traffic its
mall couldn't draw as a stand-alone operation. For EGreetings,
teaming up with Iconomy.com is a cheap way to enter e-commerce and
gain a new revenue stream without referring its customers to sites
devoted exclusively to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Several rivals to Iconomy.com have sprung up in the last few
months, analyst Mathieu notes, and Iconomy.com's alliance with
iCanBuy.com is an effort to stand out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Iconomy.com now hopes to plug its clients into the debit-card
network set up by iCanBuy.com; that would let children and teens
buy merchandise from the e-commerce stores such as the one that
Iconomy.com has built for EGreetings. Presumably, that would
increase business for both.

PROTECTING A FLY MAY ENDANGER CALIFORNIA TOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLTON, Calif. _ The scientists have packed up their gear. After
two years of sifting through the sand, field reports are being
readied. But word is already out in the desert east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The fly lives.
</P>
<P>
   Putting an entomological twist to the NIMBY syndrome, some
people here had been half-hoping it was extinct, or at least not
breeding in their backyards anymore. To them, the Delhi Sands
flower-loving fly _ the only fly ever to make the endangered
species list _ has become an expensive, iridescent-eyed pest that
is threatening their economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   Barely an inch long, the fly has the full protection of the
federal government, which says the disappearing sand dunes that are
its only remaining habitat must be saved. The fly has also drawn
the full ire of local landowners and officials in five towns and
San Bernadino County. Its salvation, they say, has held up
development, cost jobs, and swamped them with debt.
</P>
<P>
   In the roughly six years since the fly was designated an
endangered species, construction projects worth hundreds of
millions of dollars have been stalled in the Inland Empire, as the
area about 60 miles east of Los Angeles is known. Single-family
homes and shopping centers have gone unbuilt. About $10 million was
spent to move the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton a few
feet after the fly was discovered nearby. The city of Fontana,
unable to collect taxes from developers who can't develop their
land, is set to default on about $46 million in bonds Oct. 1.
Officials say millions more in new development and new taxes may be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   All this, they complain, over a couple hundred insects at most,
according to a US Fish and Wildlife Service biologist.
</P>
<P>
   As Colton City Manager Henry Garcia put it, ``The appearance of
the fly has cost us big bucks. . . . There are no supporters for
the fly in the Inland Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even advocates for endangered species concede that winning
support for the Delhi Sands fly has not been easy. From the start,
its sentimental pull has been slight, more snail darter than
California condor.
</P>
<P>
   No one has printed T-shirts featuring the fast flier, which
looks more like a dragonfly than a housefly and lives but a week
after emerging from the sandy soil where its eggs are laid.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, someone might print a shirt featuring it in the
crosshairs. At a recent meeting, a local horse rancher lashed out
at wildlife service representives for choosing a fly over property
values and progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use the word `fly' in a derogatory sense, but it's a
very interesting creature,'' said Daniel Silver, coordinator with
the Endangered Habitats League in Los Angeles. ``It may be
important as a pollinator for plants we don't even know about. You
take away the fly, you take away the plants, you take away the
plants, you take away the animals. It's all connected. . . . But
it's not just the fly. It's the habitat. It's part of our
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Inland Empire, locals seem more concerned with the
present. After years of negotiating with wildlife service
representatives, city officials say they don't have the money or
the resources to meet the agency's demand that they finance a
preserve for the Delhi Sands fly. This insect, they warn, could
bankrupt them all.
</P>
<P>
   The dunes, surrounded by freeways and residential spillover from
Los Angeles, do not come cheap _ and federal officials say they do
not have the money to purchase them.
</P>
<P>
   Land in the region goes for as much as $100,000 an acre, and the
federal government wants as many as 2,100 acres set aside for a fly
preserve. Buying the land outright would cost $220 million,
according to area officials. Rehabilitating and maintaining the
habitat could cost even more, they fear.
</P>
<P>
   The five cities and county facing the mandate have made a
counter offer of as much as 850 acres _ if the 280 acres proposed
for a preserve in Colton, ground zero for the Delhi Sands fly,
prove insufficient to rejuvenate the species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say to the federal government, `Write us a check for $220
million and we're sure these property owners will sell you the
land,' '' said Ray Bragg, Fontana's redevelopment director. `` `If
you can't come up with the money, then take the fly off the
endangered species list because you aren't serious about trying to
preserve it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Avery, a wildlife service biologist, stressed the
importance of salvaging the last remaining dunes system in the Los
Angeles basin. He noted that the fragile ecosystem is also home to
eight other species of insects found nowhere else and possibly to a
plant on the verge of extinction. He also said there are many ways
to fund the habitat, among them developer fees and so-called
mitigation banks that would allow developers to buy credits from
other property owners who cede their land to the habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of meetings, however, no solution that will save
the Delhi Sands fly and allow development to proceed appears
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of folks are missing is that this fly is found
nowhere else in the world and that it's an ecosystem found nowhere
else in the world,'' said Avery. ``Every ecosystem has its
intrinsic value, and maybe we can't quite put a dollar vallue on
it. But every time one disappears, it's an indication that
something else is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong is clear to developers, many of them reluctant to
speak out for fear of riling the wildlife service and forcing
further delays. Their projects face costly, even ruinous delays;
federal regulations require area developers to conduct a two-year
survey proving their land is free of the fly.
</P>
<P>
   The survey for the Fontana Center, a proposed shopping mall in
Fontana that is now just overgrown ground, ended Monday. To the
owners' relief, not a single fly was found. City officials hope
that means something will be built and that some taxes will be
paid. The former owners refused to pay taxes after the fly halted
development, and the new owner has not paid either. Bragg said the
bill stands at about $19 million, including penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the property knowing nothing about the fly problem,
and when we found out, we thought we could work out an equitable
solution,'' said Eric Scriven, vice president of Fontana Empire
Center, the land's would-be developer. ``We were hopeful. That was
a mistake in our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, of the Endangered Habitats League, lamented the
confrontational atmosphere in the Inland Empire and said he is
convinced that developers and the fly can not only coexist but
thrive. Otherwise, the Delhi Sands fly is likely to go the way of
the El Segundo fly, which succumbed when the soil where it grew
gave way to Los Angeles International Airport. California will have
lost something real but intangible.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Avery of the wildlife service emphasizes
preservation of the habitat, breeding flies would be pointless if
they have nowhere to lay eggs. The Delhi Sands fly once flourished
over 40 square miles in the Inland Empire, but entomologists have
so far been unable to breed it in captivity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, Colton's city manager, wonders if the federal government
is even interested in a compromise. He estimates that the stalemate
has cost Colton about $660 in economic development, as well as
idling a multimillion-dollar electrical substation built to support
the proposed commercial developments. The government, he added,
stands to lose nothing but time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their posture is obviously environmental filibustering,''
Garcia said. ``They don't have any money to buy the land. They
don't have any money to protect the land. They want us to do it for
them, but at what cost?''

MEXICO SAID TO BE IGNORING MERCURY PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZACATECAS, Mexico _ Like a giant, well-preserved museum, this
arid central Mexican city prominently displays its Spanish colonial
relics with a distinctive 20th-century twist.
</P>
<P>
   The bull ring, Mexico's oldest, has been remolded into a
five-star hotel. The stately town market, which once drew chicken
and cheese vendors into its stone walls, now houses a spotless mall
where wines and Nikes are sold. And one of the city's oldest silver
mines is now the hot local disco.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spaniards' biggest leftover has become one of Mexico's
most serious environmental problems. Experts say thousands of tons
of mercury, imported to extract silver and gold from the hills,
have contaminated the soil and water at rates hundreds of times
above internationally accepted levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the contamination is there,'' said
Jose Castro Diaz, a biologist who specializes in toxic materials
for the government's National Ecology Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican environmental and health officials, plagued by poor
record-keeping and inadequate resources, have failed to study the
area or its people comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
   Zacatecas illustrates Mexico's inability to keep its word on
urgent environmental matters, such as mercury, since the signing of
the sweeping North American Free Trade Agreement five years ago. As
part of NAFTA, Mexico pledged with the United States and Canada to
cut the amount of certain toxic substances such as DDT, PCBs,
chlordane, and mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the United States has halved its mercury emissions
through tougher detection and enforcement that has restricted
mercury use in everything from thermometers to coal-burning fuel
plants. Canada has sliced its emissions by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico? Its government says it doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, an area considered by many experts to contain the
heaviest concentration of mercury deposits left over from
colonial-era mining, the most thorough soil and water tests have
been conducted by foreign companies looking to invest here.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Some doctors blame the mercury for growing number of
illnesses, ranging from kidney infections to chronic bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern that Mexico hasn't conducted inventory studies
of its own, but it is a developing country that has to pick and
choose its priorities and may not be able to focus on this as
Canada and the US can,'' said Luke Trip, a Canadian environmental
official and chairman of a NAFTA task force studying the mercury
issue. ``The important thing now is to help the Mexicans build the
capacity to do a full-scale study.''
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian engineering firm found between 200 and 800 grams of
mercury per ton of soil outside Zacatecas around Lake Pedernalillo.
The accepted level of mercury adopted by the World Health
Organization is 1 gram per ton.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby farms use the lake's water to nurture corn, beans and
other vegetables for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is doing him in, former miner Rodolfo Garcia said. With
every delicate step he takes around his small cinderblock house, a
grimace of pain streaks across his wrinkled and unshaven face.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 53, has had two operations during the last year to
remove kidney stones that doctors said developed unusually quickly.
Another recent medical exam showed that his lungs are unusually
thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel older than I am,'' said Garcia, who has lost two
younger colleagues to similar ailments in the last two years. ``I
used to be strong and healthy, but now I can't even walk long
distances because it hurts too much and I run out of breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mining is what created Zacatecas. The grassy hills in this
region were known to the Chichimeca Indians for their rich deposits
of gold, silver and nickel. Spaniards in search of the mythical El
Dorado, the golden city in the desert, colonized the city in the
1550s and continued clawing the area for precious metals. Zacatecas
soon became Mexico's dominant center for silver production,
accounting for as much as half of the country's output.
</P>
<P>
   To extract the gold and silver, the Spaniards used amalgated
mercury, which was imported by the ton from mines in Spain. It was
the process used for the next 400 years, even after the Mexicans
won their independence from the Spanish crown in 1821. The practice
finally was halted in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials must decide what to do with the residues that
have washed down the hills into nearby rivers, lakes and fields.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, a naturally occurring toxic element usually found in
small amounts, can be converted into a highly toxic form through
mining. Mercury poisoning, which can happen through prolonged
exposure or consumption of contaminated fish and foods, can damage
human kidneys, livers and nervous systems and impair child
development.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexican officials readily admit they lack enough funds
or technical know-how to thoroughly investigate the amount of
mercury contamination in Zacatecas, the government's passiveness
stands in contrast to its aggressive handling of lead poisoning
earlier this year in the northern city of Torreon.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, environmental workers descended on the city when a
local doctor revealed in April that hundreds of children had
dangerously high levels of lead in their blood. Government lawyers
immediately ordered the local mining company, Met-Mex Penoles S.A.
de C.V., to cut production in half and to pay for remediation
measures, including neighborhood sweeps and thousands of additional
medical exams.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Zacatecas case lacks an easily identifiable
culprit like a company, critics say the government has been
unwilling to accept responsibility for either removing the mercury
or providing health care to those who have been affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is simply minimizing the dangers because it's
not ready to handle a billion-dollar disaster, which is what we
have here,'' said Martin Sutti, a local miner who has worked with
the NAFTA task force on the Zacatecas issue. ``We have dozens of
cases of unexplained illnesses here and studies that show
contamination and our government has done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sutti held a government permit to dig for silver and
gold around the lake, but he lost the contract after failing to
pursuade foreign investors who balked at the higher costs that
would be involved in cleaning the contaminated sites. The area
around Pedernalillo is believed to have the highest concentration
of mercury in the entire Zacatecas area.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have settled into this area, so the risk of
exposure is growing every day,'' added Sutti, 56, whose former wife
also has suffered from kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   Zacatecas is not the only place that officials consider
potentially contaminated. Other heavy silver mining areas where
mercury was used for extraction include the state of Guanajuato,
Hidalgo and the southern city of Taxco.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is mercury the only potentially toxic material that must be
studied. Officials say tests for cadmium, lead and arsenic also are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and other Mexican officials say that once an action plan
has been drafted sometime over the next few months, they hope to
begin early stages of testing in Zacatecas. With help from the
NAFTA task force and other outside sources, they hope to have a
clearer national picture by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where the sources of mercury are, we just don't have
the data yet,'' said Castro. ``We're trying to resolve a
400-year-old problem. Maybe we should set more realistic goals that
are different from the US and Canada, but we are starting to take
some measures.''

DIRECTOR BREAKS NEW GROUND IN `THREE KINGS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two movies ago, David O. Russell wasn't a filmmaker per se. He
was just writing-directing with a one-way ticket to that place a
guy goes when his filmography starts looking like a
moving-pictorial therapy session in which similar themes are
repeatedly explored, sometimes to the point of solipsism.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad thing, especially after ``Spanking the Monkey''
(1994) and ``Flirting With Disaster'' (1996) came on with the
idiosyncratic force of someone who could make dysfunction work for
him and for anybody with a few Thanksgiving dinners worth of family
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's specialty seemed to be men in turmoil, namely with
some acerbic Oedipal issues. ``Spanking the Monkey'' dealt with a
college kid (Jeremy Davies) and the fallout after he sleeps with
his mother, for whom he gave up an internship to nurse. ``Flirting
With Disaster'' was jump-started by an adoptee's (Ben Stiller)
cross-country search for his birth mother.
</P>
<P>
   The bleakly comic existentialism of Russell's first film and the
follow-up's breakneck, joy-ride frivolity were distinctive enough
to establish him as a director who would still seem independent
regardless of who gave him money to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than make a mother trilogy, Russell decided to move
outside the comparatively more comfortable domestic spaces for more
organic ones.
</P>
<P>
   His third film, ``Three Kings'' is set in Iraq just after the
Gulf War. It's a movie so much more visually stimulated than his
previous two that it looks like he was Oliver-Stoned drinking
Spike-Scorsese cocktails between takes. (``At the time I was
watching Mikhail Kalatozov's 1964 `I Am Cuba' about the Bay of Pigs
invasion.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I had another idea I was researching,'' he said in a laid-back
Los Angeles calm. ``Then I saw a Warner Brothers story log and this
line jumped out at me about a heist in the Gulf and I couldn't stop
thinking about it, so I dropped my other idea about America circa
1900. I took the idea of a heist. Then the L.A. Times had a
day-by-day of the war _ front page _ with these color Xeroxes. It
was the first war that had color newspaper pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   The film stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike
Jonze as U.S. soldiers looking for the millions in gold that Saddam
Hussein stole from the Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is neither the Clooney star vehicle nor the action
movie that Warner Bros. is trying to market it as. It's an ensemble
comedy-satire of that war that manages to give voice to each of the
factions that participated in it, including one Kuwaiti character
(Cliff Curtis) and one Iraqi (Said Taghmaoui), both of whom
suffered losses. The Arab characters in ``Three Kings'' are
depicted with naturalism and unsensationalized humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me there was no face on the enemy in that war, which was
the most frightening thing about it,'' Russell said. ``If you can
reduce to a silicon image of a house with a bomb hitting it, it
seems to take the war out of war. Nobody really went into the
villages during the war. So I loved the rodeo-like chaos at the end
of the war where guys could get in the Jeep and go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Then they get to hang out with these people who, originally,
were `camel jockeys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They become very human. You get to know the guy _ `You have a
family like I have a family. You went into the Reserve like I went
into the Reserve, just to make some money. Neither one of us wants
to be here. Neither one of us likes Saddam. So if we both don't
like Saddam, how come America's not doing anything to get rid of
Saddam?'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a post-war film, ``Three Kings'' is an
unlikely period piece _ the haywire March 1991 setting held the
41-year-old filmmaker's attention more than the war itself. Russell
uses the Rodney King beating, Bart Simpson dolls on the grills of
Jeeps, Public Enemy's seminal album ``Fear of a Black Planet,'' and
arguments over Lexus convertibles and black quarterbacks as
recurring pop-culture landmarks of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched about a week of the bombing,'' he said. ``This movie
begins when everybody stopped watching. It's not about the war. The
war itself is a pretty boring affair to me. It was rockets going
off on the TV screen for a month. Then everybody breaks out the
yellow ribbons, then turns away. That's when this movie begins,
when they're partying. I just kind of liked diving into the minutia
of 1991 and what was in those guys' heads.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Courage fascinates me. I want to try to
understand it, to have it.
</P>
<P>
   I read books about courage. And I read war stories. Not the ones
that describe terrain, battle lines, chain of command, troop
movements and regimental history, but the ones that show individual
grit and endurance, the ones that tell about someone who decided to
do a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust produced many stories of courage. Some were
written by Jews, such as Viktor Frankl and Elie Weisel, who
survived the death camps. Others had stories written about them,
such as the townspeople of Le Chambon, France, who saved Jews in
the very midst of the firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us feel we do not qualify to be included in a book about
courage. We have not put our lives on the line to save others.
</P>
<P>
   People who have done so can look back and say not only, ``I WAS
brave,'' but ``I AM brave.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the rest of us? Should a person get ``courage
credit'' for leaving a comfortable job for one with more challenge?
Or for standing up to a schoolyard bully or unfair boss? Or for
escaping an abusive relationship? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, most of my physician colleagues do not describe
themselves as courageous. The exceptions might include doctors who
track the Ebola virus or spend Saturday nights in hospital
emergency rooms caring for people with gang-inflicted injuries _
knowing that the emergency room might be invaded by other gang
members. They may think of themselves as courageous, and they are
right.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, courage is an everyday matter in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   I know one physician who cared for his two children and his wife
while she had chemotherapy. A cancer specialist, he continued his
practice during her treatment. Every day he saw patients with the
same diagnosis as his wife, many of whom were not doing well. He
wonders now how he made it through. I call him courageous.
</P>
<P>
   I know another physician who took care of his radiation therapy
patients at the same time he was receiving chemotherapy for his own
widespread cancer. He loved his patients and wanted to keep on
helping them. Love and courage are linked.
</P>
<P>
   I know three splendid physicians who were raised by psychotic
parents. One of the doctors now cares for her mother, along with
her responsibilities as department chair at a busy hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Is theirs a textbook definition of courage: to face a difficult
situation with bravery? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   I know a physician who trained and served in a violent part of
the world. Her hospital was attacked by security forces one night
and 68 colleagues were killed. She was away at the time but went
back to work as soon as she returned.
</P>
<P>
   Courage comes from the Latin ``cor,'' meaning heart. She has it.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues remark upon the quality of her smile and the way
it heals them. Heart, love and courage flow together.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I know a conscientious young physician who saw a
partner's patient in the emergency room one evening. Thorough
examination and testing did not reveal the cause of her difficulty.
There was nothing specific to treat.
</P>
<P>
   As she was leaving for home, the physician gave her his office,
beeper and home phone numbers and urged her to call if she got
worse. The patient agreed. She was brought in the next morning,
dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the physician told of this experience, he added, ``And I had
to see 23 patients in the clinic that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Crushed and burdened, he anticipated more burdens. Somehow, he
summoned the will to manage his devastation, harness his intellect
and practice good medicine for those 23 people despite his
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Courage? As one colleague said, ``Courage is more everyday than
I realized.''

SAN FRANCISCO _  TOWER  _ On September 6, the last night of its
life, Stars could not hide its age. The San Francisco restaurant no
longer glowed with the light of chandeliers and Tiffany lamps. Dirt
showed on the beige stars woven into the forest green carpet. In
the basement, stuffed into a box with pictures of Willie Brown,
David Letterman and Tommy Tune, was a white chef's jacket
embroidered with the name Jeremiah Tower. &HT;    Stars, Tower's shrine to the sexy rebirth of American regional
cooking and all things glittery, had fallen. And the man who once
reigned as California's most creative chef and presided over the
biggest party in San Francisco during the height of the
greed-is-good '80s had closed up shop and left town.

 The Rise &AMP; Fall of a Star: How Jeremiah Tower, the king
of  California Cuisine, lost his restaurant empire   By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  On September 6, the last night of its life, Stars
could not hide its age. The San Francisco restaurant no longer
glowed with the light of chandeliers and Tiffany lamps. Dirt showed
on the beige stars woven into the forest green carpet. Hundreds of
photographs of the famous, who for 15 years had made Stars the site
of their own fabulous dinner party, had been stripped from the
walls.
<P>
   And in the basement, stuffed into a box with pictures of Willie
Brown, David Letterman and Tommy Tune, was a white chef's jacket
embroidered with the name Jeremiah Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Stars, Tower's shrine to the sexy rebirth of American regional
cooking and all things glittery, had fallen. And the man who once
reigned as California's most creative chef and presided over the
biggest party in San Francisco during the height of the
greed-is-good '80s had closed up shop and left town. It will be
reincarnated on October 6, with the same name. But it will be an
entirely different restaurant. And Tower won't be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   When Stars opened in 1984 on a desolate alley near the Civic
Center, socialite Denise Hale and the rest of the city's social
cream led the charge. The stars of theater, music and politics
weren't far behind. Mikhail Gorbachev and Danny Kaye. Joe DiMaggio
and Rudolph Nureyev. Luciano Pavarotti and Lauren Hutton. Danielle
Steel and Liza Minnelli. They came to eat Tower's version of the
new California cuisine, marvel at his brilliant sauces and giggle
over late-night hot dogs served with sauerkraut and Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The wait staff was regarded as the best in the city. Chefs from
all over made pilgrimages to sit near the open kitchen and simply
watch the wild Tower-led crew of hot young cooks.
</P>
<P>
   But Stars shone brightest in its dining room, where Tower
floated from table to bar to kitchen and back again, a flute of
Champagne in hand. Tall and handsome, he dressed in European suits
or chef's whites, with a perfect white apron draped down to his
ankles. He possesed an impeccable palate, an appetite for alcohol,
a famous temper and a rich cache of stories from his travels around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few words spoken with an accent that was a patchwork
of time spent in Great Britain, Australia and his native East
Coast, he could make diners who stumbled into his charming web feel
as though they were the most important people in the room. And the
next day, he might not know their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stars had a comfortable feeling but at the same time was
elegant,'' says Hale, who popularized the concept of the A List and
was named one of the country's most influential women by Vanity
Fair in 1998. ``It was like Le Cirque. Once you went to Jeremiah,
you knew you were with someone who really knew how to do it. It's
very simple, really. It was &LR;  the  &LR; place.''
</P>
<P>
   From his early days in the 1970s as the chef at Chez Panisse to
his rise to the prestigious James Beard Foundation's Chef of the
Year in 1996, Tower, became a California food legend. He
popularized the American brasserie and is one of a handful of chefs
who helped Americans fall back in love with their own food.
</P>
<P>
   Goat cheese on salad, salsa on fish, individual thin-crusted
pizzas _ Tower had a part in creating them and then turning them
into staples in America's restaurants. His excelled at juxtaposing
flavors. He insisted on ingredients that were the best, the
freshest and the most local, and served them with a strong dash of
sass.
</P>
<P>
   But on this night in early September, the night of the Last
Supper, the star had clearly faded. A sprinkling of the socially
important had shown up, as much to offer support for the new
restaurant that would emerge in the space in October (see related
story) as to grab one more hit of the old Stars magic.
</P>
<P>
   The menu featured Stars standards _ roast pork with mango salsa;
steak tartare with ancho chile puree; cornmeal blinis with lobster
and caviar and enough butter, as Tower always urged, to drip down
diners' wrists.
</P>
<P>
   There were former cooks and waiters, many of whom credit their
cars and condos to the $400 a night they made in Stars' heyday.
Many describe their tenure at Stars as the best and the worst time
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 80 percent of the city's best chefs today went through
the Stars kitchen. Everyone wanted to get it on their resume,''
says BayTV chef Joey Altman, who Tower fired in 1986 and who has
since gone on to open Wild Hare in Menlo Park. ``But it was kind of
like working for an alcoholic parent. One day was Christmas and the
next day you were banished from the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd was Mark Franz, Tower's protege who essentially ran
the Stars kitchen for a decade but who left in a bitter break about
three years ago to open the well-received Farallon. He took with
him several other former Stars staffers, including pastry chef
Emily Luchetti. He loves the man he calls his brother, even though
the two didn't speak for two years after Franz left.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days you could break the rules,'' Franz says. ``JT
loved to use local stuff and put it together in a classical way. We
used all these products people had never heard of but were right in
their backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he says, people are much harder to please. ``They know
everything. Cooking shows are on TV 24 hours a day. But back then,
you never saw the kind of product we were putting on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz recalls perfect salads topped with local goat cheese,
dishes like braised endive and shanks of Somona lamb _ food now
common in restaurants from Anchorage to Orlando. And he remembers
working for a man who could be unpredictable, moody and an
unrelenting perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew if you were going to get your ass kicked or
what. You could really get roasted for doing the wrong thing,''
Franz says. ``But he was always a gentleman to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last night of Stars life, with the walls empty and the
grand piano quiet, Franz shook his head. ``It's like being at your
ex-wife's funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the evening's buzz centered on whether Tower, 57,
would show. It wouldn't be unlike him. He had been in San Francisco
a month earlier. He stayed at a Nob Hill hotel, helped a former
chef celebrate her 50th birthday, did a little business and
gathered his collection of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But he would not be at his restaurant's Last Supper. And by
midnight, the new owners began to dismantle Tower's vehicle to fame
and a place that had changed the way America cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Tower, who declined repeated requests from The Chronicle for an
interview, was 6,000 miles away in Manila. A new set of investors
opened a small Stars there in April. Having sold off all of his
empire, Tower is banished from connecting his name to Stars
restaurants anywhere in the world save the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE ARCHITECT LANDS IN BERKELEY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The way Tower recounts it in interviews, he walked into the Chez
Panisse kitchen in 1972 and was asked to improve the nightly soup.
He added white wine, cream and salt. Owner Alice Waters and her
crew were floored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall if it was a soup or what he did,'' Waters said
recently when asked about what made her hire him. ``He had a lot of
confidence and I had none. He would just come in and do something
wonderful everyday. I needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut off from his family's financial support and armed with a
masters' degree in architecture from Harvard University and a vague
plan to find work doing underwater design in Hawaii, Tower landed
in California. He decided to apply for a job at Chez Panisse
because he was broke and because that was where he had once eaten a
memorable berry tart. His previous cooking experience amounted to a
sandwich-making stint in a London pub.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, people still debate whether Tower or Waters
invented California cuisine. Likely it was a synergy of talent
colored by the state of California's food in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. Laura Chenel was starting to market her goat cheese.
Bruce Aidells was showing up at the back doors of restaurants
selling andouille sausage he'd made in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Demurs Waters: ``It was just a matter of very good timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a rivalry emerged, and adding to it were the breakups of
their relationships, both intimate and professional, which weren't
pretty, according to several people who were around the pair at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had no formal training, Tower's perspective on
excellent food had been well formed early on. Born in Stamford,
Conn., he and his brother and sister followed his parents around
the world _ his father was an international salesman of movie sound
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Tower was weaned in the dining rooms of cruise ships and hotels,
and later on fine, old wines and caviar-covered blinis served at
his Russian uncle's apartment in Washington, D.C. In college, he
charmed his roommates with chicken livers sauteed in Madeira and
multi-course dinners made with whatever was on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the early Chez Panisse days, when a three-course dinner cost
less than $8, Tower's confidence, sometimes more than the food
itself, carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time he made salt cod _ grilled salt cod, I
think,'' Waters says. ``I don't even think he soaked it. I said,
`Jeremiah, I think it's too salty. How can I sell it in the dining
room?' He said, `Alice, tell them to drink lots of red wine with
it. It's great. It's what they do in Provence.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She did and people ate it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to have that kind of confidence to be a chef,''
she says. ``Many, many times I totally believed and never
questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone fell in love with him, recalls Gourmet editor and
former New York Times restaurant critic Ruth Riechl, who worked in
Berkeley during the 1970s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Berkeley then there was this feeling like, `Oh, it's OK'
and that was good enough. With him, OK wasn't good enough. He
brought this amazing style into the community and everybody _ men
and women _ were in love with him. He was like a character out of a
movie. We were all walking around in Birkenstocks and here comes
this English gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower left Chez Panisse in 1978. Around that time, Waters had
helped arrange a dinner for James Beard in Big Sur. One of Tower's
courses, recalls Chronicle columnist and former Beard assistant
Marion Cunningham, was simply a big, black truffle presented to
every diner on a white plate. Dessert was tangerine sorbet served
in hollowed out tangerines that hung from a live tree.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Waters wrote Tower a letter praising his skills
and admiring his person. It was, she says, a love letter. Tower
would later frame it and hang it in Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) a little bit of malicious vengeance,'' he would tell
a reporter shortly after Stars opened. ``People can see in her own
handwriting just who is whose disciple.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; TOWER TAKES ON THE CITY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Tower left Chez Panisse and landed at the Balboa Cafe, owned by
Cathy and Doyle Moon. The Moons, who are now out of the San
Francisco restaurant business, gave Tower the Balboa as a sort of
trial for what would become his first national, high-profile chef
job at the Santa Fe Bar and Grill.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the Balboa or the Santa Fe were enough. In July
1984, Tower and the Moons opened Stars. Big, elegant, fun and
lively, Stars produced the city's cutting-edge food. Tower's own
sense of culinary style, polished at the hand of his mentor, French
chef Richard Olney, was at its pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first conceived of Stars, his model was probably `21'
in New York,'' says Laurence deVries, Stars' first general manager.
``He had people who knew San Francisco society working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, deVries said the last time he saw Tower
was in court. Neither side would discuss the case, and deVries
would only say that he has been estranged for 12 years from a man
he called ``ruthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower is no stranger to lawsuits. In fact, he might be one of
the most deposed chefs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He ended his relationship with the Moons in court in 1988. After
leaving the Santa Fe in 1986, complaining publicly about how the
Moons were handling things, the relationship quickly deteriorated.
It appeared that Stars might have to be sold to satisfy both
partners, but after a protracted battle, Tower kept the restaurant
by offering the Moons $1.35 million. The Moons countered with an
ill-fated suit challenging Tower's management of Stars. In an
interview at the time, he called himself ``the black widow spider
of partners,'' and when it was all over, Tower celebrated by bying
a BMW motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawsuits followed. A waiter who had contracted AIDS
sued Tower and won $30,000 in 1993 after claiming Tower had fired
him because of his condition. Tower, who would regularly
participate in AIDS fund-raisers as well as other charity events,
claimed in court he didn't know the waiter had AIDS. Tower landed
in court again over the name of Speedo 690, a short-lived
restaurant he opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the 1980s marked the beginning of what would be a
flurry of expansions and closures of Stars and its offshoots,
debuting with the opening of Stars Cafe next door to the original
restaurant. A huge success, it featured Tower's food in a more
casual, less expensive setting.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Tower had become what many would argue was the
nation's first true celebrity chef. He was a subject in a $100
million ad campaign that profiled Dewars scotch drinkers. Next to
an image of a Tower wearing a tuxedo and his charming three-quarter
grin, the copy proclaimed ``Aristocrat, confident and a
self-described monarchist.''
</P>
<P>
   But 1989 was also the year the first cracks began to appear in
the Stars empire.
</P>
<P>
   Franz, who left in a bitter break-up with Tower in 1996, says
Tower himself traced it to the Loma Prieta earthquake. Overnight,
the bustling Civic Center area turned into a near ghost town.
Office buildings were emptied to be retrofitted. Stars went from
serving 250 lunches a day to almost zero. Franz says Tower told
him, ``Mark, this is kind of the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors were also conspiring to end the Stars empire. The
high-rolling '80s morphed into the recession of the early 1990s.
The era of the big expense account and fashionable two-martini
power lunch was over. And, whether due to his duties as a celebrity
chef or his own disinterest, Tower spent less and less time at
Stars. Reviews show the food suffered, prices went up and people
who came expecting to see the star of Stars left disappointed and
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tower was selling off pieces of the Stars
name, gathering more investors and partners and expanding faster
than prudence might have warranted. A string of operations like
StarBake bakery, StarMart take-out and cookware shop, a venture in
Hong Kong and Stars restaurants in Singapore, Palo Alto and
Oakville came and went.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Tower was named Chef of the Year by the New York-based
James Beard Foundation _ an honor that had California's food elite
scratching their heads. By that time, the Stars empire had all but
crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Stars San Francisco was losing $1 million a year,
according to New York public relations man Arthur Gallego, who had
been Tower's romantic partner and the spokesperson for Stars for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   That year, to unload a flood of debts and satisfy a string of
investors, Tower signed away ownership of the trademarked Stars
name and its concept to San Francisco businessman Andrew Yap.
Tower's role was reduced to marketing and creative consultant, says
Stanley Morris, managing partner of the group that now owns every
Stars except the one in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   After a year that saw the opening of a new Stars in Seattle,
Tower and the company that now owned his restaurants severed their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego, who was with Stars until 1997, says he still sees and
talks with Tower. Like some who were close to Tower, Gallego
remains one of his great defenders. He says that between the
lawsuit with the Moons, the earthquake and the simple fact that the
energy Tower put into Stars could not be sustained forever, Stars
faded. Criticism of Tower's business practices and personal style
didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we do in this society is promote and ask people to be
confident and magnetic and outspoken and when we finally encounter
someone who is, we shoot them down,'' Gallego said. ``I think there
was a lot of jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Manetti Farrow, among the San Francisco society crowd that
stuck with Stars though its ups and downs and is actively
supporting the new Stars chef, put it simply. ``I think JT got
burned out. He was burned out in 1990, so he just gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave Tower in America's history? On one side
are detractors like Mimi Sheraton, a former New York Times food
critic who now writes for magazines such as Vanity Fair. ``I'm just
not aware of him as innovator with a nationwide influence. I think
if you went up to people here (in New York) and asked, `Who was
Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters,' they'd know. I really don't
believe, except for the most dedicated foodies and those very tuned
into California cuisine, they would even know his name.''
</P>
<P>
   But chefs like Bizou's Loretta Keller, a veteran of the Stars
kitchen who fed him twice during his last trip to San Francisco,
says Tower's food endures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his dishes are so brilliant I never get tired of
making them. There's a dish of grilled figs with prosciutto,
arugula and berry vinaigrette. I put mint mascarpone in each fig
and drizzle the vinaigrette over it. That is really a JT dish.''
</P>
<P>
   He possesses one of the most remarkable memories for flavors she
has ever encountered, she says. ``And he had this sort of tireless
sort of creativity that ultimately could be argued was his demise.
He could never leave well enough alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But like so many of Tower's former collegues, Keller says Tower
can be ``abusive and insensitive.'' And he doesn't care much
whether he leaves bridges to his past intact. ``He has an arrogance
about him in personal relationships and places. Once he's done it,
he's done it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is, apparently, quite done with San Francisco. ``I think
bittersweet is the right word for it,'' says his San
Francisco-based lawyer, Richard Collier.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he's content to spend time near the pool of his new
home in Manila's tony Forbes Park district, cultivating his latest
group of investors and admirers. Gallego, who is Filipino, says
Tower ``has always loved Asian culture and has a lot of Filipino
friends.'' Plus, Gallego adds, Tower loves to scuba dive, and a
life on the clean beaches of Manila with some time spent headlining
the occasional food event doesn't seem like a bad way to recover
from what both friends and foes term a serious case of burn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeremiah got restless and now he is tired,'' says
Denise Hale. ``I'm very unhappy he let Stars go, but you don't
judge your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, writing Tower's culinary obituary would be premature.
Stars in Manila is certainly a humble start for a comeback. Open
since April, the 100-seat restaurant, located in a condominium and
retail complex, becomes a disco after midnight. And Tower doesn't
own any of it. He works there under a personal services contract.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be back, his fans say. He just won't be back in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
To some, buying Stars from chef Jeremiah Tower and reopening it
under the same name might be the height of marketing folly. To
others, it's a brilliant way to reposition what was once a great
San Francisco restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The new Stars opens October 1 with a completely new look, new
management team and new chef. But the ghost of Stars past won't be
purged from the property on Golden Gate avenue _ in fact, the new
owners are counting on it sticking around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenants and standards that Stars established at its time,
those values, we're not letting go of,'' says Stanley Morris, the
43-year-old restaurateur who is now managing partner of the new
Stars operation. ``The name doesn't just stand for its founder, it
stands for all the excellent qualities of the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities include a focus on simply prepared food using
seasonal, local ingredients. The new chef, Christopher Fernandez,
will take his cooking experience from Oliveto's in Oakland and
Crescent Park Grill in Palo Alto and give it his own twist to
create something he's calling ``rustic regional cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new menu, fans of the old Stars can expect lots
of changes inside the restaurant. The once-famous open kitchen will
be partially blocked by a new wood-burning oven and rotisserie. The
elevated tier _ once reserved for the celebrity diners who flocked
to the place _ has been leveled and filled with chocolate brown
Pullman booths. The star-studded carpet has been replaced with wood
floors covered in hand-woven rugs.
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured some of the society followers who frequented
Stars in the 1980s will still be around. Several have been hosting
pre-opening dinner parties featuring food prepared by Fernandez.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &UR; Tower on Tower &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Jeremiah Tower was a reporter's dream _ always ready with a quip
and never shy about speaking his mind. The following is a
collection of quotes culled from his magazine and newspaper
interviews over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On why his food will endure, 1986.  &LR; ``If I were just glamorous
and not rooted in anything substantial, I wouldn't last. Nineteenth
century food was very grand yet very simple, but resonating in a
basic way. There is something in my food that is very basic to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ Comments to a cooking class, 1986.  &LR; ``What people want today is
fast food, but not typical American fast food. America is the only
country in the world with awful processed food like bologna.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On the state of his business, 1986.  &LR; ``I lose $200,000 a year
because I don't open another restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ Predicting the future of American cooking, 1986.  &LR; ``American
cooking is going to change in the next five years. There's a lot of
emphasis on regionalism now. But there's going to be even greater
eclecticism and the use of esoteric ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _ On how he'd like to be remembered, from his 1986 book &LR; 
 &UR; ``Jeremiah Tower's New American Classics.''  &LR; ``I think that the
columnist Liz Smith's farewell to Rock Hudson _ `So long, big boy,
have a good rest' _ is what I would like on my tombstone, but it
will probably be, `He invented black bean cake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On the state of trendy food, 1988.  &LR; ``If an ingredient has become
too outlandish - such as kiwi - I try not to use it. Jim Beard was
the president for the Society to Stamp out Kiwis and I was the
vice-president. I may use radicchio and balsamic vinegar, but I
would never say so on the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _ On who starts what, 1988.  &LR; ``Nouvelle cuisine, apart from what it
really is, is also pretty much a fabrication of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On being a celebrity chef in 1989, just after his $100 million &LR; 
 &UR; Dewar's ad campaign began.  &LR; ``Jeremiah Tower of Stars is a product.
Restaurants have become theater, and I'm like an actor with 14
performances a week.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On the pressures of running Stars, 1989.  &LR; ``People come in here
expecting the orgasmic experience of their life. A restaurant is
not sex or art. It's just food.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On his bitter break-up with Doyle and Cathy Moon, founding &LR; 
 &UR; partners of Stars, 1989.  &LR; ``When the flashbulbs started popping, it
all fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On what he wanted in food, 1991.  &LR; ``I want to be more sensible
after the exotic eccentricities of the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On the state of kitchen staffs, 1991.  &LR; ``Twenty years ago, I had
enthusiastic novices on staff. Now that cooking schools are
popular, people know a lot, but their attitude is terrible. It's
the TV generation. Their parents didn't teach them anything. I have
to take time not only to teach them about food but good manners and
cleanliness, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ On the seating advantage of the now-defunct Stars Palo Alto, &LR;

 CRUSH 99: Lower Quantity Yields Concentrated Fruit   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  After a cooler than normal summer and a late start
to the harvest, vintage 1999 is finally picking up around the west.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daryl Groom, executive vice president and winemaker for Geyser
Peak Winery, says that 1999 reds from Geyser Peak's Sonoma County
vineyards will be the best he's seen since coming to the winery in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey County, Mirassou vineyards manager Mark Mirassou
says the 1999 wine grape harvest is producing ``lower yields but
intensely focused fruit.'' Mirassou says the winery's vineyards in
northern Monterey County are producing a lighter than usual crop,
allowing the vines to concentrate the remaining fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Chalone Wine Estates, with vineyards and wineries in California
and Washington, is predicting a  &LR; average to slightly less than
average yields and outstanding quality. Chalone Vineyard winemaker
Dan Karlsen reports riper fruit than normal at the Pinnacles
(Monterey County) estate, while Edna Valley Vineyard in San Luis
Obispo County is hoping for more warmer &LR;  weather to further ripen
the grapes.
</P>
<P>
   At Chalone's Canoe Ridge Vineyard in Washington, an average
yield is expected for Chardonnay, while most other varieties,
especially Merlot, is forecasted to produce a light crop. Similar
low-yield projections, especially for Cabernet Sauvignon and
Merlot, are expected from Staton Hills, Chalone's other Washington
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an uneven growing season, King Estate viticulture
director Brad Biehl believes grapes in Oregon vineyards will be
complex in flavor and aroma. He says that this kind of growing
pattern historically yields fruit with good flavors and color.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Livermore Valley, as wineries gear up to celebrate
the region's 150th grape harvest, growers and winemakers are
worried that the month-late start might push the harvest into fall
and the beginning of the rainy season.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Sparklers Magnate Converts to Still   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Cordoniu, the Spanish sparkling wine giant, has
reinvented itself in California.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1991, Codorniu opened the doors to its California sparkling
wine facility, Codorniu Napa, in the rolling hills of the Carneros
region of Napa County. Earlier this month, Codorniu Napa morphed
into Artesa and in the process all but phased out the Codorniu Napa
sparkling wines. In their place the winery is producing six
remarkably good still wines under the Artesa label. Codorniu Napa
sparklers will remain in the market until 2002, when they will be
replaced by an ultra-premium sparkling wine called Joia.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming the winery and vineyards to Artesa, which means
``hand-crafted'' in Catalan, has taken three years and cost more
than $10 million. Artesa will be ``devoted to artisan winemaking,
hands-on crafting of small lots of wine from numerous
appellations,'' says winery president Michael Kenton.
</P>
<P>
   The first Artesa wines _ Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay
from Napa Valley and from Carneros and Pinot Noirs from Carneros,
Santa Barbara County and the Russian River Valley _ are all from
the 1997 vintage. Artesa's first release is 8,000 cases total, but
annual production is expected to reach 175,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the quality of these initial wines, what is encouraging
is that Artesa did not fall into the trap of releasing debut wines
at $50 and above. The six new wines are priced at about $20 each,
although they will be available in many Bay Area wine stores and
restaurants, although not in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Artesa winemaker Don Van Staaveren, who made his name at Chateau
St. Jean, has redesigned the winery for small-lot production of
still wines and converted the vineyards over to grow Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir for still wines. His new wines are all about texture
while reflecting the specific characteristics of each appellation.
</P>
<P>
   Artesa 1997 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc is layered with smoky
oak, vanilla, spice and subtle grassy accents. The 1997 Carneros
Chardonnay is a full-blown barrel-fermented malolactic Chardonnay,
while the 1997 Napa Valley Chardonnay, with no malolactic, is more
citrus and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Artesa's three juicy Pinot Noirs are from the three best Pinot
Noir regions in California. The 1997 Carneros Pinot Noir is spicy
with ripe black cherry and cranberry flavors, while the 1997
Russian River Valley Pinot Noir is more leathery with deep
cherry-berry flavors and boiled tea accents. Artesa 1997 Santa
Barbara County Pinot Noir is smoky, brooding and deeply flavored,
with good texture and length. For $60 or less for all three, wine
buyers can taste what California Pinot Noir is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Artesa has made an impressive debut in a highly competitive wine
market. If the company doesn't lose its way with too many wines at
higher prices, Artesa will be a brand to watch in the future.

 AT THE SOURCE: Almond Time: Banner year for organic grower   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 ESCALON, Calif. _  At John Lagier's fruit and nut ranch in Escalon,
the almond harvest is under way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lagier's 36 acres of almond trees near this San Joaquin County
town are like a grain of sand on the beach when compared to the
480,000 acres planted throughout the state. But Lagier is an
industry leader, one of a growing number of almond farmers who are
trying to dramatically reduce the use of pesticides or, as in
Lagier's case, to farm organically.
</P>
<P>
   Almonds are a billion-dollar crop in California, comparable to
lettuce in value. The nuts are also one of the top consumers of
pesticides. To prevent fungal diseases in the spring and worm
damage later, many growers use preventive sprays, Lagier says.
</P>
<P>
   He takes another approach. After harvest, he applies compost to
the orchard. Then he plants a cover crop to provide a habitat for
beneficial insects. The cover crop, which he mows down gradually
over the growing season, also replenishes the soil by fixing
atmospheric nitrogen in its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fungicides, Lagier sprays the leaves with compost
tea, made by filtering water through compost. The idea is to
blanket the trees with good microorganisms that can out-compete the
bad ones. ``It's not scientific,'' the farmer acknowledges, but it
appears to work.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't more almond growers farm organically? Because it's
a lot easier not to, Lagier says, and because their yields would
drop. He and other almond growers practicing sustainable
agriculture have to make up for their lower yield with higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lagier Ranch orchard includes the main commercial almond
variety, the Nonpareil, as well as two other varieties needed for
cross-pollination. The trees bloom in late February in a fragrant
carpet of white, then mature their fruit over the next seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   By late September or early October, the almond hulls have
started to split and the nuts drop easily with a shake of the
branch. That means it's harvest time. A machine shakes the mature
almonds onto the orchard floor, a mechanical sweeper gathers them
into a row, and a mechanical harvester picks them up. Then they are
carted off to a processor to be hulled and shelled.
</P>
<P>
   The best almonds are large and plump, with no shriveling, the
grower says. Their skin is unscratched and neither bleached-looking
nor darkened. And of course they taste good, with no off flavors
that might be the result of poor storage. Almonds hold well in cold
storage, but because of their high oil content they can oxidize or
absorb flavors from other foods if improperly stored. At home,
Lagier keeps his nuts in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's California almond harvest is projected to set a
record at 830 million pounds. Increased acreage, improved growing
practices and good weather have all contributed to the banner year.
Lagier expects a large crop, too, and says he may drop his $6 a
pound price at San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market when he
begins selling his new almonds in November.

 BEST WAY: Scrambled Eggs  By Nicholas Bundy 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; How do you like your scrambled eggs _ fluffy,
creamy or runny?
<P>
   What about dry and firm, with a touch of water? Or how about
with milk, half-and-half _ or nothing?
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle food department tested _ and tasted _ more than a
dozen batches of scrambled eggs for best texture and seasoning.
Each batch contained two extra-large eggs beaten with a wire whisk
with a dash of salt and pepper, and one tablespoon of either
half-and-half, 2 percent low-fat milk or water. Each batch was
cooked over medium to high heat for one to 11/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT TO ADD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Department tasters preferred the eggs mixed with one tablespoon
half-and-half, describing the texture as moist and creamy while
delivering a slightly sweet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs with 2 percent milk disappointed, yielding a watery
taste with little or no texture. Eggs with water added tasted fine,
but were stiff and rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; HOW MUCH TO ADD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After determining that we preferred eggs mixed with
half-and-half for texture, we varied the amount, making four
batches of eggs, using one, two, three or four tablespoons of
half-and-half.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was a tie. Department tasters divided evenly between
those who preferred eggs made with two tablespoons half-and-half
and with three blespoons half-and-half.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs with four tablespoons half-and-half developed
absolutely no consistency, took much too long to coagulate, and
left a crusty mess in our nonstick pan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We found that two extra-large eggs scrambled with two
tablespoons half-and-half made for a light, creamy texture and
pleasant balance of flavor. Three tablespoons half-and-half made
for a richer consistency and more texture. But we also agreed that
when it comes to the best texture for scrambled eggs, much depends
on personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   As for when is the best time to add salt and pepper, the eggs
that were seasoned both before  &LR; and &LR;  after cooking had the most
complete and rounded flavor.

a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _

 THE WORKING COOK: A Little Creativity Produces 3 Ethnic-Inspired 
 Dishes   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It can be very satisfying to set aside a day or
two to prepare a complicated, traditional recipe. Through the hours
spent following elaborate procedures, you get a sense of the skill
that has gone into making the recipe for generations _ and the
result is usually well-worth your toil.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But cooking can't always be an all-day, back-breaking affair. If
you're on a tight schedule, you often need to find creative ways to
build complex flavors.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Now &AMP; Later recipe, Polenta Pie with Pork in Salsa
Verde, derives from a Oaxacan specialty, green mole with stewed
pork. The traditional recipe calls for roasting and grinding
spices, mincing fresh herbs like cilantro and epazote, and roasting
and peeling chiles, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as intricate as the classic Mexican dish, this
version of pork in green chile sauce simply mirrors some of the
same flavors with fresh salsa verde, a tomatillo and green chile
sauce. Though very acidic when fresh, the salsa mellows into a
flavorful sauce when stewed slowly with aromatic vegetables, pork
and stock.
</P>
<P>
   This stew is layered on top of a base of roasted polenta. The
final product, which is topped with sour cream and queso fresco, is
something like a chile verde casserole _ a delicious culinary
hybrid that works great in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some techniques, such as Chinese stir-fry, are
traditionally fast and simple. The Fast&AMP;Fresh recipe this week,
Beef and Spinach Stir-Fry with Oyster Sauce, will be done in the
time it takes to steam rice. Simple dishes flavored with oyster
sauce are common in Cantonese cooking, which relies not so much on
spice but on the quality of fresh ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The trick in stir-frying is not to overcook the meat. In this
recipe, the spinach is cooked separately so the liquid it releases
does not make the meat chewy. In the end, the two are brought
together with sizzling garlic and oyster sauce, a thick, savory
sauce flavored with oyster extracts.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Dish, Linguine with Vermouth and
Orange-Scented Shrimp, pairs intriguing sweet and savory flavors.
Fresh basil and orange zest brighten the sweet rock shrimp, and the
rich creamy pasta sauce gets a kick from vermouth and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   BEEF &AMP; SPINACH STIR-FRY WITH OYSTER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound flank steak
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 (10-ounce) bag cleaned baby spinach
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons oyster sauce (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Sesame seeds (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the flank steak flat on a work surface and cut it along
the grain into 2 or 3 long, 3-inch wide sections. Take one section
and cut it with a very sharp knife, this time against the grain, as
thinly as you can. The slices should be less than 1/8-inch thick.
Repeat with the remaining sections of steak. Season the meat slices
with a generous amount of pepper; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok or large skillet over high heat. When hot, add 1
teaspoon of the oil and heat until sizzling. Add half of the garlic
and cook it until slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a few
handfuls of spinach to the pan and stir over the heat. As the
spinach wilts, keep adding more, stirring constantly until it has
all wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Drain off the liquid from the spinach and remove the spinach
from the pan. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible with your
hands, then place the spinach on a pile of paper towels to absorb
more liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining teaspoon of oil to the pan; when hot add the
remaining garlic and cook, stirring until slightly browned. Add the
reserved meat and saute quickly, stirring often, until the meat is
just browned, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the spinach to the pan. Stir in the oyster sauce, season
with pepper and heat through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Oyster sauce is available in most supermarkets. Lee Kum
Kee's Premium Oyster Sauce _ look for the label picturing a boy and

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Pork &AMP; Salsa Verde
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds boneless pork butt or shoulder, cut into 3/4-inch
cubes, fat trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   About 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large red onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   3 serrano chiles, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves, crumbled (Mexican oregano
preferred)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 pints fresh salsa verde (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated queso fresco (see note)
</P>
<P>
   The Polenta
</P>
<P>
   4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups polenta
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated queso fresco
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pork in Salsa Verde:  &LR; Season the pork with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a large, heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium-high heat.
When quite hot, add enough of the oil to completely cover the
bottom of the pot. Heat until almost smoking. Taking care not to
get splattered, add the pork in batches. Do not crowd the pan or
the meat will stew instead of fry. Brown the pork for a few minutes
on one side, then stir and brown again. Do not stir frequently or
the meat will not reach a golden-brown color. When the meat has
browned on both sides, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon;
set aside. Repeat with the remaining pork, adding more oil if
necessary, until all of the meat has been browned; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion to the pan and saute in any remaining oil for a
few minutes until tender. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a
wooden spoon to dislodge any browned bits of pork. Add the garlic,
chiles and oregano and saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pork to the pan. Add the chicken broth and the salsa.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered until the
meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During cooking, keep an eye on the level of liquid. If the meat
is not submerged, add water.
</P>
<P>
   When the pork is tender, season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Polenta:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the
water, cream and salt in a small saucepan and heat until almost
boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the polenta, oregano and cheese in a large mixing bowl;
stir until combined. Stir in the hot liquid, making sure to
incorporate all of the ingredients and smooth out any lumps. Pour
evenly into two 13 x 9-inch baking pans.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 10 minutes. Stir, then bake 25 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Ladle the stewed pork
over the polenta. Dot with the sour cream, top with shredded queso
fresco and bake for 20 minutes, until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes:  &LR; Fresh salsa verde is becoming widely available at
supermarkets and specialty stores, along with fresh tomato salsa.
If unavailable, look for jarred tomatillo or green chile salsa,
available at Trader Joe's and in the Hispanic sections of some
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Queso fresco, a salty white cheese, also is available in many
supermarkets. It usually comes in 12-ounce rounds, just the right
amount for this recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Albona Beefs Up Chifeleti   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Bruno Viscovi's grandmother prepared chifeleti,
which he characterizes as a type of gnocchi, when he was growing up
in Albona on the Istrian Peninsula in Italy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Viscovi opened Albona Ristorante Istriano near North Beach,
he put this childhood favorite on the menu, accompanied by beef
sirloin sauce flavored with cumin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful dish, with the golden brown gnocchi playing off
the rich, meaty sauce. However, Viscovi notes that it's an arduous
task preparing the sauce in small amount needed for the gnocchi so
he increased the amount in order to have enough leftover for other
uses. It's ideal as a topping for pasta with fresh gratings of
Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Albona is the only restaurant on the West Coast specializing in
the cuisine from this little-known Italian region, with influences
from Austria, Hungary, Croatia and Turkey. The combinations are
hearty, often featuring the unexpected sweet spices such as nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   Viscovi's unique food is served in a warm environment with
accents of mahogany and beveled glass. And one of the biggest
treats of all is that Viscovi is usually in the dining room, always
willing to weave a romantic tale of his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Albona Ristorante Istriano, 545 Francisco St. (near Taylor), &LR; 
 &LR; San Francisco; (415) 441-1040. Open for dinner &LR; 
 &LR; Tuesday-Saturday. &LR;

SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _  &UR; Frying the gnocchi &LR; . Bruno Viscovi says he's never seen this
technique used anywhere else; it was something his grandmother did.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The sauce. &LR;  Adding porcini powder, red wine, a little tomato
sauce and crushed red pepper flakes gives a complex depth of
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ALBONA'S PAN-FRIED GNOCCHI WITH SIRLOIN SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   The Gnocchi
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 quart vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds beef sirloin, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   Bouquet garni: 2 springs each, fresh oregano, thyme, rosemary,
marjoram, bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon porcini mushroom powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 quart beef stock
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the gnocchi:  &LR; Place the unpeeled potatoes in a large
pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
and simmer 45 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain
and peel in a towel while still hot. Pass through a potato ricer
and spread onto a lightly floured surface. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Sift 13/4 cups of the flour over the potatoes and sprinkle with
the salt and nutmeg. Incorporate the ingredients into a mound, then
form a well in the center; add the butter and the egg. Briefly
knead the dough until it comes together, using the extra flour as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the dough to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Using a 11/2-inch
round cookie cutter, cut out the dumplings and set them on a clean
towel dusted with flour. Cover the dumplings with another towel and
allow them to rest while preparing the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Heat 1/2 cup of the peanut oil in a large,
heavy-bottomed skillet. Working in batches, add the meat and brown
on all sides. As the meat browns, remove it from the pan to a
strainer set over a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When all the meat has browned, add the remaining 1/4 cup peanut
oil to the pan and saute the onion in it until translucent, 3 to 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the carrot and celery and saute over medium heat for 10
minutes, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Return the meat to the skillet and reheat. Increase the heat to
high and add the pepper flakes, parsley, garlic, herb bouquet,
mushroom powder and salt; cook for 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually deglaze the pan with the wine, cooking until liquid
has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to medium and add the tomato sauce and cumin. Add
stock to barely cover the ingredients. Reduce heat, cover and
simmer until the meat is tender, gradually adding more stock as
needed. Remove from the heat. Skim off the fat and mix it with the
flour to make a paste. Stir the paste into the sauce and cook until
thickened. Cover and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To fry the gnocchi:  &LR; Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy,
high-sided pan over medium-high heat. Add the gnocchi, a few at a
time, and fry until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and
drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Keep warm in a low oven until
ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Spoon sauce onto warmed serving plates; spread out
into a circle. Top with the gnocchi.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve the remaining sauce for another use (such as a sauce for
pasta).
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PER SERVING (using half of the sauce): &LR;   &LR; 450 calories, &LR;   &LR; 25 g &LR;

   GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, looking for a way to
rejuvenate his Democratic presidential campaign, has decided to
move his political operation to his home state of Tennessee and
challenge his sole rival (Bradley) to a series of debates. Campaign
chairman Tony Coelho and chief strategeist Carter Eskew will move

East down to one town, it might look like this little-known border
village. Here, they speak Arabic, practice the mysterious Alawite
religion, adore Syrian president Hafez Assad and hold Israeli
citizenship. No wonder no one can figure out whether the town
should stay with Israel or be turned over to Syria or Lebanon. And,
no wonder 25-year-old resident Yossef Salman is having trouble
getting permission to bring his Syrian wife from Damascus. (Kaplow,

   MEXICO-ALLIANCE _ MEXICO CITY _ One political player here calls
it ``the blunder of the century for Mexico's opposition.'' Late
Tuesday night talks definitely crumbled to forge a sweeping
coalition that could have probably defeated Mexico's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, in next year's presidential election.
Most polls show that an alliance among virtually all of Mexico's
opposition parties _ from right to left _ would have driven the PRI
from the presidency after more than 70 in power. Polls also showed
that Mexicans wanted to see the formation of a coalition. But
opposition leaders failed to show leadership, analysts say. Now the
PRI's chances of winning in 2000 once again are better than they've
looked for a long time. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). 30. WITH

   HISPANICS-COLLEGE _ WASHINGTON - New policies intended to

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   APARTMENT-MAKEOVER (New York) _ Historically, New York is a town
of temporary residences people inhabit with the false permanence
that prevails in prisons. Or in college. With living-room laissez
faire, perfectly capable adults cultivate a casual grad-school look
long after the paperback Voltaire has been shelved behind the
hardcover ``Fight Aging with Antioxidants.'' The House &AMP; Home
section asked four top interior designers to take their skills and
tackle three real-life scenarios that the celebrity clients and
decorator show houses never expose you to. By William A. Hamilton
and Stephen Williams.

   BUILDING-TO-SCALE (Helvetta, Ore.) _ The Roloff farm is a
34-acre fantasy built by Matt Roloff, a 38-year-old man who stands
4 feet 2 inches tall. Over the last decade, Roloff has been
building a little person's paradise, a place where nobody is ever
turned away because they do not meet minimum height standards. By

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie

</P>
<P>
   THEATER-CELL-PHONES (New York) _ It was an interruption whose
time is coming far too frequently. During a recent performance of
``Death of a Salesman,'' its star, Brian Dennehy, was startled to
hear a cell phone ring near the end of the second act. Even more
disturbing was to hear the phone's being answered, and a woman in
the audience clearly saying, ``It's almost finished,'' and going on
to make dinner plans. Kevin Cahoon took a aggressive approach to a
recent cell-phone intrusion. When a phone rang during his
performance earlier this month as the transsexual rock singer in
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' at the Jane Street Theater, his
concentration broke, but his aplomb didn't. Cahoon marched off the
stage, pink fringe fluttering on his denim dress, took the phone
out of an audience member's hand and answered it. By Elaine Louie.

 &HT;    BEHIND THE MINE FIELD: LITTLE-KNOWN ARAB TOWN STUCK IN LIMBO
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: For locator map purposes, Ghajar is a small town on the
Lebanon-Israel border where the border is intersected by the small
Dan River. From Metulla, on the Lebanon-Israel border, follow the
border east. It dips sharply to the southeast, then turns sharply
again due north. Then, it begins to bend from due north to
northeast. Ghajar is located at that bend.

<P>
   GHAJAR, Israel _ High atop a mountain in the Golan Heights, the
750-year-old Nimrod castle reminds us that history here is a parade
of conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Nimrod's stone walls and towers were built to defend Islam
against the Crusaders. But there were others, too _ Romans,
Mamlukes, Ottomans, British and, now, Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The fort is in ruins today. In an isolated village nearby, the
most recent conquest has left a bride and groom on opposite sides
of a border.
</P>
<P>
   Yossef Salman is caught in the limbo of his small village,
Ghajar (pronounced, ``RA-jar''), on the border of Israel, Lebanon
and Syria. In five decades, it has been passed among them, ending
up under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The people here are Arabs and speak Arabic. They practice the
mysterious Alawi religion and adore Syrian president Hafez Assad,
but they hold citizenship in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Salman lives across the street from a valley where Israel meets
Lebanon. But, Salman looks longingly toward Syria, home to his new
bride.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Amman, Jordan and married there in February. For
Salman, a college graduate disenchanted with the uneducated women
in his small hometown, 21-year-old Muna was a good match. She is
studying to be a flight attendant and shares his rare Alawi
religion.
</P>
<P>
   A peace deal between Israel and Syria could reunite them, but
that seems long in coming. Meanwhile, Salman has failed to win
Israeli approval to bring her to Ghajar and her in-laws don't want
her to go anyway. She still lives in Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will end this situation by divorce,'' Salman said.
``Her parents are not feeling well. They think there will be no
peace in the Middle East and (if she comes) they will not see their
daughter again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghajar itself, a village of small stone houses and boxy
apartment blocks, has the Twilight-Zone feel of a place trapped
between fluid borders and unstable times.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it is the only Alawi village in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawi are an offshoot of Islam. They believe in
reincarnation and deify Ali, a son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed.
Syria's Assad is an Alawi, but Alawi are a minority throughout the
Arab world and, perhaps because of that, they refuse to talk about
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Ghajar's location is such that you cannot go there
without feeling you've gone a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   A tall security fence runs between the rest of Israel and
Ghajar, giving it a no-mans-land eeriness. Until a few years ago,
people needed approval from Israeli soldiers to pass.
</P>
<P>
   A well-paved street, running past a mine field and lined with
purple lamp posts, leads into this farming town of about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people I met there refused to talk. That's unusual
in Israel, but typical of the Alawi and indicative of a town
uncertain of its place.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salman, Ghajar was part of Syria until 1967.
Residents still feel Syrian. Salman's father, Abdul Rahim Salman,
71, told me Assad is his hero.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Israel took over the Golan Heights to the east,
separating Ghajar from Syria. Months passed with Ghajar belonging
to no country and getting no services.
</P>
<P>
   Salman says the people of Ghajar made the controversial decision
to take Israeli citizenship in return for water, electricity and
free passage to their farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis tell me a different story. They say Lebanon had
held Ghajar until the mid-1960s. Then, to avoid involvement in a
water dispute with Israel, it gave the town to Syria, which lost it
in 1967. If there is a peace deal, they say, the town could go to
either Lebanon or Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs in the Golan nearby had yet another take on Ghajar.
</P>
<P>
   Golan Arabs refuse Israeli citizenship and openly await a peace
deal that will bring back Syrian control. They say Israeli leaders
played Ghajar's two major clans against each other, tricking them
into taking citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, everyone has a history to fit their needs. Israelis
see Ghajar as a lost village needing a custodian. Golan Arabs see
it as a village duped by sinister Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of Ghajar, behind the fence and the mine field,
consider themselves Syrian but have citizenship Israel. Cautiously,
they hedge their bets for whatever turn of fate comes next.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it won't come in time to save Yossef Salman's marriage.
</P>

 &HT;    BEHIND THE MINE FIELD: LITTLE-KNOWN ARAB TOWN STUCK IN LIMBO
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: For locator map purposes, Ghajar is a small town on the
Lebanon-Israel border where the border is intersected by the small
Dan River. From Metulla, on the Lebanon-Israel border, follow the
border east. It dips sharply to the southeast, then turns sharply
again due north. Then, it begins to bend from due north to
northeast. Ghajar is located at that bend.

   GHAJAR, Israel _ High atop a mountain in the Golan Heights, the
750-year-old Nimrod castle reminds us that history here is a parade
of conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Nimrod's stone walls and towers were built to defend Islam
against the Crusaders. But there were others, too _ Romans,
Mamlukes, Ottomans, British and, now, Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The fort is in ruins today. In an isolated village nearby, the
most recent conquest has left a bride and groom on opposite sides
of a border.
</P>
<P>
   Yossef Salman is caught in the limbo of his small village,
Ghajar (pronounced, ``RA-jar''), on the border of Israel, Lebanon
and Syria. In five decades, it has been passed among them, ending
up under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The people here are Arabs and speak Arabic. They practice the
mysterious Alawi religion and adore Syrian president Hafez Assad,
but they hold citizenship in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Salman lives across the street from a valley where Israel meets
Lebanon. But, Salman looks longingly toward Syria, home to his new
bride.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Amman, Jordan and married there in February. For
Salman, a college graduate disenchanted with the uneducated women
in his small hometown, 21-year-old Muna was a good match. She is
studying to be a flight attendant and shares his rare Alawi
religion.
</P>
<P>
   A peace deal between Israel and Syria could reunite them, but
that seems long in coming. Meanwhile, Salman has failed to win
Israeli approval to bring her to Ghajar and her in-laws don't want
her to go anyway. She still lives in Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will end this situation by divorce,'' Salman said.
``Her parents are not feeling well. They think there will be no
peace in the Middle East and (if she comes) they will not see their
daughter again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghajar itself, a village of small stone houses and boxy
apartment blocks, has the Twilight-Zone feel of a place trapped
between fluid borders and unstable times.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it is the only Alawi village in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawi are an offshoot of Islam. They believe in
reincarnation and deify Ali, a son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed.
Syria's Assad is an Alawi, but Alawi are a minority throughout the
Arab world and, perhaps because of that, they refuse to talk about
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Ghajar's location is such that you cannot go there
without feeling you've gone a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   A tall security fence runs between the rest of Israel and
Ghajar, giving it a no-mans-land eeriness. Until a few years ago,
people needed approval from Israeli soldiers to pass.
</P>
<P>
   A well-paved street, running past a mine field and lined with
purple lamp posts, leads into this farming town of about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people I met there refused to talk. That's unusual
in Israel, but typical of the Alawi and indicative of a town
uncertain of its place.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salman, Ghajar was part of Syria until 1967.
Residents still feel Syrian. Salman's father, Abdul Rahim Salman,
71, told me Assad is his hero.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Israel took over the Golan Heights to the east,
separating Ghajar from Syria. Months passed with Ghajar belonging
to no country and getting no services.
</P>
<P>
   Salman says the people of Ghajar made the controversial decision
to take Israeli citizenship in return for water, electricity and
free passage to their farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis tell me a different story. They say Lebanon had
held Ghajar until the mid-1960s. Then, to avoid involvement in a
water dispute with Israel, it gave the town to Syria, which lost it
in 1967. If there is a peace deal, they say, the town could go to
either Lebanon or Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs in the Golan nearby had yet another take on Ghajar.
</P>
<P>
   Golan Arabs refuse Israeli citizenship and openly await a peace
deal that will bring back Syrian control. They say Israeli leaders
played Ghajar's two major clans against each other, tricking them
into taking citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, everyone has a history to fit their needs. Israelis
see Ghajar as a lost village needing a custodian. Golan Arabs see
it as a village duped by sinister Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of Ghajar, behind the fence and the mine field,
consider themselves Syrian but have citizenship Israel. Cautiously,
they hedge their bets for whatever turn of fate comes next.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it won't come in time to save Yossef Salman's marriage.
</P>

PEDESTRIANS FIND LIFE IN THE SLOW LANE FULL OF PERILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH YANG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since the 1950s, pedestrians have faced a steady
risk of being killed by motorists, and for the thousands of walkers
in this city of narrow streets and steep hills, it's a danger that
won't disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for pedestrians say the city's response to the deaths
so far has focused primarily on enforcement of traffic laws, while
experience elsewhere indicates measures that slow traffic _ longer
walk signals, more medians, fewer one-way streets _ work better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, enforcement only goes so far,''
said Zac Wald, director of the activist group BayPeds. ``Traffic
calming is the answer, but it hasn't been broached enough.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of pedestrian deaths fell from 41 in the
1997-1998 fiscal year to 29 in the city's 1998-1999 budget period,
deaths are still occurring. Six pedestrians were killed in August
alone and another one died last week.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are not always at fault, the police and safety officials
say. Still, a number of steps have been taken to improve safety for
pedestrians. The city has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Erected pedestrian safety signs near senior centers, and the
police are patrolling troubled intersections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Added two to six seconds to the signal time at more than 20
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sent police officers into the public schools to discuss
pedestrian safety.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to pedestrian advocates, the city budgeted
$750,000 this fiscal year to hire a traffic engineer, a pedestrian
safety coordinator and a school safety coordinator to study and
then work to improve traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the big policy changes and traffic engineering projects are
still wending their way through the government.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic officials have authorized a ``traffic calming'' study in
one neighborhood where neighbors have been complaining about
speeders for years. But no one has been assigned to direct the
project.
</P>
<P>
   A broader plan to reset the pedestrian walking time at busy
intersections has been slowed by old, sometimes rusty signals.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian advocates such as Betsy Thagard, executive director
of Walk San Francisco, point to cities such as Portland and Seattle
as places where good traffic engineering increased safety.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, for example, has installed traffic circles. A study of
119 intersections where circles were built this decade found that
the accident and injury rates dropped 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of deaths in Seattle has decreased from 14
in 1990 to 11 in 1996, the latest figures available, and injuries
declined from 506 to 489 during that same time period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 25 years to get where we are,'' said Noel Schoneman,
division director for neighborhood traffic engineering in Seattle.
He noted the traffic program began in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that the decline in pedestrian injuries and
fatalities cannot be credited solely to the traffic circles, which
typically slow traffic. ``We're doing a much better job of keeping
drunk drivers off the road, triage is better and demographics
change,'' he said. ``Engineering plays a major role, but since I
can't draw a direct correlation, all I know is that we need to do
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in San Francisco note that for every pedestrian who
wants traffic to slow down, there is a driver who will protest any
measure that could be seen as increasing gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   When Supervisor Mabel Teng proposed lengthening the walking time
for pedestrians along Mission and Market streets, two major
thoroughfares, angry drivers called to complain that it already
took them too long to drive across town.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some slowing down means saving one life, I'm willing to
take the criticism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one point both pedestrian advocates and officials in San
Francisco agree: Solutions in this city won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 48 pedestrians died each year in the 1960s,
decades before the deaths of 41 pedestrians during the 1997-98
fiscal year sparked a civic push for increased safety.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a chronic and costly shortage of parking spaces,
thousands of residents walk or take public transit to work, often
up and down steep hills that block visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern in San Francisco goes beyond sheer numbers of
deaths; it is also about who is dying.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 percent of the city's 755,000 residents are over age
65, a larger elderly population than in most other big cities, said
Abbie Yant, who heads Emergency Medical Services at the Department
of Public Health. And the elderly are far more likely to die after
being hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year 1998-99, 48 percent of pedestrians killed by
vehicles were 65 or older, up from 40 percent in fiscal 1997-98.
Moreover, pedestrians were mostly at fault in 58 percent of all
fatal accidents this past fiscal year, while drivers were blamed 42
percent of the time, according to police reports. The exact
opposite was true the year before, when drivers were reported at
fault 58 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors are at risk for reasons of natural aging,'' Yant said.
``Their gait is slower and they're not hearing as clearly. ...
(Plus) a lot of seniors grew up with a value system where, here's a
pedestrian, the guy on the (traffic) signal says walk, so you do.
That's not smart in today's environment.''

HERE'S THE `SKINNY' ON A PLEASINGLY PLUMP SANDWICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of Midwestern transplants sent an e-mail a couple of
months ago looking for a recipe for pork tenderloin sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   I've got to admit to a liking for these sandwiches myself,
although it wasn't until I received the message that I remembered
them. I put away my share of them at the Old Heidelberg restaurant
across from the journalism department at the University of
Missouri-Columbia during the 19-- _ well, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   (For those who find themselves driving through Missouri, the Old
Heidelberg is still open and still serving pork tenderloin
sandwiches.)
</P>
<P>
   However, I didn't have a recipe for these huge honking
sandwiches until ``American Home Cooking'' by Cheryl Alters Jamison
and Bill Jamison (Broadway Books, $30 until Jan. 31) landed, all
470 pages of it, on my desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons write that the sandwich is often called a
``skinny'' in the ``I'' states of Iowa, Illinois or Indiana. A lot
of these sandwiches would add up to more than skinny, but that's
for another day.
</P>
<P>
   PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICHES
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   _ Four 6- to 7-ounce boneless center-cut pork loin chops
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup stone-ground cornmeal, preferably yellow
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/4 cup all-purpose unbleached flour
</P>
<P>
   _ 11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   _ Vegetable oil or shortening for pan-frying
</P>
<P>
   _ Soft hamburger buns
</P>
<P>
   _ Lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   _ Ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise or a combination
</P>
<P>
   _ Dill pickle slices
</P>
<P>
   Place pork chop between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound with a
mallet to 1/4-inch thickness or less. The chop should be large,
round and lacy-edged. You should be able to see through the pork in
places. Repeat with remaining chops.
</P>
<P>
   On a plate, stir together the cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 inch of oil into heavy skillet and heat it to 365
degrees. Dredge first pork chop heavily in cornmeal-flour mixture
and fry it until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. The
chop will shrink by a couple of inches while frying, but will
remain large. Drain and repeat with the other pork chops, checking
temperature of oil each time.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot on buns (the pork will dwarf the bun, but that's the
way it's done) with lettuce, spreading the bread thickly with
ketchup or other condiments and serving pickles on the side.

   Brazilian recipes to enjoy
</P>
<P>
   By Wendell Brock
</P>
<P>
   As Americans become better versed in Brazilian food, we wanted
to share some dishes outside the realm of feijoada and moqueca.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarians will find that Tutu a Mineira _ served with the
traditional kale, boiled white rice and farofa _ is a complete
meal. If you don't feel like bothering with the polenta, the
chicken with okra works just as well with rice. Add the hearts of
palm salad, and you've a meal fit for company. And if you want to
make your Brazilian friends happy, make quindins. Chances are,
they've never eaten them in an American cook's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   To make farofa, which is almost always placed on the Brazilian
table as a condiment, toast 1 cup coarse manioc flour with 2
tablespoons dende oil or butter.
</P>
<P>
   Where to find Brazilian ingredients: If you can't find what you
need at your local Latin market, two travel agents catering to the
Latin American community also stock basic Brazilian products: Trans
America, 5299 Roswell Road, Suite 112, 404-252-7270; and
Expeditions Travel, 5801 Roswell Road, Suite C, 404-303-8787.
</P>
<P>
   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Salada de Palmito
</P>
<P>
   (Hearts of Palm Salad)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Keep the vinaigrette simple so the clean yet buttery flavor of
the hearts of palm shines through. One option: Mix together olive
oil, red wine vinegar, just a hint of Dijon mustard and plenty of
kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Served all over Brazil, this
recipe is very similar to the one at Paul Luna's new South American
restaurant, Loca Luna.
</P>
<P>
   1 (16-ounce) can hearts of palm, drained and cut in 1-inch
pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 head romaine lettuce, or other greens, washed and torn in
bite-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Liquid from bottled malagueta peppers to taste, optional
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vinaigrette
</P>
<P>
   Place the hearts of palm and greens in a large salad bowl. Add
onion.
</P>
<P>
   If using pepper liquid, add to vinaigrette. Pour vinaigrette
over salad and chill until serving time.
</P>
<P>
   Toss and serve.

   As a certified pod person, I was thrilled to see this okra stew
on nearly every menu in the town of Ouro Preto, in Minas Gerais.
It's good all by itself, but add the rich polenta that follows, and
it's extraordinary. If you are a skin lover, those chicken
cracklings will really rock your world.
</P>
<P>
   6 pounds chicken thighs and legs
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups homemade or canned low-sodium chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds okra, trimmed and cut in 1/2-inch rounds (about 4
cups)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon preserved malagueta pepper oil or hot pepper sauce
</P>
<P>
   Wash and dry chicken pieces. Pull the skin away from the flesh,
but do not detach it. In a large bowl, toss the chicken with the
garlic, salt and pepper and refrigerate for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Add onions and
saute until they are light gold, about 10 minutes. Set aside
onions.
</P>
<P>
   In the same skillet, heat vegetable and olive oils over medium
heat. When hot, add chicken pieces and saute them until the skin
curls up crisp and golden, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels
and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the oil from the pan, add the stock and bring to a boil,
scraping up the brown bits that adhere to the bottom of the pan.
Reduce the heat and continue to cook at a low simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, generously coat a cast-iron skillet with vegetable
oil and heat over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Add the
okra and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about
12 minutes. The gum will stick to the sides of the pan. Remove the
okra from the heat. Cut away the curled fried skin from the chicken
pieces and reserve. Add the chicken pieces and onions to the
simmering sauce and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until chicken is
cooked through. Add okra and season with salt and pepper. Add the
malagueta oil or hot pepper sauce and cook for another minute.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with the fried chicken curls and polenta (see recipe). _

   My friend Eliane Oliveira introduced me to this dish at Dada, a
restaurant in the historic Pelourinho section of Salvador that
serves some of the best traditional Bahian cuisine in Brazil. The
tomatoes and dende give this version a gorgeous shrimp color.
Served as a first course, sprinkled with a little chopped cilantro,
it makes an elegant soup.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds prawns (large shrimp)
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cassava (also called manioc or yucca)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shrimp stock or light fish stock
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh or canned unsweetened coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dende oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   Rinse, peel and devein shrimp, reserving heads if making your
own shrimp stock. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   With a sharp paring knife, peel away the cassava skin and cut
the cassava root in half lengthwise. In a large bowl, cover the
cassava with cold water and set aside for 1 hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if using homemade shrimp stock, combine the shrimp
heads, shells and enough cold water to cover in a saucepan. Bring
to a boil, skim, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Strain
through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve the broth, about 2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, mix the lime juice with the salt and white
pepper and mix until the salt dissolves. Stir in the shrimp and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the cassava and place in a large kettle of lightly salted
water. Stud 1 onion quarter with the cloves and add it and the
remaining quarters and bay leaf to the cassava.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, or until the cassava is
fork-tender. Drain and cool slightly. Remove the fibrous central
cords from the cassava; remove the bay leaf and the cloves from the
onion quarter and discard. Set the cassava and onion aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the
chopped onions and garlic and cook until the onions are lightly
browned, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and stock
to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a boil,
reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   Working in two or three batches, in a food processor, puree the
boiled cassava and onions with the tomato mixture, adding the milk,
coconut milk and dende oil as you pulse the mixture. Place the
pureed mixture in a large nonstick saucepan and set over medium
heat. Add the shrimp and the cream, season with salt and pepper and
cook, stirring constantly, until shrimp are just cooked through. If
the mixture is too thick, thin with a little milk or stock. When
shrimp are cooked through, add parsley and cilantro and cook for
another 2 minutes. Serve with boiled white rice. _ Adapted from

   In the state of Minas Gerais, this is always served with a huge
spread of pork, sauteed kale, plain boiled rice and wedges of
polenta. I tend to skip the polenta, but by all means, have a
little bowl of farofa on the table to sprinkle on. The mulatinha
beans can be difficult to find, so any other kind of brown, red or
white bean works fine, as would black beans, although it won't then
be an authentic tutu. In Brazil, the addition of lard to this dish
makes it all the richer, so if you have a little pork fat sitting
around. . . .
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mulatinha beans, brown beans such as cranberry beans or
white beans such as navy or Great Northern beans, washed and picked
clean
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   3 cups beer or additional water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, ribs removed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup manioc flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano or 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped green onions, green part only
</P>
<P>
   Soak the beans overnight in water to cover by several inches.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the beans and place them in a large soup kettle with water
to cover by 3 inches (make sure to use this much water, or you
won't have enough bean liquid to puree the beans; if that happens,
used canned chicken stock). Bring to a boil and skim off any foam
or impurities. Add the beer or additional water and bring to a boil
again. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes,
stirring from time to time so the beans do not stick.
</P>
<P>
   While the beans cook, put the olive oil in a saute pan and place
over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for about 5
minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the tomato and
green pepper and cook about 10 minutes, or until the pepper is limp
and almost tender.
</P>
<P>
   Add the manioc flour, toss and cook another minute. Add about 3
cups of bean liquid, a little at a time, until the mixture forms a
light, wet paste. Fold in the oregano and parsley and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   When the beans are soft and tender, season with salt and pepper,
turn off the heat and set aside for 10 minutes. Drain the beans,
reserving the cooking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor, pulse the beans on and off in batches until
smooth, adding a little bean liquid as needed to keep the mixture
loose. Continue to process until all the beans are pureed. All the
bean liquid may not be required. The consistency should be smooth,
soft and not heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually add the manioc flour mixture to the processor, working
in two or three batches if necessary. Place the puree in a clean
kettle and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Keep warm over a
pan of simmering water until ready to serve. When ready to serve,
sprinkle with the green onions. _ Adapted from: Christopher Idone's

   Couve means ``kale,'' but Brazilian cooks also make collards
this way. Use whichever greens you please. Collards are easier to
roll than kale. This is my preferred method for cooking greens _
and okra, come to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh kale, or 1 big bunch collards
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Soak the greens in the sink to clean, or wash thoroughly. Strip
off stems and stack the leaves in a pile. Make a manageable bunch,
roll it tightly like a cigar and cut it crosswise in 1/4-inch
slivers. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.
Add onion and garlic, stirring until cooked through, about 5
minutes. Add the greens a batch at a time, stirring constantly and
adding more as they wilt. Cook until just tender but still bright
green, about 10 to 15 minutes. If the greens stick before they are
tender, add a little tap water. Serve warm.

   Some Brazilian cooks use an egg per quindim (oddly enough,
``quindim'' is the singular form in Portuguese). ``It's a fat
pill,'' I heard one well-dressed U.S. businessman say at a Rio de
Janeiro restaurant. ``It's a macaroon on steroids.'' This somewhat
lighter-than-usual recipe is from Jessica Harris' ``Tasting
Brazil.'' She uses light brown sugar to impart more flavor, but a
real quindim is bright yellow, not light brown. Reader Andrea Neves
shared a recipe with me that was very eggy and delicious _ like
grandma's custard. ``The secret,'' says Neves, ``is to cook the
quindins in a pan of water.'' We also like using mini-muffin pans
for a daintier look.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tightly packed freshly grated coconut
</P>
<P>
   5 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg white, beaten into stiff peaks
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix together by
hand the sugar, butter and coconut. Beat in the egg yolks one at a
time, stirring well. Fold in the beaten egg white. Grease 12 large
muffin molds _ or 16 mini-muffin molds _ and divide the mixture
among them. Place the muffin tin in a larger baking pan filled with
1 inch of boiling water to form a bain-marie. Bake 35 minutes, or
until the quindins are firm and golden. Let them cool in the tin
before removing.

<P>
   For those of us who aren't true bakers, this dessert is
simplicity itself. It's a good way to use ripe bananas, and with a
little supervision, even the kids can do it. It also works well
with apples. Be sure to have some vanilla ice cream on hand to
dollop on while the cobbler is hot.

 &HT;    Brazil: Collards, peanuts, sweets _ the other South knows the
comforts of home
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The corn cake was unlike anything I had ever
tasted, and yet it seemed somehow familiar. Sweet and crumbly, just
a little bit savory, studded with kernels of fresh corn, this cross
between a bright yellow cake and a very rich corn bread was the
perfect thing to have in the morning with a glass of milk. But my
food memory was confused: My South Georgia grandmothers never made
this _ or did they?
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, I picked up Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado's
``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands'' _ a Dickensian work of magic
realism about a cooking school instructor who conjures her dead
husband back into her bed _ and there was the corn cake: ``Sugar,
salt, grated cheese, butter, coconut milk, the thick and thin, both
are called for. ... The proportions depending on the taste; each
person has his preference _ some like things sweeter, some saltier,
isn't that so? And the batter very thin. A quick oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Twin passions. The living and the dead. The salty and the sweet.
I'm no Dona Flor, but what led me to Brazil in the first place was
my desire to understand its foodways. My ongoing quest is to
discover how the various cuisines of our African, European and
indigenous ancestors have been transported to the kitchens of our
time.
</P>
<P>
   And so, from the corn cake that my friend Adilson's mother made
to the eggy coconut macaroon known as quindim that is found all
over Brazil, I was forever reminded of the comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   Okra, corn, peanuts. Greens, collards, pork. Shrimp, rice,
tomatoes: These are the ties that bind the American South with the
states of Bahia and Minas Gerais. And like Southerners, Brazilians
have a very sweet tooth. But what transforms Brazilian cookery into
a distinctive art of its own is its liberal use of bacalhau (dried
salt cod) from the Portuguese; native yucca in all its forms
(boiled, fried, ground into flour and meal); the orange-amber palm
oil known as dende; the malagueta pepper (a tiny, superhot chile
whose flavor cannot be compared to any other); and coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the northeastern state of Bahia, you'll find moquecas
(fish stews flavored with coconut and dende), bobo de camarao
(boiled and pureed cassava with shrimp); caruru (a Yoruban dish of
okra, shrimp and cilantro); and acaraje, a black-eyed pea or bean
cake fried in dende oil, sliced in half, stuffed with a large dried
shrimp and slathered with vatapa (a spread of crushed nuts, coconut
milk, dried shrimp and any number of other ingredients). With a
majority-black population, Bahia remains African through and
through.
</P>
<P>
   To sprinkle a hot steaming moqueca with farofa (manioc flour
toasted with butter or oil) and drizzle it with malagueta pepper
oil is to discover the Holy Trinity of the Bahian larder. The
crunchy farofa, the aromatic dende and the fiery pepper explode on
the tongue to evince a singular sensory experience.
</P>
<P>
   Down south a bit, in the state of Minas Gerais, you encounter a
rich cuisine that celebrates pigs, polenta and pods of okra _ and
some of the weirdest, brightest desserts I have ever seen (fruit
purees and curls of green mango soaking in syrup). There's Minas
cheese (a bland cow's milk variety that comes alive with a dollop
of sweet fruit) and turkey wrapped in banana and lime leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But the piece de resistance is tutu a Mineira, a brown-bean mash
that's always served with sauteed collards, boiled white rice,
wedges of polenta cake and every cut of pork imaginable _ pork
chops, sausage, cracklings and roast pork. This is the region's
answer to feijoada (the national dish of pork and black beans).
</P>
<P>
   I never got around to trying chicken cooked in its own blood,
but I did fall head over heels in love with frango com quiabo
(chicken with okra), a simple dish that saves the crisped chicken
skins to serve on a side dish of creamy polenta with fresh corn. I
am just mystified that we Southerners have never thought of
combining pan-fried chicken with stewed okra.
</P>
<P>
   If the Minas table represents country food at its very best,
then Sao Paulo, my final destination, is the epitome of all things
cosmopolitan. The world's third-largest city, with a population of
18 million and a lively mix of Japanese, Italians and immigrants
from all over the globe, it is ranked as one of the world's great
restaurant cities. Next time, I'll sample sushi and pasta, but on
this first trip I wanted to try what the locals eat.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what led me to the home of Dona Nair Galvao da Silva
Moreira.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that she was a terrific home cook and caterer, I asked
her son Ne if I might visit their home one day for coffee and _
perhaps _ a few recipes. Instead, I arrived to find a Saturday
lunch laid out for the entire clan, the four Moreira children, five
grandchildren and an assortment of aunts, friends, maids and
guests. First, Dona Moreira sent around a tray of bright red
cocktails. ``What's in this?'' I asked Ne, suddenly lifted by a
tropical rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy,'' he said, ``Just passionfruit, strawberries, vodka
and sugar.'' Muito bom!
</P>
<P>
   While Senhor Moreira, a native of Portugal who looks to be about
5 feet tall, sat by the pool sipping whiskey and trying to keep the
umbrella table from blowing away, the grandchildren wrestled with
uncles in a beautiful room appointed with family keepsakes and a
print by the Brazilian artist Alfredo Volpi.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I munched on little fried balls stuffed with carne seca
(dried beef) and tottered into the kitchen to see what was cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a magnificent feast.
</P>
<P>
   There were pork ribs on a tray with fried yucca, a molded ring
of pure white rice, a bowl of soupy beans, a platter of grilled
beef steak and farofa. There was a fresh green salad with hearts of
palm, a tray of tomatoes scattered with mozzarella and a basket of
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   And there was one dish I'd read about but never seen _ cuscuz
Paulista, a Sao Paulo staple. Nothing like the couscous we know
from Africa and the Middle East, this puddinglike mold is made from
manioc flour and a flaky corn flour that resembles cornflakes.
Mixed with shredded chicken or shrimp, it is decorated with sliced
tomatoes, hearts of palm, English peas and even sardines. To an
American palate, it is wonderfully weird.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Dona Moreira how she got her ribs so crispy, the
whole family started giggling.
</P>
<P>
   The secret? She fries them in lard seasoned with red wine and
garlic cloves. Awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must cook them in true pork fat, what we call banha in
Brazil,'' said Ne. ``Do not put into an oven, but directly over the
fire of the stove.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Ne, a 31-year-old Clorox executive who is relocating to San
Francisco, said, ``We are very simple people, and our pleasures are
also simple: Let's cook something nice, sit around the table and
let the conversation go while we eat. This is how we have fun. The
consequences are that the whole family must urgently go on a diet,
but we can live with that!''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too.
</P>
<P>
   I can also live with the torta de banana, a Moreira family
favorite. In the States, we would call it a dump cake or cobbler.
But Dona Moreira adds yeast and eggs to give it lift, and once the
bananas caramelize and set, the dessert can be cut into neat
squares and put on a plate. You could add a dash of rum to some
whipping cream, or make a simple rum syrup and drizzle it on. Or
both.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks spent eating my way around Brazil, after
returning home to make quindim, tutu a Mineira and bobo de camarao,
I've decided that if we Southerners have anything in common with
Brazilians, it is our love of food.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if on cue, an e-mail pops up from my friend Eliane in
Salvador: ``Now, this is a promise: When you come back, you must to
cook some American Southern food for us. And, if you want, I can
see if it is possible to send you an acaraje by mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a true friend. I just hope she remembers that I like
it with vatapa and the green tomato relish.

 &HT;    Internet offers ways to prepare your kitchen for turn of
millennium
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is your kitchen Y2K ready?
</P>
<P>
   With less than 100 days until the clock ticks to 12:01 a.m.,
Jan. 1, 2000, it is time to give kitchen Y2K readiness some
thought. Predictions about what will happen range from catastrophic
(no water, no gas, no electricity, with disrupted food supplies),
to mildly inconvenient, to absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   To keep your kitchen routine running smoothly, you have to
decide how much and what kind of food, water and other supplies to
have on hand. The advice of responsible experts ranges from having
enough for 72 hours to as much as three weeks. Experts also
strongly advise not to wait until the last minute to begin stocking
up.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is ready when you are and loaded with Y2K kitchen
information, although some of it is downright wacky. Some sites
that one suspects are pushing an agenda other than good advice have
been urging people to store enough dehydrated and survival foods to
last until the next millennium. Many pass along the particularly
odious recommendation that you horde in secret, lest a threatening
neighbor should find out you have all that food and come knocking
to ask for a couple of eggs on New Year's Day. Oh, and you'd better
learn how to grind all that wheat into flour before New Year's or
you'll really be in a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also sites full of reasoned, helpful advice on how
to prepare your kitchen, as well as explaining what this Y2K thing
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Not to miss _ and maybe the only place you will need to visit _
is ``The Y2K Kitchen'' at www.y2kkitchen.com. The site is produced
by Sally Strackbein, a longtime computer professional and family
cook who has written a book of the same name but has generously put
loads of free information on her Web page. She writes in a jaunty,
humorous style about the background of the Y2K situation, while
imparting serious advice.
</P>
<P>
   Just print out her shopping list and head to the grocery store.
Her shopping tips are especially helpful and outline common
pitfalls for anyone who has never bought in bulk. Storing tips
include what to do with all that food once you've lugged it home.
Especially helpful in deciding what food to sock away are her
recipe guidelines, based on the assumption that we may have to do
our cooking on camp stoves, wood stoves or barbecue grills because
of interruptions in electricity or natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K recipes here are also a cut above. While some sites will
tell you how to boil bark, these sound fine at any time. She has
tested them all on her family and urges visitors to contribute.
There is lots of good information at this site, which has an active
forum; and it also touches on ethical and philosophical issues
related to individual and community readiness.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites you may want to visit:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cooking When the Power Goes Off'' at www.ext.vt.edu/pubs
</P>
<P>
   /disaster/490-307/490-307.html gives brief but vital safety
information about cooking by alternative methods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dealing With Disaster'' at www.naples.net/govern/county
</P>
<P>
   /emrgmgt/emrginfo.htm has straightforward information on what to
do with perishable food left in a refrigerator or freezer after the
power goes off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information about storing water is at www.securbar.com
</P>
<P>
   /purewtr.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  See www.realfood4realpeople.com/y2k.html for good tips and
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MORE RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   There are some pretty good basic Y2K recipes at 321website.com
</P>
<P>
   /members/home/data/willlorene/y2krecipes.html, but watch those
links _ there is lots of possibly irresponsible talk out there
about martial law, rampaging hordes, conspiracies and those pesky
neighbors.

   ``Nancy,'' who submitted this pantry recipe, suggests serving
with instant mashed potatoes and canned peas. You can buy
single-serving packets of mayonnaise from food warehouse stores,
along with single-serving packets of sweet pickle relish. Mix for a
quick tartar sauce. The patties are a bit dry, so if you like add a
tablespoon of mayonnaise before shaping. And if you have some Old
Bay Seasoning, shake in a bit for spice.

 &HT;    Meringue puffs turn into light, crispy cookies
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lots of us remember meringue cookies, but our recall
takes us through a rainbow of colors and is sometimes dotted with
bits of candy, chocolate chips or nuts.
</P>
<P>
   When June Henderson of Alpharetta (Ga.) asked for ``white puffy
cookies,'' recipes floated in, offering a range of cooking methods
and mix-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Most often the methods called for preheating the oven, then
turning it off and letting the egg white-based cookies sit
overnight, a method that sounds iffy in this day of heightened
salmonella safety. We also tested a recipe that lets you cook the
meringues in a low oven in less than a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out neither method is recommended by the USDA Meat and
Poultry Hotline, unless you use pasteurized egg white products like
Just Whites, according to the USDA's Bessie Berry.
</P>
<P>
   So the choice is yours: risk or safety, ovenight or not. We like
both the quick version and an overnight one from Mrs. John W.
Everage Sr. of Birmingham, both with moist, chewy centers and
crispy outsides.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Forget About Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 cookies
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Standing time: overnight
</P>
<P>
   In this recipe, the cookies sit overnight in an oven that has
been preheated and then turned off. The cookies are sugary-sweet,
crunchy on the outside and moist and chocolaty in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup broken pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, beat egg whites
until stiff peaks form. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat
until incorporated. Add salt. Fold in pecans, then chocolate chips.
Line two small or one large cookie sheet with parchment paper or
clean brown paper. Drop meringue by tablespoonfuls onto sheets.
They will not spread and can be packed closely. Place sheets in
preheated oven. Immediately turn off oven and let the cookies sit
in the oven overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Per cookie: 69 calories, 1 gram protein, 4 grams fat (percent
calories from fat, 53), 9 grams carbohydrates, no cholesterol, 15
milligrams sodium, trace fiber.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Snow Meringues
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 dozen
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Marie Geesa of Doraville (Ga.) introduced this recipe by saying
it might not be the one June Henderson remembers, but its advantage
is not having to wait overnight for the cookies to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   4 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups (9 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 275 degrees. Cut baking parchment or baking
paper to fit two cookie sheets _ do not grease. In a medium bowl,
beat egg whites until foamy. Add salt and cream of tartar. Beat
until peaks are stiff. Add sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating
well after each addition. Fold in nuts, chocolate chips and
vanilla. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto baking paper. Bake for
20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown, checking after 20 minutes
to make sure meringue hasn't dried out. With a spatula, remove to
rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Per cookie: 68 calories, 1 gram protein, 3 grams fat (percent
calories from fat, 45), 10 grams carbohydrates, no cholesterol, 18
milligrams sodium, trace fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe request
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Katherine Smith of Hiram hopes somebody copied two recipes for
kugel that she saw on a cooking show on television. Both noodle
dishes are baked; one included cottage cheese and the other had a
pecan topping and was poured into a bundt pan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ We'll get to the food, but first, let me tell
you a story.
</P>
<P>
   I'm supposed to be here _ it's written in my Month At A Glance.
``Interview Joe Macko, Visiting Club House Manager, The Ballpark in
Arlington _ 11 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm here to talk to Macko about feeding high-profile
millionaires night after summer night. Millionaires with names like
Ken Griffey Jr., Paul O'Neill, Darryl Strawberry. Big boys who make
big bucks playing the big game.
</P>
<P>
   I've checked in with security, made my way into the bowels of
the stadium and arrived at Joe's doors _ avoiding towers of hot-dog
buns on wheels and a tour group of elderly gigglers making faces
behind the media room's speakers' table.
</P>
<P>
   But no Joe. I bang on the metal doors. No answer. I try the door
handle. No luck. Then I try another. No go. And then a third. Aha!
_ this one works. And it's the right place. (A food editor can tell
these things _ this room is equipped with two stoves and a
glass-fronted refrigerator.)
</P>
<P>
   I walk into the next room calling for Joe, thinking perhaps he
hasn't heard my knocks. There's further evidence I'm in the right
place _ this room could be my neighborhood 7-Eleven. A plethora of
salty snacks in orange and yellow boxes march along a cabinet; the
cold case is filled with soft drinks and water.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall I go, calling his name.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Macko's kingdom is a suite of rooms strung under the stadium
directly behind the visitors' dugout. There's Joe's office, the
kitchen, the canteen, a bunkhouse and weight rooms. There's an
office for the managing coach. I turn the corner and _ omigosh _
there's Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up in one large room are all the Baltimore Orioles. An
open locker is set for each Bird _ a sign with each player's name
and number oversees his personal equipment. And front and center _
there's Cal Ripken _ no, not in the flesh, but the stuff that
covers his flesh. Four pairs of gray-blue uniform pants, three
pairs of athletic shoes, a pair of Nike flip-flops. And yes, an
athletic supporter, right there, hanging on a hook. Oh ... my.
</P>
<P>
   I'm feeling, well, a little breathless. I've crossed the room
and am 2 feet from Cal's jersey. My father, an Orioles fan since
the Senators left D.C., would pop his buttons knowing my college
education had finally gotten me somewhere worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the next locker. Uh-oh. Albert Belle. Two gloves, two
pairs of pants, Reebok shower shoes, a bottle of Phisoderm, a
partly used stick of Sunny Magic. (I'm enough my father's daughter
that I know not to mess with Albert Belle, but jeez, I am a
reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   But Belle has cut through my fantasy haze. Where is Joe?
</P>
<P>
   I find a phone and call the public relations folks upstairs,
telling them there seems to be no Joe.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Days were when clubhouses were rollicking,
drink-some-beer-and-cuss-the-umpires dens. Even the rather staid
Rangers were known for some cutting up off the field. A former
pitcher, not to be named later in this story, is rumored to have
shot out the home clubhouse recliners with his shotgun _ clouding
the air and the room's blue carpeting with blasts of fiberfill. Joe
Macko was on the home side of the field then, in the old days at
the old stadium when food meant Gaylen's barbecue and stadium hot
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and, in Macko's clubhouse,
four varieties of bubble gum are offered instead of the tobacco of
years past. And SnackWell cookies are stocked alongside the M&AMP;Ms,
plain and peanut. For the player who has let the big-money contract
increase his snob factor, there are biscotti. But the snack that
disappears quickest? Every 10-year-old's favorite: Cracker Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But this food usually goes to the dugout with the players. If
they want a little something between the weight room and batting
practice, there are salad and sandwich fixings on ice in the
canteen.
</P>
<P>
   There's a George Foreman grill there, too, purchased for Wade
Boggs, who exists on chicken breasts. There's a cooker that's
usually spinning with hot dogs, except when the Yankees are in
town. George Steinbrenner's players aren't allowed the All-American
favorite because the boss says they're difficult to digest.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified but well-placed source tells me you can often
tell a team's competitiveness by its dining habits. The New York
Yankees apparently eat sparingly before a game; some Kansas City
Royals have been known to tuck into three or four hot dogs
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   PowerAde and bottled water are popular with visiting players, as
is Dr Pepper, a Texas exotic. Protein-vitamin shakes are also big
among the boys. Players will often pop into the clubhouse during a
game to whip up the contents of a powder-protein pouch with some
water.
</P>
<P>
   It's after the game that Macko serves up the main event.
</P>
<P>
   He brings in chef Paul Sable from the Arlington Hilton to cook
up roast chicken, pork loin, tenderloin, macaroni and cheese _ real
food for real men. He's the only clubhouse manager in baseball to
do things in such style _ at Tiger Stadium, the visiting team can
expect delivered pizza.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Joe Macko is 71 and has spent 52 years in baseball. He's as big
as a bear, with hands the size of canned hams. When he arrives (his
Month At A Glance read noon) he's carrying 3 gallons of milk in
grocery bags _ in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one chore in his day of coddling the visiting Big Boys
of Baltimore. He and his five assistants will polish 80 pairs of
shoes during the week, wash and repair uniforms, try to accommodate
corporate autograph-seekers without annoying players, and set up
lockers.
</P>
<P>
   We talk for about 20 minutes, and he fields three phone-call
requests, one from the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, wanting to
deliver goods for my new best friend, Cal Ripken, to autograph. He
walks a fine line, Macko, knowing his job is to make the visiting
team as comfortable as possible but also understanding the draw
these players have for fans.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed, Macko acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, players hung around after the game,'' Macko
said, ``but these days, if they think they've been called wrong on
a play, they can pop in a videotape in here and see right away if
they were right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Players are certainly coddled more today, but they also work
harder than most fans imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players are usually in the clubhouse around noon. They might
work out in the weight room, then there's batting practice. They're
usually not back to their hotel until 12 or 1 a.m.'' Macko says.
``It's a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   Macko picks up a pair of uniform pants that the seamstress has
left; a good 3-inch patch has meticulously repaired a hole. Macko
has been in baseball long enough to not question such requests,
knowing that although a player may have three other pairs of pants
in his locker, these are his lucky pants. And he knows that
eccentricities and the coddling flow on both sides of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Gonzalez has about 10 or 12 pairs of pants in his
locker,'' Macko says. ``One pair might be 1 inch shorter than the
other, he might have a couple different waist sizes _ maybe he had
a big lunch or something. They all want their bottoms to look good.
They're real conscious of being pretty.''

TEEN SHOW SHOULD BE BACK BY `POPULAR' DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any drama talking boldly about ``the social order of things''
when it comes to the choice of friends is the result of someone
seeing too many teen movies, which is the built-in problem of
``Popular,'' an otherwise promising drama that could very well
prove entertaining and even thoughtful if it plays its cards right.
</P>
<P>
   Uneven pacing and clunky transitions keep the show from reaching
its potential, and the dialogue is so repetitive, constantly
dealing with popularity and acceptance, that it sounds as though
each character is saying the same thing but in different ways.
Worse, the teachers are as clueless as the young minds they're
instructing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the students populating Kennedy High are the stars
here, ``Popular'' zeros in on Brooke (Leslie Bibb) and Sam (Carly
Pope), natural-born enemies because of that whole ``social order''
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke is the blond cheerleader with the quarterback boyfriend
and loaded father; Sam is the dark-haired outsider with the single
mother. Brooke's friend, the annoying Lily (Tamara Mello), seems to
make her friend list according to parental income, so popularity
comes with a price tag.
</P>
<P>
   We're supposed to believe that Brooke is a pretty girl with a
heart _ simply a victim of her dad's wealth, if you want to look at
it that way. It's obvious that she harbors some of the same
materialistic image concerns of Lily, such as when her boyfriend
informs her of his intentions to quit the football team to
participate in a school play.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, Brooke warns him that they'll never make homecoming
court if he's ``a drama geek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she says shortly after. ``I can't believe I said that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines are blurred even more because Sam hates Brooke for
stepping over the little people, yet seems obsessed with those who
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dawns on you,'' Sam says when talking about popularity and
looks, ``you'll never be a `Seventeen' girl because they don't
allow air-brushing in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they did, Sam would probably be the first in line.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the kind of ambiguity that would give ``Popular''
sizzle and set it apart from this season's busload of teen-angst
TV. What keeps me feeling that the series has potential are dead-on
scenes, such as when Brooke is looking in a full-length mirror and
pinching the fat around her waist. The girl looks like a pencil.
But there she is, asking Lily, ``Am I too fat?'' That's scary.
</P>
<P>
   Just as encouraging is what happens at the end of the second
episode (which I won't spoil here). It airs Thursday on WB, in the
series' regular day and time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm rooting for ``Popular,'' but I've got a feeling the series
will fall victim to the very dilemma it's exploring: In order for
it to be popular with viewers, it may opt for the easy way out, get
soapy and silly, and forget its original premise. Let's hope not.

miles north of Rostov-on-Don, near the border with Ukraine.

 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VASILIYEVKA, Russia _ The killer was a neighborly grandmother
driven to carnage to protect her precious and meager livelihood, a
small plot of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, unemployed since the town's only factory shut its
doors seven years ago, had turned to plundering local vegetable
fields in the dark of night to survive and stoke his addiction to
vodka.
</P>
<P>
   On a cool summer evening 64-year-old Valentina Dolgopyatova
caught her neighbor, Nikolai Sidorenko, 47, digging up her crops.
They wrestled over the burlap sack of potatoes in his hands. The
big man swung a spade. She lunged with a five-inch boning knife.
</P>
<P>
   It took only minutes for him to die face down in a pool of his
own blood at the edge of the potato patch.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a difficult decade of Russia's economic collapse to
reach this desperate condition in a country that has failed to
complete its transition from Communist rule to free-market
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This story of dust, sweat and bloodshed in the southern Russia
village of Vasiliyevka, three hours by car north of Rostov-on-Don,
is not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of Russians depend on their small garden plots
for survival. Across Russia, almost daily, police in cities and
hamlets receive reports of thefts and, in some cases, violence in
the struggle for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very difficult,'' explained Dolgopyatova, whose eyes
welled with tears as she recounted the story of killing Sidorenko.
The authorities recently announced they would not prosecute her for
the homicide in late June, ruling that she acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we grow is all we have,'' she added, standing at the spot
where her victim collapsed and died from the knife wound to his
abdomen, still gripping the bag of freshly unearthed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Vast numbers of Russians have been left behind in Russia's
troubled transformation since the Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991. Wages have fallen, industries and jobs have disappeared and
corruption has soared.
</P>
<P>
   In Belaya Kalitva (pop. 42,000), the regional center and nearest
city to Vasiliyevka, the average monthly salary is about US$25;
Pensioners get even less, about US$16 each month, said Alexander
Krug, deputy editor of the local newspaper. ``People are at the end
of their rope to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a vicious cycle of poverty, alcohol abuse among
men and a corresponding leap in the crime rate. Russia's swelling
ranks of poor _ four of every 10 Russians live below the poverty
line _ has turned pensioners and the under-employed into
subsistence farmers, growing vegetables, raising chickens and goats
on small plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Vasiliyevka (pop. 700), the cycle became a lethal
formula, resulting in a killing that resembles a barbaric tale of
medieval survival, not life at the edge of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, Dolgopyatova, plows and sows her small field by
hand with her 72-year-old husband Andrei. He spent a lifetime in
the coal mines. She also worked the mines, before being trained to
do piecework in the local fabric factory.
</P>
<P>
   Together, their pensions total about US$32 a month. They depend
on what they grow in a field next to their clapboard house to get
them through the bitter winter. Still, she is filled with remorse
about the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do differently? I would run home right away. I'd
say to hell with it. If he wants to take them, let him take them.
I'll be able to plant again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, while the economy was austere, people were fed
and cases of common theft was rare.
</P>
<P>
   But today police cannot keep up with similar food feuds across
the country. Police in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk said that
at least eight potato thieves were killed there over the summer,
including two men savagely beaten to death by watchmen hired to
patrol the plots.
</P>
<P>
   In July in the Siberian city if Tomsk, a 75-year-old grandfather
shot to death his beloved 21-year-old grandson late one night after
he mistook the young man for a thief out to steal from his onion
patch.
</P>
<P>
   Near Ivanovo, a city northwest of Moscow, a 42-year-old woman
was spared her life, but endured a Scarlet Letter style punishment.
Several plot-owners caught her digging in their fields. They took
her to a nearby bus stop where they tied her to a post, stripped
her to her underwear and hung a sign around her neck reading: ``She
was stealing potatoes.'' Police discovered her the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Such pilfering of crops took place in Soviet times, too. But
then it was sporadic, not widespread and violent as today, said
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Rostov region is abundant with fertile farmland
that is laced with veins of coal deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But in Belaya Kalitva, eight of 10 coal mines have closed, as
have two out of three of the city's major factories. A
once-productive collective farm in Vasiliyevka is now overgrown
with weeds and the rusting hulks of machine equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely everything is dying here. There is no work to be
had anywhere,'' said Alexander Yemelin, the chief investigator who
worked the potato-killer case. Driving through the outskirts of
Belaya Kalitva and surveying the depressed landscape, Yemelin
added: ``NATO hasn't bombed us, even though it looks like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old investigator is overworked and underpaid. There
have been a record 20 murders in Belaya Kalitva so far this year.
Unless the economy improves and authorities can get crime under
control, there will be more, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The no-nonsense investigator has two pictures on his office wall
_ former Soviet leader and hard-line KGB chief Yuri Andropov and
actor Arnold Shwarzeneggar, wielding a high-caliber weapon in a
scene from the film ``The Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But the system he works for cannot protect the people, he
conceded. After a two-month investigation, the grandmother known as
``Babushka Valya'' was not prosecuted because ``we decided she
needed to protect herself,'' said Yemelin.
</P>
<P>
   The gray-haired lady, her face bronzed and deeply lined, had
been sitting at the edge of her small field watching on the lookout
for thieves after a next-door neighbor's patch had been pilfered
the night before. The knife she carried was to slice small bits of
lard and bread, which she chewed on while on guard at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she spotted in the distance a white figure bent down
in her field. She yelled to Sidorenko, but he kept on digging. As
she approached the man, she recognized him. They had both worked in
the nearby fabric factory and only recently she had given him some
food when he came by begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kolya, how can you do this?'' she asked, now standing
face-to-face with him in the small field of potatoes, corn and
pumpkin vines. ``I help you, and now you have come to steal my
potatoes?''
</P>
<P>
   He told her to get lost and when she didn't, he reached for the
spade. She brought the knife up to her chest. He raised the spade
to swing. She lunged towards him, piercing his side and severing an
artery.
</P>
<P>
   It was over before she knew it, and he staggered away,
disappearing into the darkness. She wasn't even certain if she had
stabbed him. Most importantly, she thought, he was gone, though he
had taken the sack of potatoes with him.
</P>
<P>
   When morning broke, Dolgopyatova went to the police with the
neighborhood friend who also had been robbed of her crops. The
authorities went to Sidorenko's house, but he wasn't home.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, they found him face down, about 40 yards from where
he and Dolgopyatova had struggled, hidden from view from the potato
plot by a rocky knoll.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother stares at the spot where his body was discovered
and shakes her head, her eyes once again going wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to give him bread and food and helped him. I don't know
what would make a man do something like that,'' she said. ``A man
loses his work, maybe that's it.''

 &HT;    ST. SIMONS ISLAND LIGHTHOUSE MUSEUM IS HONORED AT WHITE HOUSE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented a
national award for public service to Georgia's St. Simons Island
Lighthouse Museum on Wednesday at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny museum housed below the landmark lighthouse has a
full-time staff of only three but won the National Award for Museum
Service along with Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo and the Nevada Museum
of Art in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``This national award is a tribute to the power of museums to
engage children, families and communities in towns and cities all
across America,'' the First Lady noted in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lighthouse Museum was honored for an innovative heritage
education program that is used in every school in Glynn County _ on
the barrier islands and mainland _ and reaches over 11,000
students. Utilizing all the historic sites and museums in the
county, the program pushes students to examine their community's
history and how it relates to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach children that there are buildings in their hometown
that are just as historic and important as those in Washington,
D.C.,'' said Linda Orr King, executive director of the St. Simons
museum. The museum is operated by the Coastal Georgia Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in the U.S. Capitol before the White House
ceremony, King described how the staff recently implemented its
emergency plan as Hurricane Floyd threatened the island.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations began about five days before Floyd's predicted
arrival, she said. With the museum located a scant hundred yards or
so from the beach, the most valuable artifacts were taken to safer
sites. Shutters were battened down and windows sealed with duck
tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take care of the museum first, then your own house
and your own family,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   Then the island was ordered evacuated. ``We just prayed
everything would be okay,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the hurricane veered to the north and largely missed
the south Georgia coast.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were given by the U.S. Institute of Museum and
Library Services, a federal agency based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Community outreach is an increasingly important part of museum
``vision,'' said Beverly Sheppard, acting director of the
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, museums are asking ``What is our purpose?'' and
``Who do we serve?'' she said. The three honored museums ``have
answered those questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Park Zoo, which attracts four million visitors a
year, was honored for an intern program for needy high school
students and a development program for Chicago public school
teachers. The Nevada Museum of Art was honored for a program to
redirect kids involved in graffiti vandalism into art education and
an inter-generational arts program for families.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners have included the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C.; Houston's Museum of Fine Arts; the National
Aquarium in Baltimore and the Brooklyn Children's Museum.
</P>
<P>
   As the St. Simons Lighthouse Museum joined this group, King
marveled at ``what can be accomplished (by) a small staff and
dedicated volunteers.''

   WCW _ ATLANTA: Some home cookin' seems to have hit the spot for
the WCW. There was a giddy buzz backstage at the sparkling new
Philips Arena, future home of the Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta
Thrashers. As ``Monday Nitro'' wrestlers and roadies shuttled back
and forth, the upbeat mood was apparent. In the arena, thousands of

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sufferin' succotash! Trent Reznor wants you to feel his pain.
</P>
<P>
   And there are oceans of it. The songwriter who performs as Nine
Inch Nails has just released what is only his third full-length
album in a decade, a cinemascopic double CD that maps the torture
in his soul while heeding the minimum nightly requirements for
decadent dance beats and eerie, penumbral grooves. After the
success of NiN's ``The Downward Spiral'' five years ago broke the
dense, S&AMP;M-spiked sounds of industrial rock for the Gap-browsing
mainstream, the sullen but chic Reznor has enjoyed visionary
status. Along with rap's growing influence, he made the current
bombast of heavy rock acts Limp Bizkit and Korn commercially
feasible, foisted Marilyn Manson on the world and did some
compelling soundtrack work with directors Oliver Stone and David
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Recording ``The Fragile'' must have posed a real trauma for
Reznor who, like such rock star/auteurs as Billy Corgan and the
Artist, is a perfectionist whose persona is inseparable from his
songs. Musically, he's risen to the occasion, creating often
complex and surprising soundscapes that can pulse demonically or
unfold as the quietly dramatic backdrop for a private psychological
movie reel. Lyrically, Reznor's still deeply immersed in a
crucifixion syndrome: He's the Jesus of nihilism. He begs us to
``taste the wealth of hate in me'' (``Somewhat Damaged''), concedes
that he ``tried to save myself but my self keeps slipping away''
(``Into the Void'') and observes that ``the heavens fall but still
we crawl'' (``The Way Out Is Through''). Reznor's introspective
rage sometimes yields to beauty _ stray glimmers of light pierce
his mine-shaft sensibility _ but for all the studio-crafted
complexity that surrounds it, the singer's worldview is punishingly
narrow.

   Never mind the name on the spine of this album, this is a Foxy
Brown record. No, not the Foxy Brown who raps, but Foxy Brown the
cocksure '70s film persona that the hip-hop artist modeled herself
after. Like the onscreen character, Sole is able to adapt to any of
the vibrant and almost sampleless backdrops: a carjacking (the
engaging ``Da Story''), a boyfriend cheating (first single
``4,5,6'' and the Latin-like ``It Wasn't Me'') or simply a party
starter (former No. 1 single ``Who Dat''). On this debut, Sole ably
plays the role of a swaggering, gun-slinging, skillful rhyme-sayer
backed by fellow Atlantan and underappreciated producer ``Tricky''
Stewart. But the scariest thing about this always collected cover
girl is when the dust she kicks up settles and the credits roll,
there probably won't be a hair on her head out of place.

   More spells than songs, Lori Carson's three-minute incantations
are hypnotic in the best possible way. Like a flame, they pull your
gaze into a place you probably couldn't get to on your own. On
this, her fourth solo album, her whispers seem more celebratory _
``in spite of everything,'' runs one chorus, ``I feel a little bit
hopeful again.'' She's always gonna be the girl who checks the
shadows first, she's just seeing more sun. There are layers of
instrumentation and programmed tricks _ in ``Breathe,'' a
high-pitched buzzing accompanies the lines ``synapses short-circuit
/ misfire away.'' Carson used a computer to wash the basic tracks
with more texture _ risky, since her songs are feathery to begin
with. But the disembodied atmospherics work, spinning around her
quiet soprano like a nimbus.

   Grade: B+

<P>
   With Ronnie Dunn's narcotic vocals and Kix Brook's boundless
cowboy energy, this hot country duo is at the point where they
could put careers on cruise control and still have hits. At the
recent Country Music Associations Awards, it certainly sounded like
their new CD might be a case of coasting when they performed the
sounds-just-like-boot-scoot assembly-line song ``Beer Thirty.''
About a third of the tracks here are, indeed, lazy retread riffs
and hat tricks off past hits. Even the first single, a cover of the
1980s John Waite pop tune ``Missing You,'' seems like a limp
attempt to cash in on the success of ``My Maria.'' But the
premonitions are wrong. On much of their seventh CD, Brooks &AMP; Dunn
deliver crisp country that is as satisfying as swigging Coca-Cola
out of a glass bottle. The nuggets are all tunes penned by Dunn.
``Going Under Gettin' Over You'' is a pedal-steel piner that has
the tall Texan spitting out whiskey-and-cigarettes lyrics. ``Hurt
Train'' weaves a lonesome Texas wind-sounding guitar behind Dunn's
moans of ``Here I sit loaded, wonderin' what went wrong/The whiskey
I can hold it, but I don't know how long.''

 &HT;    Amos finds a band for trip to `Venus'
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl with the piano clearly likes being part of a band. With
last year's ``From the Choirgirl Hotel,'' Tori Amos set a new
course with a full-time band and a more organic sound, and the
result was her best work yet.
</P>
<P>
   If this new album is any indication, Amos was happy with that
direction. ``Bliss,'' the lead track and first single, floats along
on a lovely piano figure until the band kicks in on the propulsive
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   That's a description that could be used for much of the last
album, too, but this isn't ``From the Choirgirl Hotel,'' Part 2,
though. There are tracks that might have come from any stage of her
career. The minimal, droning ``Suede'' could sit comfortably on
1996's ``Boys for Pele.'' The experimentalism of that album returns
in more refined form on several other cuts, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Amos' fiercely loyal fans longing for the early
girl-with-a-piano days will hear an echo of those years on the
final track, ``1000 Oceans,'' but she's come too far to play that
role very often without tossing in a few extras. ``Concertina''
sounds more singer/songwriter-like than anything she's done in
years, at least until the bridge, where a rumbling, phased guitar
throws the whole thing off-balance. It's a telling moment. She's no
longer content with traditional notions of prettiness, but Amos can
make the most disconcerting effects sound like a kind of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of this two-CD set is a memento of Amos' 1998
``Plugged'' tour, and, like many live albums, it doesn't quite
capture the electric atmosphere of the live shows. It's
well-recorded, expertly played and a great keepsake for the fans,
but hardly essential.

 &HT;    Video of the week
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Yeah, that's a terrible pun, but it gives
you some idea of the sophomoric almost-humor that thuds throughout
this computer effects-laden box office hit.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a movie has desert scenery, a hunky action hero
(Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys and supernatural hoodoo doesn't
make it an Indiana Jones movie. You'll miss Steven Spielberg's
masterful touch watching this petrified mix of retro adventure,
clumsy slapstick and minimal chills. The movie even begs the
comparison by having one character mutter, ``I hate bugs.'' It may
remind us of Indy's snake phobia, but also makes us miss Indy all
the more.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser plays an adventurer who heads into the Egyptian
desert with a comely Egyptologist (played with abrasive prissiness
by Rachel Weisz). Entering the cursed tombs, they encounter
voracious scarabs and a flesh-sucking dead prince, and a lot of
secondhand action and jokes. Stephen Sommers wrote and directed
``The Mummy,'' so he deserves double blame for the lameness. He's
also responsible for last year's awful ``Deep Rising.'' Apparently
the money guys at Universal forgot to watch that movie before
signing Sommers. Forget Imhotep. That's the real curse. (Priced to
buy: VHS $22.98; DVD, $29.98.)

TV series, with the annoying and unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the

documentary unfolds primarily in a tent set in the parking lot of a
Nissan showroom in smalltown Texas. It's here that 23 lucky
contestants jockey to win a new, $15,000 truck. All they have to do
is be the last one standing beside it, with one hand touching the
vehicle. The more time we spend under that tent, the more nobility
and depth director-editor Bindler finds in these people. Grade: A-

   Another McCormick request: I just found out that McCormick no
longer makes its Cincinnati Chili Mix. Can you find a substitute?
</P>
<P>
   _Sally Morris, Conyers (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   And another plea: I have been looking for Taco Casserole by
McCormick. It's in a green box that has the tomato sauce, chips and
seasoning. All I do is add hamburger and cheese. Any clue?
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Ballentine, Peachtree City (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds as if all good cooks are gearing up for yummy fall
eating. First, the Primavera Pasta Sauce Blend: It comes in a
1.2-ounce envelope and at times can be hard to find. We discovered
our envelope for $1.39 at Publix, 1544 Piedmont Ave N.E.
(404-898-1850).
</P>
<P>
   Both the Cincinnati Chili Mix and the Taco Casserole in a box
have been discontinued. However, McCormick has made the recipes
available via its consumer line: 1-800-632-5847. Or look for the
chili recipe on the company's Web site at www.mccormick.com. Hint:
The Cincinnati Chili is a sweet-spicy recipe that contains cloves,
chili powder and cinnamon. Also, McCormick makes a line of chili
seasonings, including the Original Chili Seasoning in a 1.25-ounce
envelope for about $1.19. It's widely available in grocery stores.

<P>
   Q: Will you assist me in locating Vivienne's Romano Cheese
Dressing? I used to buy the dressing at the Publix store on Roswell
Road, but it has been missing from the shelf for the past month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Naudja Threadgill, Roswell (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Thomas Tucker of St. Louis, Mo., who owns and produces the
Vivienne Romano Cheese Dressing, says his dressing has been sold to
Publix in the past (item No. 786072). Tucker suggests you contact
the store manager and ask him or her to order it. Or you can order
the dressing directly from the company. Twelve 8-ounce bottles (one
case) are $33 plus shipping and handling (1-800-827-0778). This
made-from-scratch gourmet dressing has been a favorite of St. Louis
folks since 1948. Ingredients include Romano cheese, vinegar,
hard-cooked egg and a blend of spices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been looking for Clairol's True to Light makeup mirror.
I had one when I was a teen but haven't seen one recently. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Melanie Zito, Newnan (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Mirror, mirror on the wall. ... You will soon be the fairest
of all with the True to Light makeup mirror by _ Remington. Several
years ago, the company bought the rights to this mirror from
Clairol and now markets it under the Remington name. We found the
mirror (style No. LM7, $29.99) at the Remington Factory Service
Center store in Perimeter Mall (770-395-7441).
</P>
<P>
   Q: For my husband's Christmas gift, I am trying to locate a pair
of red pajamas with ``feet'' (the kind that you envision toddlers
wearing). I called J Crew, the Gap and JC Penney, to no avail.
Maybe your search will be more successful than mine.
</P>
<P>
   _Tara Reeves, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a bit of kid in all of us, right? Warmth Wear LLC is
a family-owned business in Idaho selling these cozy, comfy adult
``footed jammies'' through its Web site, www.srv.net
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)wwear/wwear.html. Made from Polar Fleece or cotton
flannel, they come in all colors and a variety of prints and
patterns, sized extra small to extra large. Each pair is $65. Those
with a drop seat, Moonies, are $75. You can also contact the
company by calling 1-888-300-7752 or writing Warmth Wear LLC, 175
Church St., Newdale, ID 83436-0185.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For a year or more, I have been unable to find Little
Debbie's Golden Almond granola bars. I have checked most major
stores. One friend located four boxes in a Kroger, and I managed to
barter some fresh home-grown tomatoes for one of the boxes! Unless
you take pity on me, I may never again have another delicious
Golden Almond granola bar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Cicotello, Marietta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: How could we not help after that plea? We found Little Debbie
Golden Almond Chewy Granola Bars, owned by McKee Foods, at Publix,
1100 Hammond Drive, Dunwoody (Ga.) (678-443-2100). An 8-ounce box
(eight bars) is $1.59. They are also available, according to the
company, at Wal-Mart, 3100 Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta; and
Publix, 3605 Sandy Plains Road, Marietta. The bars are packaged
under the banner Sunbelt Snacks &AMP; Cereals, another McKee Foods
brand. And in teeny type on the front, it says, ``Baked by Little
Debbie Snacks.''

 &HT;    North Florida town an art, antiques mecca
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Fla. _ When the shade tobacco business went belly up
back in the 1960s, this little wide-spot-in-the-road town on U.S.
27 just about rolled up the sidewalks. Nothing much happened for
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   A renaissance began in 1984 when Lee Hotchkiss and Keith
Henderson moved their Tallahassee antiques shop to an ivy-covered
brick building at Main Street and Seventh Avenue in the heart of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;H Antiques became the cornerstone of what is now one of the
Southeast's largest arts and antiques centers. This month,
Tallahassee Magazine bestowed its Best Antiques Shop award
collectively to all of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Although businesses have come and gone in the past 15 years,
there are nearly 40 merchants, galleries and cafes _ plenty to keep
a visitor busy for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the town will be abuzz with the 4th Annual Havana
Bead and Jewelry Festival at Havana's Cannery. And looking even
further ahead, Havana MusicFest 2000 is set for March 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   Havana (population 1,500) pushes ahead like the Little Engine
That Could despite the deaths this year of two of its biggest
boosters: watercolorist Lee Mainella, who founded the Florida Art
Center and Gallery, and Paul Nicholson, founder of the popular
Nicholson Farmhouse Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two pillars of the community,'' says Sandi Beare,
co-owner of Mirror Image Antiques and self-appointed one-woman
visitors bureau. ``They are the type of people who inspire you to
carry on. We would be remiss if we did not continue'' what they
pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   While the town made its reputation as an art and antiques mecca,
Beare says, ``We are becoming an international design marketplace.
It's fun what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Image specializes in antiques (``no reproductions,''
Beare insists), collectibles, fishing collectibles and baseball and
sports memorabilia. The space also includes The Vault Art Gallery
inside a 1906 bank vault.
</P>
<P>
   Beare's father, Richard Beare, runs Lord Beare's Gourmet
Specialities in a small pantry in the back of the shop. Among the
dozens of items are English teas, McVitie's Original Digestion
Biscuits, Scott's Porage Oats, clotted cream and ready-to-heat
frozen entrees such as Cornish pasties and Scottish beef bridies.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is Little River General Store, where proprietor Rita
Love stocks kitchen gadgets, country gourmet foods, wooden and
metal toys (no plastic!), gardening tools, household cleaning
agents, natural health and beauty aids, Woolrich clothing and much,
much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a froufrou gift shop,'' says Love. ``Everything I
sell is useful and has a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an old-fashioned candy counter in the front of the
store. ``People come in all the time and notice the Necco wafers
and say they haven't seen them in years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At H&AMP;H Antiques, where it all started, Hotchkiss and Henderson
are helping clients select furniture and upholstery from their
Norwalk line. They've expanded from antiques and now offer
custom-made heart pine and cherry reproductions made by local
craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday and Sunday, the town is packed,'' says Hotchkiss,
who lives above the store with her husband/business partner.
``People like it that you're usually dealing directly with the
owner of the store. You get better service.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the H&AMP;H team, Christy Parks Witt and her family live in the
hundred-year-old house where she runs her business, the Berry
Patch. The shop not only offers quality antiques, Heirloom lace and
a line of bath and home aromatherapy products but welcomes guests
to the Tea Room on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great summer,'' says Witt. ``We're seeing a lot of
tourists, but the local folks are getting smart and keeping their
money in our county. Tons of people are moving in. You can raise
your family here. It's more like Mayberry RFD.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks away at Havana's Cannery is a
31,000-square-foot antiques mall with more than 100 antiques
dealers _ plus Rafters Interior Market and Shade restaurant. The
building was home to the Havana Canning Co., built in 1934 (green
peanuts were first canned in Havana in 1946) and, later, Cal's
Tupelo Honey. Owner Trey Morgan, a Tallahasseean who started the
antiques mall in 1994, still turns out small batches of sauces,
such as honey mustard, barbecue and citrus ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spark here,'' says Morgan. ``It's been here awhile.
It's not an easy business we've picked, but I'm sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan predicts Havana's best days are yet to come. ``It takes
time. Lee Minella knew how to do it. He taught me. It's coming to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-85 south to I-185; continue until I-185
ends in south Columbus, then pick up U.S. 27 south. Follow this

Bainbridge and directly into Havana, which is 12 miles north of
Tallahassee. It's about a five-hour drive.

1/2 miles west of town. The main dining room is in the 140-year-old
Nicholson House, where ``wet-aged'' steaks ($12.95-$25.95), lamb

among the offerings. Boiled peanuts are brought to the table with
the water. 4-10 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays. Reservations advised.

<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Historic Havana House Bed &AMP; Breakfast: Bunking at this 1907
home in a residential area two blocks from the shopping district is
like staying with relatives. Your hosts will be innkeepers Bruce
and Shirley Gaver. There are two guest rooms with private bathrooms
in this renovated dwelling that was built by the first mayor of
Havana. The entrance is at the back door, where you're likely to be
greeted by Whiskers the tabby cat. There's a small garden as well
as a screened porch with a swing. Art and stained glass _ much of
it created by the Gavers _ along with antiques and collectibles
brighten the interior. Rates are $80 and $90, including a full
country breakfast. 301 E. Sixth Ave. Reservations: 850-539-5611 or

 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There are many ways to measure a life. Jobs held and
lost, lovers come and gone. But no one expects the sum of a man to
fit inside a paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost all Marceline and Thomas Ballenger have left of
their son _ the lunch sack Seattle police gave them. It is filled
with crinkled papers from temp jobs, grimy cards from shelters and
drug counselors: scraps of a street life that ended in the worst
way.
</P>
<P>
   David Ballenger was stabbed 18 times Aug. 9, allegedly in an
attack by three teenagers under the trash-strewn freeway overpass
he called home. One of his attackers reportedly boasted afterward:
``One less bum on the face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``bum'' flashes like a lightning bolt inside the Bay
City, Ore., living room of David's parents. The couple remember a
devoted son who worked hard (when he did work). A generous man who
loved Hank Williams music. A fragile man who wore his soul on his
shirtsleeves and balmed the sting of setbacks with booze. They say
David slipped away from life before it was savagely taken.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of grief crumple Thomas Ballenger's 72-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot sleep,'' he wails. ``Those boys have ruined whatever
days we have left.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife sits nearby on a couch and cradles the paper bag like a
newborn baby. She survived heart surgery this spring. But this sort
of hurt she has not known in her 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was fixed, but now it is broken again,'' Marceline
Ballenger says, her eyes a fountain of tears. ``Nothing can take
away that pain. Everyone dies, but to die that way. ... David was
not a bum. He may have been homeless. He was not loveless.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away, in his verdant Seattle back yard,
Patrick Caffee sits in the sun and grieves. It is hard for him to
accept that his son, Michael Vittorio Caffee, may have had a hand
in something so unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   He says Michael _ a dirt-bike rider and an aspiring chef who
liked to listen to the heavy-metal band Megadeth _ was with the
wrong crowd when events took a wild and tragic turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael wasn't the guy who (stabbed him). He was a kid who
just happened to be there,'' says Patrick Caffee. But his hopeful
note wavers when he realizes that his son could go to prison for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set for Michael Caffee, 19, or the two
others _ Shelton Musgrave, 18, and Jay Stewart, 17, a juvenile who
will be treated as an adult. The three have pleaded not guilty to
second-degree murder and remain in jail. The Stewart and Musgrave
families declined requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I am worried about how he is going to be as a
human being after this,'' Patrick Caffee says. ``I don't want him
to become some animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy evokes a mystery for social workers, psychologists
and parents, who seek to know why youths turn violent, and what _
if anything _ such acts say about society.
</P>
<P>
   For many, David's death strikes a nerve because it involves
young people from decent backgrounds, preying on one of society's
most vulnerable, faceless groups: the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick Caffee, for the Ballengers, each passing day brings
anger, sadness and a hard question: How did once-promising lives
collide on a summer evening near a freeway?
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) When I pass by all the people say
</P>
<P>
   Just another guy on the lost highway (End italics)
</P>
<P>
   _ Hank Williams
</P>
<P>
   David Ballenger arrived by breech birth in Fresno, Calif., on
July 25, 1953 _ the middle child of parents who gave each of their
children names that began with ``D'': the eldest, Daniel; David;
and Diane, the baby.
</P>
<P>
   A picture taken just days later shows a sparkling infant with
fuzzy wisps of hair, chubby cheeks and blue-green eyes set off by
the slightly crooked smile that David would keep for life.
</P>
<P>
   He was a mother's dream, so quiet as an infant he had to be
awakened at feeding times. On his first day of school, his mother
escorted him back to kindergarten five times. ``He would just turn
around and beat a track back home,'' she recalled. ``I'd hear a
knock-knock at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   When David was 9, and his sister Diane was 2 months old, he
bought her a rubber duck. Later on, he added a Ringo Starr doll. He
was forever splurging allowance money on her.
</P>
<P>
   In David's younger years a slight speech impediment cropped up.
He tapped his blossoming humor to deal with it. One time David told
his mother he wanted a NAYonnaise sandwich. Fine, she said, but he
had to say mayonnaise correctly. He responded: ``I'll have peanut
butter and jelly, please.''
</P>
<P>
   The family moved around as Thomas Ballenger, a plasterer by
trade, sought places where construction jobs were plentiful. They
settled in Dixon, Calif., near the University of California at
Davis. After he fell off a ladder and shattered a leg, Thomas found
work as a barber.
</P>
<P>
   David attended Dixon High School, where he was a B to C student.
He joined the wrestling team and earned a certificate of award for
the sport when he was a senior.
</P>
<P>
   He had a knack for woodwork, carving boxes and ornate frames
around mirrors. He dabbled with ceramic arts, fashioning red and
blue vases that were smooth but askew. Imperfect. His mother held
onto the crafts as if they were priceless treasures, the way moms
do.
</P>
<P>
   David and his father loved to fish. ``We had a saying in the
family,'' Thomas Ballenger said with a rumbling chuckle. ```Put a
fishhook in the bathtub and David would catch you a fish!'''
</P>
<P>
   The boy liked to reach out to others in need. He helped tutor a
fellow high school student from Mexico. Under David's guidance, the
student graduated.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, David brought home a family of ducks that
had strayed from a nearby pond. He thought the ducks were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Like most teens, David was eager to get behind the wheel. During
an early driver's test he exited a parking lot through its entrance
as the examiner looked on. He eventually passed and was soon
tooling around in his parents' pink Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   One night, he took the car out and returned it at the promised
time _ with a dent in the rear fender. David said someone had hit
the car and zoomed off.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Marceline Ballenger was lying in bed at night, she
felt a tug.
</P>
<P>
   It was David.
</P>
<P>
   He could not sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama,'' the teen whispered, ``I can't lie to you. I bent the
fender on a fencepost.''
</P>

<P>
   Michael Caffee was born Aug. 26, 1980, in Santa Fe, N.M., the
youngest child of Patrick Caffee and Donna Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Caffee and Ramirez divorced. Patrick Caffee, a union
electrician, returned to his roots in Seattle. He moved Michael and
his older sister Carleigh to a handsome, turn-of-the-century wood
home on a quiet drive in the Green Lake neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Michael attended Green Lake Elementary School. He was small for
his age but possessed an outsized spirit. He was held back a year
because of his slight frame and what appeared to be a learning
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways he was a typical, bubbly kid. He loved biking and
skateboarding and earned a nickname around the house: ``Crash
Caffee.''
</P>
<P>
   One time he was 15 feet up an apple tree, waving and yelling
like Huck Finn, when the branch snapped. He crashed. Another time,
riding his bike, he took an impossibly sharp turn. He crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael was disappointed to discover there were many Michaels at
his grade school. So he conjured another nickname, drawing on a
shortened version of his middle name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vito'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael got older, his trouble with reading and writing
worsened. He had trouble processing information and ``seeing the
big picture,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Michael did not duck challenges. In the fourth grade, he
was narrator in a school Christmas play and memorized his lines,
his father said.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhood, Michael became known for his smile and
warmth; his good nature masked his increasing frustration with
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth grade, he transferred to Meany Middle School, where
class was a chore. Patrick Caffee decided a change of environment
might help.
</P>
<P>
   So Michael was sent to Albuquerque, where his mother works as a
receptionist in a public defender's office. He stayed in New Mexico
for grades eight and nine. But his grades continued to slip; he
skipped school to hang out with friends. His parents decided to let
him come back to Seattle for the rest of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Michael first went to Ingraham High _ his dad's alma mater _ and
then to Marshall Secondary Alternative School, which offers special
education programs for students with learning difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee said Michael's prospects at Marshall dimmed when
the school imposed stringent, test-based standards.
</P>
<P>
   One friend said Michael did not like some of his teachers at
Marshall and disliked some fellow students, particularly the ones
who were into drugs. Michael transferred to Nathan Hale High School
for the 11th and 12th grades; he is a few credits shy of graduating
with the winter class of 2000, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee said his son was a joy to raise. Sure, there were
times when Michael _ like other kids _ chattered too much in class;
times when Michael got into scrapes and, more often than not, was
on the losing, bruising end.
</P>
<P>
   No worries. Boys being boys.
</P>
<P>
   Michael grew up and filled out a bit _ sprouting to 5 feet 9
inches and 145 pounds _ with blue eyes, brown hair and clean-cut
freshness, straight out of a ``Party of Five'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee said that the only trouble Michael got into with
the law as he grew up was when Seattle police scolded him for a
``capital'' offense _ he wrote his name in big letters in wet
concrete.

   _ Hank Williams
</P>
<P>
   David graduated from high school at 17, then bucked his parents'
wish that he go to college. Instead he joined his older brother,
who had moved to Sacramento to work at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Then David landed a job in San Francisco carrying hod _ a trough
that holds mortar and bricks _ for plasterers. Soon, he met the
only woman who ever really touched his heart. His parents have a
name for her _ The Fatal Woman.
</P>
<P>
   They said David rescued the woman and her two children from an
abusive man who had forced her to work the streets as a prostitute
for drug money.
</P>
<P>
   They dated for about two years. The woman decided to go on a
brief trip to visit her family, returning in two weeks with a
bombshell: During her time away she had aborted a fetus they had
conceived together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just utterly devastated him,'' his mother said. ``He
could not handle it. That was the beginning. ...''
</P>
<P>
   David and the woman broke up, and he never forgave her.
</P>
<P>
   His father urged David not to wallow in grief. Grab life by the
reins, Thomas Ballenger said. If you don't find out what you want
do by age 30, he warned, it'll be too late.
</P>
<P>
   David listened.
</P>
<P>
   He headed to the military, pleasing his dad, who had served in
World War II aboard the USS Terror, a Navy mine-laying vessel.
</P>
<P>
   David chose the Army, figuring it would give him a marketable
trade. He enlisted in early 1977, records show, and was stationed
at Fort Knox, Ky. But David soon developed severe allergic
reactions _ ``constant breaking out in hives,'' one Army report
read.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, 1977, he was honorably discharged as an Army
private. His parents said he was allergic to the wool fabric in
military uniforms, and to grass and weeds; military records also
show David complained about ``nerves;'' his sister said he always
broke out when he became nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Again, David was bitterly disappointed. He briefly returned to
his parents' home in California before embarking on a string of
run-of-the-mill jobs for several years across the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, an employer promised him room, board and good pay.
When David showed up, the employer reneged. ``Gullible. That one
word sums up David,'' his mother said. ``He trusted everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   David briefly dropped off the family radar. He resurfaced at a
veterans rehabilitation center in Pocatello, Idaho, undergoing
treatment for alcoholism. It was the first glaring sign he was
medicating himself with the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, his parents invited him to their new home in
Bay City, a pastoral area of fog-shrouded beaches and green hills
along Oregon's northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballengers' beige and blue mobile home is in dairy country,
a dash away from the Tillamook Cheese Factory. David liked the
place, but trouble would not stay away.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he was stabbed in the hand on a camping
outing. Reports of the incident are sketchy. Patrick Voris, an
ex-convict, was arrested and convicted in Tillamook County for
second-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   David took several entry-level jobs in the area. Tax records
show he logged time with a fish and crab company, and also,
beginning in April 1997, at the Tillamook Country Smoker, which
touts its product as ``Beef Jerky That Won the West!''
</P>
<P>
   After two months, David was let go. Doug Lee, the company's
personnel manager, recalled David suddenly stopped showing up. Lee
said David told people he had gotten another job paying twice as
much.
</P>
<P>
   A month later David returned to the smoker and took a small
quantity of meat. He was charged with second-degree burglary, a
felony, and was sentenced to a short period in jail, plus 18
months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   David's parents dispute the account provided by the smoker
company and court records. They said David had been given the meat
_ about $11 worth, they said _ by a co-worker who had told him it
was too old to sell. When David got in trouble for having the meat
he took the fall because he did not want to get his former
co-worker in trouble, his parents said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Thomas and Marceline Ballenger enjoyed
having David home. A neighbor learned David was living at home and
offered unsolicited advice to his parents: ``I would kick the bum
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ballengers don't have much to say to that neighbor any more.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, David figured it was time to move on. His parents
begged him to stay, but he wanted a change. He wanted to go to the
place he had remembered visiting with his family during the 1962
World's Fair _ a place where people were nice and jobs plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Destination _ Seattle.

GOP'S INTERNAL WARFARE IS MORE IDEOLOGICAL THAN THE DEMOCRATS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internecine warfare early in a presidential
campaign is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the White House aspirants in each party have been
growling at one another so ferociously that they're making even
full-throated Jesse Ventura sound like tiny, soft-spoken Tinker
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Although both parties have intense leadership struggles, the
showdown in the GOP is more deeply ideological than that in the
Democratic Party between Vice President Al Gore and former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican battle is a classic confrontation between the
forces of centrism and those of the right _ a fight that the GOP
has repeated frequently since 1912 when former President Theodore
Roosevelt sought unsuccessfully to become future President Theodore
Roosevelt by wresting the GOP nomination from then President
William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict that pitted internationalist Wendell L. Willkie
against conservatives Robert Taft and Thomas Dewey in 1940;
moderate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower against Taft in 1952;
progressive Nelson Rockefeller against conservative Barry Goldwater
in 1964; conservative Ronald Reagan against Gerald Ford in 1976 and
Reagan against centrist George Bush in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist candidate won the nomination in 1940, 1952 and
1976; the conservative, in 1964 and 1980. (In 1912, after Roosevelt
lost the Republican nod, he bolted the GOP, formed the Progressive
Party and ran as its candidate. He and Taft both lost to Democrat
Woodrow Wilson.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently Republican presidential contender Gary Bauer said in a
CNN interview, ``There is a very brutal battle under way for the
heart and soul of this party.'' Bauer hopes that conservative
fundamentalists, like himself, will prevail over the centrists.
</P>
<P>
   But that's like expecting a community college to rush out onto
the gridiron and defeat Penn State or Florida State. The odds are
that it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Before he quit the campaign, Dan Quayle told a New Hampshire
audience that grass-roots conservatives are extremely concerned
that the GOP is veering away from its right-wing philosophy in its
eagerness to anoint Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the party's
candidate next year.
</P>
<P>
   Urging a debate among Republican contenders over ``ideas,'' the
former vice president suggested that party leaders who are flocking
to Bush are interested only in winning an election and not in
preserving party principles. ``A campaign without ideas,'' said
Quayle, ``is no campaign at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the volatile and controversial Patrick Buchanan has
intensified the turmoil in the Republican Party with some explosive
ideas of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' Buchanan lays
out a shocking and fraudulent revision of recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the isolationist and protectionist xenophobe, Buchanan
asserts that America's participation in World Wars I and II was
totally unnecessary. He contends that the vicious aggression of
Nazi Germany in Europe and Imperial Japan in Asia did not endanger
the national interests of the United States and that therefore
America should have remained neutral.
</P>
<P>
   In his narrow analysis of historical events, he seems unable to
grasp the great truth of the century: America saved western
civilization and preserved its heritage by defeating the evil
German-Japanese-Italian axis in World War II and then by containing
communist expansion with aid to Greece and Turkey, helping Europe
with the Marshall Plan and NATO, and fighting communist North
Korea's invasion of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Those gargantuan achievements could not have been accomplished
by a nation hiding blindly in isolation behind its Atlantic and
Pacific moats.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's outrageous views prompted another GOP presidential
hopeful, Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam prisoner of war, to
declare that the bombastic commentator had severed his ties with
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Quayle and the anticipated leap of
Buchanan to the Reform Party _ if it will have him _ the right-wing
team has been reduced to Bauer, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. The
centrist squad consists of George W. Bush, McCain and Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Before Quayle's withdrawal, New Hampshire Sen. Robert Smith, a
doctrinaire right-winger, and moderate conservatives Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander had
abandoned their quests for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, instead of dwelling on his philosophical differences
with Governor Bush, asserted that the greatest obstacle to his
campaign was the expectation that Bush could raise as much as $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   That is a formidable obstacle for any candidate to hurtle. Only
multimillionaire Forbes has the money to fight Bush
dollar-for-dollar. But McCain, by virtue of his honesty and
independence as well as his experience in the military, may
surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   As Bauer said, the battle now under way is for the heart and
soul of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 the right wing demanded ``a choice, not an echo.'' But
after Goldwater's defeat by Lyndon Johnson that year, the call that
conservatives heard was an echo. Richard Nixon was elected
president in 1968, and he, like his successor Gerald Ford, swam
triumphantly in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as we know from history, the side that wins will not
prevail forever. At best, it will have a tenuous hold on the
party's ideology.

 SEATTLE: Destination _ Seattle.

</P>
<P>
   _ Megadeth
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, friends and co-workers describe Michael Caffee as ``a
good kid.'' They said he is passionate about dirt-bike stunts and
will beg you to watch him perform; he enjoys cooking and took a
culinary class at North Seattle Community College; he's a ready
baby sitter for parents who have to run a quick errand; he doesn't
like to see other people in pain or being dissed.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Denise Watson said her husband asked Michael to look
out for her when she was home sick in bed and her husband was at
work. ``I woke up and saw Vito sitting on my bedroom floor watching
TV,'' she recalled. ``He asked me if I needed anything like juice
from the store.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, he missed the school bus by seconds. So neighbor Erik
Seth volunteered to drive him.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Seth heard footsteps on his porch. He looked
outside and found a thank you note in his mail slot.
</P>
<P>
   A former employer of Michael's marveled over his ``gift'' to
connect with people, young and old. At University House, a
retirement home in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood, Director
Marla Becker said Michael made friends with the elderly residents
he served food to, and occasionally cooked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so natural for him. Not everyone has that ability,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   University House requires background checks of its employees, a
test that Michael passed.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his kitchen duties at the retirement home, Michael served
up unofficial fun: fast wheelchair rides for residents. But he quit
the job this summer because he did not like his hours and wanted to
do more cooking and less cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   The money he earned from his jobs _ he also worked for Spud Fish
and Chips _ went to his passions. He bought a BMX dirt bike that
cost more than $1,000. More recently, he purchased a cutlery set.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is known for his loyalty to friends. Carl Buchanan, who
has known him since grade school, said Michael ``is like a
brother.'' ``He would always be there to lend a helping hand,
support, advice or even the money out of his own pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said sometimes Michael would have words with other
kids at the biker hills at Lower Woodland Park and ``(tick) people
off.'' He recalled some childhood mischief: In grade school he and
Michael shoplifted baseball cards and gum from local stores. ``I
don't know if he got caught,'' Buchanan said. ``I did a couple of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   In middle school, they spent time at each other's homes
listening to rock music, talking about bikes. Recently, Buchanan
said Michael got stopped and cited by police for riding his bike
recklessly downtown; stunt bikers like to jump steps and other
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Michael occasionally cut class in high school
because he was restless and bored. ``I skipped school, too. I get
A's and B's. I'm not a bad person,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family say Michael is pals with Shelton Musgrave,
less so with Jay Stewart. Patrick Caffee said if Michael and
Shelton were at a party and drank alcohol, they would check on each
other to make sure the other person was OK.
</P>
<P>
   The boys know some of the local homeless men. It is as though
they are all part of an extended family linked by proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Pennyman always asks for spare change. Tobias Atara, a former
University of Washington engineering student, discusses
international politics when he is not holding a cardboard sign that
says ``Anything will help, Thank God for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was David _ known in the Green Lake area by the
nickname ``One Man'' because he often said ``everybody should be as
one, man!''
</P>
<P>
   Michael thought David was ``nice,'' his father says.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee stands in his yard, filled with wood sculptures,
including a Komodo dragon that he says chipmunks keep stealing the
legs from. He tugs on his graying hair, pulled into a pony-tail,
exposing a weathered face.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to connect the dots. Figure it out. ``I didn't see it
coming,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he wanted to give Michael, on the cusp of
adulthood, more freedom. Now, he cannot believe how Michael went
from putting his name in wet concrete to being accused of murder.

   _ Hank Williams
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, David Ballenger's downward spiral accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998 he and another man, Bobby Ray Hansbrough,
approached Robert Hunt, who was sitting on a toilet in a bathroom
stall at Woodland Park.
</P>
<P>
   One of them told Hunt: ``Drop your money, bitch. We are going to
rob you,'' according to a police report. Hunt, rattled, kept
looking at Hansbrough. David told him to stop staring ``at his
brother'' _ or else. Hansbrough hit Hunt in the head with his fist.
Hunt handed over his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants took four $20 bills, threw the wallet back at
Hunt and fled. A short time later, they were arrested. Officers
found a glass cocaine pipe with residue that tested positive for
cocaine. ``(David) attempted to conceal it by hiding the pipe in
the patrol car'' on the way to the station, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998 David entered an Alford plea to second-degree
robbery in the case _ he did not admit guilt but agreed there was
the likelihood of being found guilty if the case had gone to trial.
He was sentenced to nine months in jail, given credit for 95 days
served and told to pay restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Court records suggest David was making poor choices in company.
Hansbrough _ the man he called ``his brother'' during the attack on
Hunt _ had assaulted police in Florida in 1992 and had prior
convictions for robbery and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   After David's sentence ended in Washington in January 1999, he
was extradited to Oregon, where there was a warrant for his arrest
for a probation violation. He served nearly three months in
Tillamook County Jail, gained more than 30 pounds on jail food and
ballooned to 165 pounds _ the biggest his folks had ever seen him.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, David's mother had heart valve and arterial
bypass surgery. The day of the operation David called the hospital
several times from jail to check on her.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, he went back to Bay City to help her
convalesce, arriving a week before Mother's Day. He brought a gift
_ a handsome sketch of hearts and flowers, a makeshift card he drew
on an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   David stayed with his parents until the day after Mother's Day.
Then he returned to Seattle _ and more problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Tyree, a chemical dependency counselor with South King
County Recovery Services, saw David several times in the past year,
including just before his death.
</P>
<P>
   In early summer, Tyree picked David up in a van and took him to
a detox center in Kent, south of Seattle. When the van reached the
center's parking lot, David apparently reached through the rear
window, unlatched the locked door from the outside and bolted.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tyree said, he drove David to Seattle's Harborview
Medical Center because David had expressed a desire to be committed
for psychiatric evaluation; Tyree could not commit him, but he
offered to drive David to the hospital's emergency room. It is
unclear whether David was admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he drank alcohol he could be real mean, real vulgar,''
Tyree said. ``Without the alcohol he mellowed out. He liked to
read.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 13 David went to the Downtown Emergency Service Center
in Seattle, records show. He filled out a registration card and was
photographed for a laminated ID card. His beard was full, hair
long; he looked tired and haggard.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, the day after his 46th _ and final _ birthday, he
called his parents in Oregon. Marceline Ballenger said her son
sounded happy. He did not complain about being broke or homeless.
He phoned _ as he often did _ to say I love you.
</P>
<P>
   The call came collect from a Seattle bar.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Marceline Ballenger saw David, he was on a table
at the office of the King County Medical Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   She screamed: ``My baby! What have they done to my baby?''

   _ Hank Williams
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 9 was a typically pleasant summer day in Green Lake. Kids
rode bikes, rollerbladers cruised sidewalks, swimmers splashed at a
local community center. Trouble was nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The following account of the afternoon and evening is drawn from
statements from Michael to his father, and on statements police
gathered from Michael, Jay, Shelton and others:
</P>
<P>
   Michael says he was riding his dirt bike near the Green Lake
Park bleachers in the late afternoon when he ran into a small group
of people that included Shelton, Jay and David.
</P>
<P>
   Michael needed to talk to Shelton about a problem: Earlier in
the day, Michael had been stopped by police and cited for driving
with no license and no insurance. He was driving Shelton's father's
car when he was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Michael told his father that Shelton, Jay and another friend
said they had been drinking at Jay's house.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Shelton stepped away from the group to talk, Michael
says, and as they did they could hear the start of a dispute
between David and the others. Jay and the others were harassing
David about being homeless. A witness said Jay told David that as a
veteran, he should have more pride.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, Michael said, David walked away, but one
onlooker was concerned by the potential for violence in the
dispute, and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the teenagers ran into David again near the
Albertson's grocery store, where the dispute resumed. Again, David
left, walking toward his camp.
</P>
<P>
   According to law-enforcement sources, another 911 call came, and
Seattle police went to the scene. They stopped Michael, Shelton and
Jay a few blocks away from the store, and asked the teens to show
their knuckles _ apparently to look for evidence of a fight _ but
found nothing and let them go.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said Jay became enraged because he thought David had
called the police. Jay wanted to find David again, Michael said.
Michael says he tried to divert the others from David. Prosecutors
cast doubt on that claim. In any event, the teenagers ended up at
David's camp, near the east side of the Ravenna I-5 overpass.
</P>
<P>
   There, Michael says, Jay and Shelton attacked David, hitting and
kicking him, and Jay choked him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael says Jay then asked him for the 4-inch knife he was
carrying. He says he gave it to Jay, and watched in horror as Jay
stabbed David several times, then handed the knife to Shelton, who
also stabbed David repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said that when it was over, Jay gave the knife back to
him, and he dumped it down a storm drain.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton denied having anything to do with stabbing David,
telling police he had only handed the knife to Jay.
</P>
<P>
   Jay admitted he attacked David, choking him into
unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay said Michael did the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said Jay was worried about leaving his ``DNA'' on the
body. He and Shelton pulled off David's sweater, placed it on top
of David's bedding and set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing, the three young men reacted in different
ways:
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Shelton went home and slept next to his father.
They said Jay Stewart, who sports a tattoo of the Grim Reaper on
his left shoulder, bragged to a friend about killing ``the bum,''
and said he intended to blame Shelton and Michael for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Michael called his dad, saying, ``Something terrible has
happened.'' The next morning, Michael flagged down street workers,
who called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found David, and interviewed Michael. At first, he
denied seeing David stabbed. Later, he admitted he had been there
and showed police the storm drain, where they recovered a knife.
</P>
<P>
   After learning David was killed, his mother looked to the sky
and saw a cross in the clouds _ a sign from David, she says. His
brother Daniel went to a fencepost near Sacramento where he and
David had left a small treasure a decade ago _ a coin on top of a
post with a rock over it. The rock and coin were still there. His
sister, Diane Jones, pulled out film footage that her family had
taken of the World's Fair visit. She wanted to see her brother's
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Ballenger and Caffee families have made
pilgrimages to the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Marceline Ballenger sat down in the blood-soaked patch of earth
by the overpass, hoping to get closer to her son. She picked up a
beer cap from the grass that she thought David might have touched.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee, too, has walked the embankment _ one of the
hardest walks of his life. He trudged through weeds. He stared and
stared. He would only find some measure of solace by going to a
public memorial service for David at St. James Cathedral. One of
more than 60 people to attend, he prayed for Michael _ and for
David.
</P>
<P>
   When the church arranged the memorial service, they knew little
about David's recent life _ and nothing about his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have invited his family,'' said Jerry Connors, a
pastoral assistant at St. James, ``if only we knew he had any.''

</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee believes his son was horrified by the stabbing
and perhaps feared that Jay would attack him or Shelton, too.
</P>
<P>
   His son ``got stuck on stupid,'' Patrick Caffee says. ``He's 19
going on 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said that after his son's arrest Michael wondered if
what happened would mess up Shelton's chance of being in the
National Guard. ``Still looking out for his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Caffee said he may have failed his son by not hiring a
tutor to deal with his son's learning problems more aggressively.
``I should have paid a lot of money for a private teacher. Now, I'm
paying for a lawyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Ballengers have no easy answers to explain
David's descent. Thomas believes David got sucked into the
free-for-all attitude of the hippie era _ and never pulled out. In
hindsight, Marceline says drinking _ coupled with bad luck and poor
choices _ played a role in his tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   ``David started getting into trouble from high school,'' says
his sister Diane, 36. ``My mother may not have known, but he was
hanging with the wrong people. I knew that even though I was 10
years younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane said her brother and his peers were experimenting with
drugs and alcohol. She said her parents _ loving and devoted as
they were _ were blind to what was happening at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did drugs in high school. But I got smart. At 19 I stopped.
At 20 I got married,'' Diane said. ``Many kids experience this and
at one point have to decide whether to take a right turn or a wrong
turn. I think David took a wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his girlfriend had had that baby maybe he would have gotten
his life in order. Or if he stayed in the Army ...'' Her voice
trails off. ``You know, any one of those could have been the
turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ballenger said: ``Whatever happened, David did not
deserve to be hunted down and killed like an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ballengers will scatter David's ashes in the woods near
Vancouver, Wash., this weekend.

parents.
</P>
<P>
   Two families mourning over ruined lives, lives intertwined
suddenly and forever. ``One Man'' and ``Crash Caffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Jones has found a place of reluctant forgiveness in her
heart for Michael, who came forward and told police where the knife
was. She thinks maybe he should get a slight measure of leniency
because if it hadn't been for him, she says, police may never have
gotten a break in the case. David could have been just ``another
dead homeless guy _ some statistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Flemming, senior deputy prosecutor for King County, is
handling the murder case. She said Michael's cooperation will be
taken into consideration, but pointed out flatly: ``He's an
accomplice to murder. He admitted providing the knife and disposing
of the knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemming added: ``He lied to police about what happened. He
didn't admit at first that he was present at the time of the murder
_ only later, when he had been placed under arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   In jail, Michael, who brushes his braces with a finger-sized
toothbrush, is being treated as a suicide risk.

<P>
   One recent afternoon, Marceline Ballenger held up a picture of
her son. In it, he is full grown, with stylish sideburns, chiseled
cheekbones and a prominent nose _ evidence of the Native American
features he inherited from his paternal grandmother, who was
three-quarters Cherokee. He was the only child blessed with those
features.
</P>
<P>
   His mother recalls the day she came to Seattle to identify his
body. His sharp nose was smashed flat and pushed to the left. White
sheets were bundled around his neck covering the knife wounds.

</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her living room as sunlight filters in, she grips the
picture tighter. Something catches her eye: writing on the back of
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Marceline and Thomas Ballenger never noticed it before.
</P>
<P>
   The words are dated almost 15 years ago. Christmas Day, 1985. A
final gift from David _ homeless, not loveless.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ballenger reads through tears:
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) ``I live by the name, I will always be proud to be a
Ballenger. Thanks for being the best parents anyone could ever
have. I always will be your loving son, one good, one bad. But I'm
proud to be always a son who will never put you down. I'm no one's
fool. I will stop by saying you can always count on me to be there
for you both, like you to me. All my love, David.'' (End italics)

years, Sonia for 2. She is the widow of Sanjay, the anointed son
who was a natural wielder of power and his mother's right-hand man.

USING PRESSURE-TREATED LUMBER 
</HEADLINE>

(JT) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week this column focused on pressure-treated lumber _ how
it is made, the chemicals used and the possible hazards to humans
and the environment. The relative merits and risks of
pressure-treated lumber are the subjects of much debate. It is up
to the individual do-it-yourselfer to decide whether to use it
around the home.
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to use pressure-treated lumber for a project,
it is important to choose the boards carefully, observe all safety
precautions and wear safety gear.
</P>
<P>
   First, choose a lumberyard that will let you take the time to
look through the lumber pile for the best boards. Wear gloves when
handling the lumber, and look for pieces with the fewest number of
splits, wanes and knots. Look carefully at the surface of the
boards; they should be free of any crystalline chemical residue.
</P>
<P>
   Try to choose dry lumber. If you build with wet lumber, it will
shrink and warp when it dries and distort your project.
</P>
<P>
   Each board should have a treaters' tag on one end. The tag will
tell you which company treated the lumber, the year of treatment
and also the agency that performed the quality inspection. More
important, an abbreviation on the tag will tell you what chemical
was used in the treatment. The initials CCA indicate chromated
copper arsenate, ACZA stands for ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate,
and ACQ means alkaline copper quat.
</P>
<P>
   The label will tell if the wood was kiln-dried after treatment
(KDAT), or air-dried (Dry). These designations certify that wood
has a moisture content of only 19 percent, which is much less than
lumber that has been shipped to the supplier immediately after
treatment. Of course, the dried wood will be more expensive, but it
will be less likely to warp.
</P>
<P>
   Not all pressure-treated lumber has the same chemical content.
The amount of preservative that remains in the wood fibers after
treatment is called the preservative retention level (PRL), and is
indicated by numbers ranging from 0.25 to 2.5. The number 0.25
means that the wood can be used for above-ground use in sills,
railings or joists. A rating of 0.40 means the wood is acceptable
for ground or freshwater contact and can be used for posts and
landscape timbers. A rating of 0.60 means the wood can be used for
structural poles in wood foundations next to saltwater. Wood that
has a .80 rating can be used as foundation piles immersed in
freshwater. Finally the highest PRL rating of 2.5 means the timber
can be used as pilings immersed in saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   You can saw and sand pressure-treated lumber with ordinary hand
or power tools, but always wear a dust mask and goggles to protect
your eyes. Even though the chemicals are forced into the wood, they
do not penetrate to the core if the boards are more than
three-inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   This means that if you cut a thick board, you will be exposing
wood that is unprotected by the chemical preservative. Therefore
you apply a preservative to these cut ends if they will be exposed
to the elements. Some suppliers offer a sealer called ''endcoat
preservative.'' It contains copper naphthenate and can be brushed
on to the board ends.
</P>
<P>
   Nails and screws designed for pressure-treated lumber are
available at home centers, but you can use any exterior-grade nail
or screw that is either galvanized or made of stainless steel. Do
not use aluminum fasteners because this metal may react with the
chemical in the wood. You can also use construction adhesive for
joining, provided it is labeled by the manufacturer as for use on
pressure-treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Another misconception people have concerning pressure-treated
lumber is that it is maintenance-free and can be left exposed to
the elements without any finish. This is not entirely true, and the
unfinished wood will still absorb water. When this happens it will
expand, warp and possibly crack.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of paints and clear finishes compatible with
pressure-treated lumber. In general, oil-based paint will adhere
better than latex. The wood must be thoroughly dry before you
attempt to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   After working with pressure-treated lumber, be sure to wash all
exposed body areas carefully. Also wash your working clothes
separate from other laundry.

SEARCHING FOR LESS, NOT MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine New York's Greenwich Village with millions of jumbled
streets, add Tokyo's chaotic street numbering system, have it grow
faster than Las Vegas, with a million new addresses a day, add all
the languages of the United Nations, and make sure that every map
is hopelessly outdated. That is today's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder search engines are so important. And fortunately, some
intriguing new choices have turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently my favorite search engines were Hotbot
(www.hotbot.com) and Alta Vista (www.altavista.com). Hotbot is
useful for finding popular Web sites, and Alta Vista is good at
ferreting out obscure information. Alta Vista in particular returns
a bazillion potential hits when it is asked to scour the Net for a
word or phrase.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger the World Wide Web becomes, the more important it
becomes for search engines to return fewer results, not more. Few
people have time to click through 70,482 query matches hoping that
the one they want, the most relevant one, is in there somewhere.
The engines not only have to be smarter, but also faster.
</P>
<P>
   Several search engines introduced recently deserve serious
consideration, including the revamped version of MSN.com Search,
introduced by the Microsoft Network last week, and AOL.com Search,
to be introduced by America Online next week. But if you are
searching for the next generation in search technologies, look for
Gurunet and Google.
</P>
<P>
   Gurunet (www.gurunet.com) is a remarkable but still unfinished
instant information utility. It is not a classic search engine, but
rather the best implementation yet of the ``information at your
fingertips'' promise.
</P>
<P>
   Gurunet lets an Internet user click on any word in any on-screen
document _ in Web pages, e-mail messages, word processing
documents, product catalogs, even chat transcripts _ and instantly
call up a variety of relevant information.
</P>
<P>
   Gurunet is free Windows software that is available for
downloading from the Web site. It is relatively compact, only 700
kilobytes. Once loaded, it resides quietly in the Windows system
tray until needed. It works only when the user has an open
connection to the Internet, so it is most useful to people who are
connected through an office network, a cable modem or high-speed
digital phone line and conversely, it can be a pain for people who
connect to the Net with dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurunet software is activated by holding down the Alt key
and clicking on any word, which opens a new browser window
containing a dictionary definition of the word. To the left of the
definition are choices that include, depending on the context, a
dictionary definition, an encyclopedia entry, a list of hyperlinks
to relevant Web sites, a business profile or biography, a stock
quote or other useful factoids and infonuggets. In most cases,
there is no need to type search commands.
</P>
<P>
   Gurunet is able to search in context. For example, clicking on
the word ``Clinton'' in a sentence that mentions Hillary Rodham
Clinton calls up a biographical mention of the first lady, not her
husband, Bill, nor George Clinton of the P-Funk All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It scans a half-dozen words on either side of the highlighted
word for clues to the context, and, more often than not, it hits
the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on ``AT&AMP;T'' in an e-mail message calls up a company
profile; its stock ticker symbol, stock chart and current stock
price, and a selection of recent news headlines pointing to news
stories mentioning AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Gurunet is still a work in progress, and many, if not most, of
its links are bare. Its success will depends on the addition of
information databases, which could include more reference works,
E-commerce partners, product catalogs, news services and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reference works are outdated or incomplete. Using
Gurunet to click on ``Caruso'' in a newspaper story about Carnegie
Hall, for example, inexplicably brings up information not about the
famous Italian tenor, but about the current shortstop for the
Chicago White Sox. Score that one as an error.
</P>
<P>
   But Gurunet has the potential to transform the way electronic
documents are used. Someday, for example, clicking on ``village,''
may bring up a map of Greenwich Village, a weather report, a roster
of top-rated restaurants, movie listings, and a selection of
current shopping specials. Even the best of the conventional search
engines would get lost trying to do all that.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gurunet search found no matches for ``Hotbot'' or
``Google,'' although it did correctly find ``googol,'' the number
represented as the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   A googol is a big number, but a Google is an impressive search
engine that returns a small number of responses from a big number
of pages.
</P>
<P>
   Google (www.google.com) is not new, having made its public debut
last week after a year of trials. But it is very fast and uses
clever intuitive techniques to rank search results by relevancy.
</P>
<P>
   Search for ``Bill Clinton,'' for example, and Google returns a
handful of entries starting with the home page of the White House.
Search for ``sex,'' and Google once again returns a list starting
with the home page of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   What Google does do, however, is bring back a list that starts
with a guide to marriage and sex, not the long string of
pornographic sites that would pop up in the search listings of most
other engines. Many disreputable Web site operators attempt to fool
search engines by salting their pages with bogus key words in an
attempt to lure unsuspecting users. Google does not go ogle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Google determines the relevance or importance of a page
in part by measuring how many other sites have links to it. This
technique enables Google to rank even those sites that it has not
visited. Many Web sites do not allow search engines to catalog
their content, but they may hold the information a searcher wants.
</P>
<P>
   Google then takes into account the importance, measured in
popularity, of the sites that are linking to the page. Links from
popular sites are given more weight than links from obscure sites.
If a lot of important sites establish links with the page, the
reasoning goes, it must be important too. It is the cyber-age
variant on the common wisdom that the best roadside diners are the
ones with all the big trucks parked outside.
</P>
<P>
   Google is so good at finding relevant sites that it even offers
an ``I'm Feeling Lucky'' button that does not even bother to return
a list of search results; it deposits the user directly onto the
site with the highest relevancy ranking.
</P>
<P>
   All this focus on relevancy does not mean that size, the
traditional measure of search engine prowess, no longer matters,
said Danny Sullivan, editor of Searchenginewatch.com, a Web site
published in Shrewton, England.
</P>
<P>
   With several hundred million Web pages out there, it can be
useful to employ a search engine that covers as much virtual ground
as possible. ``Especially if you are looking for information about
obscure or unusual diseases, for example, it can be helpful to get
back 30 or 40 different results.'' Sullivan said. ``But for more
popular sites, size does not matter.''

FOR INTERNET DATING SITE, A STEAMY SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Bergin, the creator of an online matchmaking service,
recently used the Alta Vista search engine to determine how easy it
was to find her Web site, singleswithscruples.com. After typing
``singles with scruples'' into the search box, Ms. Bergin was glad
to see her site come up first on the list of results.
</P>
<P>
   But when she scrolled down the list, Ms. Bergin noticed that one
of the other results posted appeared to be a repeat listing of her
site. The title line, ``Singles with Scruples Dating, Friendship
and Matchmaker Services,'' as well as the descriptive sentence
beneath it, were word-for-word identical. Only the Internet address
was different.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Bergin clicked on the listing and saw what looked to be
an online dating site called Net Encounters, she grew more and more
annoyed that someone had used her domain name to attract Web
surfers to another dating site. But when she clicked on the site's
``Links'' icon and saw links to pornographic photos, she was
horrified. ``It was a pornography site disguised as a dating site,
and anyone looking for my site with a search engine could have come
across it,'' Ms. Bergin said. ``Needless to say, I was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergin's experience is similar in many ways to those of
other Web site owners affected by a large-scale fraud, described by
the Federal Trade Commission last week, involving a Portuguese
hacker and an Australian pornography company. In both cases,
so-called metatags _ key words and other indexing code _ were
cloned from other Web sites and used to direct Web surfers to
pornographic material.
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving the Portuguese hacker, the trade
commission said that up to 25 million Web pages may have been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of two other online dating services, www.lovecity.com
and togethernj.com, reported seeing cloned descriptions of their
sites attached to the Net Encounters site during searches conducted
on Alta Vista. In all three instances, the unsuspecting visitor to
Net Encounters is led to believe it is a dating site, and is asked
to submit personal information under the guise of submitting a free
personal ad, which the hacker can use for future solicitation. The
registered owner of the Net Encounters site is in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem for us and it leaves a bad taste for anyone
who deals with it,'' said Rob Piccola, president of Love City.
``We've built up a brand awareness over the past four years, but
now we have customers asking us if we're running pornography
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case described last week, a federal judge ordered many of
the sites run by the Australian company and the hacker off the Web,
and Australian authorities said they were considering civil or
criminal charges against the company. The hacker cannot be located.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of legitimate Web sites who want to take action
themselves can sue under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which
prohibits unfair or deceptive practices involving commerce. ``The
FTC Act gives us a broad authority to make sure these
advertisements aren't misleading,'' said Dean Forbes, a staff
attorney at the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But like Ms. Bergin, whose business generates no income as of
yet, many site owners don't have the money to enter a protracted
legal battle. Ms. Bergin said she contacted Alta Vista and asked
the company to remove the Net Encounters listing, but that it still
appears when she searches for her site.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a small business, it's a pain in the neck that's not easily
disposed of,'' said Marc Brown, a lawyer who sent a letter to the
registered owner of the Web address for Net Encounters on Ms.
Bergin's behalf. Brown added that when the cloning involves a
hacker in another country, the challenge of enforcing FTC
regulations is greatly compounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a case where private enforcement by lawsuits
will not work as well as public enforcement by the government, or
in some cases, two governments working together,'' said Tim
Stanley, chief executive of Findlaw.com, a legal site based in
Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives at Network Solutions, the leading Internet
domain registry, as well as at Alta Vista, say they have limited
ability to oversee the conduct of Web site owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly a balancing act between the majority of people who
are honest and who want to get on the Internet fast, and waiting
for the FTC to produce regulations that will protect domain names
and content,'' said Nancy Huddleston, a spokeswoman for Network
Solutions, which receives close to 13,000 domain name applications
per day. ``As the Internet grows, the problem will grow
proportionately with it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Emanuel, a spokesman for Alta Vista, said that the first
recourse for the owner of a purloined site should be to contact the
apparent perpetrator directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the search engines in a difficult position, because we
can't legislate,'' he said. ``We add 600,000 site submissions a
week, and as people become more crafty and learn how to do it, it's
very difficult for us to weed this type of infringement out.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel said the company does have an active team dedicated to
spotting clones, and that it is working on a proprietary technology
that recognizes multiple key words in order to weed out duplicate
pages.

TOGETHER ON SCREEN WITH THE STAR HE WAS LONG AGO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for LIMEY-FILMS)  
 (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ At the age of 60, white-haired and soft-spoken, Terence
Stamp has evidently come to terms with that other Terence Stamp who
became an overnight star in Peter Ustinov's 1962 movie version of
``Billy Budd,'' that high-living younger self who was a fixture in
English tabloids as an icon of the Swinging '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But he still can't help wondering why, when the 1970s arrived,
he vanished from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a hit, which I now know is what separates the men
from the boys,'' he said, sipping tea in the relative anonymity of
the fourth-floor restaurant at Fortnum &AMP; Mason on Piccadilly. ``I
had all these critical successes, but none for the mass market. I
think perhaps I was so heavily identified with the 1960s that, when
they ended, something happened. I often say the work stopped. It
didn't actually stop, but all the good stuff dried up.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to be patient and drew inspiration from Muhammed
Ali, who, when banned from boxing, stayed in fighting trim for a
triumphant return. In Stamp's case, he spent much of the 1970s in
an ashram in India. And when directors began calling again, he,
too, was ready. Starting with ``Superman,'' his second movie career
has included ``The Hit,'' ``Legal Eagles,'' ``Wall Street'' ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' and, most recently,
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Steven Soderbergh's new movie, ``The Limey,'' which
opens in New York on Friday, the young and the old Terence Stamps
have been brought together in a novel way. ``The Limey,'' which is
slang for a Briton, has Stamp playing Dave Wilson, a tough Cockney
ex-con who travels to Los Angeles to avenge what he believes is the
covered-up murder of his daughter, Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   But Soderbergh's clever twist is to weave in clips of a
boyish-looking Stamp playing Wilson as a young jewel thief more
than 30 years ago in Ken Loach's first feature film, ``Poor Cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The flashbacks provide the key to the new movie's denouement,
but they also show the young Wilson as he sets out on a life of
crime and explain why, after his latest long stretch in jail, he
feels driven to learn the truth about his daughter's death. Helped
by her Mexican friend, Ed (Luis Guzman), Wilson discovers that
Jennifer was involved with Terry Valentine, a record producer with
shady friends, played by Peter Fonda as an aging lothario with
nostalgia for the '60s (no, there are no clips from ``Easy
Rider''). And once Wilson concludes that Valentine had a hand in
Jennifer's death, the chase begins.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, then, it was his younger self that secured Stamp
perhaps his most important part in years, although in fairness,
Soderbergh and his screenwriter, Lem Dobbs, had already mentioned
him among the few actors who could play the lead role in ``The
Limey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I said it would be great to incorporate some earlier
footage, Lem said, `Then it's definitely got to be Terence Stamp,
because he was in this Ken Loach film where he actually plays a
thief,''' Soderbergh said in a telephone interview. ``We didn't
immediately write `Poor Cow' into the script, because we weren't
sure we could get the rights. But I felt he was still the right
person, so we were working on a shooting script designed for him
before he knew we were doing it. When we put it to him, he was very
intrigued by the idea, so we were off and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamp says he remembers less about his character in ``Poor Cow''
than about what he called the ``unnerving experience'' of
improvising in front of two cameras, with no script and little
guidance. But ``to pull the character from the earlier
performance,'' as he put it, his own upbringing in a working-class
family in the East End of London came in handy. In his youth, Stamp
had known many future Dave Wilsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There but for the grace of God,'' he reflected. ``There were
guys in gangs near me who became lifers, who spent years in
solitary, who were something else when they came out, so that was
what I worked on. That guy wouldn't have aged the way I had aged.
He had spent over half his life in prison. The general feeling is
that prison either breaks you or makes you. Dave Wilson was like a
Zen monk, honed year in year out, in this cell, with all this
brutality. How has he survived, how has he risen above it?''
</P>
<P>
   For the role, Stamp adopts a strong Cockney accent peppered with
Cockney rhyming slang, which was easy for him since his own East
End roots can still be heard in his accent. That he does not sound
Shakespearean is, in fact, also a product of the '60s. At a time
when everything in Britain, from ``kitchen sink'' drama to the
Beatles, used regional accents, it was suddenly possible to be an
actor without sounding like Sir John Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the young Terence Stamp, who left school at 16, the
idea of acting at first seemed as distant as his screen heroes,
Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Errol Flynn and Leslie Howard. Until he
saw James Dean in Elia Kazan's ``East of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Dean, I felt empathy,'' he said. ``I thought, I
feel like that guy. And he's up there doing it. And that was the
first time I thought that maybe this is something I should have a
go at. This was the spark. Soon I was thinking, `If I don't attempt
this, I will miss my whole life.'''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Tom, a Thames tugboat pilot, discouraged him,
telling him, ``Son, people like us don't do things like that.'' So
he left home, won a scholarship to a small London drama school,
supplemented his income working backstage in a London production of
``West Side Story'' and eventually found work in regional repertory
theater. But he was luckier than most. One day, his agent arranged
for him to meet Peter Ustinov, who was trying to cast the title
role in ``Billy Budd.'' Overwhelmed by Ustinov's presence, Stamp
was barely able to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, I thought, `I've blown that,''' he remembered
with a smile. ``He must think I'm a congenital idiot. But this was
my luck. He had seen the best actors, but he hadn't seen the
inability that Billy suffers from when he is confronted by
something he doesn't understand: he loses his power of speech.
Later, when I did a test, Ustinov said, `I'm going to insult you
and you try not to speak.' I was the only actor who didn't give in
to the temptation of screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Stamp's angelic appearance as much as his
performance served him well. In quick succession through the '60s,
he worked with William Wyler in ``The Collector,'' Joseph Losey in
``Modesty Blaise,'' John Schlesinger in ``Far From the Madding
Crowd,'' Loach in ``Poor Cow,'' Federico Fellini in ``Histoires
Extraordinaires'' (``Spirits of the Dead/Tales of Mystery'') and
Pier Paolo Pasolini in ``Teorema.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the steam ran out. His outing to Hollywood, in Silvio
Narizzano's Western, ``Blue,'' was disastrous, while his next
American movie, Alan Cooke's ``Mind of Soames,'' was not even
released. Soon the calls stopped coming. And to make matters worse,
his love affair with Jean Shrimpton, (italics)the(end italics)
model of the '60s, ended badly and left him broken-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   An escape route then appeared. While working with Fellini in
Rome, Stamp met an astrologer who introduced him to an Indian guru,
Krishnamurti. Now, with no work and no girlfriend, he headed to
India and settled in an ashram near Poona. When the call to work
finally came in 1978, he was ready to start his career afresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terence is one of those people who was absolutely content to
let his life lead him where it would and not worry about it,''
Soderbergh said. ``You get no sense of anxiety from him, no sense
of impatience, no sense of regret. And I don't think you ever did.
He's not the sort of guy who would sit around complaining about
life.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor no doubt helps. Even after his acclaimed
performance as a flamboyant Australian drag queen in ``Priscilla,''
he noted, ``the only part I was offered was a guest role as a
transsexual on the TV series `E.R.''' No wonder, then, that he was
delighted to play Dave Wilson in ``The Limey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Steven that I really, really, really wanted the part,''
he recalled. ``And he said, `I don't know any other actor who wants
to be up there with himself 35 years ago.' It hadn't even entered
my head.''

MAPMAKERS STRETCH THE DEFINITION OF CARTOGRAPHY TO HELP VISUALIZE
THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 Attn: Calif., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mapping of that vast territory known as cyberspace has begun
in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace maps are being produced by geographers,
cartographers, artists and computer scientists. They range from
glorious depictions of globe-spanning communications networks to
maps of Web information.
</P>
<P>
   Many have no geographic references, instead turning to nature,
the cosmos or neuroscience for spatial models. They stretch the
definition of a map in their effort to capture, sometimes
fancifully, what is sometimes referred to as the ``common mental
geography'' that lies beyond computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   The maps hold the potential to change, subtly or perhaps more
directly, the relationship of the average person to cyberspace, the
world of electronic communication that includes but is not limited
to the Internet. How people envision the online landscape
influences their behavior there, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need maps not just to navigate but to define and control
new territory,'' said Martin Dodge, a researcher in the Center for
Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. ``Simply
having a map allows a new perspective, a new way to orient
yourself. Relationships otherwise obscure may be revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest collection of maps can be found at Dodge's Web site,
An Atlas of Cyberspaces (cybergeography.com). The dozens of
examples there include many that arise from science and
instrumentation, while others are more products of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the very early stage of map making _ these maps are
far from perfect at the moment,'' Dodge said. ``Most have been
produced outside traditional cartography by people such as data
visualization researchers who may not even call their results a
map.''
</P>
<P>
   Maps of cyberspace fall into two categories: those depicting the
physical structure and information traffic patterns of global
networks, and those addressing the content and social spaces of the
electronic world.
</P>
<P>
   Structural maps, although seemingly straightforward, have proved
quite thorny to create. Since the National Science Foundation
relinquished its stewardship of the Internet in 1995, there has
been no central source of information about the Net's backbone
networks and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is a jumble of networks owned by phone companies
and Internet service providers, some of which do not share
information, for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis, or
CAIDA, at the University of California at San Diego develops tools
to collect and analyze data about the Net, like the specific paths
a test packet of information may follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not at a point yet where we are drawing maps with any
compelling utility for any particular community,'' said K.C.
Claffy, a researcher with the association, via e-mail. ``Though at
the same time I contend we are doing `state of the art' stuff at
the frontier of this field; I just think the field's pretty young
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Useful or not, the Internet analysis group's maps can be quite
beautiful. Some look like pointillist paintings. Others have
brightly colored grids and globe-spanning arches, suggesting a
world that is deeply, even inescapably, interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Connectivity, not necessarily geography or distance, is the
primary parameter of a cyberspace map, said Gregory C. Staple,
president of Telegeography, a company in Washington that provides
statistics and maps of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   His company has produced maps of ``telecontinents,'' redrawing
countries and coastlines to show how the flow of communications has
created a new economic geography. At a glance, these maps reveal
areas that are the telecommunications haves and have-nots, which
Staple calls ``the deep-water ports and teledeserts'' of the
information age (there are many more deserts than ports).
Telegeography also offers maps of the Internet through its Peacock
Maps subsidiary (peacockmaps.com).
</P>
<P>
   Geography is completely shunned by some mappers, like William
Cheswick, a researcher at Lucent Technologies' Bell Laboratories.
``I want to take the Net on its own terms _ it's its own space,''
Cheswick argued. ``Geographical maps I've seen have not worked very
well. They're very blobby.''
</P>
<P>
   His maps, like those from the Cooperative Association for
Internet Data Analysis, are based on information probes sent to
tens of thousands of destinations on the Net. Maps resulting from
such probes are featured on his Web site
(www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/ches/map/index.html). They look something
like promiscuously propagating sea ferns, with countless feathery
vines.
</P>
<P>
   Are they useful? Although his maps may inspire awe because of
their complexity, Cheswick explains that until such maps are
interactive, allowing access to the database that created them,
they are more powerful as symbols, perhaps, than as maps.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most so-called content maps are interactive and are focused on
the portion of cyberspace now most populated: the Web. They are,
Staple said, ``the equivalent of land-use maps in the traditional
cartographic world.''
</P>
<P>
   A new site called Newsmaps.com (newsmaps.com) creates ``visual
information landscapes'' _ grid-based topographical maps _ of
Web-based news articles and online discussion groups on topics like
fears of year 2000 computer problems. Peaks appear on the map where
there is a high concentration of documents or messages about the
same topic. The distance between peaks shows how topics are
related.
</P>
<P>
   In a different approach, the artificial intelligence laboratory
in the management information systems department at the University
of Arizona at Tucson (ai.bpa.arizona.edu/start.html) drew a map of
more than 100,000 entertainment Web sites pulled from Yahoo's
database using an automatic-indexing system.
</P>
<P>
   The map looks something like a jigsaw puzzle with colored
pieces. Users can select categories like movies or comics, or terms
like ``love'' or ``beer,'' and the map will adjust, ``shifting down
a layer'' until a customized map listing specific sites is reached,
explained Dr. Hsinchun Chen, head of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Boot doesn't deal in math-based systems. Boot, a
self-described ``telemedia'' artist who teaches film, video and
computer art to high school students in Baltimore County, Md.,
recently created what he calls a Web Map About Teen-Agers'
Happiness (www.bcpl.net/lboot/webmap2). ``Mapping and diagramming
is basic to the kind of art that I do,'' Boot said. ``My map is
crafted rather than automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The map itself suggests doodles from a brainstorming session.
Words of different sizes and colors are arranged within seemingly
penciled circles, and lines indicate relationships between the
terms. A click on a word (say, ``drugs'') takes you to a site Boot
has chosen on his theme of teen-age happiness.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he writes on his site, an attempt both to create ``a
visual presence'' for an issue and to suggest his feelings about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Boot's map was included in an online exhibition titled Omnizone:
Mapping Perspectives of Digital Culture (www.plexus.org/omnizone),
in which artists were asked to contribute ``artworks that function
(however obtusely) as maps of digital space and culture,'' a
guideline to which most contributors religiously adhered.
</P>
<P>
   Another online exhibition, an ongoing effort by the Guggenheim
Museum called Cyberatlas
(cyberatlas.guggenheim.org/home/index.html), set its sites a little
broader by not limiting the maps included to those dealing with
cultural content. Almost all the maps in both exhibitions are
interactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find representations of cyberspace that encourage
us to see advantages we can exploit _ ways we can bend and stretch
the metaphor of space into new possibilities,'' said Jon Ippolito,
the assistant curator of media arts for the Guggenheim and
organizer of the Cyberatlas project. ``We don't want to be stuck in
older geometries.''
</P>
<P>
   Is a map of cyberspace, particularly the Web, needed at all? Lev
Manovich, an artist and assistant professor in the visual arts
department at the University of California at San Diego, argues
that the hyperlinked Web ``is in a way its own map _ its own
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a painting, which is a representation of
reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people see it as something close to a moral
imperative to develop cyberspace maps.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Sterling, a science fiction author and self-described
pop-science journalist, says that such maps could alter our
experience of the online world. ``The best maps won't be true to
our experience _ they will serve to refigure and change our
experience,'' he said. ``What makes the invisible visible? New
metaphors, sometimes, but I'd be betting on better instrumentation.
A picture of the Earth from space did more for environmental
awareness than any number of ecological urban legends.''
</P>
<P>
   The era of personal maps that can provide that sort of
perspective is approaching. A company called Invisible Worlds
(invisible.net), founded by two men who have helped developed many
Internet technology standards, Carl Malamud and Marshall Rose, is
readying the underlying technology that will allow such maps to be
created and shared.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demonstration on the Web site is not visually
compelling, the company hopes that independent developers will
create various appealing interfaces as the technology catches on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having maps will be like turning on the lights on the
information,'' Malamud said. ``Regular people can experience the
structure of the Net as a tool they can use. We can create a
conception of space that is good and usable.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Invisible Worlds' idea is to provide an Up button
for people traveling in cyberspace to go along with the current,
and restrictively linear, Forward and Back controls. By providing a
vista from above, Malamud said, the user's ``viewpoint becomes one
of the parameters of the map, or even the key parameter.''

UPGRADING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, MAFIA-STYLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mob rule does for Sim City what ``The Sopranos'' did for family
drama. It uses Mafia mythology to goose a well-established genre.
Substitute a crime syndicate for city government. Badda-bing
badda-boom, you're playing a god game as the Godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Now you've got real-world hassles. You've got headaches. You've
got real estate. You've gotta build your one lousy plot of land in
Hick Town into an empire that stretches all the way to Capitol
City. So you start building. You've got construction costs. You've
got workers to manage.
</P>
<P>
   You need a steady supply of raw materials, so now you're running
a brick factory, a steel factory and a cement factory (also useful
when rival gang members have to be rubbed out).
</P>
<P>
   You've got tenants, which means you've got complaints, which
means you've got to turn some of those workers into fixers so they
can keep an eye on the neighborhood. As a landlord, you want to
keep things peaceful and quiet, so it pays to keep your tenants
happy. After all, their kids are your future work force.
</P>
<P>
   A few Deluxe Beds will do wonders for your labor supply. Also,
plant some trees. Tenants love trees, and the foliage makes it
harder for the police to stake out your buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, you need to upgrade the properties so you can
squeeze more cash out of them. You're renovating the diner into a
big restaurant, so you've got to buy a bunch of fancy equipment and
order some lunkhead to deliver it. You're converting the Peep Show
into a brothel (more human resources problems). You're trying to
turn your speak-easies and gambling dens into nightclubs and
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor and gambling are both illegal, so you've got to pay off
the cops. They'll raid the joint if they're not receiving a large
enough cut (the amount of a ``contribution'' is set in a property's
data screen). If you suspect that there might be some suspicious
deaths on the property, it might be a good idea to increase the
bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, your real estate is bumping up against other
families' territory, so their thugs start making trouble. So you've
got to hire some thugs to make some trouble with them. Dumping
bodies in enemy territory is a good tactic if you want the police
to harass your opposition. If they try the same tactic with you,
that funeral parlor business had better be up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon you've got a block-by-block turf war on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   And God forbid a cousin should be in town during this time and
anything should happen to him because if one of the don's relatives
goes down on your turf, you're going to have some serious
explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Godfather,'' Mafia leadership was a moral question. In
Mob Rule, it's a logistical question. This is organized crime. You
have to get organized! You need charts. You need tables. You need
information architecture, ya know what I'm sayin'?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the data screen on each property has a small bar
above the bribe meter to indicate the level of police interest. To
reinforce the importance of this information, it also shows up as a
colored block on police radar _ red means a raid is imminent. The
same window also tells you how many police officers are on the
payroll and how much it's costing you each month.
</P>
<P>
   A status bar puts all the important data at your fingertips:
your bank balance, your supply inventory, your tenants' complaints,
warnings about potential conflicts (if you're putting out a fire on
the waterfront, you need to know whether rival gangsters are
attacking your bookmaker across town).
</P>
<P>
   As in Sim City, the important information is also displayed
schematically on the main map. But while Sim Citizens lead normal
boring lives, Mob Rule denizens have to deal with a lot more drama.
Their situations are more complex.
</P>
<P>
   The result is some fascinating innovation in icon design: an
X'd-out wrench (Factory or Resource Is Being Picketed by Thugs), a
stick figure gagged and bound (Tenant Being Held Hostage Here by a
Gang of Thugs) and a frowny face negated by a red circle-with-slash
(Tenant Has Been Kidnapped by a Rival Family). Flaming barrels
become territory markers.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' or ``Analyze This,'' Mob Rule succeeds
because it never takes itself too seriously. The premise lets you
indulge in the Mafia fantasy. The humor makes it a safe fantasy
(keep it campy and no one gets hurt).
</P>
<P>
   And like Hugh Grant's wise-guy impersonation, it's fun to watch
alone. But it's even more fun to toss back and forth with your
friends _ Mob Rule is outstanding on a computer network. Not only
can you compete against real human beings, but you can also speak
gangsterese while doing it. You can throw every line of every Mafia
movie into the mix. You can give yourself ridiculous mobster
pseudonyms on line.
</P>
<P>
   If Jimmy (the Turnip) Rigatoni thinks that he's going to mess
with family business from his desktop, he can fuggedaboudit.
</P>

   FOR MORE BRUSSELS SPROUTS
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm confused about when and how to harvest my brussels
sprouts. The plants are good-sized and I see lots of baby sprouts,
but they are much smaller than ones in stores. I'm told that
removing the leaves will make the sprouts grow larger, but I'm not
sure how many to remove or when.
</P>
<P>
   A. Leaf removal works by driving the energy of the plant into
sprout growth, but unless the plant has some leaves, it won't be
very energetic. So before you start surgery, choose your school of
brussels sprout management.
</P>
<P>
   Home-garden style (minimal leaf removal) gives more sprouts over
a longer season, but only a few at a time on each plant. The
commercial version (off with its head!) yields somewhat fewer
sprouts, but they are uniform in size and ready all at once.
</P>
<P>
   To go commercial, watch until the sprouts at the bottom are
one-half to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Then remove the
top of the plant, including the growing point and the top rosette
of leaves with its tiny sprouts. The plant will now concentrate on
the sprouts at hand, which will be ready in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   For the home garden approach, just remove the bottom two or
three rows of leaves, cutting or snapping them off carefully so you
don't damage the sprouts in the axils. Harvest the bottom sprouts
as soon as they are about an inch in diameter. Then, as each
successive sprout reaches harvestable size, remove the leaf below
it and cut or twist off the sprout, leaving a small spur of stem on
the plant. In a long, mild fall, these spurs sometimes produce
another crop.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it has its growing point, a plant will put out new
leaves and sprouts until daytime temperatures stay below about 40
degrees Fahrenheit. It will yield small harvests every 10 days or
so for two months or more, and the sprouts, which are improved by
light frosts, will be at their tastiest.
</P>
<P>
   NAIL IN A TREE
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son built a birdhouse and hung it on a nail he had driven
into a honey locust. Will this hurt the tree?
</P>
<P>
   A. As long as the house is a lightweight single-family dwelling
and not some monster condo that will drag the nail down through the
wood and create a big wound, don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In due time, the tree will grow over the nail the way it grows
over the stubs of branches that have fallen off,'' said Dr. John
Seiler, a professor of forest biology at Virginia Tech in
Blacksburg, Va. He added that after a decade or so the tree is
likely to engulf the nail and push the birdhouse right off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can remove the nail whenever you want,'' he said. ``A hole
that small will probably heal over within a year, with most of the
closure taking place after the tree resumes its growth in spring.''
</P>
<P>
   ROSE OF SHARON ABLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the blossoms on my old-fashioned rose of Sharon bush be
even more plentiful next year if I pick them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Old-fashioned single-flowered rose of Sharon (Hibiscus
syriacus) can be counted on to bloom profusely in mid- to late
summer, even _ indeed, especially _ if you ignore it completely.
But before you get all excited, bear in mind that this is also true
of a great many weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Left to its own devices, rose of Sharon will make lots of rather
untidy-looking branches, eventually becoming 10 to 15 feet tall
with lots of small red, white, pink or lilac-blue flowers blooming
on the new growth. You'll get a more shapely plant and larger,
albeit fewer, flowers if you prune it severely in early spring,
cutting back the previous year's growth to three or four buds.
</P>
<P>
   Deadheading will not affect next year's bloom, but it will
prevent this rampant spreader from making seeds. Or you could plant
an improved longer-blooming variety that is less fertile by nature.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many choices are Paeonaeflorus, a double pink; Helene,
a red-centered white, and the large, pure-white Diana. Sources
include Louisiana Nursery, 5853 Highway 182, Opelousas, La. 70570,

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading is one thing, but should we also be worried if Johnny
can't type?
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days of taking that first typing or computer
course in junior high or even high school. Computers and children
are coming together sooner than ever _ as soon as the child can sit
up, in some cases. But is Johnny going to fall behind his peers if
he can't type 20 error-free words per minute by age 12? Is Jane
doomed to a life of hunt-and-peck because she learned bad habits
early in life?
</P>
<P>
   The debate rages among frazzled parents and educators over the
right age to start teaching a child to type _ over when the
physical and mental skills are primed and ready. And there is even
a debate over whether it should be the schools or the parents who
are teaching that thing that is still called typing by many but is
now known in some circles as keyboarding. (There is a debate over
that, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amy S. Bruckman, an assistant professor in the College of
Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has done a great
deal of research on teaching children to use computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think if you get them around the fifth-grade level
to start using their fingers on the right keys and tell them to
continue to use good form,'' she said, ``as time goes on, they will
continue to become good typists in the process. I don't have any
empirical evidence for this, but I understand a lot of elementary
schools teach basic typing form in fifth-grade _ 10 years old _ and
you could go a little bit younger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But practices vary widely. ``We have a preschool within our
school district, and we start them at the age of 3 on computers,''
said Nancy Dashner, one of two technology coordinators for the
Glenwood Community School District, which has 2,000 students in
Glenwood, Iowa. The children in the class can use an oversize mouse
to learn basic pointing and clicking in simple programs while
refining their motor coordination skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In second-grade, we're not actually teaching keyboarding,''
Ms. Dashner said. ``Some people define that word differently. At
second grade, we start talking how the right hand uses the
right-hand side of the keyboard and the left hand uses the left.
From the research I've been reading, their fine motor coordination
really isn't physically there until third-grade, and even some
third-graders can't handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many experts believe that today's computer keyboards
are easier on the hands than the manual and electric monsters used
in the typing classes of yore, concerns may arise about starting
children with typing while their hands are still growing.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Alton Barron, a hand surgeon at the C.V. Starr Hand
Surgery Center in Manhattan, said that did not worry him. ``The
issue with kids is not the typing activity specifically,'' he said.
``It's really no different from them learning the Suzuki method of
violin or anything like that where they have repetitive,
independent finger motion. There is no developmental problem with
starting kids typing early.''
</P>
<P>
   But while learning to type in short, structured lessons is fine,
youngsters run the risk of developing repetitive stress injuries,
just as adults can, if they type too much and sit at workstations
that are not the right size for them. Deborah Quilter, an RSI
consultant, worries that no one seems to care about setting up
proper ergonomic workstations for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the children are sitting on molded plastic,
inadequate chairs,'' Ms. Quilter said. ``The tables are too high.
There's no place for the keyboard or mouse at an appropriate level.
But more important than that is the child's posture. Children
slouch because the furniture doesn't fit them properly.''
</P>
<P>
   What has brought new urgency to the debate is the near ubiquity
of computers. Wendy Martin, a professor of American literature and
chairwoman of the English department at Claremont Graduate
University in Claremont, Calif., said her daughter had been about
10 years old when she started to show a desire to learn typing.
``She wanted to play certain games and also it was an awful lot
easier to do papers if you could type,'' Ms. Martin said. ``And she
wanted to do e-mail _ that's a powerful motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kelly, a writer in Brooklyn, said his 7-year-old son had
taken to the computer at an early age. ``He has those CD-ROM games
on the computer, and that's how he's familiarized himself with the
keyboard,'' Kelly said. ``He knew what button to push before he
knew what it said on it.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much importance placed on technology as a means to get
ahead these days, it might seem that parents should work on typing
skills for their children early on _ perhaps as a summer project _
especially if that is not taught at a child's school.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side of the coin, however, is the view that if
fundamental computer skills are really important for children,
professional educators should be adding these programs to their
curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Malinda Aston, the technical support director for Indiana
University's campus newspaper in Bloomington, pointed out that not
all families could afford a home computer. So schools should
provide equipment and instruction to prepare children for later
life, she contended. ``If it's going to be a priority, the schools
ought to take it on,'' she said. ``The kids that don't have the
option at home will be the ones who are behind, just like it is
with everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever typing lessons are given, they should not necessarily
involve time trials and accuracy ratings from the outset. Ms.
Dashner, of the Glenwood Community School District, differentiates
between ``keyboarding'' and ``keyboarding awareness''; the latter,
she said, focuses on correct form and placement of hands. ``We
start teaching home row in third-grade, but we don't define
words-per-minute until the sixth-grade,'' she said. ``Our emphasis
is not on speed, it's on accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the children in Ms. Dashner's school district, a minimum
speed of 20 words per minute with an 85 percent accuracy rate is
the goal for the end of sixth-grade. By the time the students reach
eighth-grade, 30 words per minute with 85 percent accuracy is
preferred. Typing 30 words per minute, she said, ``will let most
students type faster than they can write.'' And that, after all,
was the reason typing became popular in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   There are many typing programs on the market, but most are
geared to adults or older children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dashner, from the Glenwood Community School District, tested
a wide variety of software a few summers ago and found that much of
it did not meet her standards for younger ages. ``Some of the
keyboarding programs I saw really and truly are making kids do
things that are not age-appropriate,'' Ms. Dashner said. ``Plus we
have a multimedia generation here, so we've got to be able to pull
kids in. It's got to grab them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent offerings are aimed at children ages 7 to 10:
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY'S ADVENTURES IN TYPING WITH TIMON AND PUMBAA
</P>
<P>
   (Disney Interactive; $19.95; Windows 95 and later, and Power
Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Familiar characters from Disney's 1994 animated film ``The Lion
King'' are reunited here on CD-ROM with the goal of teaching
children to type. Timon the meerkat, Pumbaa the warthog and Rafiki
the baboon provide 15 typing lessons, several keyboard games and
plenty of broad comic relief. Progress reports showing
words-per-minute typing speed as well as typing accuracy are
available after each lesson, and the child can print out an award
certificate at the end of the course.
</P>
<P>
   JUMPSTART TYPING
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure, $19.95; Windows 95 and later, and
Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a chatty little robot named Botley and his human
friend Polly, children using the Jumpstart Typing program are
guided through an animated world that mixes sports, science fiction
and typing drills. The program contains more than 30 timed lessons,
as well as video clips that show proper posture and hand technique.
A diagnostic test helps determine the child's typing ability at the
beginning, and the software adjusts itself to the user's level of
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive stress injuries, known as RSI, aren't just for
grown-ups anymore. Children may spend hours using the Web or
chatting on line, putting them at risk of developing a
keyboard-related injury.
</P>
<P>
   One list of guidelines for avoiding such injuries is offered by
RSI. Help (www.rsihelp.com/children.shtml), a Web site created by
Deborah Quilter, author of ``The Repetitive Strain Injury Recovery
Book'' (Walker, 1998). The list includes these tips:
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms: Teach children the warning signs of RSI, which include
tingling, heaviness or soreness in the neck, shoulders, upper back,
upper arm, elbows, forearms, wrists, thumbs or fingers. Tell
children to report any symptoms immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: Children need child-size chairs and workstations that
are adjusted for them. Make sure that the monitor is directly in
front of the child, with the top of the screen at eye level. Be
sure the keyboard and mouse are low enough to allow your children
to relax their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise: See that the child gets plenty of regular, vigorous
exercise, including activities to strengthen the upper body.
</P>
<P>
   Breaks: Tell the child to stretch frequently while at the
computer and get up often from the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Posture: Teach children not to rest their wrists on the desk,
wrist pad or armrests while typing or using a mouse or trackball.

BLUETOOTH: AN END TO CABLE SPAGHETTI? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By next year, computing and communications devices will begin
showing up on the market with a communications technology called
Bluetooth built into them. Their arrival, the companies supporting
the Bluetooth technology say, will signal the beginning of the
personal-area network.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth, which is the creation of a consortium of computer and
communications companies _ Ericsson, IBM, Toshiba, Nokia and Intel
_ was conceived two years ago as a way to eliminate the tangle of
cables that plague device-happy computer users. It has since
evolved from a way to reduce last-minute trips to Radio Shack for
that missing nine-pin serial connector into a technology for a
broad range of wireless applications.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth works by allowing high-speed communication among
devices that are within 33 feet of one another. While some current
mobile devices can communicate through infrared signals, those
signals must have a clear, straight path from one device to the
other. Bluetooth, in contrast, operates on a radio frequency, so
its signals can penetrate walls and briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   That means an electronic organizer in your pocket could transmit
a phone number to the cell phone in your briefcase and initiate a
phone call _ all part of your personal-area network.
</P>
<P>
   With Bluetooth, your digital camera could send a photo straight
to your printer. Or seconds after you snapped a photo from a ski
lift, the digital camera could send the image to the cell phone in
your pocket, which could then send the photo as an e-mail
attachment to friends back home.
</P>
<P>
   Consider slightly more far-out scenarios, too: You arrive at the
airport and buy a ticket simply by walking past a wireless
terminal, which confirms your identity, issues an electronic ticket
and bills your credit card. And a flight attendant would no longer
ask passengers to turn off their electronic devices. The plane's
master Bluetooth device would shut them all down automatically for
takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   The rather mystifying name Bluetooth for this blend of hardware
and software was the inspiration of a group of engineers from Intel
and Ericsson who are admirers of King Harald Bluetooth, who ruled
Denmark from 940 to 985 and is known for unifying the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such seamless integration is Bluetooth's goal as well, said
Per-Erik Svensson, the Bluetooth marketing manager at Ericsson
Mobile Communications.
</P>
<P>
   By this Christmas, a limited number of devices containing
Bluetooth will be announced. Ericsson, for instance, will introduce
a wireless cell phone headset. The headset will come with a small
clip-on adapter for the phone with a Bluetooth chip in it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 2000, PC cards with Bluetooth chips will be
introduced; high-end cell phones and laptop computers will begin to
appear in the second half of the year. Peripherals, digital cameras
and personal digital assistants won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluetooth will be in virtually every product within three to
four years,'' Svensson predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth's 2.4-gigahertz frequency (a gigahertz is a billion
cycles per second), which also happens to be the frequency for
microwaves and a new generation of cordless phones, does not mean
that a Bluetooth device will start your oven or make your phone
ring, said Brent Miller, a senior engineer who specializes in
Bluetooth at International Business Machines.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth uses spread-spectrum technology, which means that the
signals are sent over a wide range of frequencies and jump from one
frequency to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the frequency hopping, the hopping pattern and hopping
speed that mitigates any interference problems,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller added that technical safeguards insured that a cluster of
Bluetooth devices in, say, an airport lounge would not suddenly
start talking to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth won't be cheap. Initially, the add-on cost to
manufacturers for incorporating Bluetooth into devices will be
around $25. That will drop to about $5 as volumes increase. The
cost to the consumer will, of course, be still higher.
</P>
<P>
   That added cost has given some manufacturers pause. ``Bluetooth
is an interesting technology that everybody is taking a serious
look at,'' said Mark Lowenstein, a senior vice president at the
Yankee Group, a technology research company in Boston. ``But there
has not yet been a solid commitment because the economics for
deployment are not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than 1,000 companies have signed on as Bluetooth
adopters, which means that they are interested in incorporating the
technology into their products and services. Once Bluetooth gains
widespread acceptance, said John Patrick, vice president for
Internet technology at IBM, ``you won't buy a product without it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy a Sony Walkman without Dolby?'' he added. ``I'm
dying to have it, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite creative efforts at hiding them, Patrick said, cables
run rampant in his office at home, connecting his computer to an
MP3 player, label printer, fax-printer, Audible player, palm-size
device and business card scanner. When he travels, his briefcase is
filled with mobile devices and their attendant cables and cradles
and often weighs more than his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth will allow people to be more inventive with the
communications. You might be wearing a piece of jewelry, for
instance, that was actually a wireless headset for your cell phone.
Or you might shake someone's hand and exchange electronic business
cards via your Bluetooth shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick would rather not emphasize those futuristic
applications. ``Frankly, I think that stuff turns people off a bit,
where we're irrelevant and we're all just a carcass, carrying a
computer,'' he said. ``But the idea of cleaning up the cable mess
and simplifying your personal productivity environnment _ now,
that's a big deal.''

`DUTCH': A GUY WHO WASN'T THERE MEETS THE GUY WHO WAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It comes as a shock at first. On page nine of Edmund Morris'
long-awaited ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' you read, in a
chapter called ``The Land of Lost Things,'' that the author was
born in the American Midwest on Aug. 9, 1912.
</P>
<P>
   This would make him 87, which does not square with the Edmund
Morris we know from the book's publicity material, who is much
younger, was born in South Africa and could therefore not have had
the American parents he gives himself in the text, even footnoting
them as being cited in several reference works.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection you realize that Morris is coyly telling
you that he is fabricating, when he writes of his birth that it
``more or less coincided with the archeological furor over Piltdown
Man, while other scientists were finding that genes could be lined
up along a chromosome.'' He continues: ``Who knows, the latter
discovery may prove as fraudulent as the former. The past is
delusion, the future illusion; one locates one's center where one
can. (Or in cases like Reagan's, where one wishes.)''
</P>
<P>
   So why, you find yourself asking, should you believe any
previously unreported details in this authorized biography, the
first one ever written by someone invited to observe a sitting
president? What is the difference between ``Dutch'' and, say,
Oliver Stone's film ``J.F.K.'' or Joe McGinniss' ``The Last
Brother,'' a biography of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy? Why shouldn't
Morris' memoir be treated as historical fiction?
</P>
<P>
   But as you read on _ and such is the force and fascination of
Morris' narrative that you can't help reading on _ you begin to see
the benefits of his highly unorthodox technique, which turns out to
be a conjoining of invention and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since Morris' partly fictional persona was born only a year
later than Reagan and crossed paths with him at various points in
their early careers, the author can make use of directly
contemporaneous commentary instead of having to resort to
speculative ``must haves'' and ``may wells.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluidity of the resulting viewpoints frees Morris to liven
up his narrative with the devices of oral and documentary history,
employing dialogues, interviews, film scenarios, epistolary
sections and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   For instance as a schoolmate of Reagan's at Eureka College, he
reviews his subject's first known stage role, the shepherd Thyrsis
in Edna St. Vincent Millay's verse drama ``Aria da Capo,'' which,
prophetically, centers on the building of an artificial wall
between two friends, although not until 57 years later would
President Reagan say, in Berlin, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall.'
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Morris' inventions lend at least the first half of
``Dutch'' a faint air of make-believe, which seems entirely fitting
for Reagan's rise to prominence. (In a brilliant description of his
first film role, as the radio broadcaster Andy McCaine in ``Love Is
on the Air,'' it is difficult to tell for a while whether what he
is describing is the movie or Reagan's experience.)
</P>
<P>
   One might of course dismiss Morris' technique as committing the
fallacy of imitative form, matching an artificial narrative with an
inauthentic subject. But some would argue that Reagan's rise to
fame was the contradiction of that fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   Above all Morris seems at pains to animate a life that in an
earlier treatment, that of Reagan's autobiography, ``An American
Life,'' produced what Morris himself calls ``the most boring book
of its kind since Herbert Hoover's `Challenge to Liberty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Dutch'' is very far from boring. As gossip it
hypnotizes: Morris has come up with the ultimate ``Hi, I'm Ronald
Reagan, who are you?'' anecdote when he tells how Reagan failed to
recognize his own son Michael at his high school commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Treating such delicate issues as Reagan's shift to the right
politically, his conduct during the Red-hunting era in Hollywood,
his relations with his wives, Jane Wyman and Nancy Davis, and the
dating of his decline into senescence, the book manages to be both
balanced and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   And in its coverage of the Reagan presidency it makes an
oft-told tale exciting and at times, even inspiring, particularly
in its vivid accounts of the various summit conferences with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't all this have been accomplished without Morris'
narrative abracadabra? Perhaps, but I can think of few conventional
political biographies that bring their subjects' pasts so richly
alive.
</P>
<P>
   And had he used a more conventional form, one finds it hard to
imagine how he could have so effectively evolved his narrative
voice from the wise-cracking irreverence of the narrator's youth to
the stunned admiration of his maturer years. (Here he undetectably
slows his aging process, turns himself into the middle-aged Edmund
Morris we recognize from the voice of his prize-winning biography,
``The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,'' and thereby provides internal
evidence of his deception, which he nowhere mentions overtly.)
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Dutch'' then finally flawed by Morris' technique? To judge
from the book's extensive notes, it in no way distorts the record
of Reagan's life, only the viewpoint from which it is told.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to approve the technique in theory; in less
skilled hands it will doubtless prove a disaster. But it certainly
succeeds in this case. So call ``Dutch'' a literary work instead of
a biography. Besides, all biographies invent their stories, as Jay
Parini pointed out recently in his ``Robert Frost: A Life.'' Why
not invent the inventor?
</P>
<P>
   But does ``Dutch'' finally penetrate the mystery of Ronald
Reagan, explain the calculated spontaneity, the cold warmth, the
absent presence? No, yet in passage after passage it certainly
captures the paradoxes he comprised. Just one example of many:
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Tampico's ice there grew, crystal by crystal, the
glacier that is Ronald Reagan: an ever-thrusting, ever-deepening
mass of chill purpose. Possessed of no inner warmth, with no
apparent interest save in its own growth, it directed itself toward
whatever declivities lay in its path. Inevitably, as the glacier
grew, it collected rocks before it, and used them to flatten
obstructions; when the rocks were worn smooth they rode up onto the
glacier's back, briefly enjoying high sunny views, then tumbled off
to become part of the surrounding countryside. They lie where they
fell, some cracked, some crumbled: Dutch's lateral moraine. And the
glacier sped slowly on.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Morris' book, irresistibly.

SOFTWARE TO HELP VIOLINISTS BRING TEARS TO LISTENERS' EYES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Okla.)   (af)  
 By MELISSA P. MCNAMARA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While they cannot eliminate the need to practice, researchers at
the University of Tulsa are offering help for aspiring violinists,
adapting speech pathology software that may enable them to
fine-tune their vibrato technique.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which detects and analyzes voice and speech
signals, offers a technological alternative to an often intuitive
process. The research is being done by Frank Boutsen, a professor
of neurogenic speech disorders, and Christy Bager, a graduate
student.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrato is produced by the vibration of a player's fingers as
they press strings on the neck of a stringed instrument. Skilled
violinists practice arm movements that make them more efficient,
but the vibrato tone is shaped over time as students develop a feel
for the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Violin students generally rely on sensations in the muscles and
tendons of the arm to select and shape movements that produce
better vibrato. To master the technique, teachers instruct students
to mimic certain everyday motions _ like tipping a salt shaker or
knocking on a door, Ms. Gaber explained.
</P>
<P>
   The new research is an effort to simplify that subjective
process by using technology that demonstrates which muscle
movements produce the cleanest sound, Boutsen said. ``This study
really takes the subjectivity out of producing vibrato,'' he said.
``I think what it really does is help people find their range
better, fine-tune probably with better precision.''
</P>
<P>
   The research began last spring as an outgrowth of earlier
studies by Boutsen on voice modulation and tremors. ``We were
looking at vocal vibrato,'' Boutsen said, ``a modulation in a
person's voice, when we said, Why don't we look at stringed
instrument vibrato?''
</P>
<P>
   The original subjects included two violinists from the Tulsa
Philharmonic, and two inexperienced high school violinists.
Monitoring muscle activity and muscle tone, Boutsen and Ms. Gaber
placed surface electrodes over the violinists' vibrato-producing
muscles as they played ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaber focused on a single note at the end of a phrase where
musicians tend to incorporate vibrato. She noted the location of
the muscle activity and compared it with the acoustic output. A
modified version of Motor Speech Profiler software by Kay
Elemetrics, which is used to study human voice patterns, was used
to correlate muscle activity with the acoustic signals of each
note.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions confirmed the researchers' hypothesis that
acoustic and muscle activity patterns were more consistent and
efficient for advanced players. The rate of amplitude modulation _
the rate of the rapid changes in pitch that underlie vibrato _
during the violin vibrato of experienced violinists ranged from
4.78 to 5.71 hertz (cycles per second), which means that the
modulation occurred about five times a second. With inexperienced
violinists, the modulation rate was more erratic, from 5 to 9 times
a second.
</P>
<P>
   The software also enables the violinists to view the results of
their vibrato attempts as depictions of waves on a computer screen,
and they can watch as changes in technique produce changes on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The study could be ``instrumental in developing violin training
software applications that can detect and analyze sounds,'' Ms.
Gaber said. And while the software alone will not eliminate the
need for a violin instructor, Ms. Gaber, a 13-year veteran of the
violin, is confident that this kind of biofeedback may ease the
difficulty of learning to produce a rich vibrato in the future.

   Exorcising The Bin Hex
</P>
<P>
   Q. An e-mail message I received from an iMac has an attachment
encoded in Bin Hex. Can a Windows 98 machine decode it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you should be able to open the attachment from your
Windows 98 machine. It's just a matter of getting software that
will decode Bin Hex for you if your e-mail program can't.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Hex is used to convert e-mail attachments like graphics and
picture files, spreadsheets, documents and other types of files to
a format that will let them travel over the Internet along with
your e-mail text message. Other popular encoding formats used for
e-mail attachments include Uuencode and MIME (which is short for
multipurpose Internet mail extensions).
</P>
<P>
   Bin Hex attachments have the file extension .hqx after the file
name, and the format is a common way to send Macintosh files. Some
full-featured e-mail programs will automatically handle the Bin Hex
attachments for you, encoding them when you send and decoding the
ones you receive.
</P>
<P>
   If your e-mail program cannot handle Bin Hex, there are utility
programs available that can. Aladdin Systems has free file
expansion and decoding software available for downloading from its
Web site (www.aladdinsys.com/expander) with versions that will work
for Windows, DOS and Macintosh systems.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
mail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West 43d
Street, New York, N.Y. 10036-3959 or by e-mail to
Q&AMP;A(AT)nytimes.com. This column will answer questions of general
interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

`SECOND SIGHT': AS HE SLOWLY GOES BLIND, A DETECTIVE GAINS
INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In creating ``Second Sight,'' Paula Milne began with an inspired
notion: A vigorous, brilliant police detective contracts a rare eye
disease that starts to rob him of his most important sensory tool.
</P>
<P>
   Too proud to give up the command of a high-profile murder
investigation, he tries to work around his new limitation. But he
cannot succeed alone, even as his other senses grow sharper to
compensate for his diminishing sight.
</P>
<P>
   So this tough guy must learn to lean upon a tough gal, his newly
installed deputy. She agrees not to tell the top brass about his
problem in exchange for her share of the glory when they crack
their case. In the process these detectives learn as much about
each other, and themselves, as they do about the people they are
investigating. Now that's a clever setup.
</P>
<P>
   But to write a riveting drama, Ms. Milne needed a second
inspiration for ``Second Sight'': a case to challenge and fascinate
her protagonists and her audience. Here, alas, she has come up
short, falling back on some hokum about a murdered college student
who left behind a trove of possible clues in a rambling videotape
diary.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects abound. Things are not always what they seem, even for
those with eagle eyes. But when you learn that the victim's
stepfather has an identical twin brother from whom he was separated
at birth, your own senses may detect the scent of an overripe red
herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Sight,'' which opens the 20th season of British imports
on the PBS series ``Mystery,'' is being broadcast in two 90-minute
installments. This story could have been more effectively told in a
single, shorter, faster-paced show.
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment you'll meet the unlikely helpmates,
Detective Chief Inspector Ross Tanner (Clive Owen) and Detective
Inspector Catherine Tully (Claire Skinner). Tanner is the
hard-driving, hard-drinking, hard-smoking kind, focused on his
career. He failed as a husband, but he cares deeply for his young
son, so you know there's a heart in there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   You're less sure about Tully's heart. Her focus is firmly on the
job, too. She desperately wants to erase a black mark on her
record; she led a bungled ambush in which one of her subordinates
was gravely wounded.
</P>
<P>
   As played by these attractive actors, under the direction of
Charles Beeson, both detectives are so thoroughly focused that it's
hard to imagine either one having any kind of real relationship,
professional or otherwise. Sparks should flit between them, but the
kindling is just too soggy, thanks to all that self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   They bicker at first sight, of course.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Given a choice, Catherine, focus on the facts. There's
time for the psychobabble when we've got the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Ah, left-brain approach. I know it well. Surely facts are
always open to interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly the banter of Nick and Nora. Or Mulder and
Scully, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting players are uniformly strong. Stuart Wilson is
memorable as the bereaved stepfather and, in the second episode,
the evil twin. But is the stepfather really bereaved? Is the twin
really evil? Is the twin really a twin? Wilson keeps you guessing,
especially when the tempo picks up in the second, more satisfying
installment, as some answers materialize fuzzily.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fuzziness is intentional. Rex Maidment's imaginative
camera work dramatizes Tanner's visual impairment, showing you the
things that the inspector sees, or thinks he sees.
</P>
<P>
   The film's off-kilter look often overshadows the logical
questions that linger even after the case is closed. For instance:
On a team of 20 or so elite detectives, how come only one notices
that the boss is going blind?
</P>

enough that a sportswriter could tuck one in the back pocket of his
polyester pants, leaving his hands free to take notes or quotes.
Times sure have changed. The once unassuming media guide has become
the glitzy, gargantuan media/recruiting/fundraising guide. Forget
the pants pocket. Many guides now barely fit inside a big pocket in
a computer case. And they're growing every year. The University of
Colorado's guide swelled from 244 pages last year to 324 pages this

MAGIC CARPETS FOR ARMCHAIR EXPLORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maps do more than lead you from point A to point B. For the
closet cartographer, a map's hieroglyphics reveal a portrait of the
world's countries, cities, mountains, plains and oceans through a
singular vocabulary of symbols, colors and typefaces.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maps are a two-way street: they not only depict the
world for their readers but also say volumes about the people who
made them by what they include and leave out, where the borders are
and what a city is called _ whether Londonderry in Northern
Ireland, for example, is rendered as Derry, the Irish nationalists'
preference.
</P>
<P>
   A good map fires the imagination like a good novel. Here are
three CD-ROM sets to curl up with on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAPS
</P>
<P>
   (National Geographic Society; $49.95; Windows 95 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Generations of map lovers have delighted in all the sensations
associated with the maps that come tucked inside National
Geographic magazines: the crisp unfolding of paper and faint smell
of ink as the reader bends over the table and lingers on the
strange names of cities and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society has collected every map included
in the magazine through 1997 _ all 535 of them _ on a set of eight
CD-ROMs. The first fold-out map, which shows the area from the
Meadow Creek Mountains in Tennessee along the French Broad River to
Asheville, N.C., appeared with the ``Round About Asheville''
article in the October 1889 issue. The last, from December 1997, is
a two-sided map of Mesoamerica published with ``The Royal Crypts of
Copan''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maps are intimately intertwined with the culture'' of the
National Geographic Society, said Allen Carroll, chief cartographer
at National Geographic Maps. ``The society's more-than-century-long
mission is to increase and diffuse geographic knowledge,'' he
added. ``People tend to think of photographs first, but I hope they
also think of maps.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society, which has sponsored exploration
and anthropological and environmental research, formed its own
cartographic division in 1915. Its maps have since set the
standard: they are dense with raw geographical data on the physical
features of the world and the names and symbols humans use to place
themselves in that world. The maps in this collection offer a
window onto history, war, culture, science and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And they can be downright beautiful. ``Bird Migration in the
Americas'' (August 1979) shows the migration routes of birds from
North America to South America with arrows sweeping down through
the bottleneck of Central America and fanning out toward Tierra del
Fuego. The continents are surrounded by drawings of the
ruby-throated hummingbird, the wandering albatross, the
blue-and-white sparrow and 64 other species, in full, flying color.
</P>
<P>
   Where the maps alone do not tell the story, there are insets. A
two-sided map that accompanied ``Panama: Ever at the Crossroads''
(April 1986) has a political map of Central America on one side and
insets and several smaller maps on the other, with insights into
archeological sites and the European invasions of the region by
explorers. It also shows the economic outlook, with a map showing
things like natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM collection also offers users historical perspectives.
A 1922 map of the world contains regions at both poles marked
``unexplored.'' ``The Antarctic Regions,'' a 1932 map, shows the
Polar Plateau with a largely empty interior, traced with the routes
of the early explorers: Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antarctica'' (1987) is fully mapped, with international
scientific bases and detailed topographical information like ice
thicknesses and mountains and glaciers, including Amundsen Glacier
and Grosvenor Mountains (named for Gilbert H. Grosvenor, the first
editor of The National Geographic magazine and the society's second
president).
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other map pairings that will interest history
enthusiasts are the theater of war in 1918, paired with a 1922 map
showing ``Countries as Established by the Peace Conference at
Paris,'' and a map of the races of Europe and Africa from 1918,
with ``Dawn of Humans'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   To provide users with a context for the collection, the software
includes a history of cartography (``from the first line drawn in
the sand'') and a history of the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   There are also nine video tours, on topics like European
history, Canadian history and the environment. ``You can't assume
that everyone who picks one of these maps up is a map geek,'' said
Bob Madden, editorial director of the CD-ROM set.
</P>
<P>
   The set's most cumbersome aspect _ that it is included on eight
CD-ROMs, which users must slip in and out of the drive to view the
maps _ has been mitigated by several search and sorting provisions.
The maps can be searched on any of the CD-ROMs by categories like
politics or history, and by geographic regions like North America
or space.
</P>
<P>
   Each map can be viewed in a thumbnail version, and users can
call up a summary with the map's title, publication date, size and
geographic names; a list of the insets, and the title of the
article (if any) relating to the map. Users can also keep several
maps open on their screen, even after switching CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The printing feature of the CD-ROM set is flexible: each map can
be sized to fit a standard page or printed on several pieces of
paper. The printouts are clear and easy to read, and the subtle
colors reproduce well. There is little to complain about in this
software, but it would be nice if the map summary had a synopsis of
the articles the maps appeared with and if the summary could be
called up from the map image and not just from the search page.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation within the maps is typical of map software: the
viewer can zoom in and out, using a thumbnail image to center the
map in the viewing window and a Find button to search for places or
insets. The maps can also be ``turned over'' so users can see the
back of any two-sided map.
</P>
<P>
   Users can view a list of alternative place names since borders,
cities and countries on maps have changed with wars, colonialism
and independence movements: Burma became Myanmar, for example, and
Leningrad became St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maps present a hierarchy of information,'' Carroll said. ``You
need a mental or visual starting point. With a map of central
Texas, there are a lot of lines and squiggles and names, but if
Houston and Dallas are in big type, you can say, `I know where I
am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Map-making today combines technology with graphic traditions,
Carroll added. ``If the information is not presented properly,'' he
said, ``it is almost worthless: counterintuitive software has the
important stuff buried, and a poorly designed map can be a jumble
of confusing code. We've all encountered ugly software, and the
same is true of maps. Maps should be as accurate as possible and as
beautiful as possible.''
</P>

<P>
   APPALACHIAN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   (Maptech Windows; $39 for each CD-ROM, $139 for set of four;
Windows 95, NT and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Trail _ 2,160.3 miles, from Springer Mountain in
Georgia to Baxter Peak in Maine _ is no walk in the woods. About
3,000 people a year try to hike the entire trail, which is in 14
states, but only 400 to 450 finish the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, hikers face physical challenges, like
blisters, Lyme disease, swarms of black flies, rain, cold and heat,
and they battle loneliness and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers who travel a section of the Appalachian Trail make up the
bulk of the users, and they are the ones who would benefit most
from a set of CD-ROM maps that will be released in early October,
said Brian King, the director of publications for the Appalachian
Trail Conference, a federation of 31 regional hiking clubs that
maintain the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help them identify the difficulty of a particular
section,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   The trail conference says that three million to four million
people travel part of the route each year.
</P>
<P>
   The map set has CD-ROMs for the New England, Mid-Atlantic and
Southern regions. A fourth covers a short stretch in West Virginia
as well as Virginia, which wins the prize for most trail miles:
more than 500. The CD-ROMs offer plenty of maps, photographs and
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The information on the 95 mile-stretch of the Appalachian Trail
inside Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, for example, includes
the geologic and human history of the area, descriptions of animals
and plants, camping and fire regulations, and, as with all
sections, a trail guide.
</P>
<P>
   The guides featured in the CD-ROM set are from the books
distributed by the Appalachian Trail Conference. They include trail
mileage, elevation ascents and descents, locations of shelters and
sources of water. There is also a description of what a hiker will
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   A 2.3-mile stretch of the trail near Hawksbill Mountain in
Shenandoah National Park includes the altitude of Hawksbill at the
summit (4,050 feet, the highest point in the park), the mountains
visible from the trail, the places where the climb is steep, and
the places to find the three-toothed cinquefoil, which blooms in
late spring.
</P>
<P>
   The trail guides make the CD-ROM set most useful to armchair
hikers and people who want to plan short trips. A particularly nice
feature is that the guides are offered in northbound or southbound
versions (hikers traveling in the direction opposite from their
trail guide have to read from back to front).
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM set also shows the land for up to eight miles on each
side of the trail. But unlike most paper hiking maps, trails
intersecting the Appalachian Trail are often not identified, so
hikers who use the CD-ROM maps to hike these trails risk getting
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM maps are easily navigated with a well-stocked
toolbar; several zoom settings; a search function for parks, lakes,
cities and other map features, and icons to link to the trail
information and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Trail is marked with small white rectangles
painted on trees and piles of stones called cairns in areas where
there are no trees. When you come upon it in the woods, stand with
the rising sun to your right. Baxter Peak is in front of you, just
a few miles, and Springer Mountain is almost right behind you.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, leave only footprints.
</P>
<P>
   TOPO USA
</P>
<P>
   (Delorme; $99.95, Windows 95, 98 and NT.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the Pacific Northwest on a flat map, with mountains and
national parks and forests surrounding Puget Sound and Seattle.
Now, imagine it as a three-dimensional topographical map: look
north past giant Mount Rainier into the Canadian Rockies, with the
mountains dropping down past Seattle to Puget Sound, only to fill
the Olympic Peninsula to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Some places just look better in three dimensions. With Topo USA,
the flat CD-ROM image can be transformed into a landscape. Now,
users have a bird's-eye view of anywhere in the 50 states: the
plains stretching northwest from Wichita, Kans.; the Pacific
coastline; the Mississippi River where it joins the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Users can search for a place on Topo USA, view a flat map and
watch as a 3-D image is built on the screen. The topographical
features can be exaggerated to throw peaks and valleys into greater
contrast and enhance the 3-D effect.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two navigation tools that mimic flight over the
landscape. In the first, users can select the pitch used to view
the map on a sliding scale between 15 and 90 degrees: at the lower
numbers, the landscape stretches out toward the horizon, and at 90
degrees, the view is from directly overhead. Since the image
adjusts as the pitch increases, the perspective for the user is one
of flying from far away to hovering over the map.
</P>
<P>
   The second feature is the rotation tool: it is possible to swing
360 degrees around the center point of the map. The perspective is
one of circling the landscape from high in the air: with Knoxville,
Tenn., as the center point, the user can rotate the view so it
first shows the Little Tennessee River winding southward with the
Great Smoky Mountain range to the east. Then the sightline is from
the peaks looking north and west toward Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the topographical sightseeing in Topo USA only
whets the appetite. For starters, the 3-D image is slightly fuzzy.
And because the images do not include buildings, landscapes built
around city and town maps seem empty.
</P>
<P>
   The filters for choosing natural and man-made components on the
map do not offer enough choices. Roads and cities, for example, are
included with parks and recreation on the map, so users cannot
simply select a geographic map with place names. The map is further
cluttered because the place names on the surface bend along with
the terrain in the 3-D images.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, however, offers a lot of basic information, down to
individual streets and landmarks. So, users can see where Ben
Franklin was born in Boston at the most detailed setting, and
increase the scale to see the landscape from above. After all, why
just look at a map when you can fly over it?

IF THE PHONE HAD A CORD, YOU COULD STRANGLE THE USER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an interruption whose time is coming far too
frequently. During a recent performance of ``Death of a Salesman,''
its star, Brian Dennehy, was startled to hear a cell phone ring
near the end of the second act.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing was to hear the phone being answered, and a
woman in the audience clearly saying, ``It's almost finished,'' and
going on to make dinner plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cahoon took an aggressive approach to a recent cell-phone
intrusion. When a phone rang during his performance earlier in
September as the transsexual rock singer in ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch'' at the Jane Street Theater, his concentration broke, but his
aplomb didn't. Cahoon marched off the stage, pink fringe fluttering
on his denim dress, took the phone out of an audience member's hand
and answered it.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters in Manhattan, museums in London, wedding receptions in
Paris _ around the world, people are taking cell-phone calls in the
presence of strangers who are forced to listen to everything from
tearful marital conflicts to shopping advice.
</P>
<P>
   A cell phone is ``a pacifier for adults,'' said Maira Kalman,
the president of M&AMP;Co, a Manhattan product and graphic design
group. ``It makes you feel connected, that you're not alone in this
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-cell-phoners are not sitting idly by. At Le Cirque
2000, a waiter will materialize at any table where a cell phone has
come into view. ``We ask them to leave the phone with us, and when
they get a call, we will call them,'' the restaurant's owner, Sirio
Maccioni, said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Center, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan
Opera post their own admonitions. At the Museum of Modern Art, come
mid-October, a prohibition will be printed in the information
pamphlets handed out at the front desk. But at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, there is no need to wrestle visitors into cell-phone
submission. The stone walls of the Beaux-Arts building are so thick
that cell phones won't work (except in the Great Hall, where they
function only half of the time).
</P>
<P>
   As rules of cell-phone etiquette are being established _ a sign
here, a murmur there _ the New York Times invited six
graphic-design companies to create a universal icon that says: Stop
cell-phone talk. The designers _ who have created everything from
universal-design kitchen implements to album covers to interiors
for the New Jersey Performing Arts Center _ have not yet been asked
to design an anti-cell-phone sign. But they're ready, with concepts
that range from anger to advocacy to ironic understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Ringing phones infuriate Ms. Kalman. Hence, the angry look to
her sign. ``It's a monster,'' she said of the design, a red face
with jagged teeth about to nosh on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cellbuster, on the other hand, is purposefully jolly. Created by
Tucker Viemeister, working with Dylan Fracareta and Jarrod Linton
at Razorfish, a product- and digital-design company in Manhattan,
it is a jamming device with an insidiously funny logo: a cell phone
that looks a little like Casper the Friendly Ghost being squeezed
to near-suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it Cellbuster because we wanted a symbol that was
sort of fun, so people felt happy about it,'' Viemeister said. He
added that although the design is lighthearted, its effect would be
drastic: a Cellbuster on the ceiling of a restaurant would insure
that no diner could receive any calls. The device would block calls
by emitting bursts of static on the same radio frequency: a caller
would hear a message that ``you cannot reach the customer at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagram, a design consulting company in Manhattan, found the
threat of violence intriguing. A takeoff on the ubiquitous Heimlich
maneuver posters, its Cell Phone Victim poster provides simple
directions for the forcible removal of a cell phone: Push. Kick.
Pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``A `no cell phone' icon would be insufficient to address this
crisis, because the people most susceptible to it seem to have no
self-control,'' said Michael Bierut, who designed the poster with
Brett Traylor. ``The syndrome requires intervention, for their own
good, really.'' A second Pentagram design, slightly less violent,
shows a cell phone displaying the words ``shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Turner, a Manhattan graphic designer, took a kinder,
gentler approach. She created glow-in-the-dark rubber gloves, one
that says ``Turn It Off,'' the other ``Stop Talk Now.'' They could
be subtly raised in dimly lighted theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sussman, a partner in Sussman/Prejza &AMP; Co., an
environmental graphics design company in Culver City, Calif., asked
her staff to design  &UR; anything but &LR;  a phone in a circle with a slash
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too dull, too obvious,'' she said. ``It's got to be
universal, not obnoxious, hopefully funny, and you could put it
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the project, Ms. Sussman's staff produced dozens
of signs, including Curb Your Calls (with a person holding a phone
at the end of a leash) and a stop sign with a phone in place of the
``o.'' Sussman/Prejza's sketch for Silence of the Phone shows a
phone-shaped face with stitches across the mouth, a reference to
Hannibal Lecter, the firmly muzzled cannibal antihero of ``Silence
of the Lambs.'' An especially witty alternative is a poster
depicting a flurry of words in various typefaces, the very
banalities that make up most cell-phone conversations (``Can you
hear me?'').
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Sagmeister and Jan Wilker, graphic designers in
Manhattan, took the obvious universal icon _ a phone in a circle
bisected by a diagonal slash _ and transformed it into a
site-specific solution: a plate flanked by a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Sagmeister, who has designed a ``no smoking'' sign for Cathay
Pacific, said he would rather lunch with a smoker than a cell-phone
user. At least the smoker, he said, ``will blow the smoke away from
me.''

LIFE'S WORK: A WILD RIDE ON THE SWIVEL CHAIR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LISA BELKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hear them before I see them _ the 8-year-old, followed by the
5-year-old _ as they clomp up the stairs that lead to my office.
They knock (when they remember), then in they come, dropping their
backpacks at my feet like an offering. If I'm on the phone, they
shush loudly at each other until I hang up. When I'm finally
theirs, they fill my lap with a jumble of artwork and homework and
memos from the PTA. I give hugs and praise and savor whatever
nuggets they offer up about their day. All this serves to postpone,
but never prevent, the final part of the ritual. The part where I
notice the time, tell them I love them, then boot them out.
</P>
<P>
   Being a working parent _ in my case, a journalist _ means having
at least one moment of the day when you push your children away.
Because guilt is an equal-opportunity companion, there is a version
of that moment to suit any frenetic schedule: early in the morning,
when you tiptoe out before they even wake up; during the late-day
phone call home, a call that you you really don't have time for
because your 4 o'clock meeting has begun; between dinner and
bedtime (assuming you made it home for either), when you have to
read a hefty brief instead of Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the business trips _ the mother lodes (parent
lodes?) of conflicted moments. I was quite the sight in the
Philippines last winter, wandering among ramshackle jungle huts in
search of a phone because it was 8 p.m. in New York and I had
promised I would call in time to say good night. (I never did find
one. I did penance with extra presents.) I topped that during one
ugly moment in the Atlanta airport when the airline gave away my
seat on the last flight out, meaning I would not be home when my
children woke up on Thanksgiving morning. (I threatened to walk
through the security door to board the plane anyway; a seat was
somehow found for me on another carrier.)
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when I traded my job in the newsroom of The New
York Times for one as an author in an office above my garage, I
smugly thought I had eliminated all the ``moments.'' I could be at
work and be at home at the same time. My older son (who was 2 at
the time) was giddy that first morning. Wow. He had his baby sitter
 &UR; and  &LR; his Mommy. But when I glided off to my desk, coffee mug in
hand, he was outraged. How to explain that I was his but only
sometimes? That I was there but also out of reach? He stood and
cried on his side of the office door. I stood and cried on mine.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, we can't be fully at home and fully at work at the same
time _ not if work is in a distant office tower and not even if
work is in the next room. Work and life don't overlap so much as
they collide or intersect, leaving us to sit in our ergonomically
correct swivel chairs and pivot between the two. And each time we
turn toward one, we are, in that moment, turning away from the
other.
</P>
<P>
   My moment comes most often at 3:45 in the afternoon when my boys
rocket into my office. By 4 o'clock they have to leave. I have to
work. I can't change that, but I can change what I tell them about
it. For years I apologized: ``I'd rather be with you, but if I
don't write, there won't be money for toys.'' Then one morning, I
found my younger son perched in his booster seat, scribbling
furiously with a pencil on a yellow legal pad. I asked what he
wanted for breakfast and he shooed me away. ``I can't talk Mommy,''
he growled. ``If I don't finish my article, my editor will be mad
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   My message, I saw, had been that work was a mix of fear and
drudgery, designed to keep me away from them. Though there are
times when all that is true, bleak is not at the core of how I feel
about my work and not how I hope my sons will one day feel about
their own. I work because I have to. I do this work because I
choose to. That makes me lucky, and that is the point: I want them
to see the luck, the fulfillment, the fun.
</P>
<P>
   I still show them the door, but I do it differently. Or I try
to. On deadline days I can, I confess, be heard to threaten that
there will be no more food, clothing, shelter or Nintendo _ ever _
unless they let me write. But in saner times I ask about their day,
then tell them about mine. About my latest magazine assignment. Or
about this new column, which might even mention them once in a
while. I use words like ``exciting'' and ``interesting,'' and I
promise them all the details. Later. The moment I turn off the
computer, swivel that chair back around and finish working. Finish
working, that is, at least until they've gone to bed and to sleep.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a one-story ranch house and the walls and ceilings are
painted off-white. There is a strange problem with discoloration on
some of the walls and ceiling of the corner bedroom. Light grayish
streaks have appeared in straight lines that seem to follow the
pattern of the wood studs inside the walls. It's almost as though
the studs were showing through the paint. Can you tell me what
could cause this?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a fairly common problem, which is usually referred to
as ``ghosting'' of the stud or beam patterns. It is actually the
result of tiny amounts of condensation that form on the inside of
insulated outside walls and the ceilings under insulated attics.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is not a good insulator, so the studs transmit cold to the
inside better than the insulation that is packed in between them.
As a result, the drywall that is directly against the studs gets
slightly colder on the inside than the rest of the wall or ceiling
which has insulation behind it.
</P>
<P>
   These cooler surfaces cause moisture in the air to condense
along the inside in lines that follow the pattern of the studs or
beams. This slight moisture catches and holds small amounts of dust
and even allows a slight amount of mildew to form in some cases _
thus creating the dark ``shadows'' that you see.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We remodeled our family room and added a new prefabricated
fireplace to this room. The prefabricated chimney for this
fireplace goes up along the outside and extends up past the peaked
roof. However, each time we use this fireplace we have a problem
with smoke drifting into the room. The dealer told us that this is
because the chimney is probably not high enough, even though it
does stick up above the roof. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: A chimney that is not tall enough is a common reason for a
fireplace smoking. The top of the chimney should stick up at least
two feet higher than the roof or any part of it (including the
peak) that is less than 10 feet away from that chimney. The same
applies to any other structure or part of the house that is within
10 feet of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there should be a hood or cap on the top of the chimney to
help deflect downdrafts when it is very windy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The house we recently moved into has a glass enclosed stall
shower and after a year or so we started to see mildew forming on
the ceiling above the shower. We installed an exhaust fan and then
repainted that ceiling after washing the mildew off with Clorox and
water, but now the mildew seems to be coming back. What can we do
about this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: One possibility is that you did not remove all the mildew
before painting. If even a few spots remain it is likely to grow
back. After washing off the mildew (with a solution of one part
fresh Clorox and three parts water) wash again with a mild
detergent and rinse off with plenty of water. When you do repaint,
make sure you use a paint that is mildew-resistant, or has had
extra mildewcide added.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when using the exhaust fan make sure you keep it running
for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the shower is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have light wood kitchen cabinets with a clear gloss finish.
I would like to remove the glossy finish and give the cabinets a
more natural looking dull finish _ like an oiled or waxed finish.
How can I do this without damaging the wood?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can completely remove all of the old glossy finish _
without damaging the wood _ by using a semi-paste chemical paint
remover. Just be sure you follow the directions on the can and be
careful not to scratch the wood when scraping the softened old
finish off. Then you can apply two coats of a clear penetrating
sealer such as Minwax Antique Oil or Watco Danish Oil. These dry to
a dull, satin sheen and will darken the wood slightly.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative method would be to apply two or three coats of
clear satin gloss or flat finish varnish that has little shine.
These will not darken the wood as much as the oils and they
eliminate the need for stripping off all of the old finish. All you
have to do is sand the old finish thoroughly to remove all gloss,
then apply the flat varnish directly over the existing finish.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``GHOSTING ON BEAMS AND STUDS'' goes
with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Dust and mildew adhere to slight condensation that
forms on the drywall surface behind which the colder wood studs or
beams are located.

A BAD DAY FOR LENO, BUT NOT FOR AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Leno was in mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst day of my life,'' said the ``Tonight Show''
host as he began his opening monologue.
</P>
<P>
   And just exactly what happened, you might be wondering, to make
Leno so despondent?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle quit the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day for stand-up comics from coast to coast, of
course, because Quayle was one of the great punch lines in the
history of political humor. A comedian could get a laugh just
mentioning Quayle's name.
</P>
<P>
   And few comedians mentioned Quayle's name more often than Leno
did. In honor of the onetime vice president's contributions to the
annals of comedic monology, Leno presented a hilarious farewell
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle will be missed on late-night television and in comedy
venues everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be missed in the race for the Republican
presidential nomination _ a contest to which he contributed
precisely nothing. Quayle was a joke as vice president, and he was
an even bigger joke as a candidate for president. What in the world
ever made him think he had a chance of winning the nomination, much
less the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   We may never know the identity of the culprits who encouraged
Quayle to run for president _ who would admit to such a thing? _
but they did him no favor. Anyone who truly cared about the guy
would have counseled him to spare himself the embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In his dropping-out-of-the-contest news conference Monday,
Quayle blamed front-runner George W. Bush's bankroll and a
front-loaded primary schedule for thwarting his bid to be president
_ excuses that betray the same lack of self-awareness that has
plagued Quayle since he burst onto the national scene in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has always found somebody to blame for the public's
refusal to accept him as a serious political leader _ the media,
the ``cultural elite,'' assorted political enemies _ but he has
never placed the blame where it belongs: on himself. Quayle is not
considered a serious leader because he is not a serious leader.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup poll revealed just how pathetic Quayle's fantasy
of becoming commander in chief really was: 61 percent of those
polled said they would never so much as consider voting for Quayle.
That's pretty much the definition of a no-chance candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   And if he'd been stubborn enough to stay in the race, that 61
percent would surely have increased. When it comes to the
no-way-no-chance-never-in-a-million-years scale of vote-getting
potential, Quayle is in a class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to just plain class, however, Quayle is nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   When Ohio Rep. John Kasich dropped out of the presidential race
a while back, he humbly admitted that the voters weren't interested
in what he had to offer and graciously declared his support for
Bush. Rather than pouting about his campaign being steamrollered by
the Bush fund-raising juggernaut, Kasich swallowed his pride and
signed on with the man whom most Republicans are counting on to
recapture the White House for the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, on the other hand, whined about Bush's dominance in the
money chase and petulantly refused to endorse the front-runner.
You'd think that endorsing Bush would be the least that Quayle
could do, seeing as how it was Bush's father who plucked this
then-Indiana senator out of obscurity and made him vice president
of the United States back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Not that an endorsement from Quayle would be worth much to Bush,
or any other candidate. The legions of Americans who would never
consider voting for Quayle probably wouldn't put much stock in any
recommendation he would make.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Quayle departed the national scene more or less the
same way he arrived _ babbling like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time to stay and a time to fold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently racked with indecision about selecting a metaphor, if
not about the fate of his campaign, Quayle plodded on: ``There's a
time to know when to leave the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Jay Leno is devastated. He'll never find
another stooge like Quayle.

DON'T WASTE TEARS ON CANDLESTICK PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With all the scripted hoopdeblah surrounding the
closing of that venerable old orchard we know and lie about as
Candlestick Park, there is a sense of comfort in knowing that some
people still know the value of a good surprise, delivered well.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the spirit of north-south cooperation and the
beginning of a new era of cheerful co-existence, the Los Angeles
Dodgers contributed to Tuesday's festivities at the boneyard by
firing team president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   Given the depth of feeling toward the Dodgers in these parts,
you can't get much more accommodating than that.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, the Tell It Goodbye promotion needed that
little extra pizazz that only a Dodgers executive being pushed onto
his sword can provide. True, Graziano wasn't as well known as, say,
manager Davey Johnson or general manager Kevin Malone, but he was
second in the club's hierarchy, and besides, there's such a thing
as wishing for too much.
</P>
<P>
   It was rather a busy day at Candlestick Park, as the tedious
countdown toward the opening of the Pacific Bell Park continues.
Manager Dusty Baker announced that Robb Nen's elbow, which at its
most enraged actually glowed in the dark, will finally undergo the
surgery it so richly deserves. This infotidbit might have been
greeted with more joy by the ticket-buyers had the Giants decided
this awhile earlier _ say, August _ but after all, The Promotion
must out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the team announced that left fielder Barry Bonds
will skip the final three games of the year in Denver to undergo
surgery on his right knee. His first-inning double in Tuesday's 6-3
loss to the Dodgers showed clearly that the knee could use a good
hoovering, but he will soldier on through, yes, the last day of The
Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The Promotion, frankly, has been going on so long now that we
are just about ballparked out. For one, all this prepackaged
nostalgia hides the fact that everyone who ever came to Candlestick
Park hated it and everyone associated with it. Truth in advertising
statutes, if enforced, would mean we would be reading more
paragraphs like this: ``I'm going to miss this place,'' Smith said,
lying like a politician under oath as his rapidly growing nose
struck a bystander in the eye. ``I have a lot of great memories
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For two, all the good stories about the ballpark have been told
quite nearly to death, even the really good ones, like the night of
the Great Dodger Riot in 1988 that caused then-general manager Al
Rosen to compare the scene to Iwo Jima and ultimately to close off
the grassy area between the fence and the permanent seats in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   And all because a Tuesday night double-header that ran on until
1:40 a.m. wasn't going the Giants' way _ a double-header made
necessary because the Dodgers wouldn't stay an extra day in April
to play a rainout because so many of them had tickets to see Bruce
Springsteen in Los Angeles on the off day. Many arrests, some
injuries, Dodgers left fielder Kirk Gibson admitting to being
scared _ now that's nostalgia you can't find on any video.
</P>
<P>
   For three, the ballpark isn't actually being torn down, like
Tiger Stadium. It will still stand, sticking its tongue out at the
Bay and becoming the home of the San Francisco 49ers, outdoor
concerts, monster truck rallies and even pit bull battle royals, if
Vince McMahon ever gets hold of the American Kennel Club.
</P>
<P>
   And for four, the backlog of memories is actually pretty
limited. Unlike Tiger Stadium, just to take one example,
Candlestick never was the home of a World Series champion. In its
40 years, it hosted only six Series games, and the two most
lingering memories were Bobby Richardson catching Willie McCovey's
line drive, and the 1989 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The only other contemporary ballparks built before 1990 that
never housed a champion are Anaheim Stadium (now Edison Field),
Montreal's Olympic Stadium (soon to be the world's largest hockey
practice facility), the Astrodome (which loses the Astros next
year), Jack Murphy Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium, and soon to be
abandoned by the Padres), and Wrigley Field, which has its own
issues with success.
</P>
<P>
   We mention this only to point out that it's hard to go all weepy
and gooey for a place that (a) everyone thought was a downwind
abattoir on its best day, (b) isn't being torn down, (c) isn't even
half a century old and (d) hasn't housed a champion. The yard's
best day was the earthquake because it saved 60,000 people from
being killed, and there isn't much marketable nostalgia in that.

STAR-TENDERS WANTED: BIG PAY, LITTLE EGO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in around midnight, and Leeza Tander-Tostenson, a
personal assistant to a handful of Hollywood luminaries, knew who
was calling.
</P>
<P>
   A client, a sometimes testy entertainment mogul, was upset
because his housekeeper had not made his bed properly. So the next
day, she made the bed the way he liked it, then corrected the
housekeeper, who promptly quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just how the job can work,'' Ms. Tander-Tostenson
said. ``If you're someone's personal assistant, they are often lost
without you. You've become part of their brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Once known as girl or guy Fridays, these ultimate helpers to the
megarich are in hot demand, as much a staple of cyberspace-made
millionaires as an American Express platinum card. The Association
of Celebrity Personal Assistants, a trade group founded in 1992,
has become so popular that it turns away 150 people each year who
want to be members. And Keith Greenhouse, who has placed butlers
and other domestic help in New York for 38 years, says the number
of personal assistants placed through his Pavillion Agency has
increased 50 percent in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire Americans are even nabbing high-priced factotums
overseas. The Ivor Spencer International School for Butler
Administrators and Personal Assistants, a leading domestic-help
agency in London, placed 30 of them in the United States last year,
up from about 15 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely more demand now,'' said Ivor Spencer, the
owner. ``It used to be that the personal assistants I trained went
to work for the English aristocracy. But they don't have that kind
of money anymore. American businessmen have it.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal assistant does virtually everything: managing the
house staff, which often includes butler, maid and gardener; paying
the boss' bills; scheduling appointments (including the vet for the
pet); and running interference on any matter that might trouble the
master. One personal assistant said she spent 80 percent of her
time answering her boss' social invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Vailakis, who owns KV Personal Assistants in New York,
does everything for her clients _ mostly Wall Street financiers _
from paying bills to returning newly bought shoes for refunds. Dean
Johnson, a personal assistant for the actress Tiffani-Amber
Thiessen, books travel plans, fields calls from her lawyer and
agent, and oversees the staffs at her homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have an innate ability to get things done,'' Ms.
Tander-Tostenson said. ``If the star asks you for peanut butter
from Japan, you don't ask, `How do I get it?' You just say, `OK'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tander-Tostenson has designed seven bathrooms in one star's
home and advised another on who should be included in his will.
Another personal assistant said that one master of the universe
asked her to alphabetize and organize by genre of music and artist
his compact disk collection, which had more than 1,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how mundane the chore, the boss usually
appreciates its completion. Lindsay Crouse, the actress, who
employs Ms. Tander-Tostenson part time, referred to her fondly as
her left and right arms. ``People like Leeza aren't squeamish about
dealing with the plumber or getting the light bulbs,'' she said.
``And she really understands the service she's providing.''
</P>
<P>
   The best personal assistants tend to be assertive people with
strong organizational skills. Employment experts say that a small
ego certainly helps, since the boss and his needs must always come
first.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the ideal personal assistant is a man or woman,
one school of thought favors women on the ground that they know
more about running a household, while another holds that men have
the edge because wives do not want female aides-de-camp following
their husbands around. (In fact, a growing number of women,
especially actresses, are hiring personal assistants.)
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past 20 years, I've only trained six ladies,'' said
Spencer, the owner of the London butler agency. ``I tell them to
behave themselves. They must not ever upstage the lady of the house
or the chief executive's wife. They can only wear a hint of
lipstick and a proper suit, certainly with no cleavage.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaries of personal assistants usually fall between $50,000 and
$80,000, but can swell beyond $100,000. Perks often include medical
insurance, paid vacation, free travel and a front-row seat to how
the wealthy live.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant said it would be hard to beat her work site _ an
opulent Manhattan apartment. And Jackie Moses, chief attendant to
Sela Ward of the ABC show ``Once and Again,'' sometimes travels
with her and has attended Emmy Award rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become very involved with the star's personal life,'' Ms.
Moses said. ``But you have to separate your life from theirs. It's
a career like any other in Hollywood, like their agent or
publicist. We work with all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosses often demand that their assistants keep their mouths
shut, especially to tabloids. The assistants say they are often
only too familiar with their bosses' habits. One, who has done
stints for both men and women, said she had become well versed on
the sex lives of several. ``You're in their house,'' she said.
``You know everything. Sometimes they tell you about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said that years ago, personal assistants who graduated
from his school, which costs about $7,000 for a six-week course,
needed almost nothing else to start a job. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were used to sending people to be trained in how to value
antiques or furniture,'' he said. ``But now people want to hire a
super personal assistant. These employers call and ask for someone
who can fly a helicopter or airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The 125 members of the Association of Celebrity Personal
Assistants meet once a month to exchange ideas on how to do their
jobs better. One coming seminar will examine security and celebrity
stalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you should know about the people we work for is that
they are extremely busy,'' Ms. Tander-Tostenson said. ``They
deserve to have a personal assistant. Everybody needs a personal
assistant. They may not be able to afford one.''

   He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted
for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100
percent. The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor
and the doctor said, `Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be
really pleased you can hear again.` To which the gentleman said,
`Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to

 &HT;    There is little fan forgiveness for WWF's `Unforgiven'
 &HT;    ANALYSIS
 &HT;    Every time it looks like WWF President Vince McMahon has added a
key piece, someone else goes down.
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll have to forgive me if I didn't walk away from the World
Wrestling Federation's latest pay-per-view event _ ``Unforgiven'' _
less than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I expect a little more. A little more action, a little
more excitement, a little more imagination and a few more surprises
from Vinny Mac and the boys from Titan Towers.
</P>
<P>
   With the company going public in a matter of days and another
pay-per-view on Sunday, the Sept. 26 show from Charlotte, N.C.,
could've been the first step to one of the biggest weeks ever for
the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the live show was well-attended and will probably generate
a solid rating from the pay-per-view television audience, but the
show was more like a newtork ``Raw'' or ``Smackdown'' in terms of
results instead of a cable offering. Triple H's win of the title
was expected and no new angles were started or even completed (Jeff
Jarrett and Chyna will battle again at the ``No Mercy''
pay-per-view).
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the WWF is that the success of its weekly
television shows has left the fans looking for more out of the
pay-per-views. It hasn't happened to date, but the WWF will have
many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   As for now, every time it looks like Vince McMahon has added a
key piece, someone else goes down. Less than a week after adding
ECW star Taz to the fold, Ken Shamrock was shelved by a major
injury. The Ultimate Fighting Championship star has a neck injury
that could require surgery, possibly spelling the end of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss of megastar Shawn Michaels to career-ending back
surgery and the uncertain future of The Undertaker, McMahon will be
pounding the independent wrestling trail for more talent such as
Reckless Youth and Mike Quackenbush, or he might be interested in
bringing back old stars like Vader or Yokozuna.

   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Some home cookin' seems to have hit the spot for the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   There was a giddy buzz backstage at the sparkling new Philips
Arena, future home of the Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Thrashers. As
``Monday Nitro'' wrestlers and roadies shuttled back and forth, the
upbeat mood was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Goldberg, as he stopped to take a
photograph with a young fan.
</P>
<P>
   In the arena, thousands of shouting fans were shaking the walls
to welcome a new World Championship Wrestling back home for this
week's show. The show was the first televised event under the
stewardship of Bill Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what's going to happen,'' said Brad Johnson of
Knoxville, Tenn. ``I hope it's much of the same stuff. I admit it,
I love this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nitro'' show seemed to indicate the open checkbook wielded
by former WCW chief Eric Bischoff was starting to close and it
looks like many other changes are sweeping over Atlanta-based WCW.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Busch has begun to cut what is believed to
be a bloated WCW roster, cut down on the house shows, change
direction of story lines and put some organization into the TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's first ``Nitro'' show went off without a hitch for
television viewers, generated some interest in the upcoming
pay-per-view and had enough surprises to keep the audience from
switching the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the behind-the-scenes differences that
can be attributed to Busch's reign:
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the fat
</P>
<P>
   One thing Bischoff had a problem doing was getting rid of
contracts on people who were not producing enough revenue. Maybe he
was ``Stone Cold'' with fear _ the fear that Vince McMahon's World
Wrestling Federation machine would turn another WCW castoff like
Stone Cold Steve Austin into a mega-star.
</P>
<P>
   Busch has chosen not to fear the unknown and has cut several
wrestlers. Wrestlers such as Brian Adams, Scott Norton and Horace
Hogan do not have a role since the New World Order broke up nearly
a year ago. With the expected departure of Randy Savage at the end
of the year, his brother Lanny Poffo has been dropped from the fold
along with former Savage sidekicks Madusa and Miss Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Having a plan
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints backstage at WCW shows was a lack
of planning before live television shows. At one time, the shows
were staged minutes before they were aired.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not good enough for Busch, who is putting an end to
the ``on the fly'' bookings that have wasted a lot of money and
time while also causing a lot of friction among wrestlers. It was
common for WCW to fly in a group of wrestlers the night of a show's
taping and never use them. Busch wants story lines done a week in
advance of an event and eventually three months in advance of
shows.
</P>
<P>
   That planning will help ``Nitro'' promote future shows and story
lines, an example being the recent six-man tag team match in
Atlanta that was ``signed'' the week before so fans knew what they
would get.
</P>
<P>
   Less talk, more action
</P>
<P>
   The Nitro show has received an overhaul in terms of its
programming and all for the better. Boring opening matches have
been replaced by good matches like Chris Benoit vs. Dean Malenko
two weeks ago and Benoit defending his TV title against Ernest
Miller to open the Atlanta show.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the constant chat sessions have been limited to one per
hour instead of two-to-three.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything
</P>
<P>
   WCW has struggled for years to keep its 8 o'clock audience from
switching to the WWF at 9 p.m. One way Busch is seeking to halt
this is by scheduling good matches starting at 8:57 p.m. and
running them through the opening of WWF's ``Raw is War.'' In
Atlanta, headliner Goldberg began his match at 8:57 p.m. and it
lasted until 9:10 p.m. The move helps keep viewers from the opening
of the WWF show, which is the point where most of the night's
matches are made.
</P>
<P>
   Fans didn't seem to notice the behind-the-scenes differences and
simply enjoyed the wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a good job. The flips were real good, '' said
Jason Holcomb, 8, of Atlanta. ``It's still cool.''

A COLORFUL ST. PETER'S RAISES EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Baroque architecture was much inspired by the theater,
and for centuries the grand facade of St. Peter's Basilica has been
the central backdrop for the religious drama of the papacy. This
week, with a show of fireworks and a solemn papal blessing by Pope
John Paul II, the Vatican is rededicating Carlo Maderno's
magnificent 17th-century facade after a three-year, $5.4 million
restoration that has revived a passionate debate over preservation
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge faced by Maderno, a master of the Baroque, was to
provide a facade for the magnificent church, which was conceived by
the Renaissance architect Donato Bramante and crowned by
Michelangelo's immense dome over the altar.
</P>
<P>
   What provoked the current debate was the discovery that Maderno,
whose facade was built from 1607 to 1612, during the pontificate of
Paul V, appeared to have enhanced the effect of his architecture by
the discreet use of color. The restoration revived a dull straw
color along a broad expanse of the facade that contrasts with the
white of the travertine marble columns in front of it. The frame
around the central balcony from which popes for centuries have
imparted their blessing ``Urbi et Orbi'' (``To the city and to the
world'') is in delicate shades of red and green.
</P>
<P>
   Renato Nicolini, a former commissioner of culture in Rome's city
government, decried the restoration as ``post-modern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the desire to transform everything into a movie set,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Bertelli, an architectural historian, was equally
dismissive. Belittling the facade's restored shade as the ``color
of tobacco,'' and using the English word ``beautification'' as if
to suggest a project inspired by Disney, he complained that ``the
televised image had won out over the real monument.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration was prompted by a desire to beautify the
basilica, the central church of Christendom, and its piazza for the
Jubilee celebration next year for the start of Christianity's third
millennium. In recent months, workers finished restoring the
sweeping colonnade, which was completed in 1666 by Gianlorenzo
Bernini to embrace the immense piazza.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in recent years that the Vatican has
completed a major restoration, after the cleaning of Michelangelo's
frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, and the debate over the facade
seems to echo recriminations over the restoration of the chapel.
Art historians and restorers were stunned by the revelation of
Michelangelo's bright colors. Still, some feared that the work had
been permanently disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Maderno's use of color was not the only striking discovery
during the basilica's restoration. Close measurements of the facade
with computerized equipment showed that the left side, as seen when
facing the basilica, was roughly 16 inches lower than the right
because of settlement in the unstable ground below. Maderno had
added bell towers at the extremities when Pope Paul deemed the
original facade too narrow for Michelangelo's massive construction.
</P>
<P>
   Bernini was commissioned in the 1640s to carry the bell towers
higher than the present height of the facade, but work was
interrupted and the construction dismantled when the building's
settlement rapidly accelerated, threatening the entire facade. The
restorers studied four tears in the facade that were partly caused
by settling that began almost immediately after completion.
</P>
<P>
   Car and bus exhaust added to the soot from centuries of
wax-torch illumination of the facade on high-feast days, dulling
the building's contours to a uniform gray. Such damage masked
details of a facade that Sandro Benedetti, a professor of
architecture at La Sapienza, the main campus of the University of
Rome, describes as ``one of the first works that open the chapter
of the Roman Baroque.''
</P>
<P>
   The facade is generating more public interest than usual because
of a broader debate about the colors of Rome as the city spruces up
for the Jubilee. As one after another of Rome's restored palazzi
emerge from beneath centuries of soot, bright pastel shades of
pink, gray and yellow are replacing the more familiar ocher and
terra-cotta hues that visitors have long associated with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The new tints are a result of research into color samples and
early depictions of the city showing that in the 16th and 17th
centuries, when much of the Baroque city received its present
shape, architects favored such bright tones.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti, who oversaw the facade's restoration, defended the
restoration of the original color. Detailed study of many samples
of stone extracted from the facade, he said, clearly showed a layer
of color between the stone and thick layers of pollutants.
Depictions of the facade in early illustrations, including a fresco
in the Vatican Library, also show the contrast in color between the
wall of the facade and the columns. Moreover, he said, documents of
the Fabbrica di San Pietro, the office entrusted since the 1500s
with maintaining the basilica, record the purchase of many brushes
to paint the facade.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent news conference, Benedetti explained that Maderno
used color to add depth and movement to the flat facade. ``It is my
task to interpret the meaning of those colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who agreed with the historical accuracy of the
restoration do not entirely approve.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Portoghesi, a professor of architectural history in Rome,
acknowledged that the colors represented ``exactly what Maderno
did, the idea of his project.'' Yet he added, in a recent interview
with La Repubblica newspaper that ``the criticism is more than
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parthenon, for instance, was blue, red and cream,'' he
continued. ``But what would happen if some archaeologist dreamed of
painting the Parthenon the way it was? Certainly there would be an
insurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti said the restoration was not a wholesale return to the
original. Not by chance, he said, had the restorers refrained from
restoring the color of the upper reaches of the facade, above the
line of columns. The paint there had been washed away so thoroughly
by centuries of rain that no traces of it could be found.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration ``was not aimed at an integral reconstruction of
Maderno's image, but rather to present it as transformed in some
places by the life of the monument,'' Benedetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, was to preserve both ``the qualities invented
by Maderno and those transformations of a qualitative nature that
the centuries have left with us.''

by former WCW chief Eric Bischoff was starting to close and it
looks like many other changes are sweeping over Atlanta-based WCW.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Busch has begun to cut what is believed to
be a bloated WCW roster, cut down on the house shows, change
direction of story lines and put some organization into the TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's first ``Nitro'' show went off without a hitch for
television viewers, generated some interest in the upcoming
pay-per-view and had enough surprises to keep the audience from
switching the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the behind-the-scenes differences that
can be attributed to Busch's reign:
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the fat
</P>
<P>
   One thing Bischoff had a problem doing was getting rid of
contracts on people who were not producing enough revenue. Maybe he
was ``Stone Cold'' with fear _ the fear that Vince McMahon's World
Wrestling Federation machine would turn another WCW castoff like
Stone Cold Steve Austin into a mega-star.
</P>
<P>
   Busch has chosen not to fear the unknown and has cut several
wrestlers. Wrestlers such as Brian Adams, Scott Norton and Horace
Hogan do not have a role since the New World Order broke up nearly
a year ago. With the expected departure of Randy Savage at the end
of the year, his brother Lanny Poffo has been dropped from the fold
along with former Savage sidekicks Madusa and Miss Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Having a plan
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints backstage at WCW shows was a lack
of planning before live television shows. At one time, the shows
were staged minutes before they were aired.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not good enough for Busch, who is putting an end to
the ``on the fly'' bookings that have wasted a lot of money and
time while also causing a lot of friction among wrestlers. It was
common for WCW to fly in a group of wrestlers the night of a show's
taping and never use them. Busch wants story lines done a week in
advance of an event and eventually three months in advance of
shows.
</P>
<P>
   That planning will help ``Nitro'' promote future shows and story
lines, an example being the recent six-man tag team match in
Atlanta that was ``signed'' the week before so fans knew what they
would get.
</P>
<P>
   Less talk, more action
</P>
<P>
   The Nitro show has received an overhaul in terms of its
programming and all for the better. Boring opening matches have
been replaced by good matches like Chris Benoit vs. Dean Malenko
two weeks ago and Benoit defending his TV title against Ernest
Miller to open the Atlanta show.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the constant chat sessions have been limited to one per
hour instead of two-to-three.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything
</P>
<P>
   WCW has struggled for years to keep its 8 o'clock audience from
switching to the WWF at 9 p.m. One way Busch is seeking to halt
this is by scheduling good matches starting at 8:57 p.m. and
running them through the opening of WWF's ``Raw is War.'' In
Atlanta, headliner Goldberg began his match at 8:57 p.m. and it
lasted until 9:10 p.m. The move helps keep viewers from the opening
of the WWF show, which is the point where most of the night's
matches are made.
</P>
<P>
   Fans didn't seem to notice the behind-the-scenes differences and
simply enjoyed the wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a good job. The flips were real good, '' said
Jason Holcomb, 8, of Atlanta. ``It's still cool.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In San Diego, comments at public hearings can be submitted by
e-mail. Boston residents can use the city's Web site to complain
about broken street signs or to pay parking tickets and excise
taxes. And in Indianapolis, taxpayers can get electronic copies of
the city budget and rework them, then send them to Mayor Stephen
Goldsmith just to show him how they would do his job.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is called electronic government, and it means giving
people access to a wide range of municipal services and information
through the Internet. In cities across the country, it is rapidly
changing the way people interact with city halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think back to the banking industry,'' said Allan H. Dobrin,
New York City's commissioner of Information Technology and
Telecommunications. ``You basically had to go into a branch, stand
on line and see a teller. Now none of us do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That same kind of paradigm switch will happen in government
now. People will get all of their services without having to go to
a government office.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipal sites on the World Wide Web like NYC Link, New York's
site (www.ci.nyc.ny.us/home.html), already offer information about
services and events and let people get government forms, register
complaints or communicate with officials via e-mail. The site has
been available since July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of electronic government is to go beyond offering
information and communication by enabling residents to do business
directly with their local governments. By relying more on computers
and less on workers, cities hope to save money as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some city Web sites are already offering a number of services.
The Indianapolis site, Indygov (www.indygov.org), for example,
provides information about polling places, parks and zoning issues.
But the site also lets residents pay parking tickets and submit
applications for electrical permits. And in San Carlos, Calif.,
contractors will soon be able to schedule building inspections with
just a point and a click
(www.ci.san-carlos.ca.us/building/smartpermit.html).
</P>
<P>
   The move toward electronic government raises logistical
challenges and some legal issues, and there are questions about
security and privacy, similar to the ones that have arisen with
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But since this is government, there are also concerns about
making such services accessible to more people. While anyone can
get in touch with city hall on the phone or in person, many people,
particularly older or poorer ones, lack computers and Internet
access. So there is a concern that as more emphasis is placed on
electronic government, the result will be two tiers of service, one
for people with Net access and the other for the rest of a city's
residents.
</P>
<P>
   State governments and the federal government are also moving to
provide more information and services electronically, but on a
daily basis, people interact far more frequently with their local
officials and bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   No city is the clear leader in the move toward electronic
government, but several are in the forefront in making available
different types of services. Boston, for example, offers its
residents the quickest way to pay parking tickets: fines can be
settled as soon as someone types in a violation number and credit
card information (www.ci.boston.ma.us/transactions).
</P>
<P>
   San Carlos, Calif., a small city in Silicon Valley, is one of
the leaders in online building permits. Residents will soon be able
to go to a Web site and view plans for any development project
under way in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Local contractors can check the status of their permit
applications 24 hours a day without having to call a government
office, and they will soon be able to check on the next inspection
required for a project and to schedule it by clicking on a date and
time on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, contractors will be able to submit and pay for
their applications by computer, said Brian Maura, the assistant
city manager and the driving force behind the effort in San Carlos.
Maura said the most common question asked by contractors was,
```Who has got my permit now?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they can check it any time,'' he said, ``and they can even
check it when we're closed. It's the classic example of
self-service government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Chamberlain, the owner of a construction company in San
Carlos, has used the new system and said he hoped that it would do
more than just keep him better informed. ``The permit processing
time out here takes forever,'' he said. ``By having a source to go
to, I think it puts the people who are doing the processing on the
line. Somebody is looking over their shoulder. That may help them
move a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Constituents are not the only ones who want government to be
more efficient. In Indianapolis, Goldsmith has challenged his staff
to come up with two ideas for new electronic services each week. In
response, the city now has a database of 158 potential new
services, including plans for an interactive community calendar,
said Ken Barlow, the project manager for the city's electronic
government effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are at 5 percent of what we should be,'' Goldsmith
said. ``We want to change the definition of customer service so
people don't have to go to city hall to do business with city
hall.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with some of the security and privacy concerns,
Indianapolis is requiring people who use certain electronic
services to make a final trip to city hall to put a signature on
file and sign up for a user name and password. ``Everything that
you submit with that user name and password, you have signed away
that you are responsible for that,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a debate over which online transactions are
so sensitive that passwords should be required. Officials in
Indianapolis have still not decided, for example, whether to
require passwords for residents to have access to their tax bills
and whether that information should be made available
electronically to anyone who submits an address in the system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the city can allow certain documents to be submitted
electronically without signatures, others must be submitted on
paper and have a signature at the bottom to be legal. ``It gets
back to the big change from paper to electronic,'' Barlow said.
``Some of the laws are geared for paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, creating a true electronic government would
require a complete reconfiguration of the equipment and systems
that a city uses to do business. While many city agencies have
computer systems to handle all sorts of information, those systems
are designed for municipal workers to type in information that is
received from constituents by mail, on paper or over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities have already adopted policies of not buying any new
equipment, and not even scheduling upgrades for old equipment,
unless the equipment can be used to connect through the city's Web
site with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and San Diego, officials are moving a little more
slowly toward electronic government, in part to be sure that the
services are provided ``end to end,'' which means that at no point
is information reprocessed by, for example, printing it out and
retyping it.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Grinnell, a spokesman for the city of San Diego, explained,
``What we have decided is not to have any of the fluff stuff but
actually do the whole gamut of the transaction without manual
intervention.'' In the meantime, he said, Mayor Susan Golding and
other officials accept public testimony as well as complaints and
requests for services by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, officials hope to be able to conduct virtually
all municipal business by computer within the next five years.
Eventually, they said, it will seem prehistoric to stand in line at
a government office to do things like paying taxes, fines and fees
or applying for various permits. The advertising and awarding of
city contracts will also be done electronically.
</P>
<P>
   New York has installed a high-speed internal computing network
that will connect all of the city's agencies and will serve as the
backbone of the city's electronic government effort. The city is
already working with International Business Machines to develop a
system that will serve as a one-stop online payment center, where
residents will be able to pay all fines, fees, taxes and other
municipal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies are seeking ways to profit from providing
Internet services for governments. The chief executive of Govworks,
Kaleil D. Isaza Tuzman, said his company, based in New York, might
charge transaction fees of a few cents for people using the sites
but hoped to make most of its money from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a person going online to pay a $35 parking
ticket might pay the fine plus a fee of a few cents. Or that person
might get a discount on the fine in exchange for accepting
information from advertisers, like automobile insurance companies.
The advertisers would cover the discounts' cost.
</P>
<P>
   Once municipalities make many of their services available,
government technology experts say, local officials will have to be
careful to insure equal access. ``Not everyone has access to the
Internet,'' said Dale Bowen, the director of online services at
Public Technology, a joint research arm for three large
associations of municipalities. ``So how do you adjust for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's group, which acts as a coordinator for a group of
municipal Web site managers who meet to share ideas, recommends
that computers be provided in public libraries and that electronic
kiosks giving access to the city's Web site be installed in
government buildings. Many cities, like New York, have already done
so; New York has made kiosks available in all five borough halls.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several years, as the various components of each
city's electronic government are built, computer users will
probably find themselves able to conduct some transactions online
while still having to stand in line at government offices to
conduct others.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for instance, excise taxes for cars and motorcycles
can be paid online, but the same tax for boats cannot be.
</P>
<P>
   As new services become available, officials say, the rewards
will come not just in time savings but in budget savings as well.
``As the Internet expands, we are cutting our bottom-line expenses,
and that's a huge advantage to your taxpayer,'' said Kyle Tager,
Boston's director of online services. ``Any time a person doesn't
have to pick up a phone and bother a city employee, it makes it
easier for everyone.''

village. Here, they speak Arabic, practice the mysterious Alawite

   MEXICO-ALLIANCE _ MEXICO CITY _ One political player here calls
it ``the blunder of the century for Mexico's opposition.'' Late
Tuesday night talks definitely crumbled to forge a sweeping
coalition that could have probably defeated Mexico's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, in next year's presidential election.
Most polls show that an alliance among virtually all of Mexico's
opposition parties _ from right to left _ would have driven the PRI
from the presidency after more than 70 in power. Polls also showed
that Mexicans wanted to see the formation of a coalition. But
opposition leaders failed to show leadership, analysts say. Now the

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Janese Swanson, inventor and founder of Girl Tech
toys, has some ideas about what little girls like. Even during a
recent interview over lunch in Manhattan, she couldn't stop herself
from brainstorming, thinking of new toy ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while she picked over her grilled tuna, she had an
idea for placating picky eaters: jigsaw-shape cutters that would
turn a boring peanut butter and jelly sandwich into an edible
puzzle. Or for fidgety young airline passengers, a travel book with
see-through pocket pages to hold postcards, souvenirs and foreign
money.
</P>
<P>
   Want more ideas? Ms. Swanson has a million of them. But unlike
countless other mothers who fantasize about creating whine-stopping
diversions for their children, she sees some of her ideas hit the
market.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Ms. Swanson is the creator of a line of affordable
electronic gadgets for girls. Some of her recent toys, which are
manufactured under Radica Games' Girl Tech brand, include the Door
Pass, which sets off an alarm if anyone tries to sneak into its
owner's bedroom, and the Beam-It flashlight, which works like a
projector to flash written messages (e.g., ``I luv U 4-ever'') on a
darkened wall.
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular creation has been the Password Journal, a
voice-activated plastic box the size of a book. The box holds a
diary that is accessible only if its owner speaks the password.

   The Password Journal costs $19.99, and girls from age 8 to 12
apparently think that this is a small price to pay to prevent pesky
siblings from snooping. In the months since the Password Journal's
debut in February, it has climbed onto the list of the top 10
best-selling toys nationwide in the youth electronics category,
according to the NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y., which tracks
toy sales at major retailers. In June the Password Journal ranked
third when average unit sales for the stores surveyed were
tabulated, behind the Sing-A-Long Cassette Player and Flip Phone
Walkie Talkie, both from DSI Toys.
</P>
<P>
   In the toy market, where almost anything electronic is
automatically labeled a boys' product, the Girl Tech gadgets are
remarkable not just because they sell but also because they
contradict the sex stereotypes that the industry seems to hold
dear.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're not pink. For another, they have nothing
whatsoever to do with dolls or ponies. And perhaps most important,
they appeal to the idea that girls, like boys, enjoy playing with
gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swanson, who has a doctorate in education from the
University of San Francisco, is adamant about the fact that girls
should be allowed to revel in their, well, girlness without being
stigmatized for it. ``They don't like the same kinds of toys boys
like, but they still like electronic toys,'' she said. ``They need
opportunities to be mischievous and adventurous, but they also
really want to identify with their own gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Her approach seems to work. While some other putatively
girl-friendly ventures have stumbled recently _ most notably, the
highly touted Purple Moon software company, which is being bought
by Mattel _ Radica has plans to expand its Girl Tech line with two
new toys later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Janese understands what girls think is fun,
and she has managed to combine that with what she knows about all
the academic research about what fosters growth and independence,''
said Pat Feely, Radica's president and chief executive. ``Some
other people who tried this ended up with products that have a real
appeal to moms, but not to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, Ms. Swanson's toys fall between ardently
pro-feminist software, like Purple Moon's Rockett series, and the
hot-pink Barbie laptop computer. In the early 1990s, while working
on her doctorate, Ms. Swanson interviewed 60 children to determine
if girls and boys played differently. She said she had concluded
that girls liked role-playing, just as boys did, ``but different
roles from the ones boys like, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake that some products for girls make is that they
don't take that desire into consideration,'' Ms. Swanson said.
``They focus on the everyday realities of their lives. But girls
don't need toys that focus on going to school or playing soccer
because they already do those things all day.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's another theme to Ms. Swanson's toys, it might be
privacy. Like diaries with a lock and key, the Password Journal and
Door Pass seem to feed the instinct for a secret life. ``They can
have adventures with their secret notebooks or can spy on their
little brothers who are trying to sneak into their rooms,'' Ms.
Swanson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that emerged from Ms. Swanson's own childhood, said
her mother, Jenna Plein. ``She had a notebook that she carried
around all the time, and she got terribly upset when her sister
would get near it,'' said Ms. Plein, a beautician who brought up
Janese (pronounced Jan-NIECE) and five other children primarily as
a single parent. ``She had to share everything _ her bedroom,
everything _ and the notebook was her one private thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The toys that Ms. Swanson played with as a child tended to fall
more into the category of debris. Discarded pieces of cardboard,
for instance, became sleighs she rode down the canyon near the
house her mother rented in San Diego. Then there was the family
blender, which she took apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't afford too many toys,'' her mother said. ``So she
was always inventing something on her own, or trying to figure out
how something worked. Come to think of it, the blender never was
put back together.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Ms. Swanson had dreams of becoming a doctor, but
those hopes were discouraged. ``In high school I was told that boys
become doctors and girls become nurses,'' said Ms. Swanson, who
graduated from Orange Glen High School in San Diego in 1975. ``I
didn't know any better _ I was the only one in my family who had
gone through high school at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she went through a succession of jobs, including:
</P>
<P>
   1. House cleaner. ``In grade school, I worked for my mom's
customers. She did their hair, I did their bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Sales clerk at Sears. ``I was the top salesperson in stereos
and radios. I made a lot of money for an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Elementary school teacher. ``I just loved watching the way
kids' minds worked. Then the district had to cut 40 teachers. I
didn't have three years' seniority, so I got laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Flight attendant. ``It was the early 1980s, and they made us
wear what they called regulation lips: red lipstick.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Model. ``One time at a job, this guy said, `Stick your tongue
out _ I need to see how your tongue looks.' This was for an ad
where you had to lick ice cream. I said, `Stick your own tongue
out,' and walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, after a brief marriage that produced her
daughter, Jackie, now 12, Ms. Swanson was hired by Broderbund
Software as a product manager.
</P>
<P>
   Two products she helped shape were the Treehouse and Playroom
series, which were among Broderbund's earliest early childhood
titles. She also worked on the Macintosh edition of the popular
Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?
</P>
<P>
   ``She sees the world the way it will be a year or two from now,
not the way it is now,'' said Tom Marcus, a former vice president
for business development at Broderbund. ``She showed a real passion
for that early childhood category long before it had market
acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swanson said working at Broderbund had burned her out. ``It
was long, long hours, and they were paying me less than $40,000 a
year, and I was a single mother,'' Ms. Swanson said. ``I missed my
daughter, Jackie, who was in day care, so I started inventing
gadgets for her.''
</P>
<P>
   One was a recording device that Ms. Swanson hoped to install in
Jackie's day-care cubby and in her own office. ``I missed her so
much that I used to call my home answering machine to hear her
voice,'' Ms. Swanson said, ``and I thought this would let me talk
to her during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That inspired Ms. Swanson's first commercial success, a handheld
recording device that changes a voice's sound so a speaker can
sound as if, say, she has just inhaled helium. In 1992, Ms. Swanson
left Broderbund to develop the technology, which she licensed to
both Yes Entertainment, which marketed it as the Yak Bak, and to
Tiger Electronics for its Talkboy FX.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after Ms. Swanson decided to create toys aimed at
girls, she founded Girl Tech as an independent company with
headquarters in San Rafael, Calif., where she lives. But the
venture floundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years after I founded the company,'' she said, ``toy
store buyers would say, `Can you make it pink?' `Can't you make it
for boys?' And I would say, `No, this is what girls like to play
with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the industry's annual Toy Fair in New York City in
early 1998, Ms. Swanson met Feely of Radica. ``I have a daughter,
and I knew right away that Janese had zeroed in on how to make
something that girls would not find too boring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radica acquired Ms. Swanson's company in 1998 for $6 million and
expects to sell $7 million worth of Girl Tech products this year,
Feely said. Not all of the current line has been successful. Ms.
Swanson is considering new packaging for the flashlight and said a
talking picture frame would probably be discontinued soon.
</P>
<P>
   In November, two new Girl Tech toys will go on sale nationwide.
They are a Keepsafe Box ($19.99), which has a remote-controlled
lock and is designed to store valuables, and Bug 'Em ($19.99), a
remote listening device that enables the user to eavesdrop on
conversations in another room.
</P>
<P>
   And after that? ``I think I really want to invent some gadgets
for women,'' Ms. Swanson said. ``I have some ideas about what they
might like.''

 &HT;    STUDY SAYS CARS ARE NOT A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cars and light trucks account for less than a
quarter of smog pollution in major cities, the AAA Motor Club said
in a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most smog comes from sources such as power plants and
refineries, AAA said in its study of 25 major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Auto emissions have been steadily declining since 1970, said AAA
spokesperson Susan Pikrallidas. She said that is mainly the result
of tighter federal emissions standards, more effective state auto
inspections and cleaner-burning gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When trying to make the air cleaner, you can't continue to
bang on motorists because it's not their fault,'' said Lon
Anderson, another AAA spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Pikrallidas stressed that the study was based on data provided
by local governments, not AAA. The findings were not meant to
discourage car pooling or other measures designed to improve air
quality but to send the message that other pollution sources must
be curbed, Pikrallidas said.

<P>
   Hey, how would you like to labor on something for a year or two
or five or six and then be told it's rotten? It happens every day,
and it happens eventually to every author, no matter how applauded:
the howling wind of the bad review. Years of work, of lonely
intellectual wandering, hit by the blast. And how does the writer
learn the bad news?
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for writers to  &UR; say &LR;  they don't want to see
any bad reviews. Others avow they don't want to be told either the
bad or the good, and only the writer knows if a peek is sneaked.
Since not even Shakespeare got solely good reviews, all writers
have to learn to cope with  &UR; the reviewer. &LR;  For instance, the
novelist Mary Gordon, who has had high praise and low knocks, put
the predicament this way: ``A good review never feels as good as a
bad one feels bad. I never want to know either way.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this is how she deals with reviews now: ``My friends, my
editors, my agent, they were all told not to tell me. They put my
reviews in envelopes and send them to me, and I hide them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's always that helpful friend who will say, `Boy, did
you get it!' I just finished a biography of Joan of Arc. She used
to say, `If you do that to me again, I'll cut your head off.'
That's what I want to say.'' To reviewers and friends who blab.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of reviews is, of course, endlessly fascinating and
perhaps always frightening and mysterious and frustrating to people
in book publishing. So much so that Pushcart Press has published
``Rotten Reviews and Rejections,'' and has sold about 70,000 copies
in its various editions, mostly, one supposes, to writers and their
publishing colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   This highly amusing book is a collection of blurb-size excerpts
of bad reviews of the works of great and/or popular writers. It's a
feel-good book for authors. If Henry James and Mark Twain can get
bad reviews, the contemporary writer can ask, then what the devil
do reviewers really know anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   Writers react to reviews in as many ways as there are reviews to
react to. Mary Higgins Clark, the best-selling author of suspense
novels, sometimes finds reviews helpful. She describes their value
this way: ``I read any I get from my publisher's clipping service,
to see if there's a consistency in them. If everyone says that the
characters are wooden, then generally I would be concerned. I say
to myself, `Lady, what are you doing wrong?' But if one says the
characters are wooden and another says they leap off the pages,
that's not helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love good reviews and cordially despise the bad ones. They
are engraved on my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspense is not ``literary,'' so a writer of Ms. Clark's popular
success can become a joyful target for some reviewers, leaving her
open to a certain snobbish glee that comes from giving such a
writer a kick. But she uses it. ``I want to be good,'' she said.
``I don't want the book I'm writing to sound like the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   A cliche about writers is that they are somehow frangible,
although one would think it takes a pretty tough-minded person to
sit alone day after day and churn out 600 or more pages of
manuscript. Still, while no one really knows whether good reviews
sell books and bad ones kill them, there is agreement that positive
reviews are at least excellent for the psyche. So however the
writer feels about these evaluations, the publisher generally tries
to be as sensitive as the skin on a ripe peach when dealing with
the authors' reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Segal, senior editor at Knopf, said that bad or good,
``I want my authors to hear about their reviews from me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fax them a note, or I read them to them on the phone,'' he
said. ``I try to read all their reviews, and if they are negative
or unfair, I send them along to the writers who want them with a
note telling them my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He underlines good ones and puts them on the Random House Web
site, randomhouse.com, which is linked to Amazon.com and other Web
sites and in that way circulates the good. His attitude about
publishing ``is to inform the writer about everything,'' he said.
``I want them to be surprised upward rather than disappointed
downward. If an author really doesn't want to know about reviews, I
respect that, except if it's a rave. Then I take it upon myself to
share it with the writer anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Meyer, director of public relations for Simon &AMP;
Schuster, said: ``If there's a specially unfortunate review, I
consult with the book's editor, and we try to find a favorable
review to counter the bad. You don't want to shield the writer from
a bad review if the consequence is that the writer will hear about
it from a friend. It's better if there are several reviews
simultaneously, something to restore balance to the writer's
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Simon is review-hardened from his years as a playwright.
(His first book, the memoir ``Rewrites,'' received generally
favorable reviews when it was published by Simon &AMP; Schuster in
1996; his continuation of that memoir, ``The Play Goes On,'' just
arrived in bookstores.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You open the play and read 45 reviews right away,'' he said.
``A book is out a week or so, and maybe you've seen one or two
reviews. People take time with books, and the reviews are not as
damaging as the sudden newspaper and television reviews that don't
like a play, so we close it on Saturday. You don't close a book on
Saturdays.''
</P>
<P>
   As for authors who say they don't read their reviews, Simon
said, ``They're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for Gore Vidal, the astonishingly eclectic writer
who himself is the subject of a biography by Fred Kaplan that is
being published by Doubleday in October. He has 100 publishers
around the world, many working in languages distant to his ear,
``so I'm fairly indifferent to reviewers,'' he said. ``When I'm
not, the public will hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he learned anything from his many reviewers, he paused
a moment, and answered: ``Are you crazy? They should be learning
from me. But they're too dumb.''

DESPITE CASINOS, BILOXI HASN'T FORGOTTEN ITS DEEP SOUTH ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BILOXI-ITINERARY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ On its September cover, Travel Holiday magazine
asked the question somebody was bound to ask: ``Is Biloxi really
the new Vegas?''
</P>
<P>
   Fair question. This spring, the Mississippi coast gambling mecca
welcomed its biggest and grandest and most Las Vegasy resort yet _
the much-talked-about Beau Rivage, a 1,780-room behemoth complete
with 12 restaurants, a European-style casino, Aveda products in the
marble bathrooms, a marina big enough to accommodate 200-foot
yachts, and a resident company of Montreal's Cirque du Soleil. Its
owner? Steve Wynn's Mirage Corp., which opened last year's
most-talked-about casino, the fine-art-laden Bellagio, in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beau Rivage is no Bellagio. And Biloxi is no Las Vegas.
We mean both of those in the best of ways.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike Las Vegas, Biloxi has a long history, both
as a city and as a tourist attraction. It was founded on the Gulf
Coast of Mississipi in 1699 by French explorer Pierre LeMoyne Sieur
D'Iberville, on a site where American Indians had lived for
centuries. By the 1820s, city folk from New Orleans, attracted by
cool sea breezes, had begun building summer cottages here; by the
1850s, hotels lined the waterfront of what had become the Deep
South's most popular resort. (One of those, the Magnolia Hotel, wasand relocated and now houses the city's Mardi Gras museum.)
And through the first half of this century, upscale resorts and the
beach _ and, illegally but fairly openly, gambling halls _
continued to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1969, the coast was battered by Hurricane Camille, and
though Biloxi rebuilt, tourism faltered. The '80s oil bust only
added to the decline. At Mary Mahoney's Old French House, an
old-fashioned restaurant of the sort found only in the South, where
the waiters wear boxy jackets and the ladies who lunch wear hats,
owner Bobby Mahoney confirms this turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s, we were a tourist town without any
tourists,'' Mahoney says. ``We knew we had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something, as it has been in so many waterfront towns, from
Atlantic City to Shreveport, turned out to be gaming. A referendum
legalized gambling on the coast in 1992, and the first Biloxi
casinos opened in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest ones tended to be smallish and relatively
unsophisticated; at least one was just a riverboat that was hauled
down the Mississippi from its former Iowa home. A few of the first
entries are already closed. But slowly, bigger companies moved in:
Isle of Capri built a big hotel and casino complex, as did Casino
Magic and the Grand Casino. In late '97, the Imperial Palace opened
an upscale 30-story high-rise, complete with a spa and an attached
movie theater and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the growth continues; Circus Circus hopes to break ground
soon. A Hard Rock Cafe _ Mississippi's first _ is in the works.
Existing hotels are expanding, even though the area already has
more than 16,000 rooms, up from 6,000 the year gambling began.
Transportation has improved; some travelers still prefer to fly
into New Orleans or Mobile (both about an hour's drive away), but
this spring, Air Tran began direct flights into the small
Gulfport/Biloxi airport from several cities, including Fort
Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, however, just 25 percent of the tourism revenue
is generated by gaming, says Steve Richer of the Mississippi Gulf
Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is because the beach came first. More than 50
charter boats offer sport-fishing trips or sunset cruises. Along
the 26 miles of man-made white sand beaches, beachcombers can swim,
parasail or rent Jet Skis. There are the requisite tacky souvenir
shops, miniature golf courses and ice cream parlors of any seaside
resort.
</P>
<P>
   And, though new casinos make the headlines, many locals are just
as excited about the planned fall groundbreaking for the new home
of the George E. Ohr Arts and Cultural Center. The museum is
dedicated to the once-obscure artist dubbed the Mad Potter of
Biloxi, both for his odd but beautiful pots and for his penchant
for crossing his eyes when being photographed and turning
cartwheels in the street, his trademark 2-foot-long handlebar
mustache following stiffly in the wind. Ohr created his intricately
shaped, oddly glazed pottery only until 1910, abruptly quitting
because he felt unappreciated. His works were rediscovered in the
1960s and really took off in the early '80s, when collectors like
Andy Warhol discovered them. Now they can fetch $40,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The simple museum is already a cultural center for the town,
with frequent displays by local artists, classes and lectures. But
the new $8 million Ohr-O'Keefe Museum, which will include a gallery
for works by African-American artists, should bring it to a much
larger stage, if only for its architect _ Frank Gehry, who designed
the decade's most acclaimed museum, the Guggenheim in Bilbao,
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The current museum is on the edge of the Vieux Marche, or Old
Market, a part of downtown with buildings dating from the early
1700s. The cobblestone streets are a nice place to wander or stop
for lunch, soaking in the history and reading the plaques that
decorate many of the old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally, the history results in some uncomfortable
moments. A few miles west of downtown is the seaside Beauvoir, the
last home of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy.
Visitors can tour his house, impeccably furnished; more than half
of the antiques were actually used by the Davis family.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum, in the Presidential Library that opened last
year, gently but firmly takes the Confederacy's side of things,
mentioning slavery only in passing. The grounds are also home to a
Confederate cemetery, which looks somewhat like a miniature version
of Arlington National Cemetery, with rows of simple headstones for
fallen soldiers. It also has a Confederate memorial inscribed: ``No
nation rose so white and fair. None fell so pure of crime.'' Surely
I am not the only visitor who stared at this monument in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the old South. The new South is better represented
by the Beau Rivage, which, though it has a Las Vegas pedigree,
isn't really all that Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Bellagio cost an estimated $2 billion, the Beau Rivage
cost an estimated $650 million. Where the Bellagio has
impressionist masterpieces and Jackson Pollock originals, the Beau
Rivage has 80-year-old live oaks lining the drive and magnolia
trees transplanted from old Mississippi homes growing in its atrium
lobby. And where the Bellagio's 3,000 rooms are on the edge of an
8-acre man-made lake, the Beau Rivage overlooks the Gulf of Mexico.
The real one.
</P>
<P>
   True Biloxi backers will also say that the Beau Rivage _ like
the other dozen or so Gulf Coast casinos _ has a distinct but
indefinable advantage over its western competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got real Southern hospitality,'' says Mahoney, the
restaurateur. ``You won't find that in Las Vegas.''

 &HT;    Screenplay as salvation: `Beauty' became writer's catharsis
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to Oscar nominations, critics are
already using phrases like ``shoo-in'' and ``sure thing'' when
talking about one movie.
</P>
<P>
   Best actor? Yep. Actress? Very likely. Original screenplay? No
doubt. And ``American Beauty'' is the only film so far this year
that seems to be an instant contender for best picture of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The satiric but uplifting tragicomedy is the first feature film
from 42-year-old screenwriter Alan Ball. He seems to have come out
of nowhere. But actually, he came from Marietta (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   He lived there as a teen, going to Marietta High School, then
enrolling at the University of Georgia for his first year of
college. After that, he transferred to Florida State University in
Tallahassee. ``My mom still lives in Marietta, in the same house I
grew up in,'' he says. He visits occasionally, and flies his
mother, Mary, out to the West Coast once or twice a year as well.
</P>
<P>
   He may sound like an overnight success, but that's not exactly
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been paying dues as long as anybody else,'' says Atlantan
Priscilla Smith, a classmate and close high school friend of
Ball's, who remains in touch. The two played in the band together
(he was a drum major), edited the school newspaper on alternate
years, wrote a musical together two years in a row to promote
newspaper sales, and continued to collaborate after they'd headed
on to college: During summer breaks, they produced theater at Cobb
(Ga.) County's Civic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cast him in his first role _ he played Alan in `Picnic,'''
says Smith, now a teacher of Spanish, English and drama at the
Horizons School. ``Since 1980 or '81, he's been out on his own
doing stuff, writing plays, working on a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball hasn't had a Georgia address in a while. In an interview
with the Los Angeles Times, he described his neighbors in Marietta
as ``shut down and living in total denial,'' a theme that crops up
in his movie. ``To me,'' he added, ``it was a town I had to get out
of.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived in New York until 1994, when he moved to Los Angeles
after his off-Broadway play ``Five Women Wearing the Same Dress''
resulted in an invitation to write for the sitcom ``Cybill.''
</P>
<P>
   For better and worse, that experience led to his penning the
``American Beauty'' screenplay in his free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you become a sitcom writer, especially for a star-driven
show, you have to divorce yourself from any really passionate
connection to your work, because it gets arbitrarily changed every
day,'' he says by phone from his Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Cybill Shepherd show became just a day job,
while his screenplay became his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my last season writing for the show, I would just come
home and pour my frustration into this script. It was kind of a
cathartic thing for me. It was fun to believe in this world and the
characters _ it wasn't just factory work.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``American Beauty'' script was initially inspired by the Amy
Fisher trial, which took place when Ball was still in New York,
working for a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by that because I instinctively knew that
what we saw in the media and what really happened were probably two
different things,'' he says. ``I realized I would never know that
true story, and no one would, except the people who lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beauty,'' Kevin Spacey plays Lester, frustrated suburban
husband of workaholic Carolyn (Annette Bening) and father to sullen
teenage Jane (Thora Birch). Mired in middle-aged blahs, Lester
comes to life on seeing _ and falling for _ Jane's best friend, a
provocative teen named Angela (Mena Suvari). Meanwhile, Jane is
becoming mesmerized by the spooky boy next door ( Wes Bentley) who
videotapes everything. And Carolyn has a fling with a real estate
czar (Peter Gallagher).
</P>
<P>
   These sexual intrigues and misunderstandings converge one dark
and stormy night, resolving in a violent act that surprisingly
becomes a transcendent glimpse of the eternal in the everyday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Not your basic Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much he loved writing this quirky,
hard-to-describe script, Ball never expected it to get made with
virtually no changes. ``It's amazing to me. I thought I would get a
few (studio) meetings, and some suggestions to get into therapy,''
he quips. ``I never expected it to get made, much less by
DreamWorks.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when his agent told him that the script was being read
by Steven Spielberg, Ball thought it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Like the plotline of the film, the meaning of the film's title
is something that was continually in flux. ``The title sort of
organically happened,'' Ball says. ``I sort of knew the title as I
was writing the screenplay, but it's like everything in the movie:
Things appear to be one thing on the surface, but if you look
closer they're richer and more interesting and complex than you
once thought. It's like the movie itself, which starts out as a
black comedy, then goes to a spiritual place. First you think (the
title) refers to the rose, then you think it's Angela, but
ultimately it's about the ability to see beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's suddenly a hot commodity as a screenwriter, his
hands are tied for the next eight months with a new sitcom, but
this time, he's in charge; he created ``Oh, Grow Up,'' an ABC
comedy about grown men sharing a brownstone, based on some of his
own New York experiences. Once he's finished with the first season
(and gets to take a vacation) he hopes to finish his next
screenplay and continue to work in both TV and film.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent every day on the set of ``American Beauty,''
watching first-time filmmaker Sam Mendes direct, Ball is thinking
about spending time behind the camera himself. And then, maybe
he'll go back to the live stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do this as long as I can and still keep my
sanity, but then I'd like to open a theater somewhere,'' he says.
``I'm a living cliche: What I really want to do is direct, and my
heart is in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE INTERVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Directed by Sam
Mendes. Rated R for strong sexuality, nudity, profanity, violence
and drug content. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's a beaut. The remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a
stellar ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch) in a scarily
disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama about the implosion of
the American family.

 &HT;    Gucci revisits signature `rock star'-type silhouettes
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN _ It's not uncommon for designers to refer back in fashion
history while conceptualizing their collections. The best designers
admit, in fact, that they don't invent styles so much as re-invent
them.
</P>
<P>
   What is uncommon is for someone to take as short a view as Gucci
design chief Tom Ford. Sizing up his spring/summer 2000 clothes at
a Tuesday morning breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel, Ford said:
``This collection may be the first '90s retrospective.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he had no intention of moving too far from the
sort of styles that brought him prominence. He was sticking with
the ``rock star'' image his clothes embody, particularly the
boot-cut pants silhouette he popularized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fitted flair is the most important pant leg,'' he said,
``because it makes you look tall, tall, tall, tall, tall and
skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   That visual effect was evident during Tuesday night's Gucci
runway preview. Leggy models wore fitted flairs in leather,
snakeskin, sequined, brocade and jersey knit, paired with matching
jackets that closed with a single silver pin, sheer silk pullovers,
or racy ruffled blouses that opened to the navel.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also showed plenty of his other two preferred pants: one
that skimmed the leg all the way down to the ankle, and another he
calls a ``training pant'' with zippers from ankle to calf. Most of
the (knee-to floor-length) skirts and dresses brushed the body
without clinging. Shoes were strappy, high-heeled and encrusted in
semi-precious stones; Ford's hosiery of choice, no matter what
color the outfit, was pale pink.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a smattering of blues, pinks and metallics, the
outfits were mainly black and white. Evening dresses were almost
all long, tight and backless.
</P>
<P>
   Prada
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Miuccia Prada reached back as far as four decades,
to the pioneering designs of Yves Saint Laurent, to create a
collection that's simpler, girlier and prettier than any she's done
in many seasons. Gone are the mirror fragment appliques, ``utility
chic'' zippers and Velcro, patchwork leathers and baby food color
schemes. Instead, Prada used such ultra-feminine design details as
wide, flat pleats on knee-length skirts, form-fitting knitwear and
blouses as airy as scarves. She hasn't given up on olive and brown
entirely, but this collection was infused with purples, yellows,
blues and creams. Prada's luxury fabric of choice was ostrich
leather.
</P>
<P>
   Men with style
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner at the magnificent restaurant Il Carpaccio, eight
American fashion editors compared notes on the Italian male's
unique style of dressing: How much aplomb they show in mixing
patterned shirts and ties. How even men in their 50s pull off the
peg-legged suit look as easily as guys in their 20s. How stylish
their shoes look, whether dressy or casual. How, unlike American
males, they don't hesitate to primp. We never could agree if it was
nature or nurture. But as we walked out into the balmy night, none
of us could keep from glancing, with curiosity and admiration, at a
dapper diner in the corner. He had on a yellow-blue-and-white plaid
spread-collar shirt with a mini-checked blue-and-yellow tie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRIDAY NIGHT: After checking into your hotel, try the fancy
seafood-in-cream-sauce dishes at the formal Mary Mahoney's Old
French House Restaurant (Magnolia and Water streets; (228)
374-0163.) Dinner for two, about $50. Or, for a slightly more
relaxed atmosphere, head for The Porter House, (604 Porter Ave.,
Ocean Springs; (228) 875-3663), where locals line up for the
nouvelle Cajun-influenced seafood. Dinner for two, about $50.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward _ well, you might as well get the gambling out of your
system. One could argue that if you've seen one casino, you've seen
them all, but there are a few subtle differences. The Imperial
Palace, sister to a Las Vegas hotel, is one of the newer resorts,
opening in December '97; some of the other large-scale casinos
include Casino Magic, Isle of Capri and the Grand Casino. If you
want to go where the locals try their luck, head to Boomtown, a
western-themed, more casual spot. The casinos are clustered in
several groups along the water, too far to walk between but within
easy driving distance of each other; there's also a free shuttle
service between them, but on our visit not many people were using
it.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: Wake up with a stroll along the beach, then get an
overview of the area by taking a 90-minute tour on the Ole Biloxi
Tour Train ($8 adults, $5 children ages 5-12; (228) 374-8687.) The
open-air, narrated tour takes you past 30 sites, including Casino
Row; the Biloxi Lighthouse; the Vieux Marche, or Old Market; the
seashell roof on St. Michael's Church; and various museums.
</P>
<P>
   Again, lunch should be seafood; another local favorite is the
Old Biloxi Schooner, (159 Howard St., (228) 374-8071), whose crab
meat-and-cheese sandwiches were recently praised by ``Travel
Holiday.'' Lunch for two, about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Before or after, catch the Biloxi Shrimping Trip, ($10 adults;
two to seven departures daily from early February through early
December; call (800) 289-7908 for schedule.) Owners Corrie and
Virginia Eleuterius demonstrate how shrimping operations work
during a cruise on the bay; if you'd like, you can pick out the
shrimp from a catch that might include soft-shell crabs, eels,
squid and dozens of fish.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably time left to see a couple of museums; one best
bet is the Maritime and Seafood Industry Museum, which documents
the fishing and shrimping industries that built Biloxi and the
hurricanes that tried to destroy it. (115 First St., (228)
435-6320. $3 for adults.) And there's the George E. Ohr Arts and
Cultural Center (136 G.E. Ohr St., (228) 374-5547; $2 adults.) This
tribute to the so-called Mad Potter of Biloxi showcases hundreds of
his odd-shaped and odd-colored pots; there's also a small display
of contemporary local artworks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, even if you're not staying there, try to score tickets to
the Beau Rivage's Cirque du Soleil presentation of ``Alegria.'' The
Montreal company has its own intimate theater at the hotel, where
it puts on its circus for people who don't like circuses. There's
some kind of deeper theatrical meaning here, which we didn't get,
but we did like the acts, including a fire dancer, trapeze artists,
contortionists, gymnasts and clowns, all set to ethereal music from
a live band. (Shows nightly except Tuesday; tickets, $45 adults,
$27.50 children ages 5-12; call (888) 566-7469.)
</P>
<P>
   Have dinner before or after the show at one of the hotel's 12
restaurants; among them are spots featuring Japanese, Italian,
French-influenced seafood, Asian, Memphis-style barbecue and a
buffet.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: For a dose of history, start at Beauvoir, Jefferson
Davis Home and Presidential Library. (2244 Beach Blvd., (800)
570-3818) The tour starts in the newly opened library with a short
film on the life of the president of the Confederacy; afterward,
tour the museum exhibits, the house that served as Davis' last
home, and a small Confederate cemetery tucked on the pleasantly
groomed grounds.
</P>
<P>
   If weather permits, head for the water again. From spring to
fall, more than 50 fishing charters operate out of Biloxi's
marinas; some can also be hired to provide bay cruises. Another
option is to take a ferry from Gulfport to the deserted-but-scenic
Gulf Islands, about an hour off the mainland, to enjoy the dunes,
surf and pines. Take snacks and drinks; concessions aren't
available. (Ferries leave from Gulfport twice daily from early
March through the last Sunday in October, (800) 388-3290; $16
adults.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to stay landside, take time for one last seafood
lunch; try the soft-shell crab or shrimp po-boys at the casual
McElroy's Harbor House (in the Biloxi Small Craft Harbor, (228)
435-5001.) Lunch for two, about $20.

 &HT;    Fergie U.S. spokeswoman for Wedgwood
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scandal of scandals: the Duchess of York setting a
table with mix-and-match china, seashells and Gummi Bears. In a
suburban Atlanta department store, no less.
</P>
<P>
   How common.
</P>
<P>
   How Fergie.
</P>
<P>
   How come?
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wife of Prince Andrew, Weight Watchers goddess and
soon-to-be NBC ``Today Show'' contributing correspondent has a new
gig _ as the U.S. spokeswoman for Wedgwood, the renowned British
china maker. And, in an ironic Madison Avenue twist, the former
Sarah Ferguson is rolling up her sleeves to show shoppers how to
take the ``fussiness'' out of entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be wondering what on earth the Duchess of York, with
cooks and butlers, knows about setting a table,'' she told the 500
who turned out on a soggy Wednesday at the North Point Mall Rich's,
the first stop on a national tour. ``I'm a single working mother,
I've paid off lots of debt (once reaching $4 million), as you all
know, but I believe in old-fashioned standards and manners.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, hosts can't have fun, especially
when the entertaining is impromptu.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the Duchess showed the crowd how to throw a table
together in 10 minutes _ you know, like when ``suddenly Andrew
(with whom she still lives) walks in and says he's bringing 15 home
to dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clumsy scene not far removed from the famous ``I Love
Lucy'' episode in which Lucy does a bumbling sales pitch for
``Vitameatavegamin,'' Fergie demonstrated how it's perfectly proper
to mix china patterns of the same color, use conk shells as vases
and a bathroom soap dish for use as a butter plate or side dish (in
this case, for Gummi Bears). ``Do wash it first, though, you
know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several hundred more shoppers joined the sell-out
crowd to have the duchess autograph one Wedgwood plate. Within
minutes, though, the line snaked through china, cologne, men's wear
and the Christmas shop as the ever-approachable Fergie agreed to
sign all their Wedgwood purchases, from Atlantan John Wade's four
salad plates to Decatur (Ga.) resident Stacy Ewing's lasagna
casserole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have driven here from Lawrenceville (Ga.) just to
buy china, but I keep up with her,'' said Linda McKee, waiting
patiently in line. ``She's so down to earth. She's like a regular
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those blistering tabloid exploits. (Who could forget
the infamous toe-sucking, topless photos of Fergie and a former
lover?) Forget the binge shopping while racking up debt. (''It
wasn't my shopping that caused that but a house we were trying to
finish,'' the Duchess emphasized in a chat before the event.)
</P>
<P>
   As with entertaining, the key to overcoming adversity, she
believes with all apparent sincerity, is to be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a weight problem since I was 12,'' said Fergie,
rejecting a cup of not-quite-hot tea. ``You can't hide.''
</P>
<P>
   She also looks for the positive in tragedy, having lost first
her close friend Princess Di and then her mother, Susan Barrantes,
to car crashes within two years. ``Some days I look in the mirror
and say, 'Hi, Mom.' I miss her. But I look at life totally
different now.''
</P>
<P>
   And, turning 40 in 10 days, she's excited over her ``Today''
show role, covering celebrities. ``I find it absolutely curious to
meet people who, once in the public eye, think they have to
change,'' she said. ``Why can't people just be themselves?''

FOR CABERNET FRANK, WINEMAKERS HOPE IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR

   BUELLTON, Calif. _ When the owners of tiny Kahn Winery decided
to make a wine honoring Frank Sinatra, they wanted to infuse the
bottling with the spirit of the singer.
</P>
<P>
   So winemaker Andrew Kahn and his partner Christian Garvin played
songs like ``Old Devil Moon,'' during the crushing process, and ``I
Can't Get Started'' for the pressing. And for the label, they got
the Sinatra estate to let them use a painting done by the singer,
who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   This week the team announced the release of the 1998 Kahn
Cabernet Frank, a wine made from Cabernet Franc grapes grown in
Santa Ynez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both card-carrying members of the International Sinatra
Society,'' said Garvin. He said he grew up in an Italian family in
New York, where the soothing sounds of Sinatra songs were played
everywhere, as common as beeping horns.
</P>
<P>
   Garvin likened the wine-making process to giving birth, noting
that some pregnant women listen to Mozart while their babies are in
the womb, so why not play Sinatra to mellow the wine?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play it while the fluid was moving from vessel to
vessel during the process, just like birth. ``Hopefully, the sound
vibrations carried through,'' he said in a telephone interview, in
which a Sinatra concert, recorded live at the Sands casino in Las
Vegas, could be heard in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to honor Sinatra, and we felt if we were going to
make a wine in his name, we wanted to take it all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners met while they were working together at Fess
Parker's Winery, where Kahn, 28, was the assistant winemaker, and
Garvin, 26, managed the bottling line. They decided to go into
business together in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Their tiny winery _ Garvin said they proudly call themselves
Santa Barbara County's smallest _ will produce roughly 1,000 cases
this year from varietal grapes grown in private vineyards
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 cases of Cabernet Frank were produced, so the winery is
limiting the sale to two bottles per customer, at $60 per bottle.
The Sinatra estate has given its blessing to the wine, and a
portion of the proceeds will benefit the Frank Sinatra Foundation,
which supports a variety of causes, Garvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to create a limited quantity of the best possible
wine in honor of what Sinatra had given us for so many years,''
Kahn said. ``Sinatra's songs have filled our cellar since the
beginning, and after his death we felt such a loss that we wanted
to give something back.''
</P>
<P>
   If the wine is a success, it may be offered in future years, the
winemakers say. The 1998 vintage will be ready to drink in a year
or two. It is available at selected wine stores and through the
winery, which has a website at www.kahnwines.com.

 &HT;    GORE MOVES HEADQUARTERS TO TENNESSEE, CHALLENGES BRADLEY TO
DEBATES
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging the
surprisingly strong challenge of Bill Bradley, dramatically
reshaped his presidential campaign Wednesday by moving his
headquarters to Tennessee, calling for ``a bunch'' of debates and
scrapping his imperial-like campaign for open, unscripted meetings
with small groups of voters in early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grassroots and directly to the American people,'' Gore said in
a surprise announcement at his Washington campaign headquarters
that, he declared, will be moved ``lock, stock and barrel'' to
downtown Nashville in a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who has surged ahead of Gore in key primary states
after months of trailing by wide margins, gleefully declined an
immediate acceptance of the vice president's request that they
debate in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, for the last ten months, the vice president's
campaign has been ignoring me. And now they want to debate me,''
Bradley told reporters at Saint John's Well-Child Center in Los
Angeles. ``I think this shows we are making some progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged as much himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the new shape of this campaign,'' he said. ``This is
a hard, tough fight. And I'm going to fight my heart out for every
single vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, however, that the narrowing of the Democratic race
was inevitable because it involves only two candidates. ``You've
got Pepsi and Coke,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, though, Gore had largely ignored Bradley in his
quest for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination. His
principal target has been Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
frontrunner for the Republican nomination who has consistently led
the vice president by double digits in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, polls indicate Bradley's insurgent campaign
has pulled even or ahead of Gore in such important primary states
as New Hampshire and New York, further troubling establishment
Democrats already anxious over Gore's inability to close the gap
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he and Bradley should take time before beginning their
debates to ``refine'' their thinking, then have ``a genuine contest
of ideas.'' He said he would like ``a bunch'' of debates, but did
not specify how many.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has as reputation as a skilled debater. Likewise, as a
senator and congressman from Tennessee, he was effective in
intimate settings such as town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But as vice president, with an entourage of staff and security,
he has had few opportunities for such events. ``It's been hard for
him to reach people through the bubble he travels in,'' said Kathy
Sullivan, the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, though, Gore said he intends to hold a
series of open meetings in the early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be speaking directly to the voters in small groups,
without intermediaries, responding to their questions, telling them
about my vision for the future, asking for their ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of a Tennessee senator who has spent much of his
life in Washington, said moving his headquarters to his home state
was ``an opportunity for transformation'' of a campaign
organization that some critics had said was top-heavy with too many
expensive consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the campaign announced Wednesday that Gore had raised
$6.5 million in the third quarter, bringing the year's total to $24
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that the vice president had $9.5
million to $10 million in cash on hand, but that the campaign had
saved just $300,000 to $800,000 of the money it raised over the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not released his third-quarter figures. But earlier
reports indicated Bradley is doing as well in gathering campaign
cash _ and a better job at controlling spending.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the Gore operation out of Washington's K Street corridor,
which is famous for its expensive lobbying and law firms, will save
some money.
</P>
<P>
   But the move will also distance the Gore campaign from the
constant chatter in Washington political circles that the vice
president's campaign is teetering and that it is hamstrung by the
public's disapproval of the scandal-plagued Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed the suggestion that the move to Tennessee was a
gimmick or that his campaign cannot break free of the country's
``Clinton fatigue,'' a term widely used by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is Clinton fatigue,'' he said. ``And I think
that ... campaigns, if conducted properly, transform the people who
are in the campaigns. And if that happens, they gain the ability to
transform the country and to renew our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But political experts questioned whether even moves as dramatic
as the ones Gore announced Wednesday would effect the vice
president's image as a Washington candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore can change his headquarters, but he can't change his life
story,'' said John Pitney, a political science professor at
Claremont McKenna College in California.

BERENGER'S `HERO' MAKES SCREEN HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You can eat way too many meals on a publicity tour,
and for an actor, that's bad.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Berenger seems to handle it by eating light and drinking
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over a menu last week, he sounded interested in many of
the selections, then ordered only two appetizer-size items for his
meal. He ignored the wine list to stick with water.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why he's close to the same shape now, at 49, that
he was more than 15 years ago in ``The Big Chill'' and 13 years ago
in ``Platoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's his nonstop schedule. Berenger has six or seven
films set to come out this year or next _ he's not really sure of
the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got all these projects that haven't come out yet,
you kind of forget what the last one was,'' he says,
apologetically, as if somehow he should be able to call each to
mind immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The film he is promoting today, ``One Man's Hero,'' is a picture
he shot a while back, about three years ago. Just now getting a
chance in theaters, it's a historical film about Irish soldiers set
during the Mexican-American War. MGM, which is distributing it _
after purchasing it from now-defunct Orion Pictures _ doesn't seem
to have much interest in promoting it, so Berenger is making the
effort on his own, because he likes the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of the executives have even bothered to
see it,'' he says, sounding disappointed rather than angry. ``It's
heartbreaking, is what it is. I mean, if I didn't like it, it would
be just as well, but I really like it a lot, which is why I've done
two days of press in Los Angeles, two days with Spanish national
and worldwide television shows. Dallas tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a two-screen premiere in Belfast, with Gerry Adams, head
of the Sinn Fein, as our host. It was his idea. The lord mayor of
Belfast came over. Then we went down to Dublin and did a screening
down there. I did a BBC talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not by chance that Berenger has done a number of historical
films (``Gettysburg,'' ``The Rough Riders''). He's into history, a
fact that becomes more obvious as the conversation jumps from the
Mexican-American War to the Civil War to the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   When doing a historical movie, he says he often ends up studying
so much on the events, he knows more than the people making the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually make a notebook out of it on these projects, for
costumes, set designs, props. I'll put what book it comes from and
the page numbers, because I've had directors (question me), and
I'll go `Look there.'''
</P>
<P>
   What fascinated him about ``One Man's Hero'' was that it was
history he had never heard, until another actor told him about it
on a set 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued by it. I found a couple of books that
mentioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is about the more than 300 Irish-Catholic immigrants
in the United States Army who deserted to join the Mexican side in
the 1846-1848 war, forming the St. Patrick's Battalion (``Los San
Patricios''). Almost forgotten in the United States, they are
heroes in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obelisk with the names of all these guys, and every
St. Patrick's Day, they have a little ceremony there. How many
attend, I don't know. Usually the president of Mexico and the Irish
ambassador. On a few occasions, the president or prime minister of
Ireland is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a film about the men had been kicked around
from time to time, perhaps even by John Ford and John Wayne, but
nothing came of it until now. One reason, Berenger speculates, is
that it portrays some negative things about the United States Army
of 150 years ago. But Berenger thinks that should not be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any place you can do a film like this, it should
be the United States,'' he says, pointing out that many of the top
politicians and newspapers of the era were against the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver Stone (who directed Berenger in ``Platoon``), you can
say all his films are controversial. Or try to be. Who cares? If
they're entertaining, they work.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives have told Berenger if ``One Man's Hero'' does
well in a few Southwestern cities such as Houston, they will
promote and release it elsewhere. That's what Berenger is counting
on with all his travels to talk it up. He wants it to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Berenger's best-known performance is as the merciless veteran
sergeant in Vietnam in ``Platoon,'' for which he got a
best-supporting-actor Oscar nomination. But the film he's in that
probably has been watched and enjoyed most is the boomer classic
``The Big Chill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it a generation movie, like `The Graduate,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The film enhanced the careers of most of its cast _ Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline, Jobeth Williams, Jeff Goldblum, WIlliam Hurt, Mary Kay
Place, Meg Tilly and Berenger _ though Berenger doesn't think it
was such a boost for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't recognize me in `The Big Chill.' They didn't
know I was in it. It may be because of the mustache. Or because
it's a comedy, and I hadn't done that many comedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenger played the TV show detective who has a fling with
Williams and at one point takes a flying leap into a sports car,
with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was a movie he enjoyed doing and one that had a lot
of effect on his future. The film was made by writer/director
Lawrence Kasdan (``Mumford,'' ``Body Heat''), and actors usually
say they have a great time on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Berenger agrees. ``I think it was the easiest
film I ever did. You had to be there every day, but you weren't on
all the time. We did no overtime; the weather was gorgeous. A lot
of card games. Poker, charades.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked filming around Beaufort, S.C., so much that he moved
there from New York after completing the film. He still lives there
with his third wife, Patricia
</P>
<P>
   Millions of fans of ``The Big Chill,'' after seeing it for the
10th time on video and recalling Goldblum's last line, ``We're not
leaving; we're never leaving,'' have no doubt pondered what happens
to the people after the movie ends. Do they stay close?
</P>
<P>
   In Berenger's case, no. He's worked on films or plays or
projects with some of the cast members since, but that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in contact with Bill Hurt for a while,'' he says. ``I
just sort of lost touch. Living where I do it's hard to keep up
with people.''

   NEW YORK _ They had only 30 minutes, so they got right down to
business. ``We're two guys describing a show about two guys
describing a show,'' explained the heavier-set of the two, as their
pianist fidgeted on his bench and adjusted the pages of his score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening everyone, I'm Jed Feuer,'' he continued,
addressing the packed audience at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on
West 42nd Street, ``and this is my partner, Boyd Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shalom,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   How expertly synchronized this seemed. Their fledgling musical,
``The Big Bang,'' was set in the apartment of a New York
proctologist, one Dr. Lipbaum, in whose living room two writers
gather potential investors for a read-through of their new musical.
It just so happened that the Fairbanks was filled on this
particular night with producers and operators of small theaters and
musical troupes around the nation, from the Paper Mill Playhouse in
Millburn, N.J., to the Municipal Theater Association of St. Louis.
In other words, here was a group of show backers watching two men
pitch a show in which two men pitch a show to a group of show
backers.
</P>
<P>
   That ``The Big Bang'' was first in the running order seemed an
act of providence, if not divine at least divinely choreographed.
On Sunday and Monday, a total of 10 productions were rolled out at
the International Festival of New Musicals, a kind of
convention-size backers' audition. It is an annual opportunity for
presenters, purveyors and supporters of musical theater _ show-tune
workers of the world, unite! _ to sample what the organizers pick
as the top eight to 10 works-in-progress among the hundreds
submitted for the event each year. Some theaters contribute
financially to the development of one of the shows, which may in
fact be booked into their theaters one day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the musical by Graham and Feuer (the son, by the way,
of Cy Feuer, the longtime Broadway director and producer), is a
paean to a bygone method of making musicals. Today, only a handful
of producers still raise money the old way; more commonly, big
shows are being ushered to the stage by entertainment conglomerates
and better-endowed nonprofit theaters. The route represented by the
festival is yet another way, perhaps the most circuitous, involving
a growing network of loose links and partnerships among smaller
out-of-town theaters that nurture a show by giving it a workshop or
a series of preliminary productions.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the shows the festival has unveiled in its 11 years have
made it to New York, let alone to Broadway, though a few writers
and productions have broken through: the composer Jason Robert
Brown, whose musical ``Parade,'' about the lynching of Leo Frank,
ran at Lincoln Center Theater last season, had a revue in the
festival two years ago, and one of last year's selections, ``The
Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' by Kirsten Childs, is
being produced this season by Playwrights Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great questions,'' said Helen Sneed, executive
director of the National Alliance for Musical Theater, the
consortium of 115 musical theaters and troupes that produces the
festival, ``is whether musicals that don't have the New York stamp
on them can have a life of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally intriguing, though, is what exactly lyricists and
composers choose to write about nowadays. If, as the generally
dismal Broadway offerings of the past few seasons indicate, the
musical is indeed in a downward cycle, fragmenting into mushy
tourist fare and unsingable material better suited to the
conservatory, the broader question is, is there any form in which
the American musical can re-establish its hold on the popular
imagination?
</P>
<P>
   The festival cannot provide an answer, but it is a kind of
snapshot of mainstream musical ambitions. Attending is great fun _
it's like being handed a tasting menu of the musical of tomorrow _
although as an event it doesn't exactly rival Fashion Week. It
takes over just two small off-Broadway houses, the Fairbanks and
the John Houseman, where the goal is not to set a trend but to
latch onto one. The shows, for the most part, are meant to appeal
to broadly American, rather than to boutique Manhattan, tastes, to
tickle patrons of the Sacramento Light Opera more than those of the
New York Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   The festival turns out to be both exceedingly well produced _
the performers in various productions included such stalwarts of
the New York stage as Stephanie Mills, Alice Ripley, Stephen
DeRosa, Nick Wyman, Jason Danieley, Jeremy Kushnier, Ken Prymus and
Carol Woods _ and surprisingly entertaining. Boiled-down versions
of the full-length musicals, culled this year from about 140
submissions, were performed in staged readings, some lasting an
hour, others half that. (Some presentations benefited greatly from
brevity.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In nervous little herds, the teams scurried into the theater;
though musicals traditionally begin with an overture, all the
musicals here start with a spiel. Actors in street clothes sing
from scripts in binders. The accompaniment is sometimes a single
piano. (One of the joys of the festival was hearing
Broadway-caliber voices unamplified _ what a novelty!) The
composers offer their best five or 10 numbers; the plot and
thematic thrust are entrusted to a narrator.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of the festival is the sheer number of polished
writers and composers who remain hot in pursuit of a hit. But the
glimpse of the future? Well, the musical of tomorrow, it turns out,
looks a lot like the musical of today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the writers are inspired by a popular movie (as in this
year's festival entry ``Summer of '42'') or an epic French tale of
epees and amour (``The Three Musketeers''), whether it is yet
another set of anecdotes from the annals of immigration (``Heading
East'') or the latest production infused with sass and soul (``The
Princess and the Black-Eyed Pea''), the shows often fit into
familiar categories. Although once a form that voraciously fed on
other traditions, it now feeds mostly on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are not invited to review the presentations, but some
shows were clear darlings of the audience. I'll come clean: my
favorite was ``Honk!,'' a sophisticated children's musical based on
``The Ugly Duckling'' by a British songwriting team, composer
George Stiles and lyricist Anthony Drewe. What with the success of
``The Lion King'' and the early, favorable buzz surrounding the
forthcoming ``Seussical,'' a show by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen
Flaherty based on the works of Dr. Seuss, maybe the musical of
tomorrow belongs to the youngest set.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelated to its submission here, ``Honk!'' was chosen for
staging later this fall by the Royal National Theater in London,
and will be produced as well this winter at the Helen Hayes
Performing Arts Center in Nyack. (``Honk!'' also supplied the
festival with a bona fide show stopper, a number for a famished,
fowl-coveting cat titled ``Play With Your Food.'')
</P>
<P>
   The scale of productions ranged from the intimate cabaret style
of ``The Big Bang'' to the full-throated choruses of ``In That
Valley,'' a large ensemble show that illustrated one of the
recurring thrusts of earnest-seeming American musicals at the end
of the century, an effort to personalize and redefine the national
journey. ``In That Valley,'' by Richard Oberacker and Steven
Minning, is the story of an 18th-century Irish immigrant taken
prisoner with her child by Indians in the mountains of western
Virginia. In a similar vein, Robert Lee and Leon Ko offered
``Heading East,'' the saga of a 19th-century Chinese immigrant, and
Thomas W. Jones II weighed in with ``Birth of the Boom,'' a doo-wop
musical that surveys the emotional lives of black American men.
Some of the composers and writers have already seen their shows on
stages, in modest productions around the country; others wait, like
the keyed-up pleaders in ``The Big Bang,'' for the big break. It
would be satisfying to conclude on the basis of the truncated
auditions this week that there are hopeful signs everywhere in the
musical theater. But more evidence is required. Like a jilted
lover, I've been hurt too many times to make that commitment.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Streams may spill over their banks in New England on Thursday as
a soggy cold front plods slowly to the coast. A jet stream
disturbance will lift tropical air over the rugged terrain across
the interior, leading to several inches of rain, especially near
the east slopes of the northern Appalachians. Much cooler and drier
air will reach the Hudson Valley by early afternoon and southern
New England by sundown on gusty breezes from the northwest.
Residual clouds and light showers will linger south of Lake
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing skies with cooler, drier winds will spread across the
Middle Atlantic region and the Southeast early in the day. The cold
front will trigger scattered showers and thunderstorms in central
and southern Florida. The tail of the front should produce some
clouds in southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Very pleasant weather is expected across the South, central
Plains and lower Ohio Valley. High pressure over Arkansas will
promote sunshine and near seasonable temperatures. A cold front
advancing quickly southeast toward the Great Lakes will bring a few
showers to the border region and shifting, gusty winds from the
Dakotas to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of very cool air will be drawn into the upper Plains and
Montana. Mixed showers are expected in the Bitterroots as chilly
air circulates uphill. Most of the West will be sunny and rather
warm though the heat in coastal California will slacken. Light
winds along the Pacific coast will allow patches of low clouds to
seep into a few coastal valleys. Increasing offshore winds in
Washington should promote sunny skies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Philadelphia Follies &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of rain has fallen on Philadelphia in
September, making it the wettest month this century. With records
dating back to the late 1700s, this is quite noteworthy. The
wettest month occurred in August 1867, when 15.8 inches fell.
Oddly, the city is still under a drought emergency so residents can
not water lawns or wash cars. The water restrictions are a residual
effect of the severe drought that had afflicted the region into
August. However, abundant rains in the past six weeks have raised
the year-to-date tally to 7 inches above normal ending the
drought. &QL;

NEW DEVICES GETTING ROAD TEST BY BUSINESS STUDENTS AT DUKE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ James H. Sherrill sat in an oversized chair in a
dimly lighted lounge, cradling a rectangular electronic device that
was unlike anything he had seen. It was smaller than a laptop and
bigger than a palmtop. It didn't have cables or a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first few minutes with the device, Sherrill, a
first-year student at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business,
was already becoming adept at using its stylus to open files and
applications. ``It has an infrared link here for a wireless
connection,'' he said, pointing to the tiny port on its side during
a quick demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The device _ called a Stylistic LT, by Fujitsu _ will become
part of Sherrill's life over the next few months. It is one of many
new gadgets that he and other students will be testing in an
unusual project started by the business school this semester.
</P>
<P>
   The project is something like an oversized focus group in which
students are both evaluators of new technology and research
subjects in a huge marketing experiment. The students are invited
to test what Nevin Fouts, associate dean for information
technology, calls ``next-generation devices'' that he thinks just
might replace laptops for use in classrooms and libraries, and
study lounges. ``The market hasn't even emerged enough to give them
a certain name,'' Fouts said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujitsu and eight other companies are participating in the
project, sending their latest gadgets to the business school for
testing in a variety of environments. More than 100 devices have
arrived on campus and are awaiting distribution. Fouts expects to
receive another 100 in the next few months. All told, the equipment
is worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   All the devices are designed to be portable, cordless, and
lightweight _ attributes that Fouts considers ideal for students on
the move from their homes to the library to the classroom. Many of
the devices look like the electronic equivalent of the stone
tablet, with liquid-crystal displays encased in heavy-duty plastic
frames. They typically include some of the same features that
people find on desktop computers, like the ability to browse the
Web or retrieve e-mail. Many also include styluses for note-taking;
some include speakers, microphones, and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   People who follow the handheld-computer business may have
already seen a few of the devices, which have been on display
recently at computer trade shows and are on the market in limited
distribution. Some, like digital clipboards for doctors, are being
used outside the educational setting, but others exist only as
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke project poses risks for the university, which is hoping
that the experiments will not be a distraction. It is also risky
for the companies, which in some cases are opening their research
and development secrets to an unpredictable student audience. But
the companies are willing to take the risks in exchange for an
intimate relationship with business school students who, once they
graduate to the corporate world, may have the money to become
frequent customers and the influence to sway market trends.
</P>
<P>
   And many administrators, faculty members, and students at the
business school are excited to have access to devices that are just
coming off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the cutting edge,'' said Christopher T. Cocks, a
second-year student. ``You could even say we're helping to define
what the cutting edge will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocks and Sherrill, the student with the Fujitsu tablet, are two
of 12 members of the Technology Advisory Council, a group of
students recruited by Fouts to help guide technology-related
decisions at the business school. This semester they have focused
almost solely on the pilot testing project.
</P>
<P>
   Each member of the council will have access to every gadget that
is sent to Fuqua for evaluation. In many cases, they will be
expected to carry the devices with them for several weeks, using
them for class notes, e-mail and Web-based research, and to trade
documents. They will be required to write journal entries about how
easy or unbearable the devices are to use. They will also test them
in controlled environments like a sound-proof laboratory typically
used by professors who are conducting market-research experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, however, each member of the council will
be asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, legal documents in which
they pledge not to give away the companies' trade secrets or
attempt to create their own companies based on knowledge of the new
gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other students, Fouts expects, will also want to get
involved in the project and will also be asked to sign agreements.
These are students who are not part of the council but who sign up
to test at least one of the gadgets in the next few semesters.
</P>
<P>
   Devices that are still being created in the companies'
research-and-development departments will not be allowed to be
toted freely around the business school. Keeping things under wraps
is essential to the project's success, those involved say.
</P>
<P>
   Aqcess Technologies, for example, will be lending Duke more than
80 copies of Qbe, its first device to go on the market. It also
plans to test the latest Qbe iterations using Duke students, if
they sign nondisclosure agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this industry, it can get hectic and cutthroat,'' said Kain
K. Johnson, vice president for sales and marketing at Aqcess
Technologies. ``Before we give anything to anyone out there, we're
going to make sure we're covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fuqua project will be formally announced this week, but the
ideas behind it have been percolating for years. It started, Fouts
said, when he and faculty members began to bemoan the drawbacks of
students' using laptops in the classroom. While some business
schools require students to have notebook computers for use in
classroom and group study sessions, Duke discourages them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the laptop screen up, you have a barrier between faculty
and students,'' said Joel Huber, associate dean of the MBA program.
The constant sound of clicking is annoying too, he said. Not to
mention, he added, that students have been known to surreptitiously
surf the Web or send e-mail when they are supposed to be taking
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Huber, Fouts, and several professors talked wishfully about a
different kind of digital device that could connect wirelessly to a
network yet didn't require a keyboard. They wanted something that
might allow students to beam documents or spreadsheets between
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conceived of a class of device that didn't exist yet,''
Fouts said.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year, Fouts began talking to technology
companies about the idea and discovered that some of them were, in
fact, being realized. Many were simply prototypes in corporate
research labs. Some were just about to hit the market, such as the
Stylistic LT, which now sells for $3,265. Others that will be
released this fall include the QBE and the Qubit, by Qubit
Technology in Denver, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and summer, Fouts negotiated agreements with the
nine companies, which also include Arthur Andersen, Dauphin
Technology, IBM, IPDN Corp., Laser Image Corporate Publishing, and
Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, too, signed nondisclosure agreements with Duke,
promising not to reveal too much about Duke's own research on the
project. For although the companies are getting piles of journal
entries and documentation about students' responses to the devices,
Duke's researchers are using the students as research subjects as
well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The students who choose to become involved in the pilot project
_ which Steve Hoeffler, the doctoral student who is leading it,
expects to be about 90 percent of Fuqua's students _ will be
matched with certain gadgets depending on their answers to survey
questions about their habits and current use of technology. The way
different samples of students react to the devices will be analyzed
as part of Hoeffler's own research project on how people respond to
new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of an entire business school as a technology test bed
is intriguing to some experts in market research. ``I think it's an
incredibly interesting approach,'' said Jens Schlueter, vice
president for marketing and research for Informative, a company
that helps Web-based companies conduct online market research. The
big difference between Fuqua's experiments and typical focus group
projects, he said, is that the business-school students will be
exploring the limitations of the devices over weeks and months,
rather than hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlueter questions whether the companies will be getting an
accurate picture of how their devices are received, given that the
students who choose to be involved may be more enthusiastic about
technology than those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffler said he was well aware of such limitations. ``We are
already starting with a pretty biased sample,'' he said, since
business school students are typically knowledgeable about
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he argued, several companies like the idea that they
can put their devices in front of people who are aware of the
limitations of current technology. ``These students probably
already have a notebook computer right now,'' said Johnson of
Aqcess Technologies. ``They may even have a portable digital
assistant. It's a perfect audience for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But from an educational perspective the project does leave some
academics questioning the wisdom of Duke's embracing the role of
beta tester. The potential for students to be overly focused on the
devices worries Rob Kling, a professor of information science at
Indiana University and editor of the technology journal Information
Society.
</P>
<P>
   A dean might be concerned about complaints from professors about
laptops, Kling said, but ``doubtless he'll still be hearing
complaints from faculty who have students in classes who are
distracted by their new gadgets, trying to get them to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fuqua's professors and administrators are already
planning to have entire classes of students try out the devices,
possibly requiring everyone in a course to sign a nondisclosure
agreement before attending.
</P>
<P>
   Huber, for example, teaches a course called The Marketing of
High Technology. The devices, he said, would be perfect for his
course and could help him interact with students in the classroom.
They might enable him to transfer presentations or spreadsheets
from a gadget's display panel to a large screen in front of the
class. And with everyone operating under the same agreements to
keep quiet outside the classroom, he said, students in class could
freely talk about the technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Huber says he will watch carefully for any signs that the
devices are getting in the way of learning. ``We'll also have paper
there,'' he added, ``if we need to regroup.''

OFFICIAL SEEKS FILMMAKER'S KNOWLEDGE OF WACO EVENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Danforth, the former senator investigating the possibility
of a government cover-up in the deaths of Branch Davidians near
Waco in 1993, is seeking information from a producer whose film has
raised questions about the events at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Gifford, executive producer of the Emmy-winning
documentary ``Waco: The Rules of Engagement,'' said he doesn't
trust the special counsel's investigation and thinks it is too
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all I know, this process might have been set up to see who
has been talking and smite them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford received a letter dated Sept. 20 saying Danforth wanted
Gifford's views on the investigation, including the use of tear gas
canisters and the use of the U.S. armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth to investigate
the 1993 events after recent news reports focused on pyrotechnic
tear gas canisters used on the last day of the standoff. The
government has said that the military canisters were fired hours
before the fire began and that they were far from where the fire
originated.
</P>
<P>
   Two congressional investigations are also expected. However, the
senator leading an inquiry into the Justice Department's handling
of high-profile cases said on Tuesday that he will focus more on
the investigation into Chinese espionage than on Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do about Waco except correct procedures
for the future,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told The Associated
Press. ``Espionage, I think, is the No. 1 priority. ... That's an
issue of America at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1993, four agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and six members of the Branch Davidian sect
died in a shootout at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   A 51-day standoff ensued, and on April 19, 1993, fire roared
through the Davidians' compound after the FBI introduced tear gas
into it. The bodies of about 80 sect members, including women and
children, were found in the remains of the fire. The body of cult
leader David Koresh was also found.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional hearing in 1995 determined that the Branch
Davidians caused the fire, but some people remain suspicious about
the government's role. Those concerns were captured in Gifford's
1997 film, which was nominated for an Oscar in 1998 for best
documentary and won an Emmy in 1999 for investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McNulty, a researcher for ``Waco: The Rules of
Engagement,'' said that he has not received a letter from
Danforth's investigators but that he has talked to them by phone.
</P>
<P>
   But Gifford is reluctant. As a former journalist for ABC News,
CNN and ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Report,'' Gifford said, he must
protect confidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I think is important is already in the film,''
Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said he believes that Danforth's investigation focuses
too narrowly on the events of April 19, 1993, which Gifford said
will leave unquestioned the government's decisions leading up to
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Justice spokesman Myron Marlin referred all
questions about limiting the investigation to April 19, 1993, to
what Reno and Danforth said in a Sept. 9 news conference.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Danforth said he would be looking at whether the
government was involved in bad acts, not bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what we are not going to be looking at is whether it was
advisable in the first place for ATF to be concerned about the
Branch Davidians, whether it was a good idea or not to stage the
raid in February of 1993, or in April of 1993, for that matter, or
the psychological efforts that took place between,'' Danforth said.

   Software for Palm VII Widens E-Mail Access
</P>
<P>
   Palm VII, the latest generation of the popular Palm electronic
organizers, is getting help from a start-up company giving away
software that lets Palm VII users retrieve e-mail from a variety of
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII, soon to be released nationally by 3Com, wirelessly
sends and receives e-mail messages through a special Palm VII
iMessenger service. ThinAirApps.com aims to change all of that with
its Thin Air Mail 1.2, an application that gives Palm VII users
access to other personal e-mail accounts, including Hot Mail and
others provided by Mindspring, Netcom and AT&AMP;T Worldnet. (America
Online is not included.)
</P>
<P>
   While the software (which can be downloaded from
thinairapps.com) is free, e-mail is still subject to Palm.net
network charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accessing your e-mail from any source at any time and place is
the killer app for the Palm VII organizer,'' said Jon Oakes,
co-founder of ThinAirApps.com, now two months old.

   Headsets Get a Makeover To Match Their New Cachet
</P>
<P>
   Headsets are cool. At least that's what Plantronics is hoping.
The Silicon Valley company, which has been making telephone
headsets since 1962, recently introduced a new line of headsets for
cell and cordless phones with a decidedly younger, trendier
customer in mind.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are headsets something to associate with telephone
operators. They're the latest accessory for actors. Think ``Jerry
Maguire'' or ``The Matrix'' or ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The smallest and slickest of Plantronics' new M series headsets,
which come in blue, silver and black, pops over one ear and a small
microphone boom extends toward the mouth. That is in contrast to
the ``soap on a rope'' style of microphones sold by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never found the sound quality to be good enough on those,''
said Debbie Abbott, director of marketing at Plantronics. The
retail price of the new headsets ranges from $29.95 to $64.95.
</P>
<P>
   Plantronics is also playing up the safety angle for headsets in
the car, although the safety benefit of using a headset while
driving is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that it is not the physical distraction but
the mental one that makes it so dangerous to drive while using a
cell phone.

   Europeans Trail Americans In Time on Line, Survey Says
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the days of de Tocqueville, Europeans and Americans
have been comparing themselves. A survey being released Thursday by
PricewaterhouseCoopers adds an Internet angle: More Americans have
home access to the Internet than their European counterparts, the
survey says, and they spend more time logged on.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of Americans, 24 percent of the British, 18
percent of Germans and 10 percent of the French have access to the
Internet at home, according to the survey, which polled 800 people
in each of the four countries. On average, Americans are spending
5.3 hours on line per week, while Europeans devote half as much
time to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Americans said they were logging on to check e-mail, conduct
research, read the news and shop. The survey also showed that the
percentage of Americans with Internet access who did not purchase
anything online dropped from 30 percent last year to 19 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans also mentioned research, news gathering and e-mail as
reasons for logging onto the Internet, but fewer than a third of
those with Internet access said they shopped on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, however, may be well ahead of everyone else when it
comes to using an electronic checkbook: 55 percent of Germans said
that online banking and investing were reasons they logged on to
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 percent of Americans, 16 percent of the British and 15
percent of the French offered those reasons.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That there is more than one way to skin a WASP is
being demonstrated by two very different, but equally
authoritative, anatomists at the moment. Their names are Amy
Sedaris and Cynthia Nixon, and they currently share the stage of
the Greenwich House Theater in the Drama Dept.'s production of
``The Country Club,'' Douglas Carter Beane's patchy comedy of rich
white people behaving badly.
</P>
<P>
   Both actresses are playing seriously dissatisfied suburban women
who are burdened with material comfort, Protestant neuroses and
silly nicknames and who, approaching 30, just can't make that leap
of faith from adolescence to adulthood. Their ilk was known in
American literature even before John Cheever met a typewriter. You
wouldn't think there's a lot more to be said about them.
</P>
<P>
   But in this alternately witty and watery play from the author of
the off- Broadway hit ``As Bees in Honey Drown,'' Ms. Sedaris and
Ms. Nixon turn roles that might have registered as soggy white
bread into French toast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sedaris, best known for her flamboyant turns in subversive
spoofs written with her brother, David Sedaris, is an aggressive,
original caricaturist, working in loopy broad strokes of acid. Ms.
Nixon, a cast member of HBO's ``Sex and the City'' and a perennial
of the New York theater since she made her Broadway debut as a
teen-ager, tends to work from the inside out, with an intensity
that suggests she truly feels her characters' pain.
</P>
<P>
   They are not necessarily actresses you would think of putting in
the same production, but here you're grateful for the counterpoint
they provide, as they take alternate routes in portraying similarly
spoiled and scared women. As Soos, a shaky young divorcee who
returns from California to the affluent, insular town in
Pennsylvania where she grew up, Ms. Nixon is all frayed nerve
endings sheathed in a fragile flippancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sedaris' Froggy, a Brooks Brothers-armored matron who lives
for the next party, is a louder creation. The performance is
centered on Ms. Sedaris' jaw, which she clenches forcefully to
suggest everything from atomic irritation to boisterous delight.
Like most of her tribe Froggy speaks in hyperbole (``Am I
overwhelmed? I  &UR; am &LR;  overwhelmed!''), and Ms. Sedaris gives a
matching hyperbolic performance. Yet her overstatement feels as
fresh and genuine as Ms. Nixon's understatement.
</P>
<P>
   These performances, nicely supplemented by Amy Hohn's droll take
on the most centered of the comedy's WASP women, are essential to
``The Country Club,'' which has been directed with a feathery touch
by the omnipresent Christopher Ashley. The play was written before
Beane's delectable ``Bees,'' and though it has some lovely
stretches of galloping dialogue, it is far less certain in
structure and far less acute as social observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Country Club'' occurs in territory somewhere between the
works of A.R. Gurney, the most accomplished theatrical chronicler
of WASP doubts and mores, and ``This Is Our Youth,'' Kenneth
Lonergan's smashing study of disaffected young adults holding on to
their high school hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Wyomissing, Pa., in the womblike ``cub room'' of the club
of the title, the comedy follows a year in the lives of six insular
friends (and one outsider) through a series of holiday-themed
parties where drinks are bolted and truths are spewed.
</P>
<P>
   Beane has the ear of both the natural dramatist and the inspired
satirist, often bringing a transforming poetic sparkle to the
conventions of WASP-speak. (Soos on discovering that her husband
had stopped loving her: ``Muzak was playing in his head or
something. . . . Behind those eyes, he was hearing the theme to `A
Summer Place.''')
</P>
<P>
   He has also come up with some terrific set pieces. They include
Soos' description of a very telling April Fool's joke played by her
mother and a scene in which a night of teen-age debauchery is
recalled in a wistful three-part harmony of memories.
</P>
<P>
   These moments are the spice in a plot that leans toward the
blandly predictable. Its catalyst is the charming, restless Zip
(Tom Everett Scott), whose romantic attentions shift from Soos to
Chloe (Callie Thorne), a working-class Roman Catholic girl from
Philadelphia who is engaged to Zip's best friend, the alcoholic
Hutch (Frederick Weller).
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe in any of these relationships, partly
because Beane draws men less convincingly than he does women, and
partly because he uses his story as a platform for some awfully
familiar observations on a shallow generation's angst. Peter
Benson, as Froggy's starchy husband, delivers a resentful tirade
about missing out on the political engagement of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hohn must comment, after a withering catalog of
dysfunctional traits of club members, ``We all have our little
stories, and nobody brings 'em up.'' And Soos, after a well-shaped
exchange of marital fantasies with Zip, suddenly descends to a far
too blunt summing up: ``I know have everything going for me, but I
still feel nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Country Club'' has been produced with the stylishness one
has come to expect from the Drama Dept., from James M. Youmans'
all-white setting, in which champagne bottles provide the color,
and Jonathan Bixby's and Gregory A. Gale's sociologically perfect
costumes to Frances Aronson's subtly surreal lighting, which
accents things like swan ice sculptures with wry portentousness.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe also continues to offer the valuable service of
letting New York audiences watch its members try on different
guises and attitudes. It has been a pleasure seeing Ms. Nixon range
through a repertory of diverse supporting and starring roles (this
one provides the best fit).
</P>
<P>
   And despite its limitations, ``The Country Club'' confirms the
reputation of Beane, the company's artistic director, as a
dialogist of refreshing grace and bite. Because his distinctive
talents are so in evidence here, you feel doubly sorry about the
feebleness of the dramatic frame that supports them. The author
would do well to consider a question posed by one of his
characters: ``How do you say something without saying it?''

ONE FOR THE `MUMMY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE MUMMY'
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG-13, Universal, CC, VHS $22.98, DVD $29.98
</P>
<P>
   Some films are remakes posing as sequels. Take ``I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer'' _ please.
</P>
<P>
   But this new ``Mummy'' is another critter. Technically, it's a
remake of the creaky 1932 original ``Mummy'' with Boris Karloff,
but it plays more like a prequel to another film: ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser is the Indiana Jones surrogate, an American
adventurer who seeks treasure in 1920s Egypt and uncovers an
ancient, supernatural menace.
</P>
<P>
   He's joined by a spunky librarian (Rachel Weisz of ``Stealing
Beauty'') and her sardonic brother (John Hannah of ``Sliding
Doors''). Arnold Vosloo (``Darkman II'') plays the mummy menace,
with help from effects that turn him into a skeleton draped with
strips of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``The Mummy'' can be creepy. But most of its scares are
more fun than frightening, and the accent's on adventure laced with
laughs and romance.
</P>
<P>
   Director-writer Stephen Sommers deftly treads a thin line
between homage and parody. He affectionately summons ghosts of '40s
adventure movies while one-upping them with preposterous events
empowered by show-off effects.
</P>
<P>
   But also credit Fraser. After playing a sympathetic admirer of
the ``Frankenstein'' films' creator (James Whale) in ``Gods and
Monsters,'' Fraser stretches with ease into a hammy hero armed with
guts, guns and gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Add his sweetly self-effacing humor in ``Blast From the Past''
and he's shown a range far beyond his cartoonish parts in ``Dudley
Do-Right,'' ``Encino Man'' or ``George of the Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time for another young actor to play the buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WALLACE, GROMIT AND DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As animation veers more from the drawing board to computer
terminals, the work known as stop-motion animation tends to be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Harryhausen has long since retired, and the last significant
stop-motion movie was 1993's ``The Nightmare Before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain's Nick Park keeps the flame burning, and his superb
works are reaching DVD.
</P>
<P>
   This week brings ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit _ The First Adventures'' to
the format (BBC Video, $34.98). The disc has all three of Park's
cartoons starring the cheese-loving English inventor and his
whip-smart dog, Gromit.
</P>
<P>
   These shorts have been available for three years on individual
tapes for $9.98 or in a boxed set for $24.98. But the DVD also
offers extras, including screen tests, clips of Park's early work,
BBC Christmas promos with Wallace &AMP; Gromit, and a look at the
creation of ``The Wrong Trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   In that Oscar-winning short, the duo is immersed in an elaborate
plot involving a villainous penguin and mechanical pants.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Grand Day Out,'' they explore the moon in search of more
cheese. ``In A Close Shave,'' Gromit is framed for stealing sheep,
while Wallace falls in love.
</P>
<P>
   Park's richly entertaining work has far more expressiveness than
more sophisticated efforts from Disney, Pixar and other studios.
Call these old-fashioned cartoons quaint, if you will _ or call
them inspired.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to see a sample, look for current gasoline ads
with toothy, talking cars from Park's Aardman Animations. Then
watch for his next animated film, ``Chicken Run'' (without Wallace
&AMP; Gromit), due next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`FLYING' WACKY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, time for something completely different: British humor with
a wildly wacky bent.
</P>
<P>
   The first 13 episodes of ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' arrive
this week from A&AMP;E Home Video.
</P>
<P>
   They're split onto two boxed sets of three videos costing $29.95
(or $12.95 for individual tapes), or two two-disc DVD sets costing
$44.95 each (or $24.95 for single discs).
</P>
<P>
   DVD extras include a ``sketch index'' for instant access to such
lunacy as ``tasty bits of dead people'' and ``musical mice.''
</P>
<P>
   DVDs also have live performances by the Python troupe, a trivia
quiz, Web links, bios, galleries of photos and illustrations and a
karaoke feature.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the DVD debut of ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail''
(Columbia TriStar, $24.95). Extras are minimal, but that film is as
good as the Brit twits get.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A `SLEEPLESS' DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another new DVD is ``Sleepless in Seattle Special Edition''
(Columbia TriStar, $27.95), and it's packed with extras: trailers,
audio commentary, a ``Love in the Movies'' featurette and a music
video of ``When I Fall in Love.''

 &HT;    ALLIANCE COLLAPSE CALLED ``BLUNDER OF CENTURY'' FOR MEXICAN
OPPOSITION
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It was going to be called the ``Great Alliance for
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's being mourned by supporters as one of the greatest
flops for democracy in Mexico this century.
</P>
<P>
   This week, dreams went up in smoke _ for now _ of forging a
sweeping opposition coalition that could have finally ended 70
years of one-party control of Mexico's presidency. The bone of
contention was not ideological differences, but disagreements over
how various political parties would unite and select one candidate
to run for president in Mexico's July 2, 2000, election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the blunder of the century for Mexico's opposition,''
said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a senator who is not affiliated with a
party but has been active in Mexico's left opposition in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The participants ``were too narrow-minded, ambitious and
selfish,'' Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   The implosion of the alliance is a gift to Mexico's ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, which has controlled the
country's presidency for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Under attack for corruption and for failing to solve Mexico's
severe poverty and inequality, the PRI is thought to be more
vulnerable than ever to electoral defeat. As a result, this year,
the party is trying to renovate its image by holding its first-ever
primary election to allow voters to select the party's nominee for
the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of an alliance also strengthens the PRI's chances
of victory once again next year. A slim chance exists that the
largest opposition parties might talk again about shaping a
coalition, but those close to the failed negotiations believe that
bad blood will prevent that from happening before a December
deadline to register an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed that as much as 60 percent of Mexicans supported
the idea of an alliance to confront the PRI in next year's
presidential election. The polls also showed that if the election
were held today, an alliance would defeat the formidable PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But late Tuesday night, four months of negotiations among eight
opposition parties collapsed _ primarily because Mexico's
conservative National Action Party, or PAN, would not accept a
proposal to hold a nationwide primary to select an alliance
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just changed the history of Mexico,'' said a disappointed
Sergio Aguayo, an analyst and democratic activist who served on a
``citizens council'' that came up with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, former Guanajuato state governote Fox _ who
has already been selected by the PAN as its nominee _ appeared
well-positioned to win such an election, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   His main rival for an alliance nomination would have been
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who stepped down Tuesday from his job as mayor
of Mexico City to devote himself to his own presidential campaign
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is the likely nominee of Mexico's leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD, which is critical of many of Mexico's
free-market economic reforms alleged as well as PRI corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Once highly popular, Cardenas now trails in many polls that show
him in third or fourth place behind Fox and two candidates vying
for the PRI's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that Cardenas resigned and alliance talks
collapsed, Mexico City's Reforma newspaper published a poll showing
that 60 percent of potential voters preferred Fox as an alliance
candidate. Only 19 percent preferred Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those outside the parties, like me, it was obvious Fox
would win a primary,'' said Aguayo. But the PAN, he said, didn't
trust that its sympathizers or Fox supporters would turn out at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PAN has a pathological insecurity,'' he said. ``There
seems to me to be an almost suicidal drive in all this. And it
seems that Fox is going to be the one who suffers and pays the
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who seemed to take a backseat in the talks compared to
other PAN leaders, tried Wednesday to put a positive spin on the
alliance fracture.
</P>
<P>
   He told a television station that the opposition parties had
managed to come up with a platform, an achievement that might allow
them to pursue more negotiations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, there wasn't only oil and water,'' he said.
``What we found was yeast and flour that made a good bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguayo said he knew forging an alliance was ``an uphill
battle,'' given the differences between the PAN and the PRD, which
are Mexico's two largest opposition parties. The conservative PAN,
which promoted a free-market philosophy long before the PRI, has
little in common with the PRD except its goal to drive the PRI from
power.
</P>
<P>
   But Aguayo said representatives of the two parties didn't
squabble in front of the citizens council about ideology. ``That
never entered into the discussions,'' he said. ``The competition
was for power, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the PAN and the PRD _ along with some
smaller parties _ had managed to unite to successfully run alliance
candidates for governor in Nayarit, Tlaxcala and Baja California
Sur states.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance candidate also ran for governor in Coauhuila state
this past week, but lost to the PRI. Some analysts thought the
defeat helped foreshadow the collapse of the presidential alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PAN and the PRD and their respective candidates are now
sharing blame being heaped on them for foiling the biggest
potential alliance of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas and Fox both think they are the Messiah,'' Aguayo
said, and neither wanted to let the other have the nomination of a
united front.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is trailing, Aguayo said, ``but now he can campaign by
saying the PAN is an accomplice of the regime because they rejected
the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar Zinser said the negotiations were ``never a game of
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Many within the two large opposition parties didn't want to
submit to an alliance, he said, but went to the table because the
Mexican public appeared to support a presidential coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN said the devil was in the details of the proposal. From
the beginning, said Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, a PAN leader, the
PAN had said it was wary of holding an election to choose a
candidate because ti might be tainted by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD held recent self-supervised elections to elect its own
party officers and the balloting was tainted by allegations of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Aguayo said the citizens council was trying to consider the
PAN's concerns by also calling for four independently-supervised
polls of voters to match those results against balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Any Mexican with a voting credential would have been allowed to
vote, but there would have been a pre-registration at some 12,000
stations set up around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought common sense would have forced (the parties) to
accept this was the best thing for Mexico and for them,'' Aguayo
said.

   BEANIES-JUDAIC (Los Angeles) _ Last winter while buying Beanie
Babies for his children's Hanukkah gifts, Steven Hoffman felt some
regret that the animal-shaped bags of beans didn't contain some
religious significance for his family. Within a few weeks, Hoffman
and a friend were developing a line of Judaic-themed beanbag
animals that went on sale last month. Their Chatsworth-based
Macca-Beanies LLC has already sold thousands of toys and expects to
exceed $300,000 in sales in the last quarter of this year. By Chris

   HELVETIA, Ore. _ At midday, Matt Roloff had already pounded
nails into his four-level treehouse, mowed the soccer field, fed
the llamas. Now, he was eyeing the telephone pole on the farm next
door. Two men in hard hats were hooking a crane to the old pole,
preparing to pull it from the ground, but Roloff had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey!'' he shouted across the way. ``Wait a minute! Let me take
that telephone pole off your hands!'' Considering that earlier in
the day, Roloff could not even put on his socks without the help of
his 3-year-old son, this pole-yanking seemed a bit ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   The workers gave him the once-over. It's a dwarf! He's on
crutches! And he's coming our way! Roloff has heard all the jokes
about trolls under the bridge and crazy Munchkins, so The Look is
nothing. He not only expects it, he plays off it.
</P>
<P>
   The workers explained that somebody already had dibs on the
30-foot pole. ``Keep me in mind,'' Roloff said, hobbling back to a
golf-cart-size vehicle. And you wonder: How could they not?
</P>
<P>
   The Roloff farm is a 34-acre fantasy in the lustrous hill
country just west of Portland. Pinot noir grapes, fat blueberries
and computer labs are among the things that grow in the fertile
ground of Washington County. But Roloff has planted something else:
a world, built to his size, to match his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   There is a full-scale pirate's ship anchored next to a pond, a
Western town with jail, bank, sheriff's office, general store,
hotel and blacksmith's shop, eight bridges, a 70-foot mine shaft, a
soccer field, llama pens, a peach orchard, a real fire truck, four
barns, a 24-foot tower designed to shake and thrill and, underlying
it all, more than 300 feet of tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a commercial venture; just an idea that got seriously
out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is what you make of it,'' he said, quoting fellow
dwarf Linda Hunt, the actress, from the movie ``Silverado.'' ``If
it doesn't fit, you make alterations.''
</P>
<P>
   Try getting a Coke from a vending machine with money slots just
out of reach. Or making a call from a pay phone. He talks about all
this in a tone devoid of self-pity. It is by way of explaining how
hostile much of the world is to a 38-year-old man who stands 4 feet
2 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   So, over the last decade, Roloff has been building a little
person's paradise, a place where nobody is ever turned away because
they do not meet minimum height standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have one gripe on this planet it is those signs at
Disneyland that say you must be taller than a certain level to go
on this ride,'' he said. ``Maturity has nothing to do with size.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Roloff got his revenge, of sorts, when a visitor
from Disney dropped by the Roloff fantasy farm. ``He was
impressed,'' Roloff recalled. The two men ended up sharing tips on
how to make great-looking fake rock walls _ ``a real sandy mix of
cement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Roloff is a diastrophic dwarf, which means his joints are
deformed and deteriorating. One hip has two ball joints, and the
other has no socket, for example. And because his condition is
degenerative, the clock is running. ``Every day, I become a little
more of a cripple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, also 4 feet 2, is a more common achondroplastic dwarf,
and has minimal physical problems. They have four children _ twin
boys, age 9; a girl, 6, and the 3 year old _ all but one of whom
are average-size. It for them, Roloff says earnestly, that he has
spent the last decade creating the fun farm. But it is also for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Roloff was a prisoner of childhood, in the words he uses in
his 1999 autobiographical book, ``Against Tall Odds: Being a David
in a Goliath World'' (Multnomah Publishers). He spent nearly five
years of his life either in a hospital bed or a body cast, his bent
frame subjected to more than 15 operations for such things as
straightening his knees and lengthening his legs.
</P>
<P>
   All he wanted were a few days playing with other children, pain
free. ``I used to look out my window and just dream about being Tom
Sawyer, floating away on a raft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was put on hold while Roloff, barely out of high
school, built a prosperous life as a computer programmer and
software expert in the San Francisco Bay area. Along the way, he
played a Munchkin in a film about the making of ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' and an Ewok in the third installment of the ``Star Wars''
series. He also became active in Little People of America, a
national organization for dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, on a job-hunting excursion in Oregon, the Roloffs
spotted a run-down farmhouse and rat-infested barn at the end of a
road just outside the Portland suburb of Hillsboro. ``It was a
dump,'' Roloff recalled. They had just purchased a new home in
California. But she was pregnant, with twins, and they did not want
their children to grow up in the cramped Silicon Valley. The dream,
long dormant, came alive.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the contour of the land, hills and dales, an old
peach orchard off to one side, overgrown fields of alfalfa and
clover, and his mind raced. He started to see the 34 acres as the
world that had been denied him. He bought the farm for $185,000.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the grand design was something the Roloffs kept to
themselves. But as Roloff scoured the Oregon countryside looking
for timbers from collapsing barns, or telephone poles, or aged
fence posts, the neighbors became ever more curious. ``I think at
first they just rolled their eyes,'' Roloff said. ``You know, look
what these crazy little people from California are doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of what he has done, perhaps, is classic guy stuff _ the
chromosomal impulse to build, tinker and remodel. And anyone who
has ever wondered why some men prefer power tools to sex can see
the guy-dream writ large on the Roloff farm. Nothing about it looks
cheap or mass-manufactured, or the least bit tacky. It is all plumb
and solidly built. Most of the project is made of reclaimed timbers
and siding _ the kind of things Home Depot does not sell.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is always dumping off recycled wood or a load of dirt.
One person's hole in the ground becomes Roloff's magic mountain.
After Roloff put out the word that he would like to have hills on
his property for future water slides and falls, contractors have
been more than happy to build his creations from their excavation
sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Roloff vision started in the barn. It was reconstructed,
from floorboards to roof, with old wood that Roloff picked up from
other barns or scrap sites. Now, it is warm and inviting, with
straw bales for sitting, ancient clear fir beams and stairs that
lead up to a loft of hidden nooks and crannies, book-lined and
toy-filled. In order to complete his plan for the barn, Roloff had
to jack it above its foundation. And while the barn was on stilts,
Roloff had another idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, why not put a mine shaft underneath it,'' he said.
``That would be really cool.'' So, he built a 70-foot-long mine
shaft, which runs horizontally, just under the barn, and is
illuminated with red lights. The children have hidden treasures in
the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he concentrated on a place that would be perfect for a
pond. But what good is a deep swimming pond without a full-scale
pirate's ship? He found a man who had built one, but no longer had
any use for it. Roloff purchased it for $2,500. The ``Rolly Polly''
has three sails, below-deck quarters for captain and crew, and a
plank, which serves as a diving board to the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the ship is a bright red 1950s vintage fire truck.
``A guy gave that to me,'' Roloff said. ``I bought some building
materials from him, and he threw in a fire truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The treehouse came about in stages, like a skyscraper, rising
around an old oak tree. The four levels are sturdy, with railing
for protection. But what is remarkable is that the constructed
material never actually touches the tree's branches _ it is wrapped
around the oak. There are six ways inside the house, from ladders
to stairs to a cargo net.
</P>
<P>
   Roloff clambered up to the top floor of the treehouse, 35 feet
above ground. It was a strain on his joints to climb, and with
crutches, it seemed a feat of considerable athleticism. ``Isn't
this cool!'' he said. ``I built this for $500.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western town is the most elaborate of the fantasy
structures. It has a boardwalk, and is covered with
cinnamon-colored siding. A thick steel vault door, reclaimed from a
merchant in eastern Oregon, opens to the bank. The sheriff's office
adjoins the jail. The entire town, though seemingly rock solid, is
built on skids so that it can be rearranged with the help of a
tractor. It cost about $18,000 to build.
</P>
<P>
   A warren of tunnels run beneath the town. To escape from jail,
you slide under a hole in the floor, and hide in the tunnels.
``When I started digging these tunnels, my wife said, `You've
really gone overboard now,''' he said. But Jeremy Roloff, 9, when
asked what his favorite part of the farm was, said, ``All the
underground roads _ they're great for playing hide and go seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the children rarely watch television. And
their friends are ``always bugging us about wanting to come over
and play,'' Jeremy said.
</P>
<P>
   Every Western town needs an Indian village _ for historic
tension, if nothing else _ so Roloff has started work on a native
town, raw pine structures built in a little valley. As obsessed as
Roloff may seem with his creations, he still works a day job. He
sells computer applications, a job that takes him on the road for
days on end. He uses his tractors, backhoes and other heavy
machinery for much of the farm work, but he also hires carpenters,
or relies on volunteers for help.
</P>
<P>
   The house where the Roloffs live is a 1930s, somewhat
nondescript structure full of children and music and ringing
phones. Amy Roloff, though she appreciates the fun farm her husband
has built for the children, would not mind if he focused his
energies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like our house,'' she said. Roloff promises that a major
remodeling of the family home will be forthcoming. But first, he
has a few more things to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow me,'' he said, and he scrambled to another barn, and up
a series of tiny stairs to a cupola with an eagle's view of the
entire spread. He caught his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there ... '' he trailed off, pointing to a
half-constructed tower that looks like a wooden oil derrick, ``
...I'm going to build a Tower of Terror, which will have a
12-foot-by-12-foot platform that will teeter and drop, just enough
to buckle your knees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And over there, I'm going to build the Titanic,'' he said. A
semi-submerged luxury liner requires a lot of water, so Roloff has
already begun digging the biggest hole yet, for a pond that will
serve as the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much to do. He plans to create a waterfall that will
tumble down one of the big mounds of dirt, splashing into a jungle
of plants that grow in Oregon's temperate climate _ ``like the
Garden of Eden, but a little more fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a master plan,'' he said. ``But it's all in my head,
and it keeps growing.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens, he is asked, when the children are grown and gone,
and he and Amy are left with the Roloff fantasy. He stared at the
34 acres, bathed in the soft light of an Indian summer afternoon.
For the first time that day, he looked puzzled. ``I don't know,''
he said.

IN ROME, ANCIENT RUINS STALL RAMP TO `GOD'S PARKING LOT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Workers building a ramp to a vast Vatican garage for
pilgrims recently stumbled on walls of an ancient Roman villa.
</P>
<P>
   Now work has halted on the ramp to ``God's parking lot,'' as it
is known locally, while Italy decides what is more important:
preserving remnants of Rome's imperial past, or building modern
amenities to insure a smooth pilgrims' progress for as many as 30
million visitors expected in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real test, a clash between modernity and the past,''
said Oreste Rutigliano, a spokesman for Italia Nostra, a
conservation association that is lobbying to close down the ramp
and resurrect the ruins. ``To permit modernity to win out would be
a terrible symbol for the jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments draw eye-rolls from some of the engineers and
city officials who have to get Rome and its roads ready by
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rome already has plenty of Roman walls, perhaps too
many,'' said Luigi Scavizzi, an engineer with Geosonda, the
construction company that is building the access ramp. ``This may
be a famous site to some, but to me it's just a bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Those bothersome walls date from about the first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Government archaeologists who are now gingerly sifting through
the site say they have not determined who built them, but already
some Italian archaeologists are saying it may have been a villa of
Agrippina, Caligula's sister and Nero's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though not remembered for her sweetness (among other things, she
is accused of poisoning several husbands, including Claudius),
Agrippina had a cheery taste in decor; the walls still show traces
of delicate floral patterns and songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to dig in Rome without stumbling on some
ancient artifact. Two weeks ago, archaeologists at a different site
found a second-century A.D. base of a statue, covered with reliefs
of Hercules, as well as pavement and walls that were once back of
the stage of the theater of Marcellus. In that case, however, the
discovery did not compete with new construction.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the walls discovered under the Janiculum Hill
next to the Vatican last month were the first archaeological find
that required tough choices since preparations for the year 2000
began.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are close to 700 construction sites snarling
traffic in Rome, and more than half are repairs undertaken
specifically for the jubilee celebrations of the Roman Catholic
Church. Holy Years, when the faithful are exhorted to make
pilgrimages to Rome, were introduced in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII,
and now take place every 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is a city haunted by the way previous generations
recklessly bulldozed through buried Greek columns and Roman villas
to modernize the capital. After World War II, construction crews
destroyed whole Roman neighborhoods to build subways and the train
station of Termini, which was inaugurated for the 1950 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   The country's feelings of guilt were most powerfully invoked in
a scene in Fellini's ``Roma'': subway workers digging underground
crash through a wall and stare silently as giant frescoes flake and
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Rome,'' said Emanuele Gatti, a classical archaeologist
who specializes in central Rome. ``We have found a lot. We have
destroyed a lot. And underground there is still an unquantifiable
amount of treasures to be discovered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rome is undergoing an extraordinary, $950 million make-over for
the year 2000, but some of its most ambitious plans have been
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   A highway underpass beneath Castel Sant'Angelo was scrapped
after environmental groups, urban planners and archaeologists
protested that the digging would damage the foundations of the
second-century mausoleum built by the Emperor Hadrian. Other
projects have hit different snags. Earlier this month, heavy rains
drove a gaping hole in a newly completed highway tunnel built under
the Appian Way.
</P>
<P>
   The underground parking lot, which is still being built to
accommodate 115 buses and 800 cars, is on Vatican territory near
St. Peter's, a $45 million project whose cost is being evenly
divided by the Italian government and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot is the Vatican's only major jubilee expense;
pilgrims will have to pay to book spaces at big public Masses and
major Holy Year events. The Italian government and the city of Rome
are paying for street repairs and restoration of historic
buildings, including churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not even have to pay to clean up St. Peter's.
The gleaming $5.4 million restored facade, which was unveiled on
Tuesday, was executed and paid for by ENI, the Italian energy
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The ramp is on state-owned land, and its fate falls under the
jurisdiction of the Culture Ministry, which must determine the
value of the find. A special committee is expected to decide soon
whether to stop building the ramp. Italia Nostra officials argue
that since the project envisions two ramps, the Vatican and Rome
can manage with only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have managed with one, we wouldn't have spent the
money to build two,'' Scavizzi retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Mocchegiani-Carpano, an archaeologist for the
government's Rome office of archaeology, said: ``This is not the
find of the century, but we would never destroy the ruins. If they
are of less importance, they could be moved, but such decisions
will be up to the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that option could significantly delay the completion of the
ramp. Officials responsible for readying the city are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the decision that is made,'' said Maurizio
Pucci, an official with the Rome Agency for the Preparation of the
Jubilee, which is coordinating year 2000 projects. ``But we are
awaiting it with trepidation.''

OPPOSITION LEADERS SEEK TO CREATE A UNIFIED FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Leaders of the divided opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia are making another,
slightly desperate effort to create a common front around the issue
of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly anti-Milosevic
rallies, the leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly
seeking a reconciliation with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former head of the central bank who is their choice for prime
minister in any transitional government. Avramovic said in an
interview that Milosevic could too easily ignore a divided
opposition and that the protest turnouts had been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties are to
attend a conference on free and fair elections. If the round table
succeeds, Draskovic said, he will throw his support to rallies to
press for early elections as the best and only effective way to
oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has been insistent that Milosevic has to resign
first, if there is be a chance for fair elections. But their
campaign shows no sign of bringing about a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join the rallies, calling them
pointless and a waste of time. He has not lent them his party's
organizational skills or helped publicize them on Studio B, the
Belgrade city television station that he controls.
</P>
<P>
   So the alliance leaders, most notably Zoran Djindjic of the
Democratic Party, are convinced that Draskovic intended to see
these rallies fail altogether, perhaps destroying Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rallies did nearly fail. They began last Tuesday.
But by Thursday night, the turnout was so low and dispirited _
fewer than 5,000 people _ that Djindjic talked bitterly about
calling off the rallies or resigning.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief aide, Cedomir Jovanovic, a former student leader,
urged him to forget the speeches and give in to the crowd's desire
for action _ to march, rather than listen. The numbers shot back up
to 20,000 and then to 30,000 or more on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are dropping again, with 5,000 on a rainy
Tuesday night. Wednesday night, the alliance announced a march on
``the forbidden hill,'' the Dedinje district where Milosevic lives.
Alliance officials said this was again a response to a perceived
desire for more action.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said that they believed that they had
saved the rallies and themselves and that they were proud that
Draskovic still had them to deal with. But the main target,
Milosevic, remains remote.
</P>
<P>
   There is some nervousness evident from the government, with the
police in riot gear carefully hidden in case of incidents and a new
crackdown on the nonpayment of taxes, indications of the increasing
economic squeeze that the government faces.
</P>
<P>
   State television remains dismissive about the opposition as NATO
agents and puppets, and counterposters have appeared to mock
alliance posters. One alliance poster shows Djindjic with his child
on his back. The new poster shows President Clinton with Djindjic
on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Important alliance leaders do not really trust Avramovic, who
had made his own approach to Draskovic, though he did tell the
Alliance about that. They apparently believe that Avramovic has his
own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, who will be 80 in two weeks, scoffs at those
concerns. But he said the alliance was too narrow a base to carry
the day against the government, and he is trying, no matter their
concerns, to build a bigger coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The election conference will be run by Dragoljub Micunovic, the
leader of a small party and a friend of Avramovic, and all
opposition parties have agreed to attend. Micunovic said he
expected all the opposition members would ``realize that their
competitors are not in that room, but rather somewhere outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, if successful, will probably include demands for
elections on all levels; revised electoral districts; an open
press, especially television; a revised media law, and strict
supervision by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few ideological differences among the opposition
parties,'' Avramovic said. ``If the round table can agree, then for
the first time, the government will face a real united front. But
you have to have elections. Period. The question is how quickly and
under what conditions. And I hope Mr. Milosevic will see the point
and resign without a fight, for that would win him considerable
support here for not going to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior government official and an executive who had just
seen Milosevic said he was in no mood to resign or schedule early
elections. ``He's just taken 78 days of bombing by NATO,'' the
businessman said. ``Do you really think he's going to surrender to
Zoran Djindjic?''

GORE CHALLENGES BRADLEY TO DEBATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to jump-start his stalled presidential
effort, Al Gore challenged his Democratic competitor Bill Bradley
on Wednesday to a series of debates and announced he was moving his
campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grass roots and directly to the American people,'' Gore told
reporters at a hastily called news conference at his downtown
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had instructed his campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, ``to move this whole campaign, lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville,'' where Gore said he expected ``to get closer to the
American people, closer to the grass roots and out of the Beltway
and into the heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former senator and House member from Tennessee and the son
of a U.S. senator, Gore has nevertheless spent much of his life in
Washington and is considered part of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he also will begin to hold a series of town-hall
meetings in key primary states and challenged Bradley to a series
of of debates on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in strategy comes at a time when Gore is facing an
unexpectedly strong challenge from Bradley, whom the vice president
has tried for months to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has demonstrated surprising fund-raising prowess and is
drawing increasing support from prominent Democrats such as New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who said recently that he did
not believe Gore could win the White House. A half-dozen other
former Senate colleagues of Gore have endorsed Bradley, also a
former senator.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore still leads Bradley in national surveys, the former
New Jersey senator has been making gains in key primary states such
as New Hampshire, where a recent poll showed him beating Gore, and
New York, where Bradley played for the NBA Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of statewide surveys show Bradley doing better than
Gore against Republican front-runner George W. Bush, who continues
to lead the vice president nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged that the dynamics of the campaign have
changed and that he must take his primary challenger more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a brand new campaign. It is a competitive,
hard-fought battle for the Democratic nomination,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two candidates. You've got Pepsi and you've got
Coke,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied that his abrupt change in tactics were related to
fund-raising problems that may be underscored in Wednesday's
release of third-quarter campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   Previous disclosures showed Bradley doing a better job of
husbanding his resources than the Gore campaign, which has been
criticized for spending too much on consultants and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to report raising $6.5 million in the third
quarter, bringing the year's total to $24 million. He is expected
to have about $9.5 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he wanted to have ``a bunch'' of debates
with Bradley on such issues as health care, education, national
defense, the environment and crime control.
</P>
<P>
   The call for debates was perhaps the most telling sign of the
reversal of fortune for Gore, who was originally considered a
shoo-in for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for the underdog candidates to clamor for debates
while the front-runners often shun such face-offs based on the
assumption that they provide free publicity to their challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California, Bradley responded to Gore's offer:
``For the last 10 months the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me. I think that shows
we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bradley noted that he had accepted a
number of joint appearances with the vice president, including a
town-hall meeting Oct. 27 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan
said that Gore's latest moves stemmed from a ``a combination of a
certain sense of desperation and a healthy desire to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that while Gore's decision to move his office out
of Washington may be largely symbolic and superficial, the
challenge to debate his competitor was more substantive and carried
with it significant risks.
</P>
<P>
   While such forums could reinforce voters' impression that Gore
is a stiff creature of Washington, they could also prompt voters to
take another look at his candidacy. Gore is considered a skillful
debater, who bested Ross Perot in a widely watched duel in 1993
over the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debating with Bradley will allow people to pay more attention
to Gore. Bradley is getting all the ink right now,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Democratic debates might put pressure on Bush to
engage his rivals. So far, the Texas governor has refused to debate
the other Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore promised to open his new headquarters in Nashville by
next week, neither he nor his staff could provide many details
regarding how many people would actually move.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Gore only made the decision to move Monday night
and informed most of his staff Wednesday morning before speaking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore will still live in his official
residence in Washington, although he also has a home in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had informed President Clinton on Wednesday morning
of his intentions to move.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts have opined that one of Gore's problems
is his association with the scandal-plagued Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said that he assumed the
president approved of moving the headquarters, noting that Clinton
ran his 1992 presidential campaign out of Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just believes you are better off closer to the people
outside the Beltway,'' Lockhart said.

NICKLAUS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would like to personally thank the people of Boston and 12
talented American golfers for giving us the most exciting Ryder Cup
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final-round TV-ratings were the highest in Cup history
and we owe it all to you.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many special moments.
</P>
<P>
   Like when a fan spat in the face of European captain Mark James'
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Like that little spike-shoed clog-dance the American players so
thoughtfully performed in the line of Jose Maria Olazabal's
potentially Cup-winning putt on the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   Or the cheering when the Europeans hit a bad shot or missed a
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Or heckling Colin Montgomerie so mercilessly that his father
couldn't stand it anymore and walked back to the clubhouse after 7
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Or steering Andrew Coltart in the wrong direction when he was
looking for his ball in the rough and suddenly ``finding'' it 30
seconds after he had to take a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to win, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, these are some of our bitterest enemies, these Brits,
Swedes and Spaniards. Wasn't it Ireland that was responsible for
stealing our nuclear-weapons secrets a while back? No, wait. That
was China. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Now the British tabloids are whining that we're a bunch of bad
sports.
</P>
<P>
   United Slobs of America they're calling us. James doesn't want
to play over here anymore. Montgomerie's having second thoughts,
too.
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch of babies, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it's not like Tom Lehman bashed a folding chair over
Olazabal's head or bowled him over with a flying drop-kick just as
he drew back his putter.(Though that might have been necessary if
Justin Leonard hadn't made that long putt seconds before.)
</P>
<P>
   All the American team did was ``modify'' the line of Ollie's
putt a little, sort of the way the Department of Transportation
modifies the surface of interstates before repaving.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he would have been happier if we had set out some orange
construction cones or some detour signs.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy har har.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys I was watching the Ryder Cup with Sunday
afternoon _ a person who clearly fails to appreciate how ``edgy''
golf has become _ said that if Jack Nicklaus had been in that
situation Sunday afternoon and seen the American team turn
Olazabal's line into a cattle trail, he would have given the
Spaniard his putt, all 30-feet of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, Ollie. Pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   My team, in its exuberance, thoughtlessly breeched a fundamental
tenet of golfing etiquette. I will not allow you to suffer for it,
even if it means losing the Ryder Cup. The game is not played that
way, and the game is more important than some cheesy trophy.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that Nicklaus, the greatest and fiercest
competitor in the history of golf, would have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't know is how some U.S. fans might have reacted to
Nicklaus' demonstration of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But I bet Mark James' wife has a clue.
</P>

`WORK' DOESN'T, AFTER THE FIRST LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WORK WITH ME 
Starring: Kevin Pollak, Nancy Travis, Ethan Embry, Emily
Rutherford 
On: CBS, Wednesday night at 8:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitcom couples don't have much less chemistry than Nancy Travis
and Kevin Pollak in ``Work With Me.'' But that's not the only
problem with this laugh-track-heavy show. ``Work With Me'' is
suffering from a full-blown case of one-joke-itis, a debilitating
disease that is just not rare enough.
</P>
<P>
   The big concept is that Travis and Pollak are a married couple
who work together. Pollak's hotheaded lawyer quits his firm after
getting passed over for partnership, and so he installs himself at
his wife's smaller firm. Can they share an office without straining
their marriage? That tedious question is the show's main source of
material. The premiere dives headlong into the most cliched plot
possible, as Pollak becomes insanely jealous of one of Travis's
handsome clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work With Me'' has two supporting characters, secretaries who
are trying to hide their love affair. Their first coverup bit is
amusing; their fifth is numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Travis, last seen on series TV in ``Almost Perfect,'' is too
tightly wound here. She appears to be going for high-strung sitcom
acting, but she'd be funnier if she relaxed a bit. Pollak is better
with his type A shtick, but the script lets him down.

`POPULAR' SHARPLY DISSECTS TEEN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

POPULAR

On: WB, Thursday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the special of the day at the youth market is a new series
called ``Popular.'' Yes, folks, yet another TV chronicle of life in
the pimple lane, with a cast of fresh faces coping with alienation,
isolation, exfoliation, and how to deliver self-aware dialogue
without tripping over tongue rings. Yes, more glorious high school
angst glazed with the sort of mall-savvy WB precociousness that
makes jeans companies pant. More ``Dawson's Creek'' chic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. ``Popular,'' which premiered Wednesday at 9,
is a surprisingly promising hour that could become something
special if it doesn't cop out and decide to become a hipped-up
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' The theme is a simple one: popularity
contests amid the cafeteria tables and gym lockers. But as it
anatomizes the teen caste system, ``Popular'' is wiser and wittier
and more elaborate than you might think possible. It's an idealized
TV vision, of course _ the girls who think they're ugly are
actually quite beautiful _ but it is based on very real issues of
conformity and acceptance. And it even has a provocative
white-supremacist undercurrent, as a blond cheerleader named Nicole
rules the school's social life like a fascist dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Popular'' characters are split into two cliques. The
ruling-class types include Nicole the Nasty, a sweet-natured jock
named Josh, and his recovering anorexic girlfriend, Brooke McQueen.
And the outsider types include the self-conscious Harrison, an
overweight girl named Carmen, and alternative Everygirl Sam
McPherson. There's a gulf between the groups, except that
``Popular'' muddies the water by having each of the kids flirt with
going over to the other side. Quarterback Josh wants to star in the
school production of ``South Pacific'' and be a ``drama geek,''
while Carmen desperately wants to be a cheerleader. Meanwhile,
Brooke and Sam are forced into a relationship, first as lab
partners, and then when they learn their single parents are dating.
</P>
<P>
   The plot turns in ``Popular'' are familiar, to the tune of
who's-invited-to-the-big-party and who'll
-get-the-part-in-the-school-play. But the show is resourceful in
its telling of these stories, utilizing _ without overusing _
devices like fantasy sequences, voice-overs, and a singer who
comments on the action (a very now-looking Lisa Loeb type).
Overall, it has a heightened tone that brings out the carnival
quality of the fictional Kennedy High School. The cheerleader
scenes are particularly garish and funny, as Nicole and Sam shake
their steely pompoms dressed in gruesomely blue outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The show is also buoyed by some snappy ``Clueless''-like
dialogue and pop reference. ``I am so worshipping your
Gwynethness,'' Brooke says as homage to Nicole. And Sam introduces
this great new putdown: ``Cancel my subscription. I'm over your
issues.'' There are a few too many contemporary quips, with
mentions of ``Monica kneepads,'' a dress that may be ``too Britney
Spears,'' and the rumor that ``Jewel never lived in a car by a
river.'' They are forced. But most of ``Popular'' avoids gratuitous
attitude, as it dissects high school culture like the frogs in Sam
and Brooke's lab pan.

WILDER STORIES; CRITICS' EYES WIDE SHUT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The October Vanity Fair has an absorbing interview with director
Billy Wilder conducted by director Cameron Crowe. It's dish with a
dependable tone, as the 93-year-old Wilder tells stories about his
great movies, including the three he most highly esteems: ``Sunset
Boulevard,'' ``The Apartment,'' and ``Some Like It Hot.'' Not
reticent, except when it comes to the loss of most of his family at
Auschwitz, Wilder holds forth on legendary actors like Cary Grant,
Humphrey Bogart, and, of course, Marilyn Monroe, who was ``very
tough to work with'' as she was always late to the set, sometimes
by eight hours. And once she got to the set, she would use nearly
80 takes for a small line like ``Where's that bourbon?'' from
``Some Like It Hot.'' ``She was either a maniac or she was very,
very soft and gentle,'' he says. ``She was just a continuous
puzzle, without any solution.'' He has less complex feelings for
Arthur Miller: ``He was an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder also had an unfavorable impression of Bogart, who would
try to ridicule him in front of the cast and crew of ``Sabrina.''
Bogart resented the director for not drinking with him, and for
wanting Cary Grant in the ``Sabrina'' role. But when he was dying
of cancer, he summoned Wilder to his home to make an apology for
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder always wanted to work with Cary Grant, who was
``absolutely wonderful,'' if ``very stingy.'' But Grant
consistently resisted, making excuses like, ``Look, I like you,
Wilder, but I cannot explain it. I just . . . the wrong signals
come up in me.'' Wilder also had another unfulfilled wish: to make
``Schindler's List.'' But Steven Spielberg could not give it up.
``It would have been something of my heart, you know,'' Wilder
says.
</P>
<P>

   The debate about ``Eyes Wide Shut'' continues to be more
engaging than the movie itself. Brill's Content looked at the
media's blind willingness to hype Stanley Kubrick's final effort,
and now the October Harper's goes after the critics for not being
able to see the movie through the hype. Writer Lee Siegel's idea is
that they succumbed to ``art-phobia,'' the fear of submitting
oneself to the power of a piece of art. Instead of processing the
movie as a movie, the critics ``decided to respond to the hype,''
he writes. ``And the result was that the hype determined their
experience of the film.'' In the pre-release barrage of sex-based
promotion and gossip about Kubrick ``as an obsessive tyrant,'' they
lost their objectivity and receptivity. Siegel effectively uses
quotes by reviewers like David Denby in The New Yorker and J.
Hoberman in the Village Voice to prove his theory, and he even
seems to nail a few who may have falsely claimed to have read the
1926 novel on which the movie was based.
</P>
<P>
   As Siegel lays out his own overintellectualized, defensive, and
reverential interpretation of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' he too doesn't
seem to have experienced the movie strictly as a movie. Maybe he's
too right, and there is no way to have a pure cinema experience in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movieline has never been shy about the fact that there are
tabloids lurking in its family tree. In addition to being
irreverent, the magazine has always been openly gossip-mongering
and catty. For October, the magazine features a wildly gossipy epic
called ``Hollywood's 50 All-Time Hottest Rumors,'' which includes
the now-famous Richard Gere rodent tale, the purported affair
between Jacqueline Susann and Ethel Merman, and a bunch of absurd
blind items like ``One of America's beloved A-list superstars has
long been rumored to be a big honking pot addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Better reading is Joe Queenan's ``The Kids Are Alright,'' in
which he praises youth-market movies for being ``refreshingly
demented'' and for their resistance to irrelevant happy endings _ a
symptom of movies aimed at baby boomers. ``Adults see their
children watching `The Matrix' and worry they'll come away from it
with a distorted view of reality,'' he writes. ``Meanwhile, adults
flock to films like `Life Is Beautiful,' whose Italian name is
`Buonasera, Auschwitz' '' _ roughly translated as ``Good Evening,
Auschwitz.''

GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE Y2K PREPAREDNESS HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Confident that key computer systems will beat the Y2K
bug, government officials are shifting into public &UR;  &LR; relations mode
as Jan. 1, 2000 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to build expectations the computer glitch won't
cause major disruptions, and in a Boston visit Wednesday, John
Koskinen, the Clinton Administration's chief Y2K adviser, said
large utilities, banks and other service providers have done a good
job advertising fixes they have made.
</P>
<P>
   Attention now should center on smaller companies and public
agencies to see whether they, too, are ready for the date change,
Koskinen said. ``Ultimately, how comfortable people will be depend
on how much information they get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen spoke to a conference on Y2K preparations at the Boston
Public Library, which drew 350 people. It was billed as one of a
series of ``community conversations'' being held around the country
to talk about the potential impact of the software bug.
</P>
<P>
   The term Y2K relates to the practice, in many older computer
programs, to use just the last two digits of each year to keep
track of dates. Left unfixed, such programs could grow confused by
the last two digits of the year 2000 and malfunction or shut down,
potentially causing problems in everything from utility and
cash-machine networks to air-traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and public agencies have spent billions of dollars to
upgrade their systems and avoid breakdowns, and now most large
organizations say they are confident their systems will function
into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Large service providers including Boston Edison, Bell Atlantic,
and Fleet Financial Group Inc., have said since July they met
fix-it deadlines, and representatives were on hand to repeat those
assurances Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One institution cited earlier by the US Department of Energy for
lagging in preparation was a gas-fired power plant in Milford run
by American National Power of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But plant officers Wednesday said they had since obtained
documents to verify that one of its computer-networking devices
would work through the date change.

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ind.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 121 of the 515 deaths, the study found, a parent, sibling, or
other adult sleeping in the bed had inadvertently smothered the
child. More than three-quarters of the children who died from
``overlying'' were younger than 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, sstudy's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report. Death certificates, he said, also may be
misleading: In some regions, coroners may be more likely to
attribute the death of an infant from a poor family to
``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher income
families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at Notre Dame
University, has done studies indicating that infants who sleep with
their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

CANADA STARTS TO TAKE HARD LINE AGAINST ILLEGAL CHINESE
IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HARDY, British Columbia _ When the Canadian navy made a
group of undocumented Chinese migrants get off a ship here
recently, a local man brought his dogs to the dock and encouraged
them to bark at the men and women wrapped in blankets against the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   For Canadian officials, the confrontation represented one
victory in what they say is a rapidly growing effort to smuggle in
illegal immigrants. This summer alone, they confiscated four
trawlers and detained 560 undocumented Chinese citizens who wanted
to make Canada their home.
</P>
<P>
   Western Canada is only one destination in a pan-Pacific surge
this year in illegal Chinese migrants. In the last 16 months, U.S.
Coast Guard ships have intercepted 20 ships carrying undocumented
Chinese in U.S. territorial waters around Guam. In the last six
months, Australia has intercepted 21 boatloads of illegal migrants,
primarily Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now experiencing the largest smuggling operation ever
experienced in Canada,'' Rob Johnston, manager of immigration
enforcement here, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weeks, an Australian diplomat in Ottawa, said of Canada's
sudden concern: ``It's deja vu. The element of the public debate
and concern is very similar to Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australia, the United States and Canada increasingly share
intelligence about vessels believed to be carrying migrants from
southeastern China, Canada has started to take the harder line
traditional in the other two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Chinese ship was intercepted, on July 20, the
authorities in Vancouver released 74 immigrants, pending resolution
of their petitions for refugee status. Within a month, half had
disappeared, presumably for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Canada has adopted a policy of detaining all
undocumented passengers on vessels from China. Sentiment for
immediately deporting them is markedly higher in western Canada
than in provinces on the Atlantic seaboard, opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's population is 20 percent ethnic Chinese, and many of
these Chinese-Canadians fear that each new boatload batters a
carefully constructed racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver is a very tolerant society,'' said Derick Y.H.
Cheng, chairman of the Chinese Cultural Center there. ``We fear
this will make a backlash, give people the stereotype that Chinese
do not abide by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Bill Vander Zalm has jumped back
into politics, starting his campaign for Parliament by saying that
the federal government would pay attention to the immigration issue
only if all the illegal Chinese immigrants detained in the region
were shipped to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure you would get some action then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers portray the boatloads of migrants, largely
from Fujian province, as job-seekers rather than freedom-seekers.
Not long ago, Elinor Caplan, Canada's new immigration minister,
toured a Vancouver Island navy base where 225 immigrants are
detained and said at a packed news conference: ``We are
intercepting, boarding and apprehending those ships. We are then
using greater powers of detention to insure people on the boat do
not flee. The system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials are also reaching across the Pacific, asking
Chinese authorities to help.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting
in New Zealand, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien discussed the
migration problem with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``I told him
we needed collaboration because they could hopefully stop the
departure of the ships from the coast of China that are coming to
our coast,'' Chretien said later. ``He recognized that, and said he
was willing to collaborate with us.''

   SITE 49, SEVEROMORSK, Russia _ Russia has asked the U.S. Energy
Department to expand joint projects aimed at securing dangerous
materials, including nuclear fuel, that could be turned into
weapons, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday on a visit
here.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the proposal incorporated an unusual provision
that would provide the United States greater access to highly
sensitive sites to which Moscow has barred foreigners or permitted
only limited entry.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which Russian and American officials said was
approved by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, was made by Adm.
Vladimir Kuroyedov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, at a
private meeting Wednesday with Richardson and his senior staff.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed a rare tour of Site 49, where the Russian
Navy stores all the nuclear fuel for its vast Northern Fleet, near
Severomorsk, the fleet headquarters, a restricted area.
Richardson's entourage was the first senior American delegation
granted permission to visit what is one of Russia's largest, most
sensitive nuclear naval bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has just completed a 16-month $10 million
security upgrade at Site 49 and at the Murmansk Shipping Co., which
operates atomic-powered icebreakers that are powered with highly
enriched fuel rods that can also be used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Six experts from several Energy Department laboratories have
spent 18 months advising the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, the
former Soviet Union's premier research center on nuclear weapons,
on improving security at the navy's nuclear-fuel storage centers.
Most were run-down and protected by little more than barbed-wire
fences and lightly armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has been working to improve the accounting
and security of such dangerous materials in Russia since 1994. But
its activities here in the Northern Fleet area began only 18 months
ago, after a deranged 19-year-old Russian sailor had seized control
of a nuclear submarine in Murmansk and held the ship for eight
agonizing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the press office at the base, Capt. Sergei
Anoufriev, said the sailor, who had passed a psychological test,
had lied about his mental history. The sailor shot and killed five
crew members before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   That case, Russian and American officials agreed, awakened the
navy to the security threat posed by insiders, rather than foreign
foes. As a result, the Russian Navy began what American officials
called a crash program to consolidate its numerous nuclear-fuel
storage centers into a single complex.
</P>
<P>
   Site 49, with 11,000 square feet of storage, can hold up to 55
tons of highly enriched uranium. Wednesday, Navy officials showed
off double fencing with electronic sensors, bright lights,
foot-thick steel doors, closed-circuit television monitors,
emergency alarms that connect to the headquarters in Murmansk and
response forces in case of a terrorist attack. The giant center,
built into a hill and painted in camouflage, is to begin receiving
fuel next week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Richardson began a weeklong tour of Energy
Department projects at several of the most sensitive military
installations in Russia. The agency spends more than $300 million a
year on projects aimed at bolstering the safety and physical
protection of nuclear fuel and other material that could be used in
bombs. It has projects in 10 of the once-secret nuclear cities at
53 sites throughout the former Soviet Union, 30 of which are in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project,'' Richardson said at Site 49, ``came in on
budget and under the planned time.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul 11: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.
</P>

BUSH HOPES `TO WHIP' BUCHANAN IN GOP PRIMARY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush said Wednesday he wants Pat Buchanan to stay in the
Republican presidential contest because ``I'd like to whip him in
the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting words were in contrast to the conciliatory remarks
he made last week. He said Buchanan should stay in the Republican
Party so it can be united for the general election campaign.
Buchanan then called Bush's remarks ``gracious'' and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday _ displaying the nervous excitement of an athlete
preparing for a big game _ Bush made it clear that he blames
Buchanan and Reform Party founder Ross Perot for his father's
re-election defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought in the 1992 campaign it was hard for my
dad to get traction in the race because ... first Patrick J.
Buchanan and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush
said. ``If the adage is true that you die a death of thousand cuts
in politics, Ross Perot was a part of inflicting a part of the
thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan may jump to the Reform Party, complaining that the
Republican presidential primary is not open to a debate of ideas
this year. The party establishment has been rallying around Bush,
who has raised more than $50 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perot created a three-way race in 1992 with Bill Clinton and
George Bush. Many analysts believe Perot's candidacy drew voters
away from Bush and helped Clinton win his first White House term.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he is open to inter-Republican debates and noted
that he supports the North American Free Trade Agreement while
Buchanan does not. The Reform Party opposes NAFTA and is generally
protectionist on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have his ideas out there in Iowa and New Hampshire
and South Carolina and see whether or not Republicans embrace or
don't embrace what he stands for,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the campaign first got going, he (Buchanan) took some
pretty good shots at me. I'd like to be able to test our ideas in a
Republican primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he disagreed with Buchanan's ``revisionist'' history
that Nazi Germany was not a security threat to the United States
after 1940, but Bush declined to say whether he believes Buchanan
is an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask him that question. Ask him that question,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's change in tone was insufficient for Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate who has been most
unequivocal on excluding Buchanan from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his statements (on World War II), he has left the party,''
McCain said after a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for Buchanan to remain in the party and debate his
stance on issues ``was my position for quite a long time,'' McCain
said. He said he had wanted to confront Buchanan about the
commentator's views on trade and the United States' role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when someone takes the positions that Mr. Buchanan did on
the issue of World War II, then it's no longer within the realm of
debate in the Republican Party.... I will not stoop to debate that
issue,'' said McCain, a son and grandson of Navy admirals who
himself was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years during the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was at the Reagan library to open a series of speeches by
presidential contenders. He had a private visit with former first
lady Nancy Reagan before his speech and she sat in the front row
for his remarks but did not join him on stage or appear with him in
public during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Buchanan said Wednesday that Buchanan would have
no comment on Bush and McCain's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At least one poll has shown that a Reform Party candidacy by
Buchanan would draw votes away from Bush and narrow the
general-election gap between Bush and the Democratic nominee, just
as Perot did to Bush's father. But Bush said it is too early to
know whether Buchanan's defection to the Reform Party would harm
him if he is the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether some of the people who support Pat
Buchanan who are loyal Republicans, will they stay with the
Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the Democratic nomination is ``up for grabs''
between Gore and Bill Bradley. Bush also noted that Buchanan is not
assured of the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all kinds of rumors about all kinds of different
candidates thinking about running, including The Donald,'' Bush
said, referring to New York developer Donald Trump. ``It's too
early to predict what the landscape will look like a year from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump also is considering a bid for the Reform Party
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not know whether there was any truth to rumors
that Perot wanted Buchanan to run in order to hurt Bush's chances
of becoming president. But he noted that Perot endorsed Ann
Richards just a week before he defeated her in the 1994 race for
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's been a relationship between he (Perot) and
my family,'' Bush said. ``I hope that people enter the political
process with what's best for the country in mind and not be making
decisions based on personal vendettas.''

RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO RULE OUT GROUND WAR IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian and international agencies struggled to keep
up with the tide of Chechen refugees fleeing airstrikes by Russian
warplanes, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin refused Wednesday to rule
out a possible ground war against the rebellious southern province.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that talks with the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, were still possible but only if Chechnya's elected
leaders take a stand against the Islamic militants who have used
Chechnya as a base for armed attacks against neighboring provinces,
and are suspected of waging a terrorist campaign in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government and the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees have promised to ship food and tents to the estimated
60,000 Chechen refugees who have flocked across the border into
Ingushetia since the Russian air campaign began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, refugees are still streaming across
the border, crowding into bus and rail stations, and into a single
encampment of only about 20 tents set up near the border village of
Sleptsovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on Russian television Wednesday night, refugees said
they were fleeing in fear for their lives. Sobbing, one woman told
NTV, a commercial station, that she could not understand why
innocent civilians were being made to suffer for the crimes of
terrorists they do not support.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials Wednesday continued to report hundreds of
civilian casualties caused by the bombing, but without independent
confirmation, some Russian newspapers Wednesday said these reports
were inflated. A reporter for Radio Liberty, one of the few
independent journalists based in Grozny, the Chechen capital, was
able to confirm the death of eight civilians, including four
children, killed Monday in the bombardment of a school outside
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when Chechnya defeated federal forces after a
two-year war, the mountainous region has been increasingly isolated
by a wave of kidnappings that have deterred reporters and aid
organizations from traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   The Maskhadov government, whose authority has been weakened by
the rise of independent warlords, has disavowed any connection to
the Islamic militants who last month launched armed attacks against
Dagestan, a region that lies between Chechnya and the Caspian sea.
Russian officials say that the militants, led by Chechen fighters,
are supported by international terrorist groups that want to
destabilize Russia's volatile North Caucacus region.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Russian military has moved an estimated
50,000 troops to the region to isolate Chechnya, but several
Russian newspapers reported Wednesday that the real goal is a
ground invasion that could begin within days.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov canceled a meeting Wednesday with the Dagestani
leader, Magomedali Magomedev, when the road to the meeting place
was blocked by angry Dagestanis protesting Chechen-led aggression
on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, authorized by Moscow, had been seen as a
preliminary opening for further, more high-level talks that Putin
has said repeatedly can only take place on Moscow's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about the reports of preparations for a ground
war, Putin said every tool needed to destroy terrorists in Chechnya
will be used. He said Moscow would be willing to negotiate with
Maskhadov, but only if the Chechen leaders ``finally condemn
terrorism, clearly and firmly, and express their readiness to hand
over the criminals.''

GORE CHALLENGES BRADLEY TO DEBATES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to jump-start his stalled presidential
effort, Al Gore challenged his Democratic competitor Bill Bradley
on Wednesday to a series of debates and announced he was moving his
campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grass roots and directly to the American people,'' Gore told
reporters at a hastily called news conference at his downtown
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had instructed his campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, ``to move this whole campaign, lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville,'' where Gore said he expected ``to get closer to the
American people, closer to the grass roots and out of the Beltway
and into the heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former senator and House member from Tennessee and the son
of a U.S. senator, Gore has nevertheless spent much of his life in
Washington and is considered part of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he also will begin to hold a series of town-hall
meetings in key primary states and challenged Bradley to a series
of of debates on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in strategy comes at a time when Gore is facing an
unexpectedly strong challenge from Bradley, whom the vice president
has tried for months to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has demonstrated surprising fund-raising prowess and is
drawing increasing support from prominent Democrats such as New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who said recently that he did
not believe Gore could win the White House. A half-dozen other
former Senate colleagues of Gore have endorsed Bradley, also a
former senator.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore still leads Bradley in national surveys, the former
New Jersey senator has been making gains in key primary states such
as New Hampshire, where a recent poll showed him beating Gore, and
New York, where Bradley played for the NBA Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of statewide surveys show Bradley doing better than
Gore against Republican front-runner George W. Bush, who continues
to lead the vice president nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged that the dynamics of the campaign have
changed and that he must take his primary challenger more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a brand new campaign. It is a competitive,
hard-fought battle for the Democratic nomination,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two candidates. You've got Pepsi and you've got
Coke,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied that his abrupt change in tactics were related to
fund-raising problems that may be underscored in Wednesday's
release of third-quarter campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   Previous disclosures showed Bradley doing a better job of
husbanding his resources than the Gore campaign, which has been
criticized for spending too much on consultants and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to report raising $6.5 million in the third
quarter, bringing the year's total to $24 million. He is expected
to have about $9.5 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he wanted to have ``a bunch'' of debates
with Bradley on such issues as health care, education, national
defense, the environment and crime control.
</P>
<P>
   The call for debates was perhaps the most telling sign of the
reversal of fortune for Gore, who was originally considered a
shoo-in for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for the underdog candidates to clamor for debates
while the front-runners often shun such face-offs based on the
assumption that they provide free publicity to their challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California, Bradley responded to Gore's offer:
``For the last 10 months the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me. I think that shows
we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bradley noted that he had accepted a
number of joint appearances with the vice president, including a
town-hall meeting Oct. 27 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan
said that Gore's latest moves stemmed from a ``a combination of a
certain sense of desperation and a healthy desire to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that while Gore's decision to move his office out
of Washington may be largely symbolic and superficial, the
challenge to debate his competitor was more substantive and carried
with it significant risks.
</P>
<P>
   While such forums could reinforce voters' impression that Gore
is a stiff creature of Washington, they could also prompt voters to
take another look at his candidacy. Gore is considered a skillful
debater, who bested Ross Perot in a widely watched duel in 1993
over the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debating with Bradley will allow people to pay more attention
to Gore. Bradley is getting all the ink right now,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Democratic debates might put pressure on Bush to
engage his rivals. So far, the Texas governor has refused to debate
the other Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore promised to open his new headquarters in Nashville by
next week, neither he nor his staff could provide many details
regarding how many people would actually move.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Gore only made the decision to move Monday night
and informed most of his staff Wednesday morning before speaking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore will still live in his official
residence in Washington, although he also has a home in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had informed President Clinton on Wednesday morning
of his intentions to move.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts have opined that one of Gore's problems
is his association with the scandal-plagued Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said that he assumed the
president approved of moving the headquarters, noting that Clinton
ran his 1992 presidential campaign out of Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just believes you are better off closer to the people
outside the Beltway,'' Lockhart said.

BUSH HOPES `TO WHIP' BUCHANAN IN GOP PRIMARY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush said Wednesday he wants Pat Buchanan to stay in the
Republican presidential contest because ``I'd like to whip him in
the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting words were in contrast to the conciliatory remarks
he made last week. He said Buchanan should stay in the Republican
Party so it can be united for the general election campaign.
Buchanan then called Bush's remarks ``gracious'' and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday _ displaying the nervous excitement of an athlete
preparing for a big game _ Bush made it clear that he blames
Buchanan and Reform Party founder Ross Perot for his father's
re-election defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought in the 1992 campaign it was hard for my
dad to get traction in the race because ... first Patrick J.
Buchanan and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush
said. ``If the adage is true that you die a death of thousand cuts
in politics, Ross Perot was a part of inflicting a part of the
thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan may jump to the Reform Party, complaining that the
Republican presidential primary is not open to a debate of ideas
this year. The party establishment has been rallying around Bush,
who has raised more than $50 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perot created a three-way race in 1992 with Bill Clinton and
George Bush. Many analysts believe Perot's candidacy drew voters
away from Bush and helped Clinton win his first White House term.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he is open to inter-Republican debates and noted
that he supports the North American Free Trade Agreement while
Buchanan does not. The Reform Party opposes NAFTA and is generally
protectionist on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have his ideas out there in Iowa and New Hampshire
and South Carolina and see whether or not Republicans embrace or
don't embrace what he stands for,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the campaign first got going, he (Buchanan) took some
pretty good shots at me. I'd like to be able to test our ideas in a
Republican primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he disagreed with Buchanan's ``revisionist'' history
that Nazi Germany was not a security threat to the United States
after 1940, but Bush declined to say whether he believes Buchanan
is an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask him that question. Ask him that question,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's change in tone was insufficient for Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate who has been most
unequivocal on excluding Buchanan from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his statements (on World War II), he has left the party,''
McCain said after a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for Buchanan to remain in the party and debate his
stance on issues ``was my position for quite a long time,'' McCain
said. He said he had wanted to confront Buchanan about the
commentator's views on trade and the United States' role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when someone takes the positions that Mr. Buchanan did on
the issue of World War II, then it's no longer within the realm of
debate in the Republican Party.... I will not stoop to debate that
issue,'' said McCain, a son and grandson of Navy admirals who
himself was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years during the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was at the Reagan library to open a series of speeches by
presidential contenders. He had a private visit with former first
lady Nancy Reagan before his speech and she sat in the front row
for his remarks but did not join him on stage or appear with him in
public during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Buchanan said Wednesday that Buchanan would have
no comment on Bush and McCain's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At least one poll has shown that a Reform Party candidacy by
Buchanan would draw votes away from Bush and narrow the
general-election gap between Bush and the Democratic nominee, just
as Perot did to Bush's father. But Bush said it is too early to
know whether Buchanan's defection to the Reform Party would harm
him if he is the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether some of the people who support Pat
Buchanan who are loyal Republicans, will they stay with the
Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the Democratic nomination is ``up for grabs''
between Gore and Bill Bradley. Bush also noted that Buchanan is not
assured of the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all kinds of rumors about all kinds of different
candidates thinking about running, including The Donald,'' Bush
said, referring to New York developer Donald Trump. ``It's too
early to predict what the landscape will look like a year from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump also is considering a bid for the Reform Party
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not know whether there was any truth to rumors
that Perot wanted Buchanan to run in order to hurt Bush's chances
of becoming president. But he noted that Perot endorsed Ann
Richards just a week before he defeated her in the 1994 race for
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's been a relationship between he (Perot) and
my family,'' Bush said. ``I hope that people enter the political
process with what's best for the country in mind and not be making
decisions based on personal vendettas.''

SMASH MOUTH LEAPS OVER THE `SUN' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smash Mouth is the band that almost wasn't _ at least in the
infectious, get-a-groove-on form that many of today's music lovers
are familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose, Calif.-based outfit was formed in 1994, when lead
singer Steve Harwell and drummer Kevin Coleman recruited guitarist
Greg Camp from a local cover band. Camp introduced them all to
bassist Paul De Lisle, with whom he played in the hip-hop/punk band
Lackadaddy. Smash Mouth was born.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the band had pulled a few demos together. One of
those songs, ``Nervous in the Alley,'' was put into rotation on a
local modern-rock station. It earned Smash Mouth a spot on a summer
festival with Beck and No Doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The band's breakthrough, however, was ``Walkin' on the Sun,''
one of 1997's breeziest slices of retro-hipness. Camp originally
wrote the song for Lackadaddy, but the band hated it. By chance,
Coleman discovered the song on an old tape, and the group decided
to record it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really think that it was going to do anything
because it didn't sound like the rest of the record, didn't really
fit in very well,'' said Camp, calling from a tour stop in Atlanta,
Ga. ``Once we recorded it ... we came back and listened to it. We
were all like `If people get into this, it's going to be pretty
big.'''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of the song's appeal, the group was determined to get
it on influential Los Angeles radio station KROQ. They carefully
plotted an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of ... stormed into the radio station with the CD and
said `Listen to this,''' Camp said. ``It was on a Tuesday, and we
know that's when they have their production meetings. We handed it
to, like, an intern and said, `Go throw this in front of the
program director during this meeting and see what he thinks.' Sure
enough, he put it on. We didn't have a record deal, and the next
day we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth's major-label debut album, ``Fush Yu Mang,'' went on
to sell 2 million copies, but it failed to produce another
``Sun''-size hit single, mainly because the rest of the album
wasn't as radio-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The group did earn airplay for its shagadelic rendition of
``Can't Get Enough of You Baby'' (off the ``Can't Hardly Wait''
soundtrack), but critics carped that Smash Mouth was simply
rehashing its sound. The phrase ``one-hit wonder'' popped up a few
times, and the pressure was on to come up with something new. Would
Smash Mouth go the way of Chumbawamba?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get out of that Cali-punk, ska-punk,
one-hit-wonder stuff,'' Camp said. ``We sort of went in saying',
`OK, let's take all of our individual influences,' which stem from
Van Halen to the Adolescents, Lee Scratch Perry ... lounge music.
We just wanted to take all those things and make them all blend
together and create our own sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting album, ``Astro Lounge,'' is a decidedly more solid
affair than ``Fush Yu Mang.'' The album culls lounge vibes,
surf-rock riffs, new-wave influences and trippy lyrics. It's the
album ``Walkin' in the Sun'' should have come from. Critics,
however, have still complained about the album's hodgepodge of
recycled styles. Guess you can't always make everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can listen to just about anything, and somebody is
influenced by somebody,'' said Camp, who was jamming to everything
from Fatboy Slim and Eminem to Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello
during the making of ``Astro Lounge.'' ``Most people are influenced
by the Beatles, Bob Dylan. You can totally hear that. I think our
influences are a little more eclectic than most of the stuff that's
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp also serves as the group's lead songwriter, and he looked
to a variety of places for inspiration when it came time to come up
with tracks for the new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I locked myself into a cheap motel for a few weeks. Just to
try to get a little seedy, try to get what I had and give it a
little grain,'' he said. ``There was just a lot of pressure, and we
were on a time schedule. We wanted to strike while the iron was
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth finished up ``Astro Lounge,'' but the label refused
to release the album until it decided the time was right for that
kind of music to hit the airwaves. The label also wanted the group
to deliver another killer lead single, a la ``Walkin' on the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp wasn't thrilled with the idea of recycling a hit, but he
vowed to come up with an equally infectious song that everyone
could relate to. The trick was to come up with something new, and
he got it by reading through the group's fan mail. The final
product, ``All Star,'' earned the group another hit and eliminated
the one-hit-wonder peg.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids are having a tough time growing up, and so we
just figured why don't we give 'em some sort of daily
affirmation?'' Camp said. ``It's just like the vehicle that got the
rest of the record listened to, and that's exactly what we wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids are an important part of Smash Mouth's audience and Camp's
life. He leased a separate bus two weeks ago so his wife and
9-month-old daughter could travel on the road with him. When the
conversation turns to his daughter, Camp's voice takes on a
lighthearted tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roommate decided to teach her how to spit. She thinks it's
a greeting. Every time someone goes, `Oh, what a cute baby,' she
does it,'' Camp said, as his daughter chattered and fussed in the
background. ``She dances a little bit. She likes really high
voices. She likes Bjork. I think she likes Cibo Matto. Cute little
Japanese girl music.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics will likely continue to bemoan Smash Mouth's
carefree approach to music, but it's simply the sound that now
comes naturally to the band. It's also a breath of fresh air in the
face of harder-edged, angrier acts such as Korn and Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of all just decided once this isn't fun anymore we're
going to go home. I like to try to write music that's fun and makes
everyone happy,'' Camp said. ``We don't want to write songs about
how we don't like drugs but the drugs like us. We don't want people
killing each other in high school because of us. We're all, for the
most part, happy people. I think a little happier than most
artists, anyway. We try to make that happen in our music and make
everyone else around us happy, too. Especially our babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Camp's experience, that's a thought many will take to
heart. After all, father knows best.

</P>
<P>
   To the countless millions who have passed under Mao's gaze, the
portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged, sturdy as
a piece of Communist architecture, no matter how drastically China
itself was being transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, so much about Chinese officialdom was kept
secret that even the circumstances surrounding the nation's most
prominent painting were considered off-limits to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a harmless step away from the zip-lipped past, Wang
Qizhi can openly admit that he painted Mao's portrait for 27 years.
Damage from sunlight and smog requires the Tiananmen portrait to be
replaced twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Chinese in the early years of the People's
Republic, Wang labored behind the scenes like an industrious ant,
following orders, suppressing all urge to show any individuality
and keeping his mouth shut about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was performing an important task for the good of the
country,'' said Wang, a slender, white-haired retiree of 72.
``There was no question about what I thought personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wang had pangs of pride when he rode through Tiananmen
Square on his bicycle and glanced up to see his painting at the
crown of the majestic Gate of Heavenly Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few of his acquaintances knew what he did, because anything
to do with Mao or his image was so politically sensitive that he
was ordered not to talk about his job. So Wang insists that his
personal achievement was always subsumed by a sense of the
burdensome importance of his daily task.
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary of Communist rule approaches on Oct. 1
and many marvel at the vast changes _ for better and worse _ that
China has experienced in a tumultuous half-century, people like
Wang express appreciation for something that has not changed, but
offers a least a thread of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese, Mao's portrait is an important political symbol
that reflects the strength and independence that China gained in
1949, even if it also embodies the nationalist pride that allowed
China to fall into a leftist frenzy in subsequent decades with
terrible damage to the nation's economic, social and political
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Mao may have so single-mindedly pursued his vision of an
egalitarian state _ and personal political power _ that he did not
seem to care how many millions died or were displaced in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even today, many more Chinese seem to admire Mao than to
hate him. A remarkably large number are nostalgic for what they
remember as the idealism and collective fervor of his era, despite
the poverty they endured at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has no equivocation; he is a diehard Mao fan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let us say a bad word about Mao in the house,'' said
Wang's son, Wang Yan, who is a painter himself. ``We have to go
outside if we want to curse Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   The son does indeed curse Mao outside, seeing the political
trauma of that era, which ended with Mao's death in 1976, as
unnecessarily damaging many of China's finest traditions, like
painting, the family avocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint in the traditional Chinese style, like my father and
my grandfather,'' he said. ``In Mao's era, traditional painting was
criticized and banned. How can that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many painters, writers and academics were attacked by the far
left during the 1960s, when radical politics engulfed Beijing. But
Wang Qizhi was protected by the authorities because there was
suddenly so much demand for his work, since Mao's portrait was
plastered all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Every major workplace in Beijing wanted its own original, and
they had to be painted by Wang or the one other man officially
approved to produce portraits of the Great Helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things were really busy, he would paint the bottom half
and I would paint the top,'' Wang said. ``We put a scaffolding
across the middle. The wart on Mao's chin marked the halfway
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, after Wang had already been painting Mao portraits for
15 years, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that
the portrait be changed, apparently under pressure from radical Red
Guards who objected that the partial side view of Mao showed only
one of his ears, suggesting that he was listening to only one
political faction.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it may sound funny that members of an intensely
intolerant group insisted that their leader be portrayed as
even-eared. But the portrait that was adopted that year remains the
version that has hung in Tiananmen Square for more than 30 years
and is still there today.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was deeply upset in 1989, though he was retired by
then, when three men in the Tiananmen protest movement splashed
paint on Mao's portrait, a move denounced by most student
protesters at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defacing the portrait is a crime,'' Wang said gravely. ``They
should have received the harshest punishment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the record, the three men _ a bus company employee, a
journalist and a schoolteacher, all from Mao's home province of
Hunan _ were sentenced to prison terms of 16 years, 20 years and
life, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be overlooked, Wang pointed out that the task of
painting a 20-foot-high portrait is not easy. The painter must
constantly be stepping back far enough to take a look, and with
such a huge portrait, Wang had to step back 100 feet. So he was
constantly climbing and descending a scaffolding, for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as China itself takes a step back to look at itself
after 50 years, it may be hard to get a clear perspective or focus
on a nation in the middle of wrenching change from a Communist
system to a new, ill-defined one. As confusing as the outlook may
be, Wang points out that material life is far more comfortable,
just as painting the Mao portrait is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's easy,'' Wang said. ``They have this big automatic
contraption that moves up and down. Not in my day. We had it much
harder.''

BUSH HOPES `TO WHIP' BUCHANAN IN GOP PRIMARY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush said Wednesday he wants Pat Buchanan to stay in the
Republican presidential contest because ``I'd like to whip him in
the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting words were in contrast to the conciliatory remarks
he made last week. He said Buchanan should stay in the Republican
Party so it can be united for the general election campaign.
Buchanan then called Bush's remarks ``gracious'' and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday _ displaying the nervous excitement of an athlete
preparing for a big game _ Bush made it clear that he blames
Buchanan and Reform Party founder Ross Perot for his father's
re-election defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought in the 1992 campaign it was hard for my
dad to get traction in the race because ... first Patrick J.
Buchanan and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush
said. ``If the adage is true that you die a death of thousand cuts
in politics, Ross Perot was a part of inflicting a part of the
thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan may jump to the Reform Party, complaining that the
Republican presidential primary is not open to a debate of ideas
this year. The party establishment has been rallying around Bush,
who has raised more than $50 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perot created a three-way race in 1992 with Bill Clinton and
George Bush. Many analysts believe Perot's candidacy drew voters
away from Bush and helped Clinton win his first White House term.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he is open to inter-Republican debates and noted
that he supports the North American Free Trade Agreement while
Buchanan does not. The Reform Party opposes NAFTA and is generally
protectionist on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have his ideas out there in Iowa and New Hampshire
and South Carolina and see whether or not Republicans embrace or
don't embrace what he stands for,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the campaign first got going, he (Buchanan) took some
pretty good shots at me. I'd like to be able to test our ideas in a
Republican primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he disagreed with Buchanan's ``revisionist'' history
that Nazi Germany was not a security threat to the United States
after 1940, but Bush declined to say whether he believes Buchanan
is an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask him that question. Ask him that question,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's change in tone was insufficient for Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate who has been most
unequivocal on excluding Buchanan from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his statements (on World War II), he has left the party,''
McCain said after a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for Buchanan to remain in the party and debate his
stance on issues ``was my position for quite a long time,'' McCain
said. He said he had wanted to confront Buchanan about the
commentator's views on trade and the United States' role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when someone takes the positions that Mr. Buchanan did on
the issue of World War II, then it's no longer within the realm of
debate in the Republican Party.... I will not stoop to debate that
issue,'' said McCain, a son and grandson of Navy admirals who
himself was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years during the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was at the Reagan library to open a series of speeches by
presidential contenders. He had a private visit with former first
lady Nancy Reagan before his speech and she sat in the front row
for his remarks but did not join him on stage or appear with him in
public during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Buchanan said Wednesday that Buchanan would have
no comment on Bush and McCain's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At least one poll has shown that a Reform Party candidacy by
Buchanan would draw votes away from Bush and narrow the
general-election gap between Bush and the Democratic nominee, just
as Perot did to Bush's father. But Bush said it is too early to
know whether Buchanan's defection to the Reform Party would harm
him if he is the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether some of the people who support Pat
Buchanan who are loyal Republicans, will they stay with the
Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the Democratic nomination is ``up for grabs''
between Gore and Bill Bradley. Bush also noted that Buchanan is not
assured of the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all kinds of rumors about all kinds of different
candidates thinking about running, including The Donald,'' Bush
said, referring to New York developer Donald Trump. ``It's too
early to predict what the landscape will look like a year from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump also is considering a bid for the Reform Party
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not know whether there was any truth to rumors
that Perot wanted Buchanan to run in order to hurt Bush's chances
of becoming president. But he noted that Perot endorsed Ann
Richards just a week before he defeated her in the 1994 race for
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's been a relationship between he (Perot) and
my family,'' Bush said. ``I hope that people enter the political
process with what's best for the country in mind and not be making
decisions based on personal vendettas.''

GORE CHALLENGES BRADLEY TO DEBATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to jump-start his stalled presidential
effort, Al Gore challenged his Democratic competitor Bill Bradley
on Wednesday to a series of debates and announced he was moving his
campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grass roots and directly to the American people,'' Gore told
reporters at a hastily called news conference at his downtown
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had instructed his campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, ``to move this whole campaign, lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville,'' where Gore said he expected ``to get closer to the
American people, closer to the grass roots and out of the Beltway
and into the heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former senator and House member from Tennessee and the son
of a U.S. senator, Gore has nevertheless spent much of his life in
Washington and is considered part of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he also will begin to hold a series of town-hall
meetings in key primary states and challenged Bradley to a series
of of debates on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in strategy comes at a time when Gore is facing an
unexpectedly strong challenge from Bradley, whom the vice president
has tried for months to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has demonstrated surprising fund-raising prowess and is
drawing increasing support from prominent Democrats such as New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who said recently that he did
not believe Gore could win the White House. A half-dozen other
former Senate colleagues of Gore have endorsed Bradley, also a
former senator.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore still leads Bradley in national surveys, the former
New Jersey senator has been making gains in key primary states such
as New Hampshire, where a recent poll showed him beating Gore, and
New York, where Bradley played for the NBA Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of statewide surveys show Bradley doing better than
Gore against Republican front-runner George W. Bush, who continues
to lead the vice president nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged that the dynamics of the campaign have
changed and that he must take his primary challenger more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a brand new campaign. It is a competitive,
hard-fought battle for the Democratic nomination,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two candidates. You've got Pepsi and you've got
Coke,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied that his abrupt change in tactics were related to
fund-raising problems that may be underscored in Wednesday's
release of third-quarter campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   Previous disclosures showed Bradley doing a better job of
husbanding his resources than the Gore campaign, which has been
criticized for spending too much on consultants and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to report raising $6.5 million in the third
quarter, bringing the year's total to $24 million. He is expected
to have about $9.5 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he wanted to have ``a bunch'' of debates
with Bradley on such issues as health care, education, national
defense, the environment and crime control.
</P>
<P>
   The call for debates was perhaps the most telling sign of the
reversal of fortune for Gore, who was originally considered a
shoo-in for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for the underdog candidates to clamor for debates
while the front-runners often shun such face-offs based on the
assumption that they provide free publicity to their challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California, Bradley responded to Gore's offer:
``For the last 10 months the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me. I think that shows
we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bradley noted that he had accepted a
number of joint appearances with the vice president, including a
town-hall meeting Oct. 27 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan
said that Gore's latest moves stemmed from a ``a combination of a
certain sense of desperation and a healthy desire to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that while Gore's decision to move his office out
of Washington may be largely symbolic and superficial, the
challenge to debate his competitor was more substantive and carried
with it significant risks.
</P>
<P>
   While such forums could reinforce voters' impression that Gore
is a stiff creature of Washington, they could also prompt voters to
take another look at his candidacy. Gore is considered a skillful
debater, who bested Ross Perot in a widely watched duel in 1993
over the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debating with Bradley will allow people to pay more attention
to Gore. Bradley is getting all the ink right now,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Democratic debates might put pressure on Bush to
engage his rivals. So far, the Texas governor has refused to debate
the other Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore promised to open his new headquarters in Nashville by
next week, neither he nor his staff could provide many details
regarding how many people would actually move.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Gore only made the decision to move Monday night
and informed most of his staff Wednesday morning before speaking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore will still live in his official
residence in Washington, although he also has a home in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had informed President Clinton on Wednesday morning
of his intentions to move.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts have opined that one of Gore's problems
is his association with the scandal-plagued Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said that he assumed the
president approved of moving the headquarters, noting that Clinton
ran his 1992 presidential campaign out of Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just believes you are better off closer to the people
outside the Beltway,'' Lockhart said.

LASTER CITED IN RELIEVING CERTAIN HEART PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two weeks ago, Arthur Toelken spelled relief:
L-A-S-E-R. With two bypass surgeries and an angioplasty already
behind him, the 65-year-old still was suffering from crippling
chest pain several times every day. ``I couldn't even get the mail
without having an angina,'' Toelken said.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dr. Lawrence Cohn,
used a laser to zap about 30 toothpick-size holes in his heart wall
to reduce his chest pain. The surgery took an hour and left Toelken
with a four-inch incision in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Toelken, of Westfield, Mass., said he felt relief in his chest
immediately and has yet to take one of his nitro pills since his
operation. ``I feel better every day,'' and hopes soon that he can
drive, fish and hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Toelken is one of several thousand patients who have tried this
laser procedure, known as transmyocardial revascularization or TMR,
which is reported in two studies in this week's New England Journal
of Medicine. The competing lasers used in the studies were
manufactuered by PLC Medical Systems in Franklin, Mass., and by
Eclipse Surgical Technologies in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long studies, performed at 30 US hospitals, offered
hope for the estimated 80,000 Americans whose heart disease is too
far along for bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty. Angina happens
when the oxygen-starved heart muscle receives less blood than it
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies, one headed by Dr. Howard Frazier of the the
Texas Heart Institute in Houston and the other by Dr. Keith Allen
of St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, both found that about 75
percent of of the several hundred patients involved reported
dramatic relief in chest pain after the laser surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, twice as many TMR recipients remained out of the
hospital for heart-related problems as those who received
conventional treatment. But between 3 and 5 percent of the patients
who underwent the operation died soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The theory for the procedure's success is that it improved blood
flow. But only the Frazier study actually found improved blood flow
in its patients. The Allen study did not, nor did a study on a
third company's laser that was published in the Sept. 11 issue of
the Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   So why are patients seeing relief?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a full appreciation of how it works yet,'' Allen
said. A couple possibilities include: the laser creates
microinjuries in the heart, stimulating angiogenesis, which is
growth of new blood vessels; or, the laser blasts destroy the pain
fibers, so patients simply don't feel the pain, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, chief of cardiac surgery at the Brigham, said that under
the microscope, they have seen evidence of angiogenesis in pig
models with the laser technique.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers are puzzled that the Frazier study showed
that the patients who had improved blood flow weren't always the
patients who felt better after the operation, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Richard Lange
and David Hillis of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas warned the pain reduction could be imaginary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These patients have exhausted all other options, so they are
in a mindset for anything. And lasers are really `Star Wars' -like
and magical,'' Hillis said. But Cohn noted the benefits of the
laser for some patients lasted more than three years. By then, an
imaginary effect would have worn off, Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis and others also criticized the studies' procedure: there
was a large crossover of patients, allowing those who did not see
effectiveness from standard drug treatment to have the surgery
done, suggesting a bias that the TMR treatment was better.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Weintraub, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and member of the FDA panel that approved
the laser technique, said that although the editorial pointed to
valid problems with the studies, he also felt that ``they are
pretty good studies, and I'm not sure if better ones will be
done,'' Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question this is a new therapy, and it makes us
all uneasy because we don't understand how it works,'' said Dr.
Timothy J. Gardner, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the
University of Pennsylvania and a spokesman for the American Heart
Association. ``But it does give us an option that we currently
don't have.''

BELL ATLANTIC SEEKS LONG-DISTANCE ACCESS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a step it vowed to repeat next year in Massachusetts, Bell
Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local telephone company, asked
regulators Wednesday to support its plan to offer long-distance
service to local customers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the proposal could dramatically alter a major
portion of the nation's phone system and spark similar changes in
other regions. Bell Atlantic, which serves 13 states in the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, would become the first of the Baby Bell
regional phone companies to enter the nation's lucrative
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which submitted its proposal
to the Federal Communications Commission, said it planned to file a
similar application by July 2000 requesting approval to offer
long-distance service to Massachusetts customers. The company sees
the Bay State's 4.8 million customers and $2 billion long-distance
market as the biggest prize after New York's $8 billion market
covering 8 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York filing is a kind of shot in the arm to the
Massachusetts process,'' said Robert Mudge, vice president of Bell
Atlantic's Massachusetts operations. He said that an application
was more likely in the second quarter and that similar requests
would be filed for New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after antitrust officials split up the AT&AMP;T
monopoly into seven Baby Bells, leaving the giant a
long-distance-only operator, change is coming to the
telecommunications landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A crush of competitors is seeking a chunk of the nation's $100
billion local phone market and $80 billion long-distance market,
now dominated by AT&AMP;T. Mergers _ like Bell Atlantic's combination
with GTE Corp. _ are spawning new companies overnight. And newer
companies are seeking to muscle in on the regionals' turf.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 1984 AT&AMP;T breakup, Baby Bells like Bell
Atlantic are not allowed to offer long-distance service _ a market
they would dearly love to crack. The companies are betting that
customers would like to see all their phone bills _ local and
long-distance _ on one statement and promise that fresh competition
will drive down rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal is steeped in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, regulators have rejected nearly half-a-dozen
applications like Bell Atlantic's, saying the companies have not
done enough to give rivals access to their local markets. Major
long-distance companies, like MCIWorldcom and Sprint, want to
compete with the Baby Bells in offering local service.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 federal act, companies like Bell Atlantic must
persuade regulators that they have done enough to promote
competition within their own local networks before seeking
permission to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators require the regional Bells to test their systems to
prove they are physically open to use by rivals. For more than two
years, Bell Atlantic has been doing just that in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've met the requirements of the Telecommunications Act,''
Bell Atlantic chief executive Ivan Seidenberg said Wednesday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said the company expects to complete testing in
Massachusetts in the first quarter of next year. The review is
being carried out by KPGM, the auditing and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates worry that if the progeny of old Ma Bell are
let into the long distance market, they will have less incentive to
provide competitive, lower-cost service to their local-service
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all going to be a huge tug-of-war,'' said Douglas A.
Christopher, a telecommunications analyst at Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co.

RUSSIA TELLS CHECHENS TO HAND OVER GUERRILLA LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Vladimir Putin demanded Wednesday that
Chechen leaders denounce terrorism and turn over guerrilla leaders
whom Russia holds responsible for a series of apartment bombings,
saying only then will Russia cease its punishing bombing of the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the Chechen leadership to finally condemn terrorism
clearly and firmly and to express their readiness to hand over
criminals,'' Putin said in televised comments.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a ground war increased Wednesday as Russian warplanes
bombed what Moscow says are strategic targets throughout Chechnya
for the seventh straight day. Unconfirmed reports circulated all
day asserting that Russian forces had entered northern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Segodnya reported that plans were already drawn up
for Russian forces to occupy northern Chechnya and partition the
republic. And the Interfax news service, citing unidentified high
ranking military officers, reported that Russian forces had
actually seized parts of northern Chechnya, including the districts
of Zandak and Galaity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian State Television showed footage of troops and tanks
concentrating on the border with Chechnya. ``It appears that a
ground operation could begin any time,'' the commentator said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters whether Russian forces had moved into
Chechnya, Putin, who earlier in the day said he was not ruling out
a ground invasion as an option, was coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I will call the defense minister
and ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed whether forces had crossed Chechnya's border, Putin
became testy. ``We don't have a border with Chechnya,'' he said.
``Chechnya is part of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses in Chechnya's capital Grozny, meanwhile, said most
of those killed in the air strikes have been civilians. News
agencies here reported that over 400 people have been killed since
the bombing campaign began last week, including 11 Wednesday. The
bombing has also driven tens of thousands of Chechens from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say Chechen guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev
was behind a series of bombings in apartment buildings in Moscow
and other Russian cities earlier this month that killed nearly 300
people.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev, who since August has led a series of raids from
Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan, a mostly Muslim republic in
southern Russia, has repeatedly denied responsibility for the
bombings. He has, however, said he plans to pry Russia's volatile
North Caucasus region, including Dagestan, free from Moscow's
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has denied that his
government was involved in any way with the terrorist bombings that
have sparked fear and anger in Russia. Maskhadov also said that his
government did not endorse Basayev's raids into Dagestan and has
called for peace talks with Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   By demanding that Maskhadov turn Basayev and other militants
over to Moscow _ a virtual impossible condition for peace talks _
Putin has made it clear that Moscow is going to try to bring the
rebel province to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about Basayev. It is about proving to Chechnya that
they have lost the war,'' said Alexei Malashenko, a specialist on
the Caucasus region at the Moscow Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was elected Chechnya's president in 1996 after Moscow
withdrew its troops following a bloody 20-month war that killed as
many as 80,000 people _ mostly innocent civilians and inexperienced
Russian conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, however, still claims Chechnya as part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov _ who has always sought good relations with Russia _
has little influence in Chechnya, which has fallen under the
control of guerrilla leaders like Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on the BBC Russian Service on Tuesday,
Basayev accused Moscow of conducting ``ethnic cleansing'' against
Chechens. He also said that Russia's bombing campaign has
consolidated Chechen society against Moscow, adding that he and
Mashkadov _ long competitors for power in Chechnya _ are now
allies, united by the common Russian enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were differences. But in the current situation we are
united and our unity is strengthened by Russia _ and for this we
are grateful,'' said Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was scheduled Wednesday to meet with Dagestan's leader
Magomedali Magomedov in the town of Khasavyurt, where Moscow signed
a truce with Chechen separatists three years ago. But when
Maskhadov arrived, angry villagers blocked the road into the town
and prevented the meeting from taking place.

GORE SEEKS DEBATES WITH BILL BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a surprisingly strong challenge for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore
Wednesday called for a series of debates against Bill Bradley and
announced he would hold ``open meetings'' with voters in key
primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he was moving his campaign headquarters ``lock,
stock and barrel'' from insider Washington to Nashville _ a move
expected to save the campaign money while giving it a folksier
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard, tough fight. I'm going to fight my heart out
for every single vote,'' said Gore, for the first time publicly
acknowledging the seriousness of Bradley's threat. ``It's a brand
new campaign now,'' Gore said at a press conference. ``There are
only two candidates. You've got Pepsi and Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, campaigning in California, indicated he was open to
debates against Gore, saying he had accepted ``a number of joint
appearances already'' and would ``look forward to more.''
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator also said he was not inclined to
``respond to every change in tactic by the vice president's
campaign,'' and added that he is also traveling around the country
to hear voters' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign shake-up was a stark admission that he can no
longer cruise along as the presumed nominee simply because he is
the sitting vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost unheard of for a front-runner to challenge an
opponent to debates, because the leading candidate usually has
little to gain from them. Gore's decision to move his national
campaign headquarters south also shows how sensitive he is to being
labeled a Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking the campaign to my roots,'' said Gore, who was born
in Tennessee, but raised in Washington as the son of a US senator.
Gore also has spent most of his adult life in Washington, first as
a US representative, then as a senator and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which stunned his campaign office here, is also
expected to save cash. Not only will costs be lower in Tennessee,
but only those workers most dedicated to Gore will endure the
personal upheaval of moving. The current campaign is larded with
high-paid consultants and contains too many people who are not
totally committed to the Gore campaign, critics of the campaign
say.
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to make the trip will be more focused on the
recently tightened Democratic race and less susceptible to
following Washington punditry at the expense of listening to real
voters, staffers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they probably want a leaner campaign,'' said someone
close to Gore. ``I bet he just woke up and said, `How did it get so
out of hand?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Kiki Moore said she did not know how many
people would be staying, as staff members need to discuss the move
with their families. One who is making the trip is campaign
director Tony Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be packing my bags, learning country music, and moving
to Nashville,'' Coelho, a former US representative from California,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The new direction of the campaign is reminiscent of the 1992
Clinton-Gore campaign, when the candidates took bus trips and held
town meetings with voters, running their campaign from Little Rock,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement underscores Bradley's climb in the
polls. Bradley, who trailed 23 percent to Gore's 68 percent in New
Hampshire in May, now leads there 44 percent to 42 percent, said
Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey
Center. The two candidates are also running neck-and-neck in recent
polls in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has earned the endorsement of Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who said Gore was unelectable
against Republican front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A Brown University poll released Wednesday showed Gore and
Bradley in a dead heat in Rhode Island, with Gore leading 37
percent to Bradley's 36 percent. But in a hypothetical matchup
against Bush, Bradlbetter with 37 percent against Bush's 26
percent. Gore led Bush 34 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to spend at least six days in New Hampshire in
October, while his wife, Tipper, will spend three days there, said
the state campaign's spokesman, Doug Hattaway. ``It's a recognition
that it's a tough campaign,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The first time both candidates will appear together in New
Hampshire is Oct. 27, at a forum sponsored by Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Debates could tarnish both candidates, if either attacks the
other. But they could also assist Gore, who would have the
opportunity to establish himself as an individual candidate,
instead of as the man in the wings during the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs to be able to say, `I am not Bill Clinton; I just
worked for him,' '' said Smith of the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore benefits from the booming economy but could suffer from the
Clinton scandals. The so-called Clinton fatigue, or perception that
voters want change, also could hurt the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke around the Bush campaign is that after Clinton leaves
office, the whole country is going to want to take a collective
shower. And Al Gore is the one who is going to be washed down the
drain,'' said Mark Corallo, a House Republican staffer.
</P>
<P>
   The polling numbers in New Hampshire buttress that theory, Smith
said, noting that Gore is strongest among those who give Clinton
high favorability ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is being seen as the administration's representative
here,'' Smith said. The primary for Gore ``is really a referendum
on the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of his recent success, Bradley has an uphill fight if he
is to persuade the Democratic Party to cast aside loyalty to its
own vice president and nominate him instead.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have tended to give the
nomination to sitting vice presidents who seek it. In only two
cases during the 20th century _ with Democrats John Nance Garner in
1940 and Alben William Barkley in 1952 _ have vice presidents been
denied the nomination, and in both cases, neither candidate was
taken seriously, said presidential scholar William Leuchtenberg of
the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents have been less successful at actually being
elected president, with most getting the job after a president's
death or resignation. Former President George Bush is the only
person this century to have ever done what Gore is trying to do:
win the presidency as the sitting vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling of `enough, already' '' that could hurt
Gore, Leuchtenberg said.

CLINTON WIDENS PLAN FOR POOR DEBTOR NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday announced a major
expansion of American efforts to forgive the debt of the world's
poorest nations, saying those countries would not have to pay back
any of the billions of dollars they borrowed from American aid
agencies if they could show the savings were being plowed into
poverty reduction and education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Wednesday of 100 percent debt forgiveness
for the world's most indebted nations _ mostly in sub-Saharan
Africa _ expands a previous commitment by the United States in June
to write off up to 90 percent of the money they owe. But the
process may take years, and it is contingent on congressional
approval of a $1 billion debt-forgiveness program that Clinton sent
to Capitol Hill last week as an amendment to his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, administration officials say, is that many of the
countries that will benefit from the program never had much hope
repaying more than a fraction of the $5.7 billion they currently
owe the U.S. Treasury. In fact, much of that debt has already been
lessened on the government's ledger books, reflecting estimates
that the United States was likely to recover only pennies on the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by the magic of Washington's budget rules, the $5.7
billion in debt can be wiped out with a congressional expenditure
of only $1 billion. Still, it is far from clear that Congress will
go along with the move, especially as elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here, just as the
two financial institutions were putting the finishing touches on a
$50 billion debt-reduction program that involves their own massive
lending to poor nations. Clinton's announcement, during a brief
appearance in a hotel ballroom where thousands of delegates of
countries around the world were gathered, seemed to take many here
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States,'' Clinton said, ``when _ and this is quite important _ when
needed to help them finance basic human needs and when the money
will be used to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said that Clinton's move had ``symbolic importance that
goes beyond its economic significance,'' especially in countries
that are choosing between paying off their international loans or
building more schools or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's program would initially aid countries like Uganda and
Mozambique, which have gone the furthest in meeting requirements
set out in 1996 for debt relief. But ultimately it could help
another 34 nations, from Tanzania to Zamabia and Ivory Coast to
Nicaragua and Honduras to rogue nations like Myanmar if they are
willing to meet the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not extend his spirit of forgiveness, however, to
one country that is deeply indebted, and deeply in trouble, with
the IMF: Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the head of the fund, Michel Camdessus, said that
``it would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on
this great nation; we will not do that.'' He urged that all the
allegations of misappropriation of funds should be weighed against
seven years of ``real progress,'' and praised Russia for continuing
to develop a ``modern market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus' comments, and the absence of balancing words of
warning to Russia, infuriated some White House officials who felt
it undermined their effort to send a stern message to Moscow.
Clinton, talked Wednesday only about Russia as an example that the
fund must heed as it reviews ``its procedures and controls to
strengthen the safeguards'' on use of its money.

HIGH COURT NOMINEE PRAISED BY BACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Momentarily side-stepping concerns about
anti-Catholicism raised by Cardinal Bernard Law, the Governor's
Council Wednesday heard from a parade of top political and judicial
leaders who praised Supreme Judicial Court Justice Margart Marshall
as a heroic and unbiased nominee for the court's chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who nominated Marshall, House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, and
retired Chief Justice Herbert P. Wilkins all testified in favor of
Marshall's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Governor's Council said they were waiting
until a second hearing Thursday to hear from opponents and address
the controversial issues surrounding Marshall's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Those include Law's recent charges that Marshall may have
exhibted an anti-Catholic bias, and questions raised by Councilor
Edward M. O'Brien (D-Easthampton) and others who believe Marshall's
three years as a judge on the state's highest court may not have
provided her with sufficient experience to serve as chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously have concens,'' O'Brien said. ``The experience
factor has some bearing on the apptitude of a person going into a
leadership position.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the Governor's Council confirmed by an 8-0
the nomination of Francis X. Spina to the Supreme Judicial Court,
even though his nomination was snagged by news that he had paid a
prison inmate serving time for murder to do legal work in a
Mafia-related drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of witness who either testified on Marshall's
behalf or wrote letters in support of her nomination, only one,
Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith, addressed the charges
leveled by Law.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith, who presided over the recent wrongful death case
involving the late Boston Celtics star, Reggis Lewis, identified
himself as a Catholic and one-time president of an organization
that opposes abortion rights, and said he was ``embarrassed'' by
Law's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fremont-Smith said, Marshall personally encouraged him
to join the Superior Court bench and ``espoused my candidacy to
various persons and was the master of ceremonies at my
swearing-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a native of South Africa who opposed Apartheid as a
student leader there, told reporters she would address the specific
concerns raised by Law at Thursday's hearing but also said her
career as an activist, lawyer, and judge has been directed at
eliminating bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout my entire life I have tried to learn to be fair and
open-minded to everyone,'' said Marshall, who would become the
state's first woman chief justice if her nomination is approved.
``The claim that I hold bias against anyone is a blow to my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's hearing, a top aide to Cellucci said he
believes Marshall's testimony, along with statements from several
prominent judges, convinced a majority of the eight-member
Governor's Council to confirm her at a vote scheduled for next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll get more than enough votes,'' the aide said. ``The
testimony indicated she has the leadership ability for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Governor's Councilor Michael J. Callahan
(D-Medford) said the status of Marshall's nomination is ``fluid''
and declined to say whether she would be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Callahan and O'Brien, Councilor David Francis
Constantine (D-New Bedford) has expressed reservations about
Marshall's candidacy for the state's top judicial post. In the
event of a tie on the eight-member Council, Lt. Governor Jane Swift
would cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   As the Council heard Wednesday's testimony from Marshall and her
supporters, Law's office again declined to clarify whether the
Cardinal continues to object to her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and his aides have said Marshall and Law spoke over the
telephone on Saturday and that Law's concerns have been allayed.
But neither Law nor his office would confirm the administration's
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Law's allegation of anti-Catholic bias arose in a Sept. 22
letter in which Law objected to the nominations of Marshall and
Superior Court Judge Judith Cowin, who has been named by Cellucci
to an associate justice's position on the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Law referred to separate actions taken by Cowin
and Marshall. In Marshall's case, he cited Marshall's tenure as
chief counsel for Harvard University and an instance in which she
asked Mary Ann Glendon, a prominent Harvard Law School professor
who opposes abortion rights, to refrain from using university
stationary for personal or political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon, in a 1992 letter written under law school letterhead,
had outlined her opposition to a federal abortion rights bill and
urged Catholic priests to work against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after being admonished by Marshall, Glendon accused her of
enforcing a double-standard, contending that Harvard had allowed
others to use university resources to oppose the US Supreme Court
nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard officials Wednesday released a copy of university
policy on the use of university stationary that appears to supppot
Marshall's action.
</P>
<P>
   The policy states: ``The letterhead should not be used for
matters unrelated to the performance of academic duties and
functions. And care should be taken that any reference to the Law
School affiliation, on matters other than official Law School
business, be made only for purposes of identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a Yale Law School graduate and the wife of New York
Times columnist Anthony Lewis, in her testimony never touched on
the issues raised by Law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she spoke about her experiences as a South African
student leader fighting that country's policy of racial separation,
her journey to America in the late 1960s, shortly before the
assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and her
passion for the American judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an immigrant. I am a citizen,'' she declared. ``And I
carry within me a particular appreciation for the hard work of the
generations who have gone before me to build this remarkable
democracy.''

The Arizona Republic shortly will move a package of stories on the
life and career of Arizona senator and presidential contender John
McCain. In addition to the seven stories, slugged MCCAIN-1 through
MCCAIN-7, are MCCAINCHRONO - a timeline of the high points of
McCain's life; MCCAINBIO - a biobox; and MCCAIN-CREDITBOX - a
bibliography of printed sources used. The stories were written by
Republic reporter BILL MULLER. The package is embargoed for Sunday,
Oct. 3. All will move in the ``A'' category. 
 
The stories will move as: 
 
MCCAIN-1 - INTRODUCTION - (Undated) - There is a grim determination
to Sen. John McCain as he rises to address the Republican faithful
in his bid to be president. McCain moves stiffly through the heavy
air of the gymnasium, his war injuries still in evidence. There is
his sore right knee, broken years ago when he ejected from a bomber
over North Vietnam. There is his aching right shoulder, shattered
by his captors. There is his hair, turned prematurely white by
mistreatment and malnutrition. Then there are his political wounds.
 
 
MCCAIN-2 - JOHN WAYNE MCCAIN (Undated) - John McCain had plenty to
live up to at the Naval Academy. There was his grandfather, Admiral
John ``Slew'' McCain, Class of '06, a grizzled old sea dog who
commanded aircraft carriers in the Pacific during World War II.  
MCCAIN-3 - CROWN PRINCE IN HELL (Undated) - Lt. Commander John
McCain was not thinking about a cell in the Hanoi Hilton when he
took off in his A-4E Skyhawk from the USS Oriskany on the morning
of Oct. 26, 1967. As a pilot, McCain had led a charmed life,
surviving a bad accident on the USS Forrestal, about a month
before. On Oct. 26, McCain would fly his 23rd sortie over Vietnam,
joining a 20-plane mission to bomb a power plant in Hanoi, a city
that had previously been off limits to U.S. attacks. An officer
warned McCain to be careful, that some of the pilots might not
return. ``Don't worry about me,'' McCain said. 
 
MCCAIN-4 - ARIZONA, THE EARLY YEARS (Undated) - In 1979, John
McCain came face to face with his future. He was in Hawaii,
attending a military reception. While there, he met a young, blond
ex-cheerleader named Cindy Hensley. It was an incredible stroke of
luck for McCain. How fortunate could one man be? Here was McCain,
who had his eye on Congress, meeting a young, attractive beer
heiress, who just happened to hail from a state that was adding a
congressional district in 1982. McCain recalls that both he and
Cindy fudged their ages at first. McCain made himself a little
younger, and Cindy made herself a little older. They found out
their real ages when the local paper published them. McCain was 43,
Cindy 25. 
 
MCCAIN-5 - CHARLIE KEATING (Undated) - - It all started in March
1987. Charles H Keating Jr., the flamboyant developer and anti-porn
crusader, needed help. The government was poised to seize Lincoln
Savings and Loan, a freewheeling subsidiary of Keating's American
Continental Corp. As federal auditors crawled all over Lincoln,
Keating was not content to wait and hope for the best. He'd spread
a lot of money around Washington, and it was time to call in his
chits. 
 
MCCAIN-6 - ARIZONA, THE LATER YEARS (Undated) - For many
politicians, the Keating scandal would have been too much to
overcome. But McCain refused to go down easily. He deployed a dual
strategy. He would make himself accessible to any reporter anywhere
who wanted to talk about the Keating Five, and he wouldn't let the
controversy detract from his work as a senator. McCain grimly
marched about the country, struggling to clear his name. McCain's
hobnobbing with the press had an unexpected side effect. Reporters
started to like McCain, if for self-serving reasons. 
 
MCCAIN-7 - THE CAREER - (Undated) - Today, as chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, McCain is shepherding the deregulation
of the telephone industry, as well as dealing with burgeoning
issues involving cable television. But McCain has really made a
name for himself by fighting wasteful government spending, which
often takes the form of pet federal projects - called ``pork
barrel'' - in congressmen's districts. To root out the pork, McCain
has stationed a staffer at appropriations committee meetings. He
also pushed the line-item veto.

MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) Doctors at the Arizona State Hospital
know how to treat the criminally insane. Advancements in psychiatry
and pharmaceuticals now make it possible to better care for the
mentally ill, often restoring them to a functionally rational
condition through the use of newly developed wonder drugs.
Unfortunately, problem facing local shrinks is: How do you medicate
an entire state? By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OZONE (Phoenix) - The Valley (Phoenix area is on the verge of
completing three straight summers without an ozone violation, an
accomplishment that could lead to the area losing its `serious`
rating for air pollution. As the ozone season ends Thursday, Gov.
Jane Hull is expected to ask the EPA to quickly reclassify the
Valley as meeting federal clean-air standards. Why were the ozone
levels were held at bay? And this is not the end of air-pollution
woes: It can take years to get reclassified, meaning all the
clean-air requirements will stay in place (such as cleaner fuels,
the auto emissions test, etc). And other pollutants, especially
particulates, remain vexing. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONET-EATS (Phoenix) - Mmmmonet. The great painter was not only a
master of the palette, but the palate as well. He lorded over his
Giverny, France, estate, a place of Eden-like gardens that yielded
wonderful meals and exquisite paintings, and he left detailed
cooking journals to preserve his preferred recipes for posterity. A
traveling exhibit of the paitings Monet produced at Giverny is at
the Phoenix Art Museum now. With recipes. BY JAIMEE ROSE. Story
moved in the ``D'' and ``E'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILSON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Given the number of privileged sons whose
political dads have given them a leg up, it's predictable that some
malcontents would grumble about Texas Gov. George W. Bush owning
much of his success to special treatment as the son of a president.
From keeping out of active military duty to getting rich in the oil
business to becoming lead owner of the Texas Rangers, George W. has
used his father's political influence to cut in line, they squawk.
The gall of these people. By STEVE WILSON. Column will move in the
``K'' category. &QL;

headquarters from Washington to his home state of Tennessee and
paring back a top-heavy campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Nashville is part of a broad strategy that his aides
hope will symbolize a break from the Beltway _ and the Clinton
administration. And it comes in response to the steady rise in the
polls, and in the public imagination, of former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, the sole Democrat who dared challenge Gore and his
vast institutional apparatus for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore backers have been dispirited by national polls
that show Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner,
sustaining a strong lead that Gore has been unable to dent.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Gore campaign has only vaguely focused on Bush
and acted as if Bradley did not exist. But the former basketball
star has demonstrated his ability to raise serious money. And now
that Bradley has drawn even with Gore in opinion polls in key
states like New York and New Hampshire, the Gore camp can no longer
ignore the Bradley threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the challenge for the nomination has changed,''
Gore acknowledged Wednesday, noting that the Bradley camp had
established ``a baseline of competence and credibility.'' He added:
``We're in a completely new campaign. So we're going to adapt to it
and adjust to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals is to cut expenses by limiting the number and
salaries of senior staffers. The need to conserve money is a
consequence of Gore's lackluster fund raising: He collected an
unimpressive $6.5 million in the last three months and has spent
almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's cash has been drained in part by efforts to raise money
and build state organizations. But that focus has resulted in
negative news accounts of a bulging campaign top-heavy with
Washington consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The move will mean lower rents in Nashville and will provide a
face-saving way for some of Gore's high-priced talent to leave the
campaign without being fired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is reporting that it has just $10 million in cash
on hand. Bradley's campaign refused to divulge how much it raised
in the last quarter and how much it has on hand, but the
expectation is that in financial reports to be made public on
Thursday, he will show he is competitive with Gore. Three months
ago, the Gore campaign said it had $9.4 million on hand; Bradley
had $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville is also part of a broader effort to
revitalize the campaign. Other elements include an accelerated
schedule of debates with Bradley to showcase the vice president's
verbal skills, an emphasis on meetings with smaller and less formal
groups and a rejiggered stump speech designed to show a more
passionate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More tactical plans include working aggressively behind the
scenes to try to win the endorsement of groups that Bradley has so
far neutralized, most prominently the AFL-CIO, which is meeting in
California in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the new campaign seeks to feature a
new Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked over the weekend how he planned to overcome the challenges
he faces, a suddenly plain-speaking Gore, stung by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's devastating pronouncement last week that he is
unelectable, had a blunt and urgent answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoeleather and hard work and a lot of handshaking and talking
with people one on one and getting out of this 4-by-4 that I ride
around in and walking down the sidewalks and Main streets and going
in stores and coffee shops and looking voters in the eye and
talking to them one by one,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dryly noted Gore's abrupt change in strategy,
particularly the vice president's apparent eagerness to debate.
``For the last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me,'' he said while
campaigning in California. ``I think that shows we're making some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the address of Gore's headquarters mattered little.
What the move shows, he said, is ``the Democratic side is clearly
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers in and out of Washington have said that Gore needs to
shed the trappings of the vice presidency, and the move to
Tennessee, where he spent his boyhood summers, should help him do
that.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the broader need for Gore to project some of
the ``outsider'' status that has helped propel the Bradley
campaign. It also signals Gore's need to establish a presence in
the South, where Bush looms with a strong advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee itself, a poll conducted Sept. 16 for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee found Bush leading Gore among
registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the 17 states that
make up the South, a new poll conducted for the American
Association of Health Plans showed Bush leading Gore 53 percent to
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the campaign was moving ``lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville so that we can get closer to the American people, closer
to the grassroots and out of the Beltway and into the heartland.''
He said he would formally open a Nashville office next Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, including President Clinton, have long been
telling him that he needs to connect better with voters. They want
him in intimate exchanges with people about what really matters in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent more than an hour on Sunday with 10 people in a
livingroom in the tiny outpost of Berlin, N.H., said Wednesday that
he would go ``directly to the voters in small groups, without
intermediaries, responding to their questions, telling them about
my vision for the future, asking for their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also been told to sharpen his message, reveal some
passion and try to appear as often as possible with his playful,
spontaneous wife, Tipper, to show that he is a ``real person,'' a
family man _ and not Bill Clinton. Even so, his advisers are
divided over how much he should try to separate himself from his
political patron. A base more than 500 miles from Washington could
help keep at a distance the Clinton scandal, and the shadow it
casts over a Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speech now includes a reference to an earlier period
in his life when he was ``disillusioned'' with politics, the
result, he says, of the Vietnam War, Watergate and watching his
father, a senator from Tennessee, go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With these glancing references to the tumultuous 1960s and '70s,
Gore hopes to begin to add some complexity to his personal
narrative and to counter the impression that he has been a
politician and Washington insider all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers say the Bradley surge is a blessing in
disguise. ``It's better than shadow-boxing out there by
ourselves,'' said one. It has energized the candidate and his
campaign staff and cast them in a role that Americans love: that of
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to fight,'' said Tony Coelho, his campaign
manager. ``We've unshackled him. We've liberated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Gore is still a cautious politician. While
he is taking some stands that may be popular locally but are risky
nationally, like supporting timber cutting in New Hampshire's White
Mountains, he still refuses to say whether he believes Clinton was
right to grant clemency to a group of imprisoned Puerto Rican
nationalists. ``I have not reviewed the record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He can also signal an air of desperation. In a recent speech to
Democratic activists, he blurted out: ``I care.'' The words
inadvertently recalled former President George Bush's struggle to
sympathize with voters. ``Message: I care,'' Bush had said in 1992,
drawing ridicule for needing to spell out what he had been unable
to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often turns to this none-too-subtle approach as he seems to
regard his listeners as interest groups. ``I am FOR the veterans!''
he will announce. Or, as he said last week: ``For the
environmentalists here, the first word I learned to spell was green
_ G-R-E-E-N!''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville adds to the risk that Gore will be seen as
desperate. ``It redefines the `Hail Mary,''' said one Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats perceived the move as a welcome sign that
Gore was ready to take control of his campaign and put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals a change in attitude,'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant who ran Clinton's insurgent campaign from
Little Rock, Ark., in 1992. ``And it allows you to make changes, to
do things you need to do underneath without creating a three- or
four-day brouhaha,'' he said, referring to the downsizing of the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this move to be an opportunity for transformation,''
Gore said
</P>
<P>
   Part of that transformation will be a willingness to challenge
Bradley directly and to begin drawing contrasts with a man he has
not mentioned by name until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to engage Bradley on specific issues, including
education, health care and the environment.

EX-TREASURER DESCRIBES `NIGHTMARE' OF FRAUD ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joseph D. Malone, who oversaw the Treasury while
employees allegedly pulled off the largest theft of public money in
Massachusetts history, says he is ``devastated'' by the
``nightmare'' of watching his record crumble and former friends
betray him.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since seven men were indicted in the $9.5
million Treasury theft, Malone said Wednesday he does not want to
speak with any of those charged in the case because they committed
the ``ultimate betrayal'' against him and the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is devastating,'' he added. ``To know the effort that went
into the eight years that we were in office and to think that there
-- if the allegations are true -- was such a lack of conscience on
the part of these individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If these allegations are true, it's the ultimate betrayal,''
Malone said. ``This is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Malone declined to discuss what he knew about any
wrongdoing in the agency, saying no matter his response, it could
be misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the men _ three former Treasury employees, a
top fundraiser for Malone and three others _ include stealing
$300,000 to $400,000 in bags of cash from a state employees bank on
Beacon Hill, tipping off heir-finding firms to uncashed state
checks in exchange for kickbacks, and larceny of about $9 million
from the loosely supervised Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement of criminal charges against fundraiser
Richard Arrighi, brings the scandal closer personally to Malone,
who is cooperating with Attorney General Thomas Reilly's probe.
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi was the lawyer for Malone's now-deceased mother and won
lucrative bond contracts for his law firms under Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said watching the scandal unfold has been especially
painful because he knew some of the players personally. Arrighi is
accused of concealing $1.6 million stolen from the Treasury by
laundering it through a Waltham condo development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly knew Rick,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources say Arrighi arranged for former Deputy Treasurer
Robert Foley, the alleged mastermind of the scheme, to get his job
from Malone. Malone Wednesday denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Foley,'' Malone said. ``Arrighi didn't have to help
him. He came with a strong background in accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he blames himself only for trusting too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 44 years I thought I had seen just about everything,''
Malone said in a measured voice. ``But this is a whole new story.
... Seven people conspired to steal money from the people of
Massachusetts and I say, didn't one of them have the good sense to
say this is a crazy idea and let's stop it?''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who dreamed of being a governor since he was a teenager,
relinquished his position to run, unsuccessfully, for the state's
highest office last year and is now an online consultant.
</P>
<P>
   His political career has been deeply damaged by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had some antennae that led me to see what was going
on or to smell a rat, but it didn't go that way,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also said it has been months since he talked to Arrighi
or to Foley, who oversaw many of the cash functions in the
treasury, which has about $40 billion under its management.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was indicted charges of embezzlement, receiving bribes,
conflict of interest, conspiracy and concealing stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Former Treasury supervisor John ``Trixie'' Trischitta was
indicted for his part of an alleged kickback scheme with heir
finders Martin Robbins and Thomas Ciliberto Jr., who, according to
Reilly, stole money from the state's Unpaid Check Fund with
Trischitta's help. Robbins and Cilberto were also indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Robert Borino was indicted for allegedly working
with Arrighi to launder the stolen money from the Unpaid Check
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Scot Butcher, the Treasury's former head of cash management, was
indicted for allegedly stealing cash from a state employees bank at
the One Ashburton Place government building on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Malone Wednesday said he closed the teller station at Ashburton
Place but did not recall when. His closure of another teller
station within the State House was done with much fanfare earlier
in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole teller system was open for abuse and that's why we
shut it down,'' he said.

   Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it would reinvent itself as
kind of Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular web site to
merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling
powerhouse, which started as an online bookstore, will gather an
unprecedented amount of precious information on the buying habits
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called zShops, begins Thursday with 500,000 new
products _ about four times the offerings of the average Kmart _
the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to
buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys. For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>

   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

   NEW YORK _ Top executives from three of the nation's top copper
companies secretly convened in a room at the Trump International
Hotel in Manhattan last Friday to try to resolve one of the
nastiest, most convoluted corporate takeover fights in recent
years. When they emerged more than two hours later, it was nastier
and more convoluted than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting brought together Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps
Dodge, the nation's largest copper producer, with the chief
executives of two competitors, Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals
Co., that had agreed last July to merge with each other. Yearley,
rather than see his smaller rivals join hands, had launched his own
$2.8 billion hostile offer to acquire both of them for Phelps
Dodge. Finally, after weeks of rebuffing Yearley, Francis
McAllister of Asarco and Milton Ward of Cyprus Amax had agreed to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley presented his best offer, he recalled. But he was not
willing to meet their demand _ $3.1 billion for the combination.
When the meeting broke up, Yearley was still determined to own both
companies and McAllister and Ward, eager to protect their
interests, quickly began a search for a white knight, adding yet
another player to the corporate chess game.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, a brawl in the copper industry was unthinkable.
Ailing economies in Asia and Latin America had left demand for
copper waning. Prices plummeted to a 12-year low then _ a paltry 63
cents a pound. Profits at copper mining companies tumbled, with
some companies forced to cut production to help arrest the price
slide. In fact, the industry's bleak outlook was the catalyst that
prompted McAllister to talk to Ward in the first place last May.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly that world has changed. Copper prices have risen 33
percent since then. Now, Asarco and Cyprus Amax, instead of being
left alone to embrace each other out of desperation, have, in
effect, become much more valuable prizes on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as soon as they walked out of the meeting last Friday,
the two sought a bid from Grupo Mexico, a little-known Mexican
copper producer and Asarco's largest shareholder. Grupo Mexico,
which had been eying the action for a while, immediately offered to
pay $1.03 billion in cash for Asarco, barely edging out Phelps
Dodge's $1.01 billion stock and cash offer. Asarco and Cyprus Amax,
essentially acknowledging that their original deal was no longer
viable, postponed shareholder votes scheduled for Thursday on the
merger, giving each other until Tuesday to reconsider their
options, even ditch merger plans altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The four-way fight is endemic of what has happened in stagnant
commodity-driven industries seeking some way to shore up production
without losing their shirts in the process. Low prices in
slow-growing industries, including oil, aluminum, copper and
chemicals, have made even the most unattractive partners appealing
to formidable competitors hoping to cut costs and restore
profitability to their slim-margin businesses. And with 1980s-style
corporate takeover tactics back in vogue, properties expected to
benefit from rising prices are now worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When copper was 65 cent per pound, no one thought anyone would
have been fighting over these two companies,'' said Tom Burnett,
founder of Merger Insight, which is based in New York. ``The worm
has turned. Commodity prices are on the move and companies don't
want to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Asarco and Grupo Mexico said executives would not
comment on recent events. Executives at Cyprus Amax did not return
phone calls. But people involved in the talks said Cyprus Amax had
been scouting for another partner and could possibly strike a deal
soon with Phelps Dodge. Asarco too has been negotiating with other
suitors this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McAllister of Asarco, who only became chief executive last
spring, never planned for his company to become a target,
executives close to him said. Instead his solution to Asarco's woes
was for him to act as buyer, squeezing savings out of any merged
entity. McAllister wanted to turn Asarco's fortunes around, one
person said, and he found a willing partner in the older Ward, who
was looking for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations said Ward had
already approached a handful of potential merger partners for
Cyprus Amax last year. So it was with little fanfare that Ward and
McAllister announced July 15 that their companies would join forces
in a merger of equals, valued then at $737 million in stock. Stock
traders yawned at the news: the stock of both companies dropped 3
percent on the day the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the time said the ho-hum response was because
neither of the companies' shareholders were paid a premium and they
did not understand how the duo could successfully improve profit
margins without cutting production. ``People wanted to see how
they'd perform before they bid up the stock,'' said Ali Agha, a
metals and mining analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. But the
merger did catch the attention of Yearley, who said he thought a
three-way merger with Asarco and Cyprus Amax could be just the
ticket to make Phelps Dodge the premier low-cost global copper
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge is one of the few copper companies to turn a
profit. And after mulling over the combination, he said he called
both Ward and McAllister on Aug. 10 to propose they meet. The two
rebuffed his offer, saying their merger agreement barred them from
independently talking to other suitors. Still, Yearley followed up
with a letters to the chief executives and boards of directors,
requesting a reply within a week.
</P>
<P>
   None came, until the two companies publicly dismissed Phelps
Dodge's offer Aug. 20 and reconfirmed their own merger. So Phelps
Dodge went public with a sweeter offer that day, offering stock for
the pair with a combined value of $2.6 billion, a 30 percent
premium to the companies' trading prices the previous day. Five
days later, Asarco and Cyprus Amax snubbed that bid, suggesting
they would be willing to negotiate only if Phelps Dodge put a much
better deal on the table. To deter stockholder interest in the
Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco and Cyprus Amax also sweetened the terms
of their own merger, offering an extra payment of $5 a share in
cash once the deal was completed. Undaunted, Phelps Dodge launched
a tender offer for shares in the two companies Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley was not the only interested party, however. Grupo
Mexico, Mexico's largest diversifed mining company, owned a 9.7
percent stake in Asarco, the largest single holding. Its chairman,
German Larrea, watched the brouhaha intensely. Not only was he
interested in getting the best price for his shares, executives
said, he also was potentially interested in a piece of the action
himself. Larrea, according to documents recently filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, held separate meetings in late
August and early September in Mexico City with both McAllister of
Asarco. Executives from Phelps Dodge also tried to woo him to vote
for their bid, Yearley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Larrea was an attentive suitor. An executive
close to the company said Larrea ``didn't want to do something
hostile'' after Asarco's announcement in July. But now, with Phelps
Dodge in the picture, he said, Larrea ``perceived himself as the
good guy.'' A spokesman for Larrea said he was not granting
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Larrea had a problem, though. Because Grupo Mexico's stock did
not trade in the United States, it would have to offer cash. So the
company hired Chase Securities Inc. as its adviser and to arrange
financing for its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enthusiasm for Phelps Dodge's offer was growing on
Wall Street, particularly after the company increased its bids
again, on Sept. 22, to a stock and cash offer worth about $2.8
billion for the two companies together. Regulators were believed to
be giving the nod to the three-way merger, despite initial
antitrust concerns, according to executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco and Cyprus Amax, after finally agreeing to meet Yearley,
laid out several demands at the session last Friday. First, said
Yearley, they wanted Phelps Dodge to pay a 55 percent premium to
their stocks' prices prior to the Phelps Dodge bid Aug. 20. Next,
they wanted Phelps Dodge to take the risk of any antitrust
approval. They also wanted to avoid paying a $45 million breakup
fee for canceling their merger. Top executive pay packages would
have to be honored. If Yearley could agree to those terms, he had a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley said he agreed to almost everything except price.
Already Phelps Dodge was offering about a 40 percent premium to buy
the companies. ``We thought we'd gone far enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the skirmish took an unexpected twist later that afternoon.
A representative of Credit Suisse First Boston, which was advising
Asarco, contacted Larrea of Grupo Mexico, documents filed with the
SEC show, and made him an offer: Asarco would be willing to
consider ``an all cash firm offer for all of its shares at $26 per
share.'' Cyprus Amax was mentioned too, but Grupo was not
interested, said an executive close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the talks said Asarco executives did not
know that Larrea was interested in buying the company _ despite
having had several discussions with key executives at Asarco _
describing the call as ``one of those interesting coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Grupo Mexico announced its plans to launch a tender
offer for Asarco for $26 a share, slightly higher than the $25.47
Phelps Dodge had proposed two days earlier. ``As you know, in the
past we have expressed an interest in exploring the possibility of
a combination of our two companies' operations,'' Larrea wrote in a
letter to McAllister that evening. ``Briefly put, we believe our
proposal is in the best interest of your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   As advisers and executives sort through the offers this week, it
is not yet clear which company will buy Asarco or Cyprus, or if
they end up together.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, said one banker involved in the deal, ``It was a
good attempt that didn't work out that well.'' More to the point,
he added, ``Althought it will end up being good for shareholders,
it may not be necessarily be good for management.'' &QL;

MARKET PLACE: STOCK FUND SALES LAG AS BROADER MARKET COOLS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Be careful what you ask for, the saying goes, because
you may get it.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors who ignored the indexing phenomenon in
hopes that their fund would eventually beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 are getting their wish, as the average U.S. diversified equity
fund appears poised to top the index for the second consecutive
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But that is little comfort to investors, who liked things a lot
better when the S&AMP;P 500 was beating most other funds and posting 20
percent-plus annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   With the S&AMP;P index down 7.3 percent since June 30, and now up
only 4.2 percent for the year, investors' impatience is showing:
fund sales, which were strong in the second quarter, have slacked
off considerably in the last two months as the broad stock market
has drifted lower.
</P>
<P>
   Investors put $9.2 billion into stock funds in August, down 25.7
percent from July sales of $12.4 billion, according to new figures
from the Investment Company Institute, and September has shaped up
about the same. Charles Biderman, president of Trimtabs.com
Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates total
September stock-fund sales of $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the stock market declined, but it has once again
begun to narrow. While small-capitalization and mid-capitalization
funds performed better than large-cap funds this quarter, the much
noted rotation from growth stocks to value stocks earlier this year
has abated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., large-cap growth funds lost an average
of 4.2 percent this quarter through Sept. 23, compared with an 8.3
percent drop for large-cap value funds. Mid-cap growth funds broke
even, but mid-cap value funds fell 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bigger value funds, Vanguard's $32 billion Windsor II,
which had managed decent returns in recent years even though its
value style was out of favor, has slumped 14.7 percent so far this
quarter, hurt by big holdings in financial stocks and Waste
Management Inc. Its sister value fund, Vanguard Windsor, which
soared in the spring, is down 11.1 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For many diversified mutual fund managers, who are on track to
post single-digit returns for the first time in several years, the
pressure is on to improve results in the fourth quarter. Overall,
the average U.S. diversified equity fund fell 5.7 percent in the
quarter through Sept. 23, according to Lipper Inc., compared with a
loss by the S&AMP;P 500-stock index of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That performance may be causing fund flows to narrow somewhat,
too. Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks
fund flows, estimates that 70 percent of fund sales in the first
three weeks of September went to technology funds and index funds,
which tend to draw a high proportion of money every month no matter
how they do against other funds because they are a mainstay of
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is tightly focused on these two sectors,'' said
Adler, who noted that technology funds were one of the few bright
spots this quarter, up an average of 6 percent through Sept. 23,
according to Lipper. (Gold funds have soared this week and will
also rank among the top funds for the quarter, which ends
Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Top-selling Vanguard said its stock funds have taken in $2.2
billion this month, up from $2 billion in August. The only fund
company with more assets under management, Fidelity Investments,
says its stock funds drew $500 million in September through Monday.

   Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it would reinvent itself as
kind of Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular web site to
merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling
powerhouse, which started as an online bookstore, will gather an
unprecedented amount of precious information on the buying habits
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called zShops, begins Thursday with 500,000 new
products _ about four times the offerings of the average Kmart _
the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to
buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys. For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Thousands of jubilant university students
gathered Wednesday to hail the country's reformist president inside
the sprawling, golden-domed shrine to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the puritanical Muslim cleric who led Iran's Islamic revolution 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The students pressed against barriers inside the shrine to chant
the name of the president, Mohammad Khatami, punched the air with
hand-lettered signs bearing slogans of support and raised cries of
``Death to the opponents of Khatami!''
</P>
<P>
   So dense was the crowd that many students were pressed almost
against the glass walls of the green-roofed pavilion within the
shrine that encloses the tomb of Khomeini, who died in 1989 at age
90, and that of his son, Ahmad Khomeini, a cleric who died in 1996
in his mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   But if the students' enthusiasm carried the unmistakable sense
of a society in transition, it was also redolent of the formidable
obstacles that Khatami, 53, a high-ranking cleric himself, will
have to overcome to build a ``civil society'' in Iran _ his catch
phrase since his landslide election victory 28 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In casting their votes, 20 million Iranian voters backed
Khatami's pledge to establish a tolerant, law-abiding democracy
that he has said would mitigate the harshness of Islamic rule
without allowing it to be swept aside by Western-style secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has been called the ``Iranian Gorbachev,'' a reference
to Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts as Soviet leader to reform the
Communist system, which ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union
and his ouster in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One similarity is that Khatami is an authentic member of the
political establishment that he now challenges. He emerged from the
same ultraconservative Islamic seminary in Qom as the hard-line
clerics who still cling doggedly to the legacy of Ayatollah
Khomeini, and with them he took part in the ``Islamic revolution''
that overthrew the Shah in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the difference in Khatami's case were the years
before his election in 1997, when he was sidelined by clerics to a
position as director of the national library. There he plunged into
a study of Western political thought and emerged with ideals that
drew heavily from the 18th-century liberal philosophers who
influenced the American Revolution, including Hobbes, Locke and
Rousseau. Khatami's 290-page book on Western political thought is
now a best-seller around the campus of Tehran University, where he
draws powerful backing.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's supporters, concentrated among the
two-thirds of Iran's population of 70 million who are under 30
years old, are at least counterbalanced, for now, by his opponents,
as Wednesday's events at the shrine demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a few feet away from the podium used by Khatami, rows of
Muslim clerics and other influential figures responded impassively
to Khatami's hourlong speech. They included Hassan Khomeini, the
ginger-bearded grandson of the Ayatollah; he is 28, a
middle-ranking cleric who has become an icon to Islamic
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Through waves of cheering and chanting by the students, the
clerics offered no applause. Some stroked their beards pensively,
others played distractedly with prayer beads, still others fanned
themselves with programs for the gathering, which was part of a
10-day celebration of the 100th anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The clerics' glumness was not relieved even when Khatami,
responding to the cries of ``Death to the opponents of Khatami!''
rebuked the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I don't like to hear slogans like that,'' Khatami
exclaimed. ``I don't like to hear `Death to opponents' or death to
anybody, because as matters stand in our society at present, it
will be interpreted in a very negative way, as meaning that anybody
who does not share your views should be silenced, and that's not
right at all. The Iran that we want should be one where there will
be room for all the different viewpoints, for all ideologies, even
those that oppose the president. They, too, must have the right to
express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Iranian clerics are aligned with Khatami, many
others, probably a majority, are in the conservative camp with
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Iran's Supreme Leader, a title
bequeathed by Ayatollah Khomeini, Khamenei remains the country's
most powerful figure, with effective control of the army, the
police, the judiciary and the intelligence agencies, as well as the
theological establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, Khatami's powers as president are
limited, and he relies heavily for his influence on the persuasive
power of his popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, who did not attend Wednesday's gathering, has been
engaged in a game of political cat-and-mouse with Khatami, blocking
many of the president's initiatives and maneuvering to discredit
and even jail some of his associates, but managing to avoid a
direct political confrontation that many Iranians fear could lead
to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the struggle has been waged with only occasional
violence, and both sides seem keen to keep it that way as they
approach the next crisis point: parliamentary elections next
February, in which Khatami will attempt to wrest a majority from
the conservatives.

   Wednesday's meeting with the students was laden with political
overtones, coming as it did in the aftermath of rioting in July on
the university campus, the worst disturbances since the 1979
revolution. The July riots began with student protests over the
closing of a reformist newspaper, but they spiraled out of control
as the police and gangs of Islamic militia members attacked a
student dormitory, killing at least two students.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives appeared to have won the day then by calling
huge crowds into Tehran's streets in a counterdemonstration, but
popular outrage at the students' deaths prompted Khamenei to
condemn the attack on the dormitory as ``criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July the conservatives have remained on the offensive.
Earlier this month, they used a press court to close another
leading reformist newspaper, Neshat, and to sentence its editor to
a 30-month jail term, now under appeal, for ``insulting the
sanctity of Islam,'' among other things, through its coverage of
the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Although a government inquiry condemned the police for the
campus attack, a revolutionary court, also under conservative
control, announced two weeks ago that it had sentenced four people,
apparently students, to death for their roles in the disturbances.
No announcement has been made that the sentences were carried out,
and reformers hope they will be commuted to jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest skirmish, hard-liners have attempted to stir
public outrage against the reformers over the publication of a
satirical essay in a Tehran campus magazine that featured a student
telling the 12th imam _ a central figure in the theology of Iran's
Shiite Muslims _ that he would be too busy with exams to attend the
reappearance on earth of the imam, an event that holds a sanctity
among Shiites similar to the second coming of Jesus among
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative newspapers have run banner headlines on the affair,
not mentioning that the original article appeared in a publication
with a press run of 150 copies, and conservative students have
rallied on the university campus, demanding the resignation of the
culture and education ministers, key allies of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the new attacks, Khatami's tactic has been to
parade his own Islamic credentials while offering oratorical
strikes against the conservatives. At Wednesday's meeting, he
lavished praise on Ayatollah Khomeini and emphasized the importance
he attached to university learning, as if to say that conservatives
who condemn the campuses as centers of anti-Islamic sentiment and
urge that they be closed have betrayed Ayatollah Khomeini's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   While attacking the anit-imam satire as ``an insult to religious
values,'' he said the ``bigger crime'' was that of the
conservatives ``who have tried to convert a small wave into a big
storm'' in a bid to isolate the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly Khatami concentrated on an appeal to the students to
avoid provoking the hard-liners and giving them a pretext for
another campus confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should remember that there are hands at work in our country
that want to foster divisions among us and to set one group against
another, with a view to creating chaos,'' he said. ``So while you
should defend your values, don't allow divisions to rule life on
the campuses. You are there to ask questions, to learn, to engage
in dialogue, not to allow the universities to descend into chaos.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging that he faces
a serious challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination,
announced Wednesday that he was relocating his campaign
headquarters from Washington to his home state of Tennessee and
paring back a top-heavy campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Nashville is part of a broad strategy that his aides
hope will symbolize a break from the Beltway _ and the Clinton
administration. And it comes in response to the steady rise in the
polls, and in the public imagination, of former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, the sole Democrat who dared challenge Gore and his
vast institutional apparatus for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore backers have been dispirited by national polls
that show Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner,
sustaining a strong lead that Gore has been unable to dent.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Gore campaign has only vaguely focused on Bush
and acted as if Bradley did not exist. But the former basketball
star has demonstrated his ability to raise serious money. And now
that Bradley has drawn even with Gore in opinion polls in key
states like New York and New Hampshire, the Gore camp can no longer
ignore the Bradley threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the challenge for the nomination has changed,''
Gore acknowledged Wednesday, noting that the Bradley camp had
established ``a baseline of competence and credibility.'' He added:
``We're in a completely new campaign. So we're going to adapt to it
and adjust to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals is to cut expenses by limiting the number and
salaries of senior staffers. The need to conserve money is a
consequence of Gore's lackluster fund raising: He collected an
unimpressive $6.5 million in the last three months and has spent
almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's cash has been drained in part by efforts to raise money
and build state organizations. But that focus has resulted in
negative news accounts of a bulging campaign top-heavy with
Washington consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The move will mean lower rents in Nashville and will provide a
face-saving way for some of Gore's high-priced talent to leave the
campaign without being fired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is reporting that it has just $10 million in cash
on hand. Bradley's campaign refused to divulge how much it raised
in the last quarter and how much it has on hand, but the
expectation is that in financial reports to be made public on
Thursday, he will show he is competitive with Gore. Three months
ago, the Gore campaign said it had $9.4 million on hand; Bradley
had $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville is also part of a broader effort to
revitalize the campaign. Other elements include an accelerated
schedule of debates with Bradley to showcase the vice president's
verbal skills, an emphasis on meetings with smaller and less formal
groups and a rejiggered stump speech designed to show a more
passionate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More tactical plans include working aggressively behind the
scenes to try to win the endorsement of groups that Bradley has so
far neutralized, most prominently the AFL-CIO, which is meeting in
California in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the new campaign seeks to feature a
new Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked over the weekend how he planned to overcome the challenges
he faces, a suddenly plain-speaking Gore, stung by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's devastating pronouncement last week that he is
unelectable, had a blunt and urgent answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoeleather and hard work and a lot of handshaking and talking
with people one on one and getting out of this 4-by-4 that I ride
around in and walking down the sidewalks and Main streets and going
in stores and coffee shops and looking voters in the eye and
talking to them one by one,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dryly noted Gore's abrupt change in strategy,
particularly the vice president's apparent eagerness to debate.
``For the last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me,'' he said while
campaigning in California. ``I think that shows we're making some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the address of Gore's headquarters mattered little.
What the move shows, he said, is ``the Democratic side is clearly
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers in and out of Washington have said that Gore needs to
shed the trappings of the vice presidency, and the move to
Tennessee, where he spent his boyhood summers, should help him do
that.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the broader need for Gore to project some of
the ``outsider'' status that has helped propel the Bradley
campaign. It also signals Gore's need to establish a presence in
the South, where Bush looms with a strong advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee itself, a poll conducted Sept. 16 for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee found Bush leading Gore among
registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the 17 states that
make up the South, a new poll conducted for the American
Association of Health Plans showed Bush leading Gore 53 percent to
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the campaign was moving ``lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville so that we can get closer to the American people, closer
to the grassroots and out of the Beltway and into the heartland.''
He said he would formally open a Nashville office next Wednesday.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, including President Clinton, have long been
telling him that he needs to connect better with voters. They want
him in intimate exchanges with people about what really matters in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent more than an hour on Sunday with 10 people in a
livingroom in the tiny outpost of Berlin, N.H., said Wednesday that
he would go ``directly to the voters in small groups, without
intermediaries, responding to their questions, telling them about
my vision for the future, asking for their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also been told to sharpen his message, reveal some
passion and try to appear as often as possible with his playful,
spontaneous wife, Tipper, to show that he is a ``real person,'' a
family man _ and not Bill Clinton. Even so, his advisers are
divided over how much he should try to separate himself from his
political patron. A base more than 500 miles from Washington could
help keep at a distance the Clinton scandal, and the shadow it
casts over a Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speech now includes a reference to an earlier period
in his life when he was ``disillusioned'' with politics, the
result, he says, of the Vietnam War, Watergate and watching his
father, a senator from Tennessee, go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With these glancing references to the tumultuous 1960s and '70s,
Gore hopes to begin to add some complexity to his personal
narrative and to counter the impression that he has been a
politician and Washington insider all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers say the Bradley surge is a blessing in
disguise. ``It's better than shadow-boxing out there by
ourselves,'' said one. It has energized the candidate and his
campaign staff and cast them in a role that Americans love: that of
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to fight,'' said Tony Coelho, his campaign
manager. ``We've unshackled him. We've liberated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Gore is still a cautious politician. While
he is taking some stands that may be popular locally but are risky
nationally, like supporting timber cutting in New Hampshire's White
Mountains, he still refuses to say whether he believes Clinton was
right to grant clemency to a group of imprisoned Puerto Rican
nationalists. ``I have not reviewed the record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He can also signal an air of desperation. In a recent speech to
Democratic activists, he blurted out: ``I care.'' The words
inadvertently recalled former President George Bush's struggle to
sympathize with voters. ``Message: I care,'' Bush had said in 1992,
drawing ridicule for needing to spell out what he had been unable
to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often turns to this none-too-subtle approach as he seems to
regard his listeners as interest groups. ``I am FOR the veterans!''
he will announce. Or, as he said last week: ``For the
environmentalists here, the first word I learned to spell was green
_ G-R-E-E-N!''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville adds to the risk that Gore will be seen as
desperate. ``It redefines the `Hail Mary,''' said one Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats perceived the move as a welcome sign that
Gore was ready to take control of his campaign and put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals a change in attitude,'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant who ran Clinton's insurgent campaign from
Little Rock, Ark., in 1992. ``And it allows you to make changes, to
do things you need to do underneath without creating a three- or
four-day brouhaha,'' he said, referring to the downsizing of the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this move to be an opportunity for transformation,''
Gore said
</P>
<P>
   Part of that transformation will be a willingness to challenge
Bradley directly and to begin drawing contrasts with a man he has
not mentioned by name until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to engage Bradley on specific issues, including
education, health care and the environment.

BUSH DENOUNCES PEROT AND BUCHANAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas sternly
denounced Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan on Wednesday, suggesting that
``personal vendettas'' may be driving their apparent alliance to
have Buchanan seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asserted that both men helped undermine his father's
unsuccessful campaign for re-election to the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the 1992 campaign was hard for my dad to
get traction in the race because of, first, Patrick J. Buchanan,
and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush said in
response to questions at a news conference during a two-day
California campaign swing. ``If the adage is true _ you die a death
of a thousand cuts in politics _ Ross Perot was a part of the
thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's display of a festering resentment toward Perot and
Buchanan was unusual in a campaign in which he has tried to strike
an accommodating tone to win over a broad spectrum of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks reignited the feuds that started with his father
_ and make it less likely that Bush would ever reach an
accommodation with Perot or Buchanan. Buchanan weakened President
George Bush by taking him on in the primaries in 1992; Perot's
independent candidacy cost him voters in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Many other politicians have taken care not to criticize Perot,
the founder of the Reform Party, whose profile has diminished but
who still has considerable influence among some in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the front-runner for the Republican nomination, and many
of his advisers view Buchanan as a serious threat because if he
wins the Reform Party nomination he could siphon Republican support
from Bush in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's expected bid for the nomination had thus far had the
tacit backing of Perot, whose advisers have briefed the Buchanan
campaign on the byzantine Reform Party nominating process. Even
Buchanan's advisers said they know the unpredictable Perot could
undermine their effort by plunging into the nomination race himself
_ or backing another contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was particularly critical of Perot, recalling the Texas
business executive's endorsement of Gov. Ann Richards, the
Democratic incumbent, when Bush ran against her in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a personal relationship with Mr. Perot in that about
one week before the 1994 election, up pops Mr. Perot and he
endorsed my opponent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Buchanan and Perot were motivated by bad blood
toward his family, Bush said, ``I hope not.'' But he went on to
raise the notion of vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people enter the political process with what's best
for the country in mind _ not making decisions based on personal
vendettas,'' Bush said. ``I don't know Mr. Perot well enough to be
able to tell you whether or not he's got personal animus toward me.
All I got to tell you is the one time I did have political
experience with him is when he endorsed my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot was traveling and could not be reached for comment. But
Russell J. Verney, the Reform Party chairman who is close to Perot,
dismissed Bush's remarks as ``paranoia'' from the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   ``After '92 the Bushes couldn't accept responsibility for their
loss, so they call it a vendetta,'' he said. ``There's no vendetta.
There's no animus. The Bushes have to take full responsibility for
`read my lips _ no new taxes' and a miserable campaign in '92.''
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on reports that Buchanan was considering running
for the Reform Party nomination, Bush made his most vigorous appeal
to Buchanan not to defect _ even as other Republicans are
condemning Buchanan for his comments about the West's response to
Hitler in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, his revisionist history about World War II is
wrong,'' Bush said. Still, making clear that he is trying not to
alienate Buchanan's supporters, he added, ``If he goes, he's gone,
I understand that. The question is whether some of the people who
support Pat Buchanan who are loyal Republicans stay with the
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a rival for the nomination who
has declared that Buchanan no longer has a place in the Republican
party, sought to draw a contrast with Bush's handling of the
renegade Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Wednesday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley,
Calif., where Nancy Reagan sat in the front row, McCain cloaked
himself in the memories of Reagan, whom he recalled as a great
American hero who would never stand for aggressors like Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Ronald Reagan's words stand too as a challenge,'' McCain
said in a passage that his advisers said was a reference to Bush's
handling of Buchanan. ``For not only must Americans be prepared to
defend the honor and glory of our country, but to speak out
forcefully against those who would urge us to abandon our world
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reagan did not endorse McCain or speak publicly Wednesday,
but she met with him before his speech and people close to the
senator said she has privately encouraged his bid.
</P>
<P>
   McCain first met the Reagans in the early 1970s when they had
dinners to welcome prisoners of war home from Vietnam. Meeting with
reporters in front of a chunk of the Berlin Wall on display at the
library, McCain said he disagreed with Bush, who said of Buchanan,
``Let Republicans decide whether or not his ideas make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain put forth a different view: ``When someone takes the
positions that Mr. Buchanan did on the issue of World War II, that
is not longer in the realm of debate of the Republican Party,'' he
said. ``I won't stoop to debate that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Buchanan as a ``marginal figure now _ he's gained
no traction in New Hampshire or anyplace else.''

CLINTON WIDENS PLAN FOR POOR DEBTOR NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday announced a major
expansion of American efforts to forgive the debt of the world's
poorest nations, saying those countries would not have to pay back
any of the billions of dollars they borrowed from American aid
agencies if they could show the savings were being plowed into
poverty reduction and education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Wednesday of 100 percent debt forgiveness
for the world's most indebted nations _ mostly in sub-Saharan
Africa _ expands a previous commitment by the United States in June
to write off up to 90 percent of the money they owe. But the
process may take years, and it is contingent on congressional
approval of a $1 billion debt-forgiveness program that Clinton sent
to Capitol Hill last week as an amendment to his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, administration officials say, is that many of the
countries that will benefit from the program never had much hope
repaying more than a fraction of the $5.7 billion they currently
owe the U.S. Treasury. In fact, much of that debt has already been
lessened on the government's ledger books, reflecting estimates
that the United States was likely to recover only pennies on the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by the magic of Washington's budget rules, the $5.7
billion in debt can be wiped out with a congressional expenditure
of only $1 billion. Still, it is far from clear that Congress will
go along with the move, especially as elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here, just as the
two financial institutions were putting the finishing touches on a
$50 billion debt-reduction program that involves their own massive
lending to poor nations. Clinton's announcement, during a brief
appearance in a hotel ballroom where thousands of delegates of
countries around the world were gathered, seemed to take many here
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States,'' Clinton said, ``when _ and this is quite important _ when
needed to help them finance basic human needs and when the money
will be used to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said that Clinton's move had ``symbolic importance that
goes beyond its economic significance,'' especially in countries
that are choosing between paying off their international loans or
building more schools or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's program would initially aid countries like Uganda and
Mozambique, which have gone the furthest in meeting requirements
set out in 1996 for debt relief. But ultimately it could help
another 34 nations, from Tanzania to Zamabia and Ivory Coast to
Nicaragua and Honduras to rogue nations like Myanmar if they are
willing to meet the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not extend his spirit of forgiveness, however, to
one country that is deeply indebted, and deeply in trouble, with
the IMF: Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the head of the fund, Michel Camdessus, said that
``it would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on
this great nation; we will not do that.'' He urged that all the
allegations of misappropriation of funds should be weighed against
seven years of ``real progress,'' and praised Russia for continuing
to develop a ``modern market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus' comments, and the absence of balancing words of
warning to Russia, infuriated some White House officials who felt
it undermined their effort to send a stern message to Moscow.
Clinton, talked Wednesday only about Russia as an example that the
fund must heed as it reviews ``its procedures and controls to
strengthen the safeguards'' on use of its money.

CALIFORNIA RACIAL PROFILING BILL IS VETOED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Playing both sides of a divisive racial issue,
Gov. Gray Davis of California has vetoed a bill requiring
law-enforcement agencies to provide information to determine
whether they are stopping a disproportionate share of racial
minority members. But while he questioned the usefulness and cost
of the measure, which is strongly supported by civil rights groups,
Davis ordered the state highway patrol to collect that information
and urged local police departments to do so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill contended that at a cost of less than $2
million a year it would have produced evidence of whether motorists
from minorities were being stopped by law-enforcement officers for
questioning because of the driver's race. The bill would have
required police to record the race, sex and other information about
every motorist they stop.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message late on Tuesday, the governor, who was
supported in his election campaign last year by the usually
conservative police groups that opposed the measure, disputed the
cost estimates of the bill's supporters and said ``it is
questionable whether the information gathered _ at a potential cost
of tens of millions of dollars _ would provide any more meaningful
information than is currently available.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that although there might be a few specific instances
of racial profiling ``there is no evidence that this practice is
taking place statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Davis noted approvingly that more than 30 local
law-enforcement agencies around the state were voluntarily
collecting information on the people being stopped by police, and
said he had ordered the sole law-enforcement agency under his
direct control, the California Highway Patrol, to record the
ethnicity as well as other data on the people stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' communications director, Philip Trounstine, said he
believed that there was no contradiction in the actions and that
what the governor principally objected to was mandating every
police agency in the state to collect the statistics. He said the
governor felt police should undertake the collection of racial data
on their own and only where it seemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups have said that the targeting of minorities,
largely black and Hispanic motorists, is a longstanding practice
among some police departments and, most recently, President Clinton
ordered federal law-enforcement officials to collect information on
the race and sex of people they stop. Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey has acknowledged that state police there had engaged in
racial profiling and she has appointed a new chief to attack the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, a Democrat,
supported the bill, saying it would increase public confidence in
law enforcement. But several police associations said having to
record the data would be an unnecessary burden and would contradict
the training officers receive to ignore the race of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have required police officials to record the
apparent ethnicity of every motorist they stop, as well as other
information like age, sex, whether they conducted a search and
whether a citation was issued. The officers would not have asked
the racial background of the motorists, but would have relied on
their own visual determination.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would have lapsed at the end of 2004, included
no provisions to halt the practice of racial profiling, if it were
found to exist, but would have provided the first comprehensive
data in the state on what kinds of people were being stopped by
police and whether the figures varied by district. Civil rights
groups have argued that such information is an important first step
in rooting out what they contend is a pattern of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sponsored by state Sen. Kevin Murray, an L.A.
Democrat and an African-American who earlier had sued the Beverly
Hills Police Department, contending that he had been stopped by a
policeman there purely because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   Murray harshly criticized the governor Wednesday, saying, ``What
we have now is the largest state in the union, with the largest
population of minorities, which has now said it's not going to do
anything on this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Trounstine disputed the suggestion that Davis was doing nothing
and insisted that the dispute was largely over the best way to
achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may argue about whether mandating the collection of
data is the proper state function,'' Trounstine said, ``but no one
can question Governor Davis' commitment to civil rights and equal
protection under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis followed up his veto by writing to Mayor Richard Riordan
of Los Angeles, whose police chief had criticized the bill, and
urging him to begin collecting the data voluntarily, as some other
cities are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor can't rely on volunteerism, rely on
law-enforcement agencies to volunteer to do this,'' said Elizabeth
Schroeder of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California.

COMMENTARY: ATTENTION MUST BE PAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alton Fitzgerald White, one of the stars of the
Broadway musical ``Ragtime,'' let it be known this week that he
plans to sue the city for false arrest. And on Tuesday he made an
appearance at a parochial school in Harlem to commiserate with
youngsters who have had their own ugly encounters with the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would happen to me,'' said White, whose
prominent role in a hit Broadway show (not to mention the fact that
he was perfectly innocent) was not enough to protect him from being
arrested, handcuffed, hauled away, strip-searched and held for
several hours at the 33rd Precinct station house last July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The police were looking for armed drug dealers and would later
say that White and three other innocent men were arrested because
they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. White
disagrees, pointing out that he was seized in the lobby of the
building in which he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was I supposed to be?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance Tuesday at Rice High School was a gesture of
support by White for students who are clean-cut, diligent,
well-behaved _ and frequently harassed by the police. School
officials said there have been dozens of encounters with the police
in which youngsters who have done nothing wrong have been detained,
frisked, handcuffed and otherwise abused.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are school officials immune. In a story about this problem
that ran in March, The New York Times' Kit Roane wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Administrators said that Brother Tyrone Davis, who teaches
business law at the school and is the executive director of the
archdiocese's office of black ministry, has grown so tired of being
stopped by the police that he now rarely leaves work without
donning his religious collar. Others, like McBean (Damarr McBean, a
15-year-old honors student) say they just try to stay indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   The encounters can be tragic. Leroy Jermaine Grant, a Rice
graduate, was one of three young men shot and wounded by state
troopers during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is an all-boys school and the only Catholic high school in
Harlem. The problems faced by its students are the same problems
faced by so many black and Latino kids _ and adults _ throughout
the city and the nation. We are not talking about criminals here.
We are talking about only those who behave themselves and obey the
law. We are talking about solid citizens who are irresponsibly
targeted and cruelly mistreated by the police, largely because they
are black or Latino.
</P>
<P>
   This systematic outrage continues because not enough responsible
adults _ black or white _ have been willing to step forward and
declare that it must cease.
</P>
<P>
   During his appearance at Rice, White described how, with his
neighbors looking on, he was made to kneel in the vestibule of his
building with his hands cuffed behind his back. He was told by the
police to ``face the wall'' and keep his mouth shut. He was not
allowed to ask any questions or to assert his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gotten irate I could have been killed,'' he said.
``It was beyond humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   As he knelt on the cold tile floor, he said, he realized that in
the eyes of the police he was not a good guy, a decent and honest
man, a star in a hit show. None of that. He was a complete nobody,
just another black man with no rights and no claim to respectful
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm dealing with now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White said he was filing the lawsuit and speaking out publicly
because he wants to call as much attention to the problem of police
misconduct as he can. ``I am an artist, not an activist,'' he said.
But he was so shocked and so devastated by his arrest and
incarceration that he felt that he could no longer remain silent.

<P>
   ``This is happening,'' he said, ``right now, to someone who has
no voice. People are tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal of Rice High, Orlando Gober, agreed. ``We have
several young men sitting right here who have been stopped by the
police in the past several months,'' he said. He added that those
youngsters felt as White did when he was arrested _ humiliated and
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a reality,'' said Gober. ``A very sad, sick reality. But
it is reality nonetheless.''

POLICE BREAK UP ANIT-MILOSEVIC DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Riot police swinging batons broke up a
peaceful demonstration on Wednesday night, preventing some 20,000
demonstrators from marching to the suburb where President Slobodan
Milosevic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 people were injured, including at least five reporters,
cameramen and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to break up the march was a clear departure from
police tactics since daily demonstrations began Sept. 21. While the
police action is likely to swell what has been a disappointing
number of daily demonstrators, it also seemed intended to advertise
and underline Milosevic's determination to use force to hold on to
his job.
</P>
<P>
   During the last major demonstrations in the winter of 1996-97,
which lasted 88 days, police were careful not to confront marchers.
Clearly, Milosevic wants no repetition of that three-month
embarrassment, which ended when he accepted opposition victories in
local elections and fired the police and television chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Alliance for Change said on Wednesday night that
although they wanted to test the police, they did not want
violence. They said the purpose of the march was designed to draw
more people to these nightly rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we're playing with dangerous stuff,'' said Milan
Protic, one of the Alliance leaders, before the police charged. But
in speeches after the march, before a thin and shaken crowd in
Belgrade's Square of the Republic, Protic and Zoran Djindjic,
leader of the Democratic Party, appealed to demonstrators not to
confront the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marathon,'' Djindjic said. ``I beg of you to be more
wise than they are.'' But he also noted with glee: ``The regime
showed that they are more scared of us than we thought an hour
ago.'' And he announced that demonstrators would make the same
march again on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a tense standoff between demonstrators and police
blocking Kneza Milosa Street, in front of the Defense Ministry
building still blasted from NATO bombs. Opposition leaders, after
talking to the police, urged their followers to turn up another
route.
</P>
<P>
   But the marchers did not follow them, so the leaders returned to
sit in front of police lines, to prevent a confrontation and urged
protesters to sit. After about 20 minutes, 75 riot police then
marched down Nemanjina Street and started to drive the marchers
back with their shields and batons.
</P>
<P>
   A Djindjic bodyguard, Vlada, was badly beaten on the head, and
with an eye swollen shut, said on Wednesday night of Milosevic:
``It won't be that easy to make him leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's clash, leaders of the divided political
opposition to Milosevic moved to make another effort to create a
common front around the issue of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly rallies, the
leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly seeking a
rapprochement with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest opposition
party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former central banker who is their choice for prime minister in
any transitional government. Avramovic believes, he said in an
interview, that Milosevic can easily ignore a divided opposition,
and that the turnouts thus far have been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties will
attend a ``round table'' on necessary conditions for free and fair
elections. If the round table succeeds, then Draskovic says he will
throw his support to rallies intended to press for early elections,
as the best and only effective way to oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance has been insistent that Milosevic must resign
first, if there would be any chance of fair elections. But their
campaign thus far shows no sign of bringing about any resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join these rallies, calling them
``pointless'' and ``a waste of time.'' He has not lent them his
party's organizational skills or helped publicize them on the
Belgrade city television station he controls, Studio B.
</P>
<P>
   But Studio B covered Wednesday night's clashes, and the violence
will add pressure on Draskovic, once known for his fiery boldness
in earlier demonstrations, to join these.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For 50 years, ever since the Chinese Communist Party
came to power, a portrait of Mao has loomed over Tiananmen Square
in the heart of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To the countless millions who have passed under Mao's gaze, the
portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged, sturdy as
a piece of Communist architecture, no matter how drastically China
itself was being transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, so much about Chinese officialdom was kept
secret that even the circumstances surrounding the nation's most
prominent painting were considered off-limits to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a harmless step away from the zip-lipped past, Wang
Qizhi can openly admit that he painted Mao's portrait for 27 years.
Damage from sunlight and smog requires the Tiananmen portrait to be
replaced twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Chinese in the early years of the People's
Republic, Wang labored behind the scenes like an industrious ant,
following orders, suppressing all urge to show any individuality
and keeping his mouth shut about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was performing an important task for the good of the
country,'' said Wang, a slender, white-haired retiree of 72.
``There was no question about what I thought personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wang had pangs of pride when he rode through Tiananmen
Square on his bicycle and glanced up to see his painting at the
crown of the majestic Gate of Heavenly Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few of his acquaintances knew what he did, because anything
to do with Mao or his image was so politically sensitive that he
was ordered not to talk about his job. So Wang insists that his
personal achievement was always subsumed by a sense of the
burdensome importance of his daily task.
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary of Communist rule approaches on Oct. 1
and many marvel at the vast changes _ for better and worse _ that
China has experienced in a tumultuous half-century, people like
Wang express appreciation for something that has not changed, but
offers a least a thread of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese, Mao's portrait is an important political symbol
that reflects the strength and independence that China gained in
1949, even if it also embodies the nationalist pride that allowed
China to fall into a leftist frenzy in subsequent decades with
terrible damage to the nation's economic, social and political
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Mao may have so single-mindedly pursued his vision of an
egalitarian state _ and personal political power _ that he did not
seem to care how many millions died or were displaced in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even today, many more Chinese seem to admire Mao than to
hate him. A remarkably large number are nostalgic for what they
remember as the idealism and collective fervor of his era, despite
the poverty they endured at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has no equivocation; he is a diehard Mao fan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let us say a bad word about Mao in the house,'' said
Wang's son, Wang Yan, who is a painter himself. ``We have to go
outside if we want to curse Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   The son does indeed curse Mao outside, seeing the political
trauma of that era, which ended with Mao's death in 1976, as
unnecessarily damaging many of China's finest traditions, like
painting, the family avocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint in the traditional Chinese style, like my father and
my grandfather,'' he said. ``In Mao's era, traditional painting was
criticized and banned. How can that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many painters, writers and academics were attacked by the far
left during the 1960s, when radical politics engulfed Beijing. But
Wang Qizhi was protected by the authorities because there was
suddenly so much demand for his work, since Mao's portrait was
plastered all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Every major workplace in Beijing wanted its own original, and
they had to be painted by Wang or the one other man officially
approved to produce portraits of the Great Helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things were really busy, he would paint the bottom half
and I would paint the top,'' Wang said. ``We put a scaffolding
across the middle. The wart on Mao's chin marked the halfway
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, after Wang had already been painting Mao portraits for
15 years, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that
the portrait be changed, apparently under pressure from radical Red
Guards who objected that the partial side view of Mao showed only
one of his ears, suggesting that he was listening to only one
political faction.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it may sound funny that members of an intensely
intolerant group insisted that their leader be portrayed as
even-eared. But the portrait that was adopted that year remains the
version that has hung in Tiananmen Square for more than 30 years
and is still there today.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was deeply upset in 1989, though he was retired by
then, when three men in the Tiananmen protest movement splashed
paint on Mao's portrait, a move denounced by most student
protesters at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defacing the portrait is a crime,'' Wang said gravely. ``They
should have received the harshest punishment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the record, the three men _ a bus company employee, a
journalist and a schoolteacher, all from Mao's home province of
Hunan _ were sentenced to prison terms of 16 years, 20 years and
life, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be overlooked, Wang pointed out that the task of
painting a 20-foot-high portrait is not easy. The painter must
constantly be stepping back far enough to take a look, and with
such a huge portrait, Wang had to step back 100 feet. So he was
constantly climbing and descending a scaffolding, for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as China itself takes a step back to look at itself
after 50 years, it may be hard to get a clear perspective or focus
on a nation in the middle of wrenching change from a Communist
system to a new, ill-defined one. As confusing as the outlook may
be, Wang points out that material life is far more comfortable,
just as painting the Mao portrait is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's easy,'' Wang said. ``They have this big automatic
contraption that moves up and down. Not in my day. We had it much
harder.''

BISHOP CREDITED WITH CURBING VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR'S SECOND CITY

   BAUCAU, East Timor _ Unexpectedly from around the corner, a
group of smiling teen-age girls appeared Wednesday afternoon,
singing a United Nations song: ``Brothers and sisters of East
Timor, it's time to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, here in East Timor's second city, people were
shopping at a small outdoor market. Power and water were operating
normally. In the lovely Portuguese-built center of town, only one
building had been burned.
</P>
<P>
   This is the East Timor that could have been, if armed men had
not rampaged through the territory this month looting, burning and
depopulating almost every town and village.
</P>
<P>
   With desolation the norm throughout East Timor, there is an
unreal, ``through the looking glass'' feel to Baucau.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with other cities was heightened Wednesday when
soldiers in the capital, Dili, discovered nine charred bodies in
the back of a pickup truck in a junkyard on the western outskirts.
Military officers said additional bodies had been lying in the
surrounding bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no initial information on who they were or who
had killed them, the nine bodies, lying in a grotesque tangle in
the small white truck, were evidence of what is apparently the
largest-scale atrocity discovered to date from the recent weeks of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the man who appears to have saved Baucau from
destruction, the Roman Catholic bishop, Basilio do Nascimento,
slipped off his sandals as he received visitors in his cool
hillside residence. His electric clock ticked quietly on the wall,
and the smell of cooking floated from his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Such comfort and normalcy contrasted with the fate of his fellow
bishop, Carlos Belo, the winner of the Nobel Prize for peace in
1996, whose residence in Dili was burned and who was forced to flee
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, do Nascimento said, with Dili a charred
ruin 80 miles to the west, Baucau, a city of 27,000, could become
the temporary capital of the emerging new nation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   His visitors Wednesday included representatives of the United
Nations, which has just opened an office in Baucau _ with an
initial staff of eight _ its first in East Timor outside Dili.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the representatives, Nicholas Birnback, said he was
stunned to hear the teen-aged girls singing the U.N. song, a sign
that at least some of the optimism that had flourished before this
month of terror was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The song was written to advertise the Aug. 30 referendum in
which nearly 80 percent of the people of East Timor voted for
independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is preparing to run a transitional
administration for two to three years in East Timor if the
Indonesian Parliament endorses the independence vote, as expected,
in October.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, whose strong baritone amplifies his soft words,
professed to be puzzled that Baucau escaped other towns' fate.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody else here seemed to have any doubt. For months before
the referendum, the bishop held weekly consultations that included
representatives of the militia, of the military, of
pro-independence forces and of the local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we tried to do something in this sense,'' the bishop
said. ``There was very good cooperation among all of us, it is
true. There was a great deal of goodwill among all of these people.
If we collaborated to preserve Baucau from all this catastrophe, I
am very glad.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the city was entirely spared. In the
outer sector known as New Baucau, he said, about 50 buildings were
burned, only two of them private residences. As in other cities
government buildings were burned and the main marketplace was razed
along with many surrounding shops.
</P>
<P>
   And as in other cities, the militias terrorized many residents
into fleeing into the hills. But the residents are returning now in
large numbers and this is perhaps the only place in East Timor
where people feel safe enough to stroll the streets in the cool
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop seemed to confirm a report here that he had paid off
the departing Indonesian military not to destroy the power station,
as it did when it pulled out of many other towns. ``Before their
departure, they sold us oil,'' he said. ``We bought some oil from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an embryonic sign that the East Timorese are beginning to
assert control over their land for the first time in centuries,
motor bikes could be seen in town with riders carrying two-way
radios _ a step towards filling a security vacuum left by the
withdrawing Indonesian military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem at this moment is concerning authority,'' the
bishop said. ``We have no power and we have no control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bishop suggested to his U.N. visitors Wednesday that they
coordinate their police activities with the men on the motorcycles
_ representatives of the pro-independence forces that will form the
core of a future East Timorese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem at this moment is concerning authority,'' he
said. ``We have no power and we have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   But like so much else in a newly free East Timor _ like the
burned and flattened homes that can be seen all along the road from
Dili to Baucau _ the country's laws and system of justice will have
to be constructed from the bare foundations.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official, Alan Castle, who was visiting Wednesday to put
the first four unarmed foreign police officers in place, said the
four U.N. officers, all from the Philippines, would be empowered to
carry out the full range of law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem they will run into is what laws apply,'' he
said. ``Yes, you can hold someone in custody. But don't ask me
under what real power. And don't ask me where they would hold
them.''

OFFICIALS URGE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO DO MORE TO TOUT GLOBAL
TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that critics of the World Trade
Organization have taken over the debate and may eventually take
over the streets, political leaders in Seattle and Washington,
D.C., are expressing growing consternation that the Clinton
administration isn't doing an adequate job defending global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic officials in Washington state, including Sen.
Patty Murray, King County Executive Ron Sims and Rep. Adam Smith,
are critical of the administration for allegedly failing to reach
out to Democratic allies in the environmental and labor movements
who are critical of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Senate hearing Wednesday to discuss preparations for
the World Trade Organization meeting that begins in Seattle Nov.
30, several top administration officials and senators agreed that
U.S. public opinion has turned against unfettered global trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank with you, this has not been an easy sell,'' said
Commerce Secretary William Daley. ``Many people see only layoffs.
They don't see the payoffs of this open trading system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials promise high-ranking Cabinet
members will visit Seattle soon to outline the case in favor of
global trade. They boast that, at the insistence of the United
States, the WTO has agreed to devote the day before the ministerial
meeting in Seattle to listening to the concerns of critics. They
also promise that President Clinton will speak out in defense of
free trade, and even yesterday Clinton spoke briefly about his
plans for Seattle, saying that he hopes to use the WTO meeting ``to
raise working conditions for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington state Democrats, who generally are in lockstep
with the Clinton administration on trade policy, say they have two
sets of concerns: that the mainstream environmental and labor
groups planning peaceful protests are raising legitimate criticisms
that are not getting adequate attention from the administration,
and that the more radicalized protesters planning disruptive
activities will sully Seattle's reputation in the eyes of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The handwringing from Seattle began two months ago, when Murray
called on Clinton to meet with labor, environmental and consumer
groups in an effort to ``lessen the chance of disruptive
confrontations.'' In a letter to the Clinton, Murray expressed
``deep concern'' about the planned protests, warned that Seattle
companies are wary of supporting the WTO because of fear of
repercussions, and told the president ``a public defense from you
is warranted and necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Murray said her concerns have eased
since August, but she remains concerned that disruptive protests
could harm Seattle's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor community is going to have a demonstration, and
that's great, the environmentalists will do the same, and that's a
good way to express opinion, but what I don't want the outside
world to see is burning of cars or something that presents the
wrong image,'' she said. ``I am worried that extreme outside groups
may come in and give a flavor that isn't reflective of who we are
to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Ron Sims, who serves on advisory panel to the
U.S. Trade Representative's office, said he has been holding a
series of meetings with White House officials in recent weeks
demanding more attention to the concerns of WTO critics. Many of
the critics argue that the organization is inattentive to
environmental and labor concerns, and that the United States is
surrendering its values in order to open markets for multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just global discussions, they're local
discussions,'' Sims said. ``What are they going to do to engage
labor and environmentalists more fully than they have? Who's going
to do it, and when are they going to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sims called on protesters not to interfere with the WTO
proceedings, saying that many of the rules to be negotiated are
important to Seattle-area companies. But he said the trade
ministers also need to heed the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues of human rights should not be ignored,'' he said.
``The issue of what's happening to the environment, and our demand
that other countries not denude their forests, those are legitimate
issues. You can't ignore them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Smith yesterday met with other centrist Democrats to begin
planning for what he said will be a meeting with U.S. trade
officials to seek greater attention to the concerns of WTO critics.
Smith last year refused to back the Clinton administration on a key
trade vote, saying that labor and environmental concerns were not
adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Murray and Sims, Smith said he welcomed ``a lively
debate,'' saying ``it would be bad if everybody just showed up and
said trade is great so let's have a week-long cheerleading
exhibition.'' But he said he worries that the administration is not
adequately separating isolationists, who he thinks are not helpful
to the debate, from those who support global trade but have
concerns about the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. trade representative could be doing a much better job
at listening and trying to understand what some of the protests are
about,'' Smith said. ``Yes, some of these people (protesters) are
just off the map and want to go back to the 6th century, but the
bulk of them have legitimate concerns that the U.S. trade
representative would be well served doing a better job of
addressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern got unusual support at Wednesday's Senate hearing.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said ``out there amongst the
average people there is a tremendous distrust and fear and negative
feeling'' about global trade, while Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., said, ``We have lost the support for trade liberalization
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., called
for a stronger defense of free trade, saying, ``Protectionism is
once again on the rise in both political parties. ... If there ever
was a time to call those who believe in free markets to the
ramparts, now is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky defended the WTO,
saying that it ``has fully proven its value to Americans and to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also took steps to address concerns, announcing that
representatives of many organizations will be allowed to speak
directly to the trade ministers the day before the formal meeting
opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking for ways to deliver the message ourselves,
and to help other people deliver the message as well,'' said
Barshefsky's spokesman, Tom Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands that it's important to make the
connections for people about what trade means to them every day,''
Tripp said. ``Those messages can and will be delivered by the
president and his administration, but they also need to be
delivered at every level of the economy, right down to the shop
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefky's office also employs a full-time liaison to
non-governmental organizations, such as labor and environmental
groups, and a top labor movement official acknowledged that the
Clinton administration is attentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has been responsive to labor
concerns ... but we face enormous obstacles at the WTO in making
progress with worker rights issues,'' said Thea Lee, assistant
director of public policy for the AFL-CIO. ``Are we making enough
forward progress? No, and our prospects for making progress in
Seattle are dim.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local officials are unfazed by the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my view are a little bit overreacting to this,''
said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I lived through the Vietnam era,
so I don't get panicked when people say they're going to make their
wishes known.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., is also not particularly worried
about the protesters, and suggested the news media should do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hope the local media doesn't spend all its time
talking about protests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn also said that in a meeting last week with top
officials of The Boeing Co., she urged the company to do more to
communicate with its employees about the value of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell says he plans to welcome the
protesters, saying ``that's the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get people to see the positive side of this
debate,'' he said. ``Being the center of ideas only enriches our
lives.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul II: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans, desperate for money to
finance their spending bills without raiding Social Security funds,
Wednesday devised a plan that relies almost entirely on delaying
billions of dollars in federal tax credits for millions of
working-class families.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was immediately questioned by Democrats and some
Republicans, who called it an accounting gimmick that could hurt
people on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Frank Salizzoni,
the chief executive of H&AMP;R Block Inc., said it could cause
confusion and disrupt the personal lives of hard-working American
families.''
</P>
<P>
   A chart detailing the plan, obtained from a senior House
Republican leader, shows Congress on course to spend $7.6 billion
in surplus contributions to Social Security to run the government
in the 2000 fiscal year, which begins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But because under the new plan about $8 billion would not be
spent in the 2000 year, the Republicans' calculations show $400
million in black ink, rather than a $7.6 billion dip into Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   But the figure could be higher. The Congressional Budget Office
released new figures Wednesday night estimating that Republicans
were actually on course to spend $17.9 billion out of the Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republican leaders, who have vowed daily, and
fervently, that they will not spend the funds, stood together
Wednesday under a banner reading ``Stop Robbing Social Security''
and unveiled a new campaign of television commercials renewing
their pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' own calculations show that the only way
they can avoid raiding Social Security is to distribute the
politically popular earned-income tax credit payment in 12 monthly
payments next year, rather than paying it in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, payments for October,
November and December 2000 would be counted against the 2001
budget, according to John Feehery, spokesman for Speaker Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   So the plan actually saves no money, but instead uses an
accounting device that allows three months of the tax-credit
payments to be counted in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Feehery said delaying the payments would hurt no one and help
the government weed out waste, fraud and abuse'' that he said was
rampant in the earned-income tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old tax credit payment program was designed to be an
incentive to keep people working and paying taxes. About 20 million
Americans in households earning from $10,200 to $30,580 are
eligible for the credit. They received $28.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The average family received $1,890 in a single annual payment,
allowing some to pay off debts, make a down payment on a car or pay
tuition. Under the Republican plan, that same family would receive,
instead, a check for $157.50 a month, a sum better suited for
buying groceries or paying utility bills.

CITY ACCUSES BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF CONSPIRING TO PROMOTE PRIVATE
COLLECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new line of attack in the city's vehement
opposition to a controversial art exhibition, senior City Hall
officials on Wednesday accused the Brooklyn Museum of Art of
conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value of the
artwork in the show, all of which is privately owned by the British
advertising executive Charles Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials vowed to file a lawsuit in State
Supreme Court seeking to seize control of the museum by contending
that it had violated its lease with the city in part by misusing a
public institution to promote a private collection.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would not try to block the exhibition from
opening on Saturday and were instead preparing for a tough legal
battle. On Tuesday, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to cut off the museum's city financing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Joseph
J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, accused the museum of ``hucksterism'' and
of perpetrating a ``scam'' by conspiring with Christie's auction
house, which is a sponsor of the exhibition, to enrich Saatchi by
inflating the value of his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   In making the allegations of conspiracy, officials capitalized
on news reports that noted the awkward role of Christie's, which is
a promoter and financial supporter of the exhibition as well as a
purveyor of artwork belonging to Saatchi, who is a major collector
and an important client. Christie's also supported an installation
of the show at the Royal Academy in London.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts of interest, some museums do not exhibit
private collections unless they have been promised to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scam and taxpayers dollars should not be used to
support that,'' Hess said at Wednesday's news conference.
``Taxpayers' dollars should be used for educating children, for
building roads, for supporting the homeless, not for pushing up the
value of a private art collection.'' He added, ``We'll bring all of
this out in court. We are going to do some aggressive discovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Christie's quickly rejected the allegations as a
desperate and feeble attempt by the mayor to quash the museum show,
which Giuliani has called ``disgusting'' and offensive to Catholics
because it includes a painting of the Virgin Mary surrounded by
elephant dung and pornographic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani away on a three-day political trip to the West
Coast, officials at City Hall were clearly seeking to retake the
offensive in the museum dispute. The Giuliani administration had
been on the defensive since late Tuesday when the museum abandoned
its efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations with City
Hall and announced the show would go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that every day, the city comes up with a new
pretextual claim,'' said Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who is
representing the museum in its suit against the city. ``Now they
have come up with another argument. Each and every one of them is
nothing more or less than further pretext in an effort to punish
the museum for the exercise of its First Amendment rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, which was said to have given less than $50,000 to
the show, also rejected the conspiracy charges. ``We are aware of
these bewildering accusations,'' the auction house said in a
prepared statement. ``They have absolutely no substance, are not
true. Christie's has a long history of sponsorships of exhibitions
in the United States and internationally. Nothing in this
exhibition is for sale nor is their any expectation for any of the
works from the exhibition to be sold by Christie's.'' The statement
was followed by a long list of shows that the auction house has
supported.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the museum, through a spokesman, issued a statement calling
the accusations ``preposterous and misleading.'' It said, ``The
Mayor's latest charge simply reflects the depths to which he will
go to undermine the First Amendment.'' The spokesman, Fred
Schroeder, said Christie's financial contribution to the show
represented a small fraction of its total cost. &QL;

SOLIDARITY COMES FULL CIRCLE AS ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS GROW

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul 11: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.

REGULATORS SMILE ON BELL ATLANTIC'S LONG-DISTANCE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, La., S.C., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, workers dispatched by Bell Atlantic
Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone company, began
unloading 30 boxes of documents from trucks outside the Washington
offices of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes contained three copies of Bell Atlantic's application
to sell long-distance communications services to consumers and
businesses in New York state. If the petition is granted, Bell
Atlantic will become the first regional Bell admitted to the $80
billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its physical heft, Bell Atlantic's application was
matched in significance by a statement of merely four sentences
issued a few hours later by Maureen Helmer, chairwoman of the New
York Public Service Commission, which is highly regarded at the FCC
and which has been jawboning Bell Atlantic to open its local
network for years.
</P>
<P>
   All but formally endorsing Bell Atlantic's long-distance
aspirations, Ms. Helmer insured that Bell Atlantic's rivals, which
will try to convince the FCC to reject the application, have a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that Bell Atlantic's progress in meeting the
terms of the 271 checklist has reached the point of a filing with
the FCC,'' her statement read, referring to the section of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 that details the steps that a Bell
company must take before entering the long-distance market. ``The
cooperation of all the parties during the course of this review has
facilitated a tremendous amount of progress by the company in
opening its local market to competition. If the filing is
consistent with the terms and conditions that we have established,
and the record we have developed over the past 2{ years, I am
optimistic that I could offer my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Helmer was under no obligation to share her optimism
Wednesday; the New York PSC will not make its formal comments to
the FCC for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks leading up to Bell Atlantic's application
Wednesday, many communications experts said that the FCC was likely
to follow the guidance of the New York regulators _ or at least
give New York's recommendation far more weight than it had lent to
earlier long-distance endorsements for other regional Bells from
regulators in other states. Applications in some states _ including
Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma _ were rejected, with people
close to the FCC saying that the commission had not been convinced
of the rigor and independence of the regulators in those states.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, FCC Chairman William Kennard was positively glowing
Wednesday in his praise of the New York PSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the New York Public Service Commission for its work
on Bell Atlantic's application to enter the long distance market,''
he said in a statement. ``The dedication and expertise displayed by
New York's Public Service Commission and its staff are truly
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's regard for the New York regulators may be enhanced by
the fact that his chief of staff, Kathryn Brown, spent three years
as director of the New York PSC's consumer services division.
</P>
<P>
   So at this point the tea leaves indicate that the application
will be approved. That still does not necessarily mean Bell
Atlantic is set to define the One True Path for other Bells to
reach their long-distance nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, SBC Communications Inc. is scheduled to receive
results of a test of the openness of its network Friday, with the
next meeting of the state's regulatory commission to discuss SBC's
long-distance plans set for Oct. 21. If SBC is lucky _ and good _
it will be able to apply to the FCC for permission in Texas soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But the way SBC has opened its network in Texas is in some
technical aspects quite different from Bell Atlantic's model.
Because of the high concentration of lucrative business customers
in New York, especially in Manhattan, many competitive local phone
companies in New York City have found it economical to assemble
relatively extensive networks of their own and to buy access to
Bell Atlantic's systems piecemeal. In working with the state's
regulators, Bell Atlantic has spent a lot of time and effort
developing the capacity to sell access to many discrete parts of
its network.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive local carriers in Texas, on the other hand, appear
to have more appetite for bigger chunks of SBC's network, perhaps
putting more focus on less lucrative residential customers because
the Texas business market is not quite as attractive as that of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``SBC is following a different model and also has a pretty good
chance of getting in on a slightly later time track,'' said former
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who is now a consultant for McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is whether or not both of them are
accepted,'' he said. ``If they are, the country will see two
different models and different states will go with different
models.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To many telecommunications analysts and executives, Bell
Atlantic's model seems to require more work on the part of the
incumbent. That is why executives at other regional Bells have been
heard to complain that Bell Atlantic has been too conciliatory,
perhaps setting a bar too high for the other Bell companies to
hurdle easily.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has every reason to be more conciliatory because
it has already lost so much corporate business in big metropolitan
markets to upstarts. It is not a new pattern. In 1990, for
instance, Nynex _ later acquired by Bell Atlantic _ became the
first Bell to set aside space within its switching centers for
competitors to place their own equipment. The other Bells howled
that Nynex was making them look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would say that's being conciliatory,'' said Ivan
Seidenberg, who was chairman of Nynex before becoming chairman of
Bell Atlantic. ``I would say we're the first company that faces
competition in the industry every time. And I can go ahead and say
we have been right every time because everybody has followed suit
sooner or later, though they tend to do it kicking and scratching
because it's convenient to say, `New York made us do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to trade some things to get access to larger
markets, I think that's the right trade-off,'' Seidenberg added.
``While I could get excited about the word conciliatory, I might
want to replace that with savvy and strategic.''

CANADA STARTS TO TAKE HARD LINE AGAINST ILLEGAL CHINESE
IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HARDY, British Columbia _ When the Canadian navy made a
group of undocumented Chinese migrants get off a ship here
recently, a local man brought his dogs to the dock and encouraged
them to bark at the men and women wrapped in blankets against the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   For Canadian officials, the confrontation represented one
victory in what they say is a rapidly growing effort to smuggle in
illegal immigrants. This summer alone, they confiscated four
trawlers and detained 560 undocumented Chinese citizens who wanted
to make Canada their home.
</P>
<P>
   Western Canada is only one destination in a pan-Pacific surge
this year in illegal Chinese migrants. In the last 16 months, U.S.
Coast Guard ships have intercepted 20 ships carrying undocumented
Chinese in U.S. territorial waters around Guam. In the last six
months, Australia has intercepted 21 boatloads of illegal migrants,
primarily Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now experiencing the largest smuggling operation ever
experienced in Canada,'' Rob Johnston, manager of immigration
enforcement here, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weeks, an Australian diplomat in Ottawa, said of Canada's
sudden concern: ``It's deja vu. The element of the public debate
and concern is very similar to Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australia, the United States and Canada increasingly share
intelligence about vessels believed to be carrying migrants from
southeastern China, Canada has started to take the harder line
traditional in the other two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Chinese ship was intercepted, on July 20, the
authorities in Vancouver released 74 immigrants, pending resolution
of their petitions for refugee status. Within a month, half had
disappeared, presumably for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Canada has adopted a policy of detaining all
undocumented passengers on vessels from China. Sentiment for
immediately deporting them is markedly higher in western Canada
than in provinces on the Atlantic seaboard, opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's population is 20 percent ethnic Chinese, and many of
these Chinese-Canadians fear that each new boatload batters a
carefully constructed racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver is a very tolerant society,'' said Derick Y.H.
Cheng, chairman of the Chinese Cultural Center there. ``We fear
this will make a backlash, give people the stereotype that Chinese
do not abide by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Bill Vander Zalm has jumped back
into politics, starting his campaign for Parliament by saying that
the federal government would pay attention to the immigration issue
only if all the illegal Chinese immigrants detained in the region
were shipped to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure you would get some action then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers portray the boatloads of migrants, largely
from Fujian province, as job-seekers rather than freedom-seekers.
Not long ago, Elinor Caplan, Canada's new immigration minister,
toured a Vancouver Island navy base where 225 immigrants are
detained and said at a packed news conference: ``We are
intercepting, boarding and apprehending those ships. We are then
using greater powers of detention to insure people on the boat do
not flee. The system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials are also reaching across the Pacific, asking
Chinese authorities to help.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting
in New Zealand, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien discussed the
migration problem with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``I told him
we needed collaboration because they could hopefully stop the
departure of the ships from the coast of China that are coming to
our coast,'' Chretien said later. ``He recognized that, and said he
was willing to collaborate with us.''

JAPAN'S DISDAIN FOR FOREIGNERS SURFACES IN CRIME ANXIETIES

   TOKYO _ With a graph of its sales mirroring the path of lemmings
falling from a cliff, Japan's largest lockmaker, Miwa Co., settled
on a recent ad strategy that fanned Japanese fears of crime, and
spiced it with a foreign twist.
</P>
<P>
   The insecurity spreading through the society, the advertisements
announce, is due to Chinese ``theft gangs'' that maintain ``secret
bases'' in the country. ``The damage by foreign theft gangs is
increasing swiftly now,'' one ad reads in boldface. ``It is time to
invest in safety like those in America and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which brought a burst of interest in Miwa
locks, offers a window on a deep streak in Japanese society to look
askance at most things foreign, especially fellow Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials deny that their advertisements reflect any
racism. A spokesman said, moreover, what the police confirm: that
crime by foreigners in general, and that crime by Chinese in
particular, is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, what the advertisements do not say but the
police do is that over all the crime problem in Japan, a society
known for its safety, is considered to be well under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been expecting this kind of crime to come to Japan,
because the world is becoming borderless, and so crime is becoming
borderless too,'' said Yukio Akamatsu, the official responsible for
the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With foreigners making up less than 1 percent of the population,
Japan remains determinedly monoethnic and continuously on guard
against any ``corruption'' of its purity by fellow East Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and Koreans living in this country have long complained
that they have difficulty finding housing because of the prejudices
of Japanese landlords. Visa applications by Asians are said by many
to receive closer scrutiny than those of others, ostensibly for
fear of allowing a proliferation of aliens who outwardly resemble
Japanese. And in interviews, people here freely attribute problems
to the foreigners in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese experts on racial stereotypes say that whatever the
most recent police statistics indicate, a tendency to point a
finger at Chinese reflects a mixture of fear and contempt that has
been present since a failed Mongol invasion of Japan in the 15th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that since its collision with the West toward
the middle of the 19th century, Japan has used Westerners and
Asians as flip sides of the same coin of racial complexes,
struggling to ``catch up'' to the one while despising the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude to this is very complicated, and discussion is
kind of taboo,'' said Hiroyoshi Ishikawa, a professor at Seijo
University in Tokyo. ``The Japanese government had a very conscious
effort to copy the customs of Europeans first, and then
Americans,'' he added. ``And in the depths of their hearts, the
Japanese people have had some kind of contempt for the Chinese and
the Koreans. Since the end of the 19th century, the attitude has
been whites are superior, other Asians are inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese seem openly conscious of these attitudes, or seem
to have considered that airs of superiority and aloofness may have
helped lead Japan into its brutal colonial adventurism in Asia,
which ended disastrously in World War II. Few also seem to consider
the unfair impact of negative stereotypes of foreigners on the
lives of the Asians and other non-Westerners who live here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many illegal aliens are causing crimes, but the media reports
often say it is suspected that the culprits are Chinese, even when
the facts aren't known,'' said Chiu Xiong Yin, president of the
Tokyo Association of Chinese Residents. ``The media seems to be
influenced by discriminatory feelings toward Chinese people: they
take tiny incidents and blow them up into huge affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to live as a Chinese in Japan. We are so
tired of these things, but we try not to make our anger public.''

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ind.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 121 of the 515 deaths, the study found, a parent, sibling, or
other adult sleeping in the bed had inadvertently smothered the
child. More than three-quarters of the children who died from
``overlying'' were younger than 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, say the study's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report. Death certificates, he said, also may be
misleading: In some regions, coroners may be more likely to
attribute the death of an infant from a poor family to
``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher income
families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at Notre Dame
University, has done studies indicating that infants who sleep with
their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

NICKLAUS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would like to personally thank the people of Boston and 12
talented American golfers for giving us the most exciting Ryder Cup
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final-round TV-ratings were the highest in Cup history
and we owe it all to you.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many special moments.
</P>
<P>
   Like when a fan spat in the face of European captain Mark James'
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Like that little spike-shoed clog-dance the American players so
thoughtfully performed in the line of Jose Maria Olazabal's
potentially Cup-winning putt on the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   Or the cheering when the Europeans hit a bad shot or missed a
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Or heckling Colin Montgomerie so mercilessly that his father
couldn't stand it anymore and walked back to the clubhouse after 7
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Or steering Andrew Coltart in the wrong direction when he was
looking for his ball in the rough and suddenly ``finding'' it 30
seconds after he had to take a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to win, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, these are some of our bitterest enemies, these Brits,
Swedes and Spaniards. Wasn't it Ireland that was responsible for
stealing our nuclear-weapons secrets a while back? No, wait. That
was China. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Now the British tabloids are whining that we're a bunch of bad
sports.
</P>
<P>
   United Slobs of America they're calling us. James doesn't want
to play over here anymore. Montgomerie's having second thoughts,
too.
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch of babies, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it's not like Tom Lehman bashed a folding chair over
Olazabal's head or bowled him over with a flying drop-kick just as
he drew back his putter.(Though that might have been necessary if
Justin Leonard hadn't made that long putt seconds before.)
</P>
<P>
   All the American team did was ``modify'' the line of Ollie's
putt a little, sort of the way the Department of Transportation
modifies the surface of interstates before repaving.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he would have been happier if we had set out some orange
construction cones or some detour signs.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy har har.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys I was watching the Ryder Cup with Sunday
afternoon _ a person who clearly fails to appreciate how ``edgy''
golf has become _ said that if Jack Nicklaus had been in that
situation Sunday afternoon and seen the American team turn
Olazabal's line into a cattle trail, he would have given the
Spaniard his putt, all 30-feet of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, Ollie. Pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   My team, in its exuberance, thoughtlessly breeched a fundamental
tenet of golfing etiquette. I will not allow you to suffer for it,
even if it means losing the Ryder Cup. The game is not played that
way, and the game is more important than some cheesy trophy.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that Nicklaus, the greatest and fiercest
competitor in the history of golf, would have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't know is how some U.S. fans might have reacted to
Nicklaus' demonstration of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But I bet Mark James' wife has a clue.

BRADLEY SEEKS TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE HEALTH CARE A PRIORITY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's health care proposal
seeks to put the issue back on the national agenda after the
failure to pass universal health insurance in 1994 humiliated
President Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And while his Senate career was not marked by leadership on
health care, it was distinguished by spotlighting important,
complex and sometimes stupefyingly dull issues, from the debt of
developing countries to tax simplification. He made Washington pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Bradley argued insistently that having nearly
one-fifth of the population uninsured was an urgent national
problem and that it could not be solved on the cheap. His $65
billion-a-year plan, he said, involves ``a great deal of money.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, it is far from clear that it can be solved as cheaply
as Bradley proposed; subsidies of up to $1,800 a year may not get
all that many lower-wage earners insured. A Bradley aide
acknowledged on Wednesday that the sum was ``probably a little bit
low,'' adding, ``It gets people in the door, if not the parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan, and he said it was evolving, skirted two major rocks
that sank the Clinton program _ requiring employers to insure their
workers and an attempt to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling employers to insure their workers was central to the
president's plan, and stirred deadly opposition from small
business. Cost containment, a health-care problem beginning to
emerge again now after several quiet years, antagonized health-care
providers whose support the administration had counted on.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley plan is also an important political token _ both
much broader than anything Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's
opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, has advocated
and a venture into an area widely regarded, in the capital at
least, as political quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, it is not unlike the senator's position on gun
control, demanding registration of all handguns _ a step
conventionally considered politically unattainable, especially when
House Democrats recall that their anti-gun votes helped cost them
control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one argues that the administration's occasional
efforts to pass legislation to curb soft money and issue
advertisements have cost it political support, campaign finance is
another area where Bradley is now demanding more ``reform'' than
either the Clinton-Gore administration or any sizable faction in
Congress is now pushing.
</P>
<P>
   But his health-care proposal is more than another effort to
one-up the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an example of Bradley's promise to focus on a few
major issues in his campaign, and, he hopes, his presidency. That
was a style he showed in the Senate, where he sometimes buried
himself in a single subject for months.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that can work in a presidential campaign over the long
run, let alone in the White House, where problems are thrust upon
presidents, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short run, at least, his initiative was welcomed on
many fronts as an important attention-getting move.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Feder, a veteran of the Clinton effort who is now dean of
policy studies at Georgetown University, said, ``I think it's great
to hear an expression of support for a move toward universal
coverage, and a commitment particularly that all low-income people
ought to have full government support and a recognition that it
takes money to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, which brought the nation the ``Harry and Louise''
commercials against the Clinton plan, praised the proposal as
``realistic and thoughtful.'' But Kahn did say he feared that
details of the Bradley proposal would lead to ``expensive so-called
patient protection mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from a finished plan, and some very obvious
questions lead only to guesswork. (But the completeness of the
Clinton plan of 1993-94 seemed to present a new target with every
difficulty it anticipated.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the obvious questions is what would be the effect
of opening up the federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which
now insures nine million people from a stable, educated and
above-average-income work force, to any American who wanted to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be likely to draw in many people whose poor health is
a factor in their not being insured today, thereby making the
federal pool more expensive to insure? The Bradley aide said no one
could know, but it was just as possible that it would draw in more
young, healthy people and reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bradley sailed around the politically ruinous issue of
requiring employers to provide insurance, he could not put it over
the horizon. Most Americans now get their health insurance through
employers, but why should hard-pressed employers insure their
workers if the government will? Again, no one knows how many
employers might stop insuring their workers, but it could be enough
to have a serious impact on the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for supporters of universal care, if not necessarily of
the Clinton variety, the doubts were outweighed by just seeing
their issue on the front pages again.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Rowland, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation here, said, ``It really goes beyond some of the
incremental stuff we've been looking at.'' Ms. Rowland said Bradley
had acknowledged this problem ``needs to be addressed in a bigger
way than just hoping everyone will get insurance.''

OPPOSITION LEADERS SEEK TO CREATE A UNIFIED FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Leaders of the divided opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia are making another,
slightly desperate effort to create a common front around the issue
of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly anti-Milosevic
rallies, the leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly
seeking a reconciliation with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former head of the central bank who is their choice for prime
minister in any transitional government. Avramovic said in an
interview that Milosevic could too easily ignore a divided
opposition and that the protest turnouts had been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties are to
attend a conference on free and fair elections. If the round table
succeeds, Draskovic said, he will throw his support to rallies to
press for early elections as the best and only effective way to
oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has been insistent that Milosevic has to resign
first, if there is be a chance for fair elections. But their
campaign shows no sign of bringing about a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join the rallies, calling them
pointless and a waste of time. He has not lent them his party's
organizational skills or helped publicize them on Studio B, the
Belgrade city television station that he controls.
</P>
<P>
   So the alliance leaders, most notably Zoran Djindjic of the
Democratic Party, are convinced that Draskovic intended to see
these rallies fail altogether, perhaps destroying Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rallies did nearly fail. They began last Tuesday.
But by Thursday night, the turnout was so low and dispirited _
fewer than 5,000 people _ that Djindjic talked bitterly about
calling off the rallies or resigning.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief aide, Cedomir Jovanovic, a former student leader,
urged him to forget the speeches and give in to the crowd's desire
for action _ to march, rather than listen. The numbers shot back up
to 20,000 and then to 30,000 or more on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are dropping again, with 5,000 on a rainy
Tuesday night. Wednesday night, the alliance announced a march on
``the forbidden hill,'' the Dedinje district where Milosevic lives.
Alliance officials said this was again a response to a perceived
desire for more action.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said that they believed that they had
saved the rallies and themselves and that they were proud that
Draskovic still had them to deal with. But the main target,
Milosevic, remains remote.
</P>
<P>
   There is some nervousness evident from the government, with the
police in riot gear carefully hidden in case of incidents and a new
crackdown on the nonpayment of taxes, indications of the increasing
economic squeeze that the government faces.
</P>
<P>
   State television remains dismissive about the opposition as NATO
agents and puppets, and counterposters have appeared to mock
alliance posters. One alliance poster shows Djindjic with his child
on his back. The new poster shows President Clinton with Djindjic
on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Important alliance leaders do not really trust Avramovic, who
had made his own approach to Draskovic, though he did tell the
Alliance about that. They apparently believe that Avramovic has his
own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, who will be 80 in two weeks, scoffs at those
concerns. But he said the alliance was too narrow a base to carry
the day against the government, and he is trying, no matter their
concerns, to build a bigger coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The election conference will be run by Dragoljub Micunovic, the
leader of a small party and a friend of Avramovic, and all
opposition parties have agreed to attend. Micunovic said he
expected all the opposition members would ``realize that their
competitors are not in that room, but rather somewhere outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, if successful, will probably include demands for
elections on all levels; revised electoral districts; an open
press, especially television; a revised media law, and strict
supervision by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few ideological differences among the opposition
parties,'' Avramovic said. ``If the round table can agree, then for
the first time, the government will face a real united front. But
you have to have elections. Period. The question is how quickly and
under what conditions. And I hope Mr. Milosevic will see the point
and resign without a fight, for that would win him considerable
support here for not going to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior government official and an executive who had just
seen Milosevic said he was in no mood to resign or schedule early
elections. ``He's just taken 78 days of bombing by NATO,'' the
businessman said. ``Do you really think he's going to surrender to
Zoran Djindjic?''

IN ROME, ANCIENT RUINS STALL RAMP TO `GOD'S PARKING LOT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Workers building a ramp to a vast Vatican garage for
pilgrims recently stumbled on walls of an ancient Roman villa.
</P>
<P>
   Now work has halted on the ramp to ``God's parking lot,'' as it
is known locally, while Italy decides what is more important:
preserving remnants of Rome's imperial past, or building modern
amenities to insure a smooth pilgrims' progress for as many as 30
million visitors expected in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real test, a clash between modernity and the past,''
said Oreste Rutigliano, a spokesman for Italia Nostra, a
conservation association that is lobbying to close down the ramp
and resurrect the ruins. ``To permit modernity to win out would be
a terrible symbol for the jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments draw eye-rolls from some of the engineers and
city officials who have to get Rome and its roads ready by
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rome already has plenty of Roman walls, perhaps too
many,'' said Luigi Scavizzi, an engineer with Geosonda, the
construction company that is building the access ramp. ``This may
be a famous site to some, but to me it's just a bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Those bothersome walls date from about the first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Government archaeologists who are now gingerly sifting through
the site say they have not determined who built them, but already
some Italian archaeologists are saying it may have been a villa of
Agrippina, Caligula's sister and Nero's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though not remembered for her sweetness (among other things, she
is accused of poisoning several husbands, including Claudius),
Agrippina had a cheery taste in decor; the walls still show traces
of delicate floral patterns and songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to dig in Rome without stumbling on some
ancient artifact. Two weeks ago, archaeologists at a different site
found a second-century A.D. base of a statue, covered with reliefs
of Hercules, as well as pavement and walls that were once back of
the stage of the theater of Marcellus. In that case, however, the
discovery did not compete with new construction.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the walls discovered under the Janiculum Hill
next to the Vatican last month were the first archaeological find
that required tough choices since preparations for the year 2000
began.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are close to 700 construction sites snarling
traffic in Rome, and more than half are repairs undertaken
specifically for the jubilee celebrations of the Roman Catholic
Church. Holy Years, when the faithful are exhorted to make
pilgrimages to Rome, were introduced in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII,
and now take place every 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is a city haunted by the way previous generations
recklessly bulldozed through buried Greek columns and Roman villas
to modernize the capital. After World War II, construction crews
destroyed whole Roman neighborhoods to build subways and the train
station of Termini, which was inaugurated for the 1950 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   The country's feelings of guilt were most powerfully invoked in
a scene in Fellini's ``Roma'': subway workers digging underground
crash through a wall and stare silently as giant frescoes flake and
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Rome,'' said Emanuele Gatti, a classical archaeologist
who specializes in central Rome. ``We have found a lot. We have
destroyed a lot. And underground there is still an unquantifiable
amount of treasures to be discovered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rome is undergoing an extraordinary, $950 million make-over for
the year 2000, but some of its most ambitious plans have been
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   A highway underpass beneath Castel Sant'Angelo was scrapped
after environmental groups, urban planners and archaeologists
protested that the digging would damage the foundations of the
second-century mausoleum built by the Emperor Hadrian. Other
projects have hit different snags. Earlier this month, heavy rains
drove a gaping hole in a newly completed highway tunnel built under
the Appian Way.
</P>
<P>
   The underground parking lot, which is still being built to
accommodate 115 buses and 800 cars, is on Vatican territory near
St. Peter's, a $45 million project whose cost is being evenly
divided by the Italian government and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot is the Vatican's only major jubilee expense;
pilgrims will have to pay to book spaces at big public Masses and
major Holy Year events. The Italian government and the city of Rome
are paying for street repairs and restoration of historic
buildings, including churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not even have to pay to clean up St. Peter's.
The gleaming $5.4 million restored facade, which was unveiled on
Tuesday, was executed and paid for by ENI, the Italian energy
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The ramp is on state-owned land, and its fate falls under the
jurisdiction of the Culture Ministry, which must determine the
value of the find. A special committee is expected to decide soon
whether to stop building the ramp. Italia Nostra officials argue
that since the project envisions two ramps, the Vatican and Rome
can manage with only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have managed with one, we wouldn't have spent the
money to build two,'' Scavizzi retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Mocchegiani-Carpano, an archaeologist for the
government's Rome office of archaeology, said: ``This is not the
find of the century, but we would never destroy the ruins. If they
are of less importance, they could be moved, but such decisions
will be up to the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that option could significantly delay the completion of the
ramp. Officials responsible for readying the city are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the decision that is made,'' said Maurizio
Pucci, an official with the Rome Agency for the Preparation of the
Jubilee, which is coordinating year 2000 projects. ``But we are
awaiting it with trepidation.''

MARKET PLACE: STOCK FUND SALES LAG AS BROADER MARKET COOLS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Be careful what you ask for, the saying goes, because
you may get it.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors who ignored the indexing phenomenon in
hopes that their fund would eventually beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 are getting their wish, as the average U.S. diversified equity
fund appears poised to top the index for the second consecutive
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But that is little comfort to investors, who liked things a lot
better when the S&AMP;P 500 was beating most other funds and posting 20
percent-plus annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   With the S&AMP;P index down 7.3 percent since June 30, and now up
only 4.2 percent for the year, investors' impatience is showing:
fund sales, which were strong in the second quarter, have slacked
off considerably in the last two months as the broad stock market
has drifted lower.
</P>
<P>
   Investors put $9.2 billion into stock funds in August, down 25.7
percent from July sales of $12.4 billion, according to new figures
from the Investment Company Institute, and September has shaped up
about the same. Charles Biderman, president of Trimtabs.com
Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates total
September stock-fund sales of $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the stock market declined, but it has once again
begun to narrow. While small-capitalization and mid-capitalization
funds performed better than large-cap funds this quarter, the much
noted rotation from growth stocks to value stocks earlier this year
has abated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., large-cap growth funds lost an average
of 4.2 percent this quarter through Sept. 23, compared with an 8.3
percent drop for large-cap value funds. Mid-cap growth funds broke
even, but mid-cap value funds fell 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bigger value funds, Vanguard's $32 billion Windsor II,
which had managed decent returns in recent years even though its
value style was out of favor, has slumped 14.7 percent so far this
quarter, hurt by big holdings in financial stocks and Waste
Management Inc. Its sister value fund, Vanguard Windsor, which
soared in the spring, is down 11.1 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For many diversified mutual fund managers, who are on track to
post single-digit returns for the first time in several years, the
pressure is on to improve results in the fourth quarter. Overall,
the average U.S. diversified equity fund fell 5.7 percent in the
quarter through Sept. 23, according to Lipper Inc., compared with a
loss by the S&AMP;P 500-stock index of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That performance may be causing fund flows to narrow somewhat,
too. Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks
fund flows, estimates that 70 percent of fund sales in the first
three weeks of September went to technology funds and index funds,
which tend to draw a high proportion of money every month no matter
how they do against other funds because they are a mainstay of
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is tightly focused on these two sectors,'' said
Adler, who noted that technology funds were one of the few bright
spots this quarter, up an average of 6 percent through Sept. 23,
according to Lipper. (Gold funds have soared this week and will
also rank among the top funds for the quarter, which ends
Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Top-selling Vanguard said its stock funds have taken in $2.2
billion this month, up from $2 billion in August. The only fund
company with more assets under management, Fidelity Investments,
says its stock funds drew $500 million in September through Monday.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Top executives from three of the nation's top copper
companies secretly convened in a room at the Trump International
Hotel in Manhattan last Friday to try to resolve one of the
nastiest, most convoluted corporate takeover fights in recent
years. When they emerged more than two hours later, it was nastier
and more convoluted than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting brought together Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps
Dodge, the nation's largest copper producer, with the chief
executives of two competitors, Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals
Co., that had agreed last July to merge with each other. Yearley,
rather than see his smaller rivals join hands, had launched his own
$2.8 billion hostile offer to acquire both of them for Phelps
Dodge. Finally, after weeks of rebuffing Yearley, Francis
McAllister of Asarco and Milton Ward of Cyprus Amax had agreed to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley presented his best offer, he recalled. But he was not
willing to meet their demand _ $3.1 billion for the combination.
When the meeting broke up, Yearley was still determined to own both
companies and McAllister and Ward, eager to protect their
interests, quickly began a search for a white knight, adding yet
another player to the corporate chess game.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, a brawl in the copper industry was unthinkable.
Ailing economies in Asia and Latin America had left demand for
copper waning. Prices plummeted to a 12-year low then _ a paltry 63
cents a pound. Profits at copper mining companies tumbled, with
some companies forced to cut production to help arrest the price
slide. In fact, the industry's bleak outlook was the catalyst that
prompted McAllister to talk to Ward in the first place last May.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly that world has changed. Copper prices have risen 33
percent since then. Now, Asarco and Cyprus Amax, instead of being
left alone to embrace each other out of desperation, have, in
effect, become much more valuable prizes on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as soon as they walked out of the meeting last Friday,
the two sought a bid from Grupo Mexico, a little-known Mexican
copper producer and Asarco's largest shareholder. Grupo Mexico,
which had been eying the action for a while, immediately offered to
pay $1.03 billion in cash for Asarco, barely edging out Phelps
Dodge's $1.01 billion stock and cash offer. Asarco and Cyprus Amax,
essentially acknowledging that their original deal was no longer
viable, postponed shareholder votes scheduled for Thursday on the
merger, giving each other until Tuesday to reconsider their
options, even ditch merger plans altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The four-way fight is endemic of what has happened in stagnant
commodity-driven industries seeking some way to shore up production
without losing their shirts in the process. Low prices in
slow-growing industries, including oil, aluminum, copper and
chemicals, have made even the most unattractive partners appealing
to formidable competitors hoping to cut costs and restore
profitability to their slim-margin businesses. And with 1980s-style
corporate takeover tactics back in vogue, properties expected to
benefit from rising prices are now worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When copper was 65 cent per pound, no one thought anyone would
have been fighting over these two companies,'' said Tom Burnett,
founder of Merger Insight, which is based in New York. ``The worm
has turned. Commodity prices are on the move and companies don't
want to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Asarco and Grupo Mexico said executives would not
comment on recent events. Executives at Cyprus Amax did not return
phone calls. But people involved in the talks said Cyprus Amax had
been scouting for another partner and could possibly strike a deal
soon with Phelps Dodge. Asarco too has been negotiating with other
suitors this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McAllister of Asarco, who only became chief executive last
spring, never planned for his company to become a target,
executives close to him said. Instead his solution to Asarco's woes
was for him to act as buyer, squeezing savings out of any merged
entity. McAllister wanted to turn Asarco's fortunes around, one
person said, and he found a willing partner in the older Ward, who
was looking for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations said Ward had
already approached a handful of potential merger partners for
Cyprus Amax last year. So it was with little fanfare that Ward and
McAllister announced July 15 that their companies would join forces
in a merger of equals, valued then at $737 million in stock. Stock
traders yawned at the news: the stock of both companies dropped 3
percent on the day the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the time said the ho-hum response was because
neither of the companies' shareholders were paid a premium and they
did not understand how the duo could successfully improve profit
margins without cutting production. ``People wanted to see how
they'd perform before they bid up the stock,'' said Ali Agha, a
metals and mining analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. But the
merger did catch the attention of Yearley, who said he thought a
three-way merger with Asarco and Cyprus Amax could be just the
ticket to make Phelps Dodge the premier low-cost global copper
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge is one of the few copper companies to turn a
profit. And after mulling over the combination, he said he called
both Ward and McAllister on Aug. 10 to propose they meet. The two
rebuffed his offer, saying their merger agreement barred them from
independently talking to other suitors. Still, Yearley followed up
with a letters to the chief executives and boards of directors,
requesting a reply within a week.
</P>
<P>
   None came, until the two companies publicly dismissed Phelps
Dodge's offer Aug. 20 and reconfirmed their own merger. So Phelps
Dodge went public with a sweeter offer that day, offering stock for
the pair with a combined value of $2.6 billion, a 30 percent
premium to the companies' trading prices the previous day. Five
days later, Asarco and Cyprus Amax snubbed that bid, suggesting
they would be willing to negotiate only if Phelps Dodge put a much
better deal on the table. To deter stockholder interest in the
Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco and Cyprus Amax also sweetened the terms
of their own merger, offering an extra payment of $5 a share in
cash once the deal was completed. Undaunted, Phelps Dodge launched
a tender offer for shares in the two companies Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley was not the only interested party, however. Grupo
Mexico, Mexico's largest diversifed mining company, owned a 9.7
percent stake in Asarco, the largest single holding. Its chairman,
German Larrea, watched the brouhaha intensely. Not only was he
interested in getting the best price for his shares, executives
said, he also was potentially interested in a piece of the action
himself. Larrea, according to documents recently filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, held separate meetings in late
August and early September in Mexico City with both McAllister of
Asarco. Executives from Phelps Dodge also tried to woo him to vote
for their bid, Yearley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Larrea was an attentive suitor. An executive
close to the company said Larrea ``didn't want to do something
hostile'' after Asarco's announcement in July. But now, with Phelps
Dodge in the picture, he said, Larrea ``perceived himself as the
good guy.'' A spokesman for Larrea said he was not granting
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Larrea had a problem, though. Because Grupo Mexico's stock did
not trade in the United States, it would have to offer cash. So the
company hired Chase Securities Inc. as its adviser and to arrange
financing for its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enthusiasm for Phelps Dodge's offer was growing on
Wall Street, particularly after the company increased its bids
again, on Sept. 22, to a stock and cash offer worth about $2.8
billion for the two companies together. Regulators were believed to
be giving the nod to the three-way merger, despite initial
antitrust concerns, according to executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco and Cyprus Amax, after finally agreeing to meet Yearley,
laid out several demands at the session last Friday. First, said
Yearley, they wanted Phelps Dodge to pay a 55 percent premium to
their stocks' prices prior to the Phelps Dodge bid Aug. 20. Next,
they wanted Phelps Dodge to take the risk of any antitrust
approval. They also wanted to avoid paying a $45 million breakup
fee for canceling their merger. Top executive pay packages would
have to be honored. If Yearley could agree to those terms, he had a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley said he agreed to almost everything except price.
Already Phelps Dodge was offering about a 40 percent premium to buy
the companies. ``We thought we'd gone far enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the skirmish took an unexpected twist later that afternoon.
A representative of Credit Suisse First Boston, which was advising
Asarco, contacted Larrea of Grupo Mexico, documents filed with the
SEC show, and made him an offer: Asarco would be willing to
consider ``an all cash firm offer for all of its shares at $26 per
share.'' Cyprus Amax was mentioned too, but Grupo was not
interested, said an executive close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the talks said Asarco executives did not
know that Larrea was interested in buying the company _ despite
having had several discussions with key executives at Asarco _
describing the call as ``one of those interesting coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Grupo Mexico announced its plans to launch a tender
offer for Asarco for $26 a share, slightly higher than the $25.47
Phelps Dodge had proposed two days earlier. ``As you know, in the
past we have expressed an interest in exploring the possibility of
a combination of our two companies' operations,'' Larrea wrote in a
letter to McAllister that evening. ``Briefly put, we believe our
proposal is in the best interest of your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   As advisers and executives sort through the offers this week, it
is not yet clear which company will buy Asarco or Cyprus, or if
they end up together.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, said one banker involved in the deal, ``It was a
good attempt that didn't work out that well.'' More to the point,
he added, ``Althought it will end up being good for shareholders,
it may not be necessarily be good for management.'' &QL;

<P>
   Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it would reinvent itself as
kind of Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular web site to
merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling
powerhouse, which started as an online bookstore, will gather an
unprecedented amount of precious information on the buying habits
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called zShops, begins Thursday with 500,000 new
products _ about four times the offerings of the average Kmart _
the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to
buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys. For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

BILLIONAIRE, ONCE REFUGEE, DONATES MILLIONS TO SMITHSONIAN

 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A refugee from the 1956 Hungarian uprising who came
penniless to the United States will give the Smithsonian
Institution $60 million, its largest donation ever, the Smithsonian
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The donor, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, became a billionaire by leasing
airliners, and his gift to the Smithsonian will be directed to a
new museum at Dulles International Airport to open in four years
that will contain objects too big _ like the space shuttle and a
747 jetliner _ for its National Air and Space Museum on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the gift, the Smithsonian is expected to name the
Dulles museum for Udvar-Hazy (pronounced OOD-var HAH-zee), perhaps
at the next meeting of its governing board of regents in January.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the space shuttle and the 747, the Dulles museum will
also house the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima in 1945; an SR-71, once a secret spy plane, and a B-17,
another World War II bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy was traveling in Asia Wednesday and not available for
comment, but the chairman of his leasing company, Leslie Gonda,
described how Udvar-Hazy's knack for aviation had brought him a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he was an undergraduate at UCLA, he gave classes to
graduate students in airline management and administration,'' Gonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the University of California at Los Angeles that
Udvar-Hazy learned that he could make money by buying an airplane
from one company and selling it or leasing it to another.
</P>
<P>
   According to an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 1990,
Udvar-Hazy learned in 1967 that Air New Zealand was trying to sell
an old Lockheed Electra and told the airline that he would sell it
for a 5 percent commission. Air New Zealand agreed and Udvar-Hazy
sold the airplane and made a $50,000 commission.
</P>
<P>
   He was then 21 years old and he said that he carried on the deal
via Telex because, he said, ``I was afraid if someone saw me,
they'd be disappointed in how young I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy is now 53 and earlier this year The Los Angeles
Business Journal estimated his fortune at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Udvar-Hazy, Gonda and Gonda's son, Louis, sold their
company, the International Lease Finance Corp., to American
International Group, the insurance company, for $1.3 billion in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy and the elder Gonda stayed on to run the company for
the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Gonda is also a Hungarian refugee, now 80, who lost much of his
family in the Holocaust and came to the United States in 1963 after
going first to Venezuela in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He said Udvar-Hazy and his brother, Andre, were taken by their
parents, Ernest and Ethel, to Sweden when the Soviet Union put down
the Hungarian uprising in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The family then moved to New York City, where Udvar-Hazy
attended elite Stuyvesant High School, and then to California.
Udvar-Hazy lives with his wife, Christine, their four children and
his mother (his father has since died) in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Morten S. Beyer, chairman of MBA, an aviation consulting firm,
said the company Udvar-Hazy founded is one of the largest owners of
Boeing and Airbus planes, although it has no 747s like the one that
will be installed at Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like the economics for the lessor,'' Beyer said of
Udvar-Hazy's aversion to the 747.
</P>
<P>
   After word of the donation got out, the secretary of the
Smithsonian, I. Michael Heyman, noted that it was the latest in a
series of ``exemplary gifts to the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was the bequest by Dr. Paul Singer of his huge
collection of ancient Chinese artifacts to the Smithsonian's Arthur
M. Sackler Gallery announced on Sept. 8. The collection has been
valued at $50 million to $60 million.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging that he faces
a serious challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination,
announced Wednesday that he was relocating his campaign
headquarters from Washington to his home state of Tennessee and
paring back a top-heavy campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Nashville is part of a broad strategy that his aides
hope will symbolize a break from the Beltway _ and the Clinton
administration. And it comes in response to the steady rise in the
polls, and in the public imagination, of former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, the sole Democrat who dared challenge Gore and his
vast institutional apparatus for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore backers have been dispirited by national polls
that show Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner,
sustaining a strong lead that Gore has been unable to dent.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Gore campaign has only vaguely focused on Bush
and acted as if Bradley did not exist. But the former basketball
star has demonstrated his ability to raise serious money. And now
that Bradley has drawn even with Gore in opinion polls in key
states like New York and New Hampshire, the Gore camp can no longer
ignore the Bradley threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the challenge for the nomination has changed,''
Gore acknowledged Wednesday, noting that the Bradley camp had
established ``a baseline of competence and credibility.'' He added:
``We're in a completely new campaign. So we're going to adapt to it
and adjust to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals is to cut expenses by limiting the number and
salaries of senior staffers. The need to conserve money is a
consequence of Gore's lackluster fund raising: He collected an
unimpressive $6.5 million in the last three months and has spent
almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's cash has been drained in part by efforts to raise money
and build state organizations. But that focus has resulted in
negative news accounts of a bulging campaign top-heavy with
Washington consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The move will mean lower rents in Nashville and will provide a
face-saving way for some of Gore's high-priced talent to leave the
campaign without being fired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is reporting that it has just $10 million in cash
on hand. Bradley's campaign refused to divulge how much it raised
in the last quarter and how much it has on hand, but the
expectation is that in financial reports to be made public on
Thursday, he will show he is competitive with Gore. Three months
ago, the Gore campaign said it had $9.4 million on hand; Bradley
had $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville is also part of a broader effort to
revitalize the campaign. Other elements include an accelerated
schedule of debates with Bradley to showcase the vice president's
verbal skills, an emphasis on meetings with smaller and less formal
groups and a rejiggered stump speech designed to show a more
passionate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More tactical plans include working aggressively behind the
scenes to try to win the endorsement of groups that Bradley has so
far neutralized, most prominently the AFL-CIO, which is meeting in
California in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the new campaign seeks to feature a
new Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked over the weekend how he planned to overcome the challenges
he faces, a suddenly plain-speaking Gore, stung by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's devastating pronouncement last week that he is
unelectable, had a blunt and urgent answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoeleather and hard work and a lot of handshaking and talking
with people one on one and getting out of this 4-by-4 that I ride
around in and walking down the sidewalks and Main streets and going
in stores and coffee shops and looking voters in the eye and
talking to them one by one,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dryly noted Gore's abrupt change in strategy,
particularly the vice president's apparent eagerness to debate.
``For the last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me,'' he said while
campaigning in California. ``I think that shows we're making some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the address of Gore's headquarters mattered little.
What the move shows, he said, is ``the Democratic side is clearly
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers in and out of Washington have said that Gore needs to
shed the trappings of the vice presidency, and the move to
Tennessee, where he spent his boyhood summers, should help him do
that.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the broader need for Gore to project some of
the ``outsider'' status that has helped propel the Bradley
campaign. It also signals Gore's need to establish a presence in
the South, where Bush looms with a strong advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee itself, a poll conducted Sept. 16 for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee found Bush leading Gore among
registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the 17 states that
make up the South, a new poll conducted for the American
Association of Health Plans showed Bush leading Gore 53 percent to
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the campaign was moving ``lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville so that we can get closer to the American people, closer
to the grassroots and out of the Beltway and into the heartland.''
He said he would formally open a Nashville office next Wednesday.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, including President Clinton, have long been
telling him that he needs to connect better with voters. They want
him in intimate exchanges with people about what really matters in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent more than an hour on Sunday with 10 people in a
livingroom in the tiny outpost of Berlin, N.H., said Wednesday that
he would go ``directly to the voters in small groups, without
intermediaries, responding to their questions, telling them about
my vision for the future, asking for their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also been told to sharpen his message, reveal some
passion and try to appear as often as possible with his playful,
spontaneous wife, Tipper, to show that he is a ``real person,'' a
family man _ and not Bill Clinton. Even so, his advisers are
divided over how much he should try to separate himself from his
political patron. A base more than 500 miles from Washington could
help keep at a distance the Clinton scandal, and the shadow it
casts over a Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speech now includes a reference to an earlier period
in his life when he was ``disillusioned'' with politics, the
result, he says, of the Vietnam War, Watergate and watching his
father, a senator from Tennessee, go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With these glancing references to the tumultuous 1960s and '70s,
Gore hopes to begin to add some complexity to his personal
narrative and to counter the impression that he has been a
politician and Washington insider all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers say the Bradley surge is a blessing in
disguise. ``It's better than shadow-boxing out there by
ourselves,'' said one. It has energized the candidate and his
campaign staff and cast them in a role that Americans love: that of
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to fight,'' said Tony Coelho, his campaign
manager. ``We've unshackled him. We've liberated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Gore is still a cautious politician. While
he is taking some stands that may be popular locally but are risky
nationally, like supporting timber cutting in New Hampshire's White
Mountains, he still refuses to say whether he believes Clinton was
right to grant clemency to a group of imprisoned Puerto Rican
nationalists. ``I have not reviewed the record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He can also signal an air of desperation. In a recent speech to
Democratic activists, he blurted out: ``I care.'' The words
inadvertently recalled former President George Bush's struggle to
sympathize with voters. ``Message: I care,'' Bush had said in 1992,
drawing ridicule for needing to spell out what he had been unable
to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often turns to this none-too-subtle approach as he seems to
regard his listeners as interest groups. ``I am FOR the veterans!''
he will announce. Or, as he said last week: ``For the
environmentalists here, the first word I learned to spell was green
_ G-R-E-E-N!''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville adds to the risk that Gore will be seen as
desperate. ``It redefines the `Hail Mary,''' said one Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats perceived the move as a welcome sign that
Gore was ready to take control of his campaign and put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals a change in attitude,'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant who ran Clinton's insurgent campaign from
Little Rock, Ark., in 1992. ``And it allows you to make changes, to
do things you need to do underneath without creating a three- or
four-day brouhaha,'' he said, referring to the downsizing of the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this move to be an opportunity for transformation,''
Gore said
</P>
<P>
   Part of that transformation will be a willingness to challenge
Bradley directly and to begin drawing contrasts with a man he has
not mentioned by name until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to engage Bradley on specific issues, including
education, health care and the environment.

CLINTON WIDENS PLAN FOR POOR DEBTOR NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday announced a major
expansion of American efforts to forgive the debt of the world's
poorest nations, saying those countries would not have to pay back
any of the billions of dollars they borrowed from American aid
agencies if they could show the savings were being plowed into
poverty reduction and education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Wednesday of 100 percent debt forgiveness
for the world's most indebted nations _ mostly in sub-Saharan
Africa _ expands a previous commitment by the United States in June
to write off up to 90 percent of the money they owe. But the
process may take years, and it is contingent on congressional
approval of a $1 billion debt-forgiveness program that Clinton sent
to Capitol Hill last week as an amendment to his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, administration officials say, is that many of the
countries that will benefit from the program never had much hope
repaying more than a fraction of the $5.7 billion they currently
owe the U.S. Treasury. In fact, much of that debt has already been
lessened on the government's ledger books, reflecting estimates
that the United States was likely to recover only pennies on the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by the magic of Washington's budget rules, the $5.7
billion in debt can be wiped out with a congressional expenditure
of only $1 billion. Still, it is far from clear that Congress will
go along with the move, especially as elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here, just as the
two financial institutions were putting the finishing touches on a
$50 billion debt-reduction program that involves their own massive
lending to poor nations. Clinton's announcement, during a brief
appearance in a hotel ballroom where thousands of delegates of
countries around the world were gathered, seemed to take many here
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States,'' Clinton said, ``when _ and this is quite important _ when
needed to help them finance basic human needs and when the money
will be used to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said that Clinton's move had ``symbolic importance that
goes beyond its economic significance,'' especially in countries
that are choosing between paying off their international loans or
building more schools or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's program would initially aid countries like Uganda and
Mozambique, which have gone the furthest in meeting requirements
set out in 1996 for debt relief. But ultimately it could help
another 34 nations, from Tanzania to Zamabia and Ivory Coast to
Nicaragua and Honduras to rogue nations like Myanmar if they are
willing to meet the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not extend his spirit of forgiveness, however, to
one country that is deeply indebted, and deeply in trouble, with
the IMF: Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the head of the fund, Michel Camdessus, said that
``it would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on
this great nation; we will not do that.'' He urged that all the
allegations of misappropriation of funds should be weighed against
seven years of ``real progress,'' and praised Russia for continuing
to develop a ``modern market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus' comments, and the absence of balancing words of
warning to Russia, infuriated some White House officials who felt
it undermined their effort to send a stern message to Moscow.
Clinton, talked Wednesday only about Russia as an example that the
fund must heed as it reviews ``its procedures and controls to
strengthen the safeguards'' on use of its money.

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interrogation techniques used during Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile were the same used by British
forces in Northern Ireland and found by the European Court of Human
Rights not to constitute torture, the lawyer leading the general's
defense told a London court. Spain is seeking the extradition of
Pinochet, 83, to stand trial on torture charges.

<P>
   BRITAIN: BLAIR INVITATION TO TORIES
</P>
<P>
   A day after assailing ``conservative forces,'' in his address to
the annual Labor Party convention, for holding Britain back, Prime
Minister Tony Blair invited Conservatives to desert their party for
his, saying Labor now represented ``traditional'' conservative
values better than a ``Conservative Party more extreme than ever.''
The Tory leader William Hague said Blair's attack showed
``incredible hypocrisy.''

   SCOTLAND: GAELIC SCHOOL OPENS
</P>
<P>
   Scotland opened its first all-Gaelic public primary school in an
effort to safeguard a traditional language spoken by only 60,000
people, most of whom live in the Highlands and the Western islands.
The school, in Glasgow, has 109 students and will hold all classes
solely in Gaelic, with English offered as a separate course
starting in the third grade.

<P>
   ITALY: WOMEN CAN ENLIST
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20,000 women are expected to apply to join Italy's armed

   COLOMBIA: NEW VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Yet another outbreak of violence by armed groups of the left and
right has resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people and the
kidnapping of another 16. Right-wing death squads killed 10 people

came to power, a portrait of Mao has loomed over Tiananmen Square
in the heart of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To the countless millions who have passed under Mao's gaze, the
portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged, sturdy as
a piece of Communist architecture, no matter how drastically China
itself was being transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, so much about Chinese officialdom was kept
secret that even the circumstances surrounding the nation's most
prominent painting were considered off-limits to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a harmless step away from the zip-lipped past, Wang
Qizhi can openly admit that he painted Mao's portrait for 27 years.
Damage from sunlight and smog requires the Tiananmen portrait to be
replaced twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Chinese in the early years of the People's
Republic, Wang labored behind the scenes like an industrious ant,
following orders, suppressing all urge to show any individuality
and keeping his mouth shut about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was performing an important task for the good of the
country,'' said Wang, a slender, white-haired retiree of 72.
``There was no question about what I thought personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wang had pangs of pride when he rode through Tiananmen
Square on his bicycle and glanced up to see his painting at the
crown of the majestic Gate of Heavenly Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few of his acquaintances knew what he did, because anything
to do with Mao or his image was so politically sensitive that he
was ordered not to talk about his job. So Wang insists that his
personal achievement was always subsumed by a sense of the
burdensome importance of his daily task.
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary of Communist rule approaches on Oct. 1
and many marvel at the vast changes _ for better and worse _ that
China has experienced in a tumultuous half-century, people like
Wang express appreciation for something that has not changed, but
offers a least a thread of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese, Mao's portrait is an important political symbol
that reflects the strength and independence that China gained in
1949, even if it also embodies the nationalist pride that allowed
China to fall into a leftist frenzy in subsequent decades with
terrible damage to the nation's economic, social and political
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Mao may have so single-mindedly pursued his vision of an
egalitarian state _ and personal political power _ that he did not
seem to care how many millions died or were displaced in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even today, many more Chinese seem to admire Mao than to
hate him. A remarkably large number are nostalgic for what they
remember as the idealism and collective fervor of his era, despite
the poverty they endured at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has no equivocation; he is a diehard Mao fan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let us say a bad word about Mao in the house,'' said
Wang's son, Wang Yan, who is a painter himself. ``We have to go
outside if we want to curse Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   The son does indeed curse Mao outside, seeing the political
trauma of that era, which ended with Mao's death in 1976, as
unnecessarily damaging many of China's finest traditions, like
painting, the family avocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint in the traditional Chinese style, like my father and
my grandfather,'' he said. ``In Mao's era, traditional painting was
criticized and banned. How can that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many painters, writers and academics were attacked by the far
left during the 1960s, when radical politics engulfed Beijing. But
Wang Qizhi was protected by the authorities because there was
suddenly so much demand for his work, since Mao's portrait was
plastered all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Every major workplace in Beijing wanted its own original, and
they had to be painted by Wang or the one other man officially
approved to produce portraits of the Great Helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things were really busy, he would paint the bottom half
and I would paint the top,'' Wang said. ``We put a scaffolding
across the middle. The wart on Mao's chin marked the halfway
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, after Wang had already been painting Mao portraits for
15 years, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that
the portrait be changed, apparently under pressure from radical Red
Guards who objected that the partial side view of Mao showed only
one of his ears, suggesting that he was listening to only one
political faction.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it may sound funny that members of an intensely
intolerant group insisted that their leader be portrayed as
even-eared. But the portrait that was adopted that year remains the
version that has hung in Tiananmen Square for more than 30 years
and is still there today.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was deeply upset in 1989, though he was retired by
then, when three men in the Tiananmen protest movement splashed
paint on Mao's portrait, a move denounced by most student
protesters at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defacing the portrait is a crime,'' Wang said gravely. ``They
should have received the harshest punishment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the record, the three men _ a bus company employee, a
journalist and a schoolteacher, all from Mao's home province of
Hunan _ were sentenced to prison terms of 16 years, 20 years and
life, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be overlooked, Wang pointed out that the task of
painting a 20-foot-high portrait is not easy. The painter must
constantly be stepping back far enough to take a look, and with
such a huge portrait, Wang had to step back 100 feet. So he was
constantly climbing and descending a scaffolding, for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as China itself takes a step back to look at itself
after 50 years, it may be hard to get a clear perspective or focus
on a nation in the middle of wrenching change from a Communist
system to a new, ill-defined one. As confusing as the outlook may
be, Wang points out that material life is far more comfortable,
just as painting the Mao portrait is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's easy,'' Wang said. ``They have this big automatic
contraption that moves up and down. Not in my day. We had it much
harder.''

COMMENTARY: MANICHAEAN MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 ByM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's assume the curator of the National Gallery in Washington
came up with a show called ``Outrage.'' It featured a statue of
Moses wearing a Nazi swastika on his chest, a painting of a violent
Martin Luther King Jr. forcing Elizabeth Cady Stanton into
submission, and an avant-garde collage of the cutest puppy you ever
saw being tortured to death by a sadistic homosexual. As Mort Sahl
used to say, ``Is there anybody I haven't offended?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes; Christians. In a real-life abuse of public responsibility,
good taste and artistic license, the curator of the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is presenting ``Sensation,'' featuring a portrait of the
Virgin Mary with her breast decorated by a piece of what is
described delicately as elephant dung. (As they say with a smirk at
the Brooklyn Museum, ``dung happens.'')
</P>
<P>
   The museum's serenely elitist board members are either
incredibly stupid or knew _ and did not care _ that this would (a)
offend the religious, (b) anger and divide the city, (c) make a ton
of money for the exhibition's owners, and (d) make the museum's
staff the heroes of free expression with their own set.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew, or should have, that their publicly financed
thumb in the eye of the faithful was a supremely political act.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani had to respond to reflect his values, and did;
the artist's press agent in London had to denounce the mayor's
withdrawal of funds as ``totalitarian and fascist,'' as he
delightedly did; and the mayor's senatorial opponent, Hillary
Clinton, had to march in liberal lock step with the rest of the
city's embarrassed, unhappy but principled cultural establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the hubristic Brooklyn Museum plunged the city into a
lose-lose battle. It's now the ``right to free artistic
expression'' versus ``the accountability of the spending of public
funds.'' Everybody to the ramparts and to hell with comity.
Absolutists of the world, unite: Go to court over the issue of free
hate speech and grind the losers' faces in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever wins, everybody loses. When basic principles are in
conflict, democracies work out compromises that reflect the
majority and protect the minority. A civil libertarian believes not
only in liberty but in civility.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as a big First Amendment type. I was
all for the Nazis' right to parade through Skokie and think the
flag-burning amendment is a travesty and sedition must be defended.
I'm for a private gallery's right to display outrage and sensation
and an offended public's right to picket peaceably.
</P>
<P>
   But limits exist: you can't steal this essay, protected by
copyright, and put it on your Web site. Nor can a museum defiantly
spend money raised by taxation for causes opposed by the majority
or disgust a significant minority. Sooner or later, the public's
elected representatives direct that spending or are replaced.
Freedom of expression is a right, but public payment for it is not
an entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Free-speech lawyers I know and respect say the mayor will lose
because the Supreme Court frowns on any ``penalty on disfavored
viewpoints.'' Maybe so; maybe the court's decision last year that
governments could impose a decency standard on taxpayer-paid
expression will not apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But believers in unfettered expression looking for an exciting
``Kulturkampf'' to drive the Yahoos from the temple should stop
before they win a Pyrrhic victory. If public museums win in federal
court the right to offend egregiously without being punished by
losing their subsidies, they will lose their subsidies beforehand.
The art world is thoughtlessly flirting with a democratic public's
pre-emptive censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Surely artists would be freer to shock if unworried by the loss
of taxpayer support. Privately financed institutions and commercial
galleries have that constitutionally protected advantage. But is
heavier reliance on private philanthropy what our cultural
Houyhnhnms really want?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the authors of this Manichaean madness _ museum
curator, chairman and the benefactors of ``Sensation'' _ send their
contributions directly to the Buchanan campaign? Nothing is helping
bigots more in dividing religions and races.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs mediators, not gladiators. This is not the Good
Fight; this is the wrong fight. Settle it before everybody loses.  &QL;

AMAZON.COM SUDDENLY OFFERS 500,000 NEW THINGS TO BUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Got a taste for turducken, that distinctive Cajun
assemblage of turkey, duck and chicken? Feeling the need for a
really distinctive cookie cutter? Try Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The new brick-red tab appearing today on Amazon's
distinctive home page means the world's largest Internet retailer
has expanded again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Seattle's Amazon has added a department called
zShops, which opens the company's Web site to any individual or
company, large or small, that wants to sell online. zShops' launch
today makes 500,000 new items available immediately to Amazon's 12
million shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   These include exotic edibles from Fran's Chocolates and Cajun
Specialty Meats, cookie cutters from Kitchen Collectibles, car
parts, maternity clothes, golf clubs, dolls, and time-share resort
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Bigelow, owner of Fran's Chocolates in Seattle, said it was
easy to promote her ``carefully and lovingly made'' hand-dipped
candy on the small company's own Web site, but harder to handle the
mechanics of selling it there. Amazon's willingness to undertake
those details persuaded her to become one of the first zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts Wednesday seemed to agree Amazon's latest venture is a
good idea _ for the world's largest Internet retailer as well as
for shops like Fran's.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they said, it will enhance Amazon's stature as the
preeminent online shopping destination, making it a potentially
limitless resource for customers. At the same time, zShops will
create a low-cost revenue stream that may hasten the day
four-year-old Amazon stops losing money.
</P>
<P>
   The department will also give Amazon additional valuable
credit-card data about shoppers' buying patterns. And a new search
engine associated with zShops will reveal who wants to buy what,
guiding Amazon's future expansion efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good move for many reasons,'' said Sue Rothberg, a
senior analyst with Gomez Advisors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cheered the news, sending the stock up 23 percent.
Shares gained 14.875 to end the session at 80.75.
</P>
<P>
   To use zShops, a person or organization pays Amazon a fee of
$9.99 to list up to 3,000 items, or 10 cents per item for fewer
than 100 items.For each sale by a zShop, Amazon collects another
fee, starting at five percent of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers must handle their own inventories and shipping. But for
an additional charge to sellers _ $.60 plus 4.75 percent of the
price _ Amazon will process each credit-card transaction,
eliminating checks, money orders and the hassle and insecurity that
consumers and businesses alike may associate with electronic
commerce. Amazon will extend its 1-Click shopping cart service to
zShops at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   In case of fraud or dissatisfaction by either buyer or seller,
Amazon will pay up to $250, or up to $1,000 if it handled the
transaction. Having to stand behind sales by merchants it doesn't
know could tarnish Amazon's good name, a possibility that Ken
Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York, sees as
a greater threat to Amazon than the policy's financial or staffing
impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the data Amazon acquires by handling all these additional
credit-card transactions will give it new insights into who buys
what, and how often. Amazon is already well-known for using such
customer data to lead returning buyers to merchandise they're
likely to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants can create unlimited numbers of links between Amazon's
offerings and their own, at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Each zShop's offerings are indexed by Amazon's new
shopping-oriented search engine, so the free searches turn up items
sold by Amazon itself or the zShops. The engine even directs
shoppers to other, noncompeting Web sites if the items sought
aren't available at Amazon.com, a practice most sites avoid at any
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's explanation, as always, is that it just wants to offer
the best possible shopping experience. But learning what people
wanted and couldn't find also gives Amazon a strong indicator of
how to expand its own offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Amazon will likely encroach on some of its zShops
as it expands, though specialty and niche sites will always exist,
Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue that zShops could yield for Amazon is a topic Joel
Spiegel, the newly appointed vice president and general manage of
zShops, won't discuss. But analysts said the potential is large.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor will be how many merchants become zShops.
Amazon won't say how many are already signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Also critical are Amazon's income and expenses. Several
additional sellers' fees can provide more income. Boldface listings
cost $2 per sale. Emphasis in a given category, such as Health &AMP;
Beauty, costs $14.95 per listing. Showcasing on Amazon's home page
costs $99.95 per listing. As to expenses, Spiegel said Amazon is
``doing a lot of work'' to create zShops, declining to provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon doesn't have to pay for the zShops' warehousing and
shipping costs. But it doesn't take a full markup on sales either,
just a percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell just how much money zShops will make for
Amazon. Creating the new department now means zShops could provide
an extra kick in the critical fourth quarter encompassing the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Marketwatch reported that analysts Warburg Dillon Read
expect fully 25 percent of this year's estimated $12 billion in
online sales to be made at Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's costs to zShop merchants are low by comparison to those
charged by Yahoo! and Lycos, two other sites that give homes to
businesses lacking their own, said Rothberg. And because Amazon is
a site designed for shopping, while those sites are designed for
broader use, Amazon will probably steal vendors from them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel declined to say whether the new department will mean
additions to staff.
</P>
<P>
   Why the name ``zShops''?
</P>
<P>
   ``The `shops' part was easy,'' Spiegel said. ``The 'z' is for
zero hassle, zero risk, and A-to-Z selection.''

PROSECUTORS BEGIN INVESTIGATION OF MOSCOW BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian prosecutors have opened the first criminal
investigation into a Moscow bank since the government was rocked by
accusations of money laundering through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the prosecutor's investigative unit, Vladimir
Minayev, said Russian authorities had uncovered evidence of
suspicious deals carried out by the Flamingo Bank, a small bank
based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev declined to say whether Russian officials had uncovered
information that Flamingo had channeled money through suspicious
accounts at the Bank of New York. He said the investigation was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian executives say Flamingo was one of several Russian banks
suspected of funneling under-the table payments from Russian
importers through foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is a widespread means of avoiding taxes and
tariffs. And some Russian businessman have said it may account for
some of the money that passed through accounts at the Bank of New
York that the FBI is examining. Some $7.5 billion passed through
their accounts over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Flamingo Bank did not respond to repeated requests
for comment. The bank received a license in October 1994, according
to the Central Bank. It has a license to deal in foreign currency,
as well as rubles. But its official assets are so small that it has
escaped attention by some Western bank-rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspicions involving the Bank of New York were
publicized, Russian officials first denounced the charges as a
conspiracy to humiliate Russia. More recently, however, leading
officials and tycoons have argued that Moscow should take visible
steps to crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia's business community has suddenly been
swept by a new sense of rectitude. There is, however, a pervasive
sense that many Russian executives, legitimate as well as shady,
will be hurt as long Russia is seen as deeply corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev was among the officials who recently traveled to the
United States to discuss the money-laundering case that is swirling
around the Bank of New York. He insisted in an interview that the
investigation into the Flamingo Bank had not been prompted by the
United States, but was based on Russian law-enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev said the investigators who searched the bank had found a
sum of hard currency with no documentation to indicate where it
came from. Russian press reports said the hard currency totaled
$430,000.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions of money laundering, Minayev said, were one reason
that Russian authorities began their investigation. ``We have not
launched a campaign against the banks,'' he said. ``But we are
trying to investigate illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo is not the only bank that Russian executives said
might be linked to schemes to avoid tariffs. Other banks include
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank and the Sobin Bank. Those banks have
denied violations.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers questioned whether the case against Flamingo was
the start of a serious anticorruption drive. Rather, they said, the
authorities are making an example of Flamingo to impress the West.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant published an article on the case under
the headline, ``The General Prosecutor's Office Launders
Reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamingo, Kommersant wrote, is a ``scapegoat in a noisy
anticorruption campaign.''

Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone company,
dropped off 30 boxes of documents at the Federal Communications

application to sell long-distance communications services to
consumers and businesses in New York state. But for all of its
physical heft, Bell Atlantic's application was matched in

RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO RULE OUT GROUND WAR IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian and international agencies struggled to keep
up with the tide of Chechen refugees fleeing airstrikes by Russian
warplanes, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin refused Wednesday to rule
out a possible ground war against the rebellious southern province.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that talks with the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, were still possible but only if Chechnya's elected
leaders take a stand against the Islamic militants who have used
Chechnya as a base for armed attacks against neighboring provinces,
and are suspected of waging a terrorist campaign in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government and the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees have promised to ship food and tents to the estimated
60,000 Chechen refugees who have flocked across the border into
Ingushetia since the Russian air campaign began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, refugees are still streaming across
the border, crowding into bus and rail stations, and into a single
encampment of only about 20 tents set up near the border village of
Sleptsovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on Russian television Wednesday night, refugees said
they were fleeing in fear for their lives. Sobbing, one woman told
NTV, a commercial station, that she could not understand why
innocent civilians were being made to suffer for the crimes of
terrorists they do not support.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials Wednesday continued to report hundreds of
civilian casualties caused by the bombing, but without independent
confirmation, some Russian newspapers Wednesday said these reports
were inflated. A reporter for Radio Liberty, one of the few
independent journalists based in Grozny, the Chechen capital, was
able to confirm the death of eight civilians, including four
children, killed Monday in the bombardment of a school outside
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when Chechnya defeated federal forces after a
two-year war, the mountainous region has been increasingly isolated
by a wave of kidnappings that have deterred reporters and aid
organizations from traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   The Maskhadov government, whose authority has been weakened by
the rise of independent warlords, has disavowed any connection to
the Islamic militants who last month launched armed attacks against
Dagestan, a region that lies between Chechnya and the Caspian sea.
Russian officials say that the militants, led by Chechen fighters,
are supported by international terrorist groups that want to
destabilize Russia's volatile North Caucacus region.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Russian military has moved an estimated
50,000 troops to the region to isolate Chechnya, but several
Russian newspapers reported Wednesday that the real goal is a
ground invasion that could begin within days.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov canceled a meeting Wednesday with the Dagestani
leader, Magomedali Magomedev, when the road to the meeting place
was blocked by angry Dagestanis protesting Chechen-led aggression
on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, authorized by Moscow, had been seen as a
preliminary opening for further, more high-level talks that Putin
has said repeatedly can only take place on Moscow's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about the reports of preparations for a ground
war, Putin said every tool needed to destroy terrorists in Chechnya
will be used. He said Moscow would be willing to negotiate with
Maskhadov, but only if the Chechen leaders ``finally condemn
terrorism, clearly and firmly, and express their readiness to hand
over the criminals.''

HOLYFIELD SAYS HE FOUGHT SICK AGAINST LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield says he was sick the first time.
Lennox Lewis says it makes him sick to hear such talk. Thus began
the tub-thumping for Holyfield-Lewis II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander always makes excuses after a poor performance, but the
only problem he had was Lennox Lewis punching him,'' Lewis said
Wednesday with disgust after hearing Holyfield's claim that a virus
and leg cramps conspired against him when they first squared off
last spring in a heavyweight unification fight that produced little
fighting and nothing heavy but a controversial draw that left a
sour taste in everyone's mouth _ apparently including Holyfield's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a virus 10 days before the fight,'' the WBA-IBF champion
said when asked to explain his decidedly lackluster performance
that night at Madison Square Garden. ``I had stomach cramps going
into the ring and my leg started to cramp after the first round. My
doctor told me I didn't need to go fight but I told him, `You think
I trained all this time and I'm pulling out?' All that work and you
the only one who don't get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would lay down (that week) and have a big knot (cramp) in my
stomach. I didn't want to believe these type things were happening.
I felt your mind always tells you something is wrong (as a big
fight approaches), so when I got really sick I just thought it was
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured once the bell rings, I'd feel better. It didn't go
away, but I'm so quick to change my mind. I switched up and
thought, `What difference do it make? I'll get him in the third
round (when he had predicted he would knock Lewis out at God's
insistence).' When I didn't, I lost a little zeal. I started
thinking, `It just ain't going to get no better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't for Holyfield until the three judges' scorecards were
read and the fight was declared a draw even though the crowd and
most ringside observers believed Lewis had done enough to win. Some
believed he had done quite a bit more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, frankly, saw Holyfield as the winner, a point he didn't
try to dispute Wednesday as his Nov. 13 rematch with Lewis was
officially announced in a ballroom at the New York Hilton in
Manhattan. The difference was Holyfield didn't see himself losing
either under a unique scoring system that has been in effect for as
long as there have been champions and challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fight was even,'' Holyfield said. ``I didn't get
to him and he shouldn't be rewarded just for keeping me off him.
We're both champions and we didn't take anything away from each
other. When you have two champions, you can't win the fight if you
don't take it from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The champion remains the champion until he is dethroned. He is
defending his title while the other man is seeking it and by their
very definition defending is different from challenging.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, both men were champions. Both were
defending titles and it was clear Lewis did a far better job
defending the WBC portion from Holyfield than Holyfield did keeping
Lewis's mitts off the WBA and IBF portions. Yet in the end, neither
fought well enough to convince the world he was the superior
fighter, which is why they will do it again at Las Vegas's Thomas
and Mack Center for big money.
</P>
<P>
   But when they do, one thing will be clear even before the first
bell rings. Evander Holyfield may not have lost his titles to
Lennox Lewis on the night he cramped up, but that doesn't mean he
didn't lose anything to him.
</P>
<P>
   That June night, Holyfield was paid over $20 million to Lewis's
$10 million. On Nov. 13, they'll receive $15 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   That's a loss of something bigger than title belts. It's a loss
of leverage and a concession by Holyfield that he needs this fight
as much as Lennox Lewis needed their first one . . . which is
probably enough to make him feel sick all over again.

   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul 11: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.

RUSSIA ASKS U.S. TO EXPAND JOINT EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD NUCLEAR
FUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SITE 49, SEVEROMORSK, Russia _ Russia has asked the U.S. Energy
Department to expand joint projects aimed at securing dangerous
materials, including nuclear fuel, that could be turned into
weapons, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday on a visit
here.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the proposal incorporated an unusual provision
that would provide the United States greater access to highly
sensitive sites to which Moscow has barred foreigners or permitted
only limited entry.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which Russian and American officials said was
approved by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, was made by Adm.
Vladimir Kuroyedov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, at a
private meeting Wednesday with Richardson and his senior staff.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed a rare tour of Site 49, where the Russian
Navy stores all the nuclear fuel for its vast Northern Fleet, near
Severomorsk, the fleet headquarters, a restricted area.
Richardson's entourage was the first senior American delegation
granted permission to visit what is one of Russia's largest, most
sensitive nuclear naval bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has just completed a 16-month $10 million
security upgrade at Site 49 and at the Murmansk Shipping Co., which
operates atomic-powered icebreakers that are powered with highly
enriched fuel rods that can also be used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Six experts from several Energy Department laboratories have
spent 18 months advising the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, the
former Soviet Union's premier research center on nuclear weapons,
on improving security at the navy's nuclear-fuel storage centers.
Most were run-down and protected by little more than barbed-wire
fences and lightly armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has been working to improve the accounting
and security of such dangerous materials in Russia since 1994. But
its activities here in the Northern Fleet area began only 18 months
ago, after a deranged 19-year-old Russian sailor had seized control
of a nuclear submarine in Murmansk and held the ship for eight
agonizing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the press office at the base, Capt. Sergei
Anoufriev, said the sailor, who had passed a psychological test,
had lied about his mental history. The sailor shot and killed five
crew members before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   That case, Russian and American officials agreed, awakened the
navy to the security threat posed by insiders, rather than foreign
foes. As a result, the Russian Navy began what American officials
called a crash program to consolidate its numerous nuclear-fuel
storage centers into a single complex.
</P>
<P>
   Site 49, with 11,000 square feet of storage, can hold up to 55
tons of highly enriched uranium. Wednesday, Navy officials showed
off double fencing with electronic sensors, bright lights,
foot-thick steel doors, closed-circuit television monitors,
emergency alarms that connect to the headquarters in Murmansk and
response forces in case of a terrorist attack. The giant center,
built into a hill and painted in camouflage, is to begin receiving
fuel next week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Richardson began a weeklong tour of Energy
Department projects at several of the most sensitive military
installations in Russia. The agency spends more than $300 million a
year on projects aimed at bolstering the safety and physical
protection of nuclear fuel and other material that could be used in
bombs. It has projects in 10 of the once-secret nuclear cities at
53 sites throughout the former Soviet Union, 30 of which are in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project,'' Richardson said at Site 49, ``came in on
budget and under the planned time.''

CANADA STARTS TO TAKE HARD LINE AGAINST ILLEGAL CHINESE
IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PORT HARDY, British Columbia _ When the Canadian navy made a
group of undocumented Chinese migrants get off a ship here
recently, a local man brought his dogs to the dock and encouraged
them to bark at the men and women wrapped in blankets against the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   For Canadian officials, the confrontation represented one
victory in what they say is a rapidly growing effort to smuggle in
illegal immigrants. This summer alone, they confiscated four
trawlers and detained 560 undocumented Chinese citizens who wanted
to make Canada their home.
</P>
<P>
   Western Canada is only one destination in a pan-Pacific surge
this year in illegal Chinese migrants. In the last 16 months, U.S.
Coast Guard ships have intercepted 20 ships carrying undocumented
Chinese in U.S. territorial waters around Guam. In the last six
months, Australia has intercepted 21 boatloads of illegal migrants,
primarily Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now experiencing the largest smuggling operation ever
experienced in Canada,'' Rob Johnston, manager of immigration
enforcement here, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weeks, an Australian diplomat in Ottawa, said of Canada's
sudden concern: ``It's deja vu. The element of the public debate
and concern is very similar to Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australia, the United States and Canada increasingly share
intelligence about vessels believed to be carrying migrants from
southeastern China, Canada has started to take the harder line
traditional in the other two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Chinese ship was intercepted, on July 20, the
authorities in Vancouver released 74 immigrants, pending resolution
of their petitions for refugee status. Within a month, half had
disappeared, presumably for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Canada has adopted a policy of detaining all
undocumented passengers on vessels from China. Sentiment for
immediately deporting them is markedly higher in western Canada
than in provinces on the Atlantic seaboard, opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's population is 20 percent ethnic Chinese, and many of
these Chinese-Canadians fear that each new boatload batters a
carefully constructed racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver is a very tolerant society,'' said Derick Y.H.
Cheng, chairman of the Chinese Cultural Center there. ``We fear
this will make a backlash, give people the stereotype that Chinese
do not abide by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Bill Vander Zalm has jumped back
into politics, starting his campaign for Parliament by saying that
the federal government would pay attention to the immigration issue
only if all the illegal Chinese immigrants detained in the region
were shipped to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure you would get some action then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers portray the boatloads of migrants, largely
from Fujian province, as job-seekers rather than freedom-seekers.
Not long ago, Elinor Caplan, Canada's new immigration minister,
toured a Vancouver Island navy base where 225 immigrants are
detained and said at a packed news conference: ``We are
intercepting, boarding and apprehending those ships. We are then
using greater powers of detention to insure people on the boat do
not flee. The system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials are also reaching across the Pacific, asking
Chinese authorities to help.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting
in New Zealand, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien discussed the
migration problem with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``I told him
we needed collaboration because they could hopefully stop the
departure of the ships from the coast of China that are coming to
our coast,'' Chretien said later. ``He recognized that, and said he
was willing to collaborate with us.''

   Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it would reinvent itself as
kind of Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular web site to
merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling
powerhouse, which started as an online bookstore, will gather an
unprecedented amount of precious information on the buying habits
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called zShops, begins Thursday with 500,000 new
products _ about four times the offerings of the average Kmart _
the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to
buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys. For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ind.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 121 of the 515 deaths, the study found, a parent, sibling, or
other adult sleeping in the bed had inadvertently smothered the
child. More than three-quarters of the children who died from
``overlying'' were younger than 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, say the study's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report. Death certificates, he said, also may be
misleading: In some regions, coroners may be more likely to
attribute the death of an infant from a poor family to
``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher income
families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''

<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at Notre Dame
University, has done studies indicating that infants who sleep with
their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

 UNDATED: hate literature.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an important difference from real-world and Internet malls,
however, zShops will be essentially organized by product and
product category _ for example, fishing rods and sporting goods _
not by stores. Only after a customer has picked a particular item
from a list _ say, an Orvis fly rod for $150 _ would he be sent to
a page controlled by the merchant that would include a picture and
description of the item.
</P>
<P>
   To make the offer more enticing, Amazon is giving merchants a
chance to use several of the marketing tools it has refined.
Through what it calls relationship marketing, a small seller of
Indian Spices could have a link to its web site pop up every time a
customer calls up a book by ``Satanic Verses'' author Salman
Rushdie or a CD by sitarist Ravi Shankar. This service will be
offered free until Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for a percentage of the sale, Amazon will let any
merchant offer one-click shopping. That allows customers to click
on the shipping address and credit information stored in the Amazon
data bank to make a purchase through another merchant. Amazon
charges the card and then deposits the money directly into the
seller account. The seller is responsible for shipping and product
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to say how many stores are participating in
the experiment, but the arrangement will be less appealing to
larger business. Matt Hyde, vice president of online sales for
sporting goods retailer REI.com, said he had turned down the
opportunity because he aims to control the quality of the shopping
experience for his customers. ``Amazon commoditizes the product,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would consider it,'' said Anna Schryver, a spokeswoman for
clothing retailer Lands' End. ``However, we believe the greatest
place for our customer is our web site, because of the service
component.''
</P>
<P>
   This strategy is not without risks, the most pressing of which
is quality control. Amazon now has a brand name that is widely
recognized for trustworthiness. Since the retailer will only do
minimal screening of its prospective partners, it could easily find
itself processing orders for inefficient or dishonest merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is optimistically counting on self-policing by consumer
ratings to eliminate most fraud. ``If you are selling online, your
digital reputation is all you have,'' said Jaleh Bisharat, Amazon's
vice president of marketing. ``They have a tremendous incentive to
deliver high-quality goods.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Amazon has said it will guarantee merchandise that
never arrives or differs materially from how it was described up to
$1,000 it if handled the credit card payment and up to $250 if it
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, company analysts see a downside that could be
substantial. ``If the Tiffany lamp I order through zShops turns out
to be a fake, will I still blame Amazon? Yep,'' said Alan
Braverman, head of Internet Research at Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk to Amazon could be well worth the while if it
becomes the pre-eminent vault of information of Internet shopping
habits. In theory, Amazon could gather information on products that
were most popular with its customers. ``One of the reasons behind
adding these shops will be to help them determine what products
their customers are interested in so they can offer it
themselves,'' said Mike May, a digital commerce analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm. ``If a specific
product category, say sweaters, gets hot, they have a lot of
incentive to sell direct to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Amazon does not eventually choose to expand into new
products, it still has a lot to gain by learning more about
consumer shopping habits. ``The data could become the most valuable
asset,'' predicted Braverman. He hypothesizes about a future where
manufacturers like Procter &AMP; Gamble, for example, would pay Amazon
to test market new products.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how such an arrangement could benefit Amazon,
one need look no farther than when Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. started its
Mutual Fund Marketplace. The financial services giant offered to
customers the ability to go to one spot to buy mutual funds from
dozens of companies. Schwab took no ``inventory'' from the
companies and had no responsibility for managing the money, but it
did collect fees on the transactions. Schwab also kept the most
valuable part of the transaction for itself: information on
customers investing habits.
</P>
<P>
   The fund companies do not know who their customers are, they
simply get the money. As a result, the fund companies cannot
communicate directly with the investors who buy through Schwab, so
have no hope of repeat sales or targeted marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, on the other hand, has used this method to establish a
base of customers about whom it knows habits, preferences,
investment ability and more. As it has expanded its business, it
has started to pick off these customers from the companies whose
funds it also sells. Schwab has been the most successful company in
its industry in recent years.

NICKLAUS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would like to personally thank the people of Boston and 12
talented American golfers for giving us the most exciting Ryder Cup
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final-round TV-ratings were the highest in Cup history
and we owe it all to you.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many special moments.
</P>
<P>
   Like when a fan spat in the face of European captain Mark James'
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Like that little spike-shoed clog-dance the American players so
thoughtfully performed in the line of Jose Maria Olazabal's
potentially Cup-winning putt on the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   Or the cheering when the Europeans hit a bad shot or missed a
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Or heckling Colin Montgomerie so mercilessly that his father
couldn't stand it anymore and walked back to the clubhouse after 7
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Or steering Andrew Coltart in the wrong direction when he was
looking for his ball in the rough and suddenly ``finding'' it 30
seconds after he had to take a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to win, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, these are some of our bitterest enemies, these Brits,
Swedes and Spaniards. Wasn't it Ireland that was responsible for
stealing our nuclear-weapons secrets a while back? No, wait. That
was China. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Now the British tabloids are whining that we're a bunch of bad
sports.
</P>
<P>
   United Slobs of America they're calling us. James doesn't want
to play over here anymore. Montgomerie's having second thoughts,
too.
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch of babies, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it's not like Tom Lehman bashed a folding chair over
Olazabal's head or bowled him over with a flying drop-kick just as
he drew back his putter.(Though that might have been necessary if
Justin Leonard hadn't made that long putt seconds before.)
</P>
<P>
   All the American team did was ``modify'' the line of Ollie's
putt a little, sort of the way the Department of Transportation
modifies the surface of interstates before repaving.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he would have been happier if we had set out some orange
construction cones or some detour signs.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy har har.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys I was watching the Ryder Cup with Sunday
afternoon _ a person who clearly fails to appreciate how ``edgy''
golf has become _ said that if Jack Nicklaus had been in that
situation Sunday afternoon and seen the American team turn
Olazabal's line into a cattle trail, he would have given the
Spaniard his putt, all 30-feet of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, Ollie. Pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   My team, in its exuberance, thoughtlessly breeched a fundamental
tenet of golfing etiquette. I will not allow you to suffer for it,
even if it means losing the Ryder Cup. The game is not played that
way, and the game is more important than some cheesy trophy.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that Nicklaus, the greatest and fiercest
competitor in the history of golf, would have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't know is how some U.S. fans might have reacted to
Nicklaus' demonstration of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But I bet Mark James' wife has a clue.
</P>

OPPOSITION LEADERS SEEK TO CREATE A UNIFIED FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Leaders of the divided opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia are making another,
slightly desperate effort to create a common front around the issue
of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly anti-Milosevic
rallies, the leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly
seeking a reconciliation with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former head of the central bank who is their choice for prime
minister in any transitional government. Avramovic said in an
interview that Milosevic could too easily ignore a divided
opposition and that the protest turnouts had been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties are to
attend a conference on free and fair elections. If the round table
succeeds, Draskovic said, he will throw his support to rallies to
press for early elections as the best and only effective way to
oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has been insistent that Milosevic has to resign
first, if there is be a chance for fair elections. But their
campaign shows no sign of bringing about a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join the rallies, calling them
pointless and a waste of time. He has not lent them his party's
organizational skills or helped publicize them on Studio B, the
Belgrade city television station that he controls.
</P>
<P>
   So the alliance leaders, most notably Zoran Djindjic of the
Democratic Party, are convinced that Draskovic intended to see
these rallies fail altogether, perhaps destroying Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rallies did nearly fail. They began last Tuesday.
But by Thursday night, the turnout was so low and dispirited _
fewer than 5,000 people _ that Djindjic talked bitterly about
calling off the rallies or resigning.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief aide, Cedomir Jovanovic, a former student leader,
urged him to forget the speeches and give in to the crowd's desire
for action _ to march, rather than listen. The numbers shot back up
to 20,000 and then to 30,000 or more on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are dropping again, with 5,000 on a rainy
Tuesday night. Wednesday night, the alliance announced a march on
``the forbidden hill,'' the Dedinje district where Milosevic lives.
Alliance officials said this was again a response to a perceived
desire for more action.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said that they believed that they had
saved the rallies and themselves and that they were proud that
Draskovic still had them to deal with. But the main target,
Milosevic, remains remote.
</P>
<P>
   There is some nervousness evident from the government, with the
police in riot gear carefully hidden in case of incidents and a new
crackdown on the nonpayment of taxes, indications of the increasing
economic squeeze that the government faces.
</P>
<P>
   State television remains dismissive about the opposition as NATO
agents and puppets, and counterposters have appeared to mock
alliance posters. One alliance poster shows Djindjic with his child
on his back. The new poster shows President Clinton with Djindjic
on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Important alliance leaders do not really trust Avramovic, who
had made his own approach to Draskovic, though he did tell the
Alliance about that. They apparently believe that Avramovic has his
own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, who will be 80 in two weeks, scoffs at those
concerns. But he said the alliance was too narrow a base to carry
the day against the government, and he is trying, no matter their
concerns, to build a bigger coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The election conference will be run by Dragoljub Micunovic, the
leader of a small party and a friend of Avramovic, and all
opposition parties have agreed to attend. Micunovic said he
expected all the opposition members would ``realize that their
competitors are not in that room, but rather somewhere outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, if successful, will probably include demands for
elections on all levels; revised electoral districts; an open
press, especially television; a revised media law, and strict
supervision by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few ideological differences among the opposition
parties,'' Avramovic said. ``If the round table can agree, then for
the first time, the government will face a real united front. But
you have to have elections. Period. The question is how quickly and
under what conditions. And I hope Mr. Milosevic will see the point
and resign without a fight, for that would win him considerable
support here for not going to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior government official and an executive who had just
seen Milosevic said he was in no mood to resign or schedule early
elections. ``He's just taken 78 days of bombing by NATO,'' the
businessman said. ``Do you really think he's going to surrender to
Zoran Djindjic?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before the 28 teams opened their training camps, the
National Hockey League executive Steve Solomon attended the revival
of ``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway. Solomon, second in command
to Commissioner Gary Bettman, spied a hockey-friendly journalist at
intermission and went into sell mode. The topic was the NHL's new
four-on-four overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting five minutes in sports!'' Solomon said. ``It
will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, but Solomon won't be around to hype it. A couple
weeks later, he announced his resignation, effective Friday, the
opening night of the NHL season. Solomon is going to Univision, the
Spanish television network, where he will head the sports division.
</P>
<P>
   While Bettman seeks Solomon's replacement, the league skates on,
with the Dallas Stars defending their first Stanley Cup and the
2000 playoffs set to end next June. Along with the new overtime
concept, the NHL has partly changed its video-review policy. No
longer will television tape nullify apparently good goals because
an attacking player had a skate in the goalie's crease. The
decision regarding goalie interference will be made only by the
referees, the way it used to be. And there will be two referees for
50 of each team's 82 regular-season games, up from 20 last season.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new team in Atlanta, in a new arena, with plenty
of tickets sold for the Thrashers. The Carolina Hurricanes have a
new arena in Raleigh, N.C., where tickets are not selling as well.
The Los Angeles Kings have a new building, too, and so does the
Colorado Avalanche. Locally, the Rangers signed six free agents and
the Devils stood pat. The Islanders are still in their old
building, with the same ownership considering a sale as the payroll
shrinks, the season-ticket base dwindles and local television
exposure remains uncertain. As for national TV, Fox is gone with
all its incomprehensible camera angles and ABC is in with fewer
regular-season games than Fox and camera work still to be
determined. More games will be seen on ESPN and ESPN2, the cable
partners of ABC and all under the Disney umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   When the puck drops Friday, with the Rangers at Edmonton, it
will be the first season in two decades without Wayne Gretzky, who
began in 1979 with the Oilers and finished in 1999 with the
Rangers. Gretzky and his No. 99 jersey will be honored in pregame
ceremonies Friday night and he will enter the Hall of Fame in
November. And this season could be the last for Hall-bound Dominik
Hasek of Buffalo, who said he plans to retire. Hasek has won the
Vezina trophy for the past three seasons as the league's best
goalie. But Bettman emphasized that the returning younger stars
include Paul Kariya of Anaheim, Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh and Eric
Lindros of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of sports in all ages is that there is always
another generation,'' Bettman said. As for rules changes, Bettman
said, ``The feedback we've gotten has been overwhelmingly
positive'' for the new overtime format. Under it, teams tied after
60 minutes will each get 1 point in the standing, as they always
have for ties. The five-minute, sudden-death overtime will be
played, however, with four skaters apiece, instead of five. If a
team scores to win in overtime, it gets a second point in the
standing for a victory while the losing team keeps its point for
the tie in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Scotty Bowman, the dean of NHL coaches, said he is not
sure how this will affect strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things you put in your mind,'' Bowman said.
``What the standings are. Your opponent. How you're playing in the
game. It will cause a lot of parity. If you tied every game, you'd
have 82 points, going for another 82. You might see some real
offense for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   This should highlight players like Brian Leetch, the Ranger
captain, who is a skilled attacker from his defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the rule, it's exciting,'' Leetch said. ``Teams will
put skill players out there. It will help the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, said that eliminating video
review for crease violations will lead to more collisions between
attackers and goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, there are serious issues. With the collective
bargaining agreement in place until 2004, some teams are resisting
the wage inflation that has raised the average salary to almost
$1.3 million. Among the stars in contract squabbles are: Aleksei
Yashin of Ottawa, Keith Primeau of Carolina, Bill Guerin of
Edmonton, Byron Dafoe of Boston and Darren McCarty of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents still seeking teams include Ulf Samuelsson, Pat
Verbeek, Dmitri Khristich and Joe Murphy. Among old faces in new
places: Theo Fleury from Calgary to Colorado to the Rangers;
Zigmund Palffy from the Islanders to Los Angeles; Niklas Sundstrom
from the Rangers to San Jose, via Tampa Bay; and Grant Fuhr from
St. Louis to Calgary. Kevin Lowe, the former Ranger and Oiler, is
coaching Edmonton. Mario Lemieux, the former Pittsburgh star, now
heads an ownership group that bought the Penguins out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the NHL has not commanded the higher profile that
seemed its destiny five years ago. After Bettman's first full
season, 1993-94, the Rangers had won the Stanley Cup and Solomon
was helping to negotiate big national television deals. Rap artists
wore team jerseys and hockey seemed hip. The cute, new, successful
expansion team was the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, founded by the Disney
Co., an encouraging straw in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   With baseball on strike that autumn, hockey had a wider space on
the big sports stage. And then Bettman, negotiating a collective
bargaining agreement, ordered a labor lockout that lasted 15 weeks.
Perhaps it was only coincidental, but hockey's momentum seemed to
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, as sensitive to criticism as he is dedicated to his
mission, is quick to counter perceptions that hockey has not
attained its expected share of the American sports audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous fragmentation out there,'' Bettman said,
referring to the sports marketplace, especially its television
component. ``The competition, in terms of distribution, is fiercer
than ever before. On a regional basis, we continue to do great. We
have a strong fan base. Our attendance has never been stronger.
We're in more places than ever before. Go back to 1990. We were in
11 U.S. markets. For next season, we will be in 21. All of these
things will take time. We've been heading in the right direction.
It's a long road. We think we're on the right track.''

IN ROME, ANCIENT RUINS STALL RAMP TO `GOD'S PARKING LOT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Workers building a ramp to a vast Vatican garage for
pilgrims recently stumbled on walls of an ancient Roman villa.
</P>
<P>
   Now work has halted on the ramp to ``God's parking lot,'' as it
is known locally, while Italy decides what is more important:
preserving remnants of Rome's imperial past, or building modern
amenities to insure a smooth pilgrims' progress for as many as 30
million visitors expected in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real test, a clash between modernity and the past,''
said Oreste Rutigliano, a spokesman for Italia Nostra, a
conservation association that is lobbying to close down the ramp
and resurrect the ruins. ``To permit modernity to win out would be
a terrible symbol for the jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments draw eye-rolls from some of the engineers and
city officials who have to get Rome and its roads ready by
December.

   ``I think Rome already has plenty of Roman walls, perhaps too
many,'' said Luigi Scavizzi, an engineer with Geosonda, the
construction company that is building the access ramp. ``This may
be a famous site to some, but to me it's just a bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Those bothersome walls date from about the first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Government archaeologists who are now gingerly sifting through
the site say they have not determined who built them, but already
some Italian archaeologists are saying it may have been a villa of
Agrippina, Caligula's sister and Nero's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though not remembered for her sweetness (among other things, she
is accused of poisoning several husbands, including Claudius),
Agrippina had a cheery taste in decor; the walls still show traces
of delicate floral patterns and songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to dig in Rome without stumbling on some
ancient artifact. Two weeks ago, archaeologists at a different site
found a second-century A.D. base of a statue, covered with reliefs
of Hercules, as well as pavement and walls that were once back of
the stage of the theater of Marcellus. In that case, however, the
discovery did not compete with new construction.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the walls discovered under the Janiculum Hill
next to the Vatican last month were the first archaeological find
that required tough choices since preparations for the year 2000
began.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are close to 700 construction sites snarling
traffic in Rome, and more than half are repairs undertaken
specifically for the jubilee celebrations of the Roman Catholic
Church. Holy Years, when the faithful are exhorted to make
pilgrimages to Rome, were introduced in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII,
and now take place every 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is a city haunted by the way previous generations
recklessly bulldozed through buried Greek columns and Roman villas
to modernize the capital. After World War II, construction crews
destroyed whole Roman neighborhoods to build subways and the train
station of Termini, which was inaugurated for the 1950 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   The country's feelings of guilt were most powerfully invoked in
a scene in Fellini's ``Roma'': subway workers digging underground
crash through a wall and stare silently as giant frescoes flake and
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Rome,'' said Emanuele Gatti, a classical archaeologist
who specializes in central Rome. ``We have found a lot. We have
destroyed a lot. And underground there is still an unquantifiable
amount of treasures to be discovered.''

<P>
   Rome is undergoing an extraordinary, $950 million make-over for
the year 2000, but some of its most ambitious plans have been
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   A highway underpass beneath Castel Sant'Angelo was scrapped
after environmental groups, urban planners and archaeologists
protested that the digging would damage the foundations of the
second-century mausoleum built by the Emperor Hadrian. Other
projects have hit different snags. Earlier this month, heavy rains
drove a gaping hole in a newly completed highway tunnel built under
the Appian Way.
</P>
<P>
   The underground parking lot, which is still being built to
accommodate 115 buses and 800 cars, is on Vatican territory near
St. Peter's, a $45 million project whose cost is being evenly
divided by the Italian government and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot is the Vatican's only major jubilee expense;
pilgrims will have to pay to book spaces at big public Masses and
major Holy Year events. The Italian government and the city of Rome
are paying for street repairs and restoration of historic
buildings, including churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not even have to pay to clean up St. Peter's.
The gleaming $5.4 million restored facade, which was unveiled on
Tuesday, was executed and paid for by ENI, the Italian energy
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The ramp is on state-owned land, and its fate falls under the
jurisdiction of the Culture Ministry, which must determine the
value of the find. A special committee is expected to decide soon
whether to stop building the ramp. Italia Nostra officials argue
that since the project envisions two ramps, the Vatican and Rome
can manage with only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have managed with one, we wouldn't have spent the
money to build two,'' Scavizzi retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Mocchegiani-Carpano, an archaeologist for the
government's Rome office of archaeology, said: ``This is not the
find of the century, but we would never destroy the ruins. If they
are of less importance, they could be moved, but such decisions
will be up to the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that option could significantly delay the completion of the
ramp. Officials responsible for readying the city are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the decision that is made,'' said Maurizio
Pucci, an official with the Rome Agency for the Preparation of the
Jubilee, which is coordinating year 2000 projects. ``But we are
awaiting it with trepidation.''

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997. In 121 of the 515 deaths, the
study found, a parent, sibling, or other adult sleeping in the bed
had inadvertently smothered the child. More than three-quarters of
the children who died from ``overlying'' were younger than 3
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, say the study's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Death certificates, he said, also may be misleading. They often
contain little information about the circumstances of the deaths _
whether the parents were using drugs or alcohol, smoked, or
suffered from depression, for instance. In some regions, coroners
may be more likely to attribute the death of an infant from a poor
family to ``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher
income families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 of the 121 overlying deaths in the study were related to
alcohol, according to coroner reports and other data. But the
researchers conceded that the data were sometimes scant and that
other deaths might also be alcohol related.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''

</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at the University
of Notre Dame , has done studies indicating that infants who sleep
with their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

   ABIQUIU, N.M. _ The men and women who had gathered for a

   Talking about growing old and dying has long been taboo in
youth-obsessed America, but in coming years, as their numbers
skyrocket, it may begin to seem as though older Americans talk of
little else. The generation that is retired and approaching its
last years, and especially the baby boomers following them, are
examining what it means to age as no generation before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being yourself, whatever that is,'' said Loretta
Wrobel, 55, a psychotherapist with long gray hair, who had traveled
to Ghost Ranch, an hour north of Santa Fe, from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop at Ghost Ranch _ where O'Keeffe painted into her
90s _ is one of scores of events this year at which ``conscious
aging,'' a term that refers loosely to aging as an opportunity for
human growth and social contribution, is the focus.
</P>
<P>
   Where society has tended to look at old people as patients or
problems, and another popular new school of thought, ``successful
aging,'' celebrates hard-charging octogenarians on skis, conscious
aging is less about physical vitality, and more about learning to
live with these inescapable facts of life, aging and dying.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme is Deepak Chopra, whose book ``Ageless Body,
Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old'' (Crown
Publishers, 1993), suggests that meditation and yoga can keep old
age at bay. But the mainstream is made up of self-professed
realists who say that there is no denying that the body fails _ and
that there lies the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate the John Glenns, and the sexy grandmothers, but
that's trying to transform old age into middle age,'' said Rick
Moody, the former director of the Brookdale Center on Aging at
Hunter College, and author of ``The Five Stages of the Soul''
(Doubleday Anchor Books, 1997), a guide to spiritual growth in the
second half of life. ``Conscious aging is saying that the big
adventure is the inner journey, and that does not have to stop when
you can no longer ski downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Cole, a University of Texas historian who wrote a
cultural history of aging, ``The Journey of Life'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1991), says conscious aging is an effort to break
through the American tendency to think either entirely positively
about old age or entirely negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either all bad _ people get decrepit and they should be
put away in nursing homes,'' Cole said, ``or it's all good _ we all
automatically become wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to face the complex reality of growing old, Cole
and others say, is to talk about it. And at Ghost Ranch, there was
a full weekend of talk, on subjects from retirement communities to
Hindu, Buddhist and American Indian views of aging and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do with these extra years?'' asked Dr. Drew Leder,
a 44-year-old professor of Western and Eastern philosophy at Loyola
College, in his opening talk.
</P>
<P>
   Proposing that aging be used as ``a curriculum for the soul,''
Leder asked the participants to talk about their own awakening to
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Greensmith, 64, a retired teacher from Prescott, Ariz.,
talked about her role in a community theater production of ``The
Velveteen Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else in the cast was a child,'' Mrs. Greensmith said.
``I was the fairy godmother, but they called me the fairy
grandmother. I suddenly saw myself through their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the thought had not occurred to her, said Mrs. Greensmith,
who has gray hair, to the children she was undeniably old. And that
was three years ago, when she was 61.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul Rollins, the epiphany was his parents' unhappy old age.
As a young couple, and even well past middle age, he said, they had
been part of a vibrant community in North Carolina. But they did
not anticipate growing old, Rollins said, and almost overnight
their friends moved away, or died.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents died alone in a nursing home,'' he said. ``That
transformed me. I decided I wanted to age with friends, not
strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar experience motivated Geoffrey Landis, a 47-year-old
artist, to found Jubilados, the Buddhist-based group that sponsored
the conference and is planning an affordable, spiritual retirement
community in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Landis told the group that his mother, Elizabeth Landis, who had
been a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, had died, marginalized and
invisible, in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion turned to the wisdom of old people in general.
Melinda Hurst offered a cautionary view, saying, ``You're not going
to get wise just because you get old.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurst, who sits on the ethics board at Cedars Sinai Hospital
in Los Angeles, said later that she had come to the conference to
explore her deepest fears about aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of being left behind,'' she said. ``I'm afraid of
the fact that I can't figure out the damn computer. I think the gap
is very painful between people who are plugged into technology and
those of us who aren't. Things went very slowly when we were
growing up. Now, my god, you get a computer, and six months later,
they tell you to get a new one.''
</P>
<P>
   She will probably replace her Powerbook soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roszak, the author of the book about the 1960s ``The
Making of a Counterculture'' (University of California Press,
1968), talked about his latest book, ``America the Wise'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1998), and his view that baby boomers would bring about a
more compassionate society in their old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are sitting in this room today are the wave of
the future,'' said Roszak, who recently retired as a professor of
history at California State University at Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, and with all the emphasis at the conference on the
joys of later life, it is not easy growing old in America. Carol
Segrave, 57, who did the publicity for the conference, is a
consultant on conscious aging. She meditates and quotes the
68-year-old author Ram Dass on the spiritual growth that can come
with physical decline. At the same time, she is mindful of the
youth culture that reigns in Southern California, where she lives
and works. And when the subject of plastic surgery came up, Ms.
Segrave, who is from Santa Monica, did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it,'' she said. ``I'm going to start with my eyes.'' &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ Despite the soaring value of the yen, Toyota Motor
Corp. introduced a subcompact car Wednesday that will be imported
from Japan and will be priced well below comparable models made by
Detroit auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, such a move would probably have outraged American
auto executives, prompting them to call for federal investigations
into whether Japanese cars were being dumped on the United States
market. But there was silence Wednesday from the industry in
Detroit, which has become increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
   The new subcompact, the Echo starts at just $9,995, the first
Toyota in five years to be priced in the United States for less
than $10,000. The Echo costs thousands less than competitors
including the Ford Escort ($11,760), Dodge Neon ($12,460) and even
Ford's newest small car offering, the Focus ($11,865).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Toyota executives say that selling the car at that price
is profitable for the company and that the low price comes from
engineering advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the low price was prompted by the last surge in
the yen's value,'' said Donald V. Esmond, group vice president and
general manager of Toyota's United States arm. ``It probably was
due to the yen four years ago, when the yen was so strong and our
cars were so high-priced.
</P>
<P>
   The yen briefly peaked at just 79.85 to the dollar in April 1995
before retreating below 100. The yen closed Wednesday at 106.98 to
the dollar, after climbing more than 15 percent over the last 10
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rally, which tends to make all imports more expensive,
has been powered by Japan's apparent emergence from its longest
recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Okuda, the chairman of the Toyota, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that the globalization of the auto industry had
made trade frictions less severe between the United States and
Japan. ``That is how we in private business, as well as in the
government, see it,'' Okuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is harder now for American executives to call for
people to ``buy American.'' The Chrysler Corp., whose former
chairman, Lee Iacocca, prominently accused Japan of dumping cars in
the United States, was acquired by a German company and is now
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many other auto makers with headquarters in foreign
countries are building huge numbers of cars and trucks in the
United States. In the 1999 model year, Toyota built in North
America 74 percent of its cars and trucks sold here, Honda built 82
percent and Nissan built 58 percent. BMW, Mitsubishi, Mazda and
Subaru also build cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the General Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. sell
cars around the world and own major auto makers in other countries.
Ford even owns 33.4 percent of Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday, investors can buy Toyota's American
depository receipts under the symbol TM on the New York Stock
Exchange. Toyota shares also began trading Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange. Okuda even rang the New York Stock Exchange's
opening bell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The current surge in the yen marks the first real potential for
trade issues to roil the waters in the auto industry since
Daimler-Benz bought and Chrysler last November.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler still employ their
longtime trade lobbyist, Stephen J. Collins, as president of the
Automotive Trade Policy Council. He continues to warn about the
threats from Japanese competition and said Wednesday, ``There's a
sense of renewed aggressivity of Japan in the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the country's trade deficit with Japan is once
again widening but conceded that part of the increase is coming
from cars imported to help quench an unexpectedly strong American
auto market _ one that United States auto makers are also
struggling to supply.
</P>
<P>
   Though such comments used to be backed up with frequent
pronouncements by the chief executives of Detroit auto makers, that
is no longer the case. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and GM officials
declined to comment Wednesday on the yen or Toyota's pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda said Toyota had set a goal of capturing 10 percent of the
American market _ compared with 8.6 percent in the first eight
months of this year _ but had set no timetable. ``The rise in the
value of the yen will not affect our future activities here,'' he
added. ``It will not affect how soon we attain that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also plans to increase its share of the European market
from 3 percent to 5 percent by 2005. Worldwide, Toyota sells about
9 percent of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda said the yen's effect on Toyota's American operations
would continue to shrink in the future as more of the company's
vehicles are assembled in the United States. But the Echo, a
subcompact with expansive headroom and crisp handling, will be
imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota expects to sell at least 50,000 of the 2000 model year
Echos in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers shaved about $2,600 off the price of the Toyota
Tercel, the car the Echo replaced. Michael J. O'Brien, a Toyota
executive, said engineers designed the Echo with fewer separate
components and with parts that were easier to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they saved $12 a car by redesigning the Echo's
air-conditioning unit in one piece instead of three. And they saved
$30 to $35 a car by bolting the power-steering pump, alternator and
air-conditioning compressor directly to the Echo's engine block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those changes added up,'' he said. ``Anytime there's a part,
there's handling requirements, and that all adds up to money.''

BILLIONAIRE, ONCE REFUGEE, DONATES MILLIONS TO SMITHSONIAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A refugee from the 1956 Hungarian uprising who came
penniless to the United States will give the Smithsonian
Institution $60 million, its largest donation ever, the Smithsonian
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The donor, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, became a billionaire by leasing
airliners, and his gift to the Smithsonian will be directed to a
new museum at Dulles International Airport to open in four years
that will contain objects too big _ like the space shuttle and a
747 jetliner _ for its National Air and Space Museum on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the gift, the Smithsonian is expected to name the
Dulles museum for Udvar-Hazy (pronounced OOD-var HAH-zee), perhaps
at the next meeting of its governing board of regents in January.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the space shuttle and the 747, the Dulles museum will
also house the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima in 1945; an SR-71, once a secret spy plane, and a B-17,
another World War II bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy was traveling in Asia Wednesday and not available for
comment, but the chairman of his leasing company, Leslie Gonda,
described how Udvar-Hazy's knack for aviation had brought him a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he was an undergraduate at UCLA, he gave classes to
graduate students in airline management and administration,'' Gonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the University of California at Los Angeles that
Udvar-Hazy learned that he could make money by buying an airplane
from one company and selling it or leasing it to another.
</P>
<P>
   According to an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 1990,
Udvar-Hazy learned in 1967 that Air New Zealand was trying to sell
an old Lockheed Electra and told the airline that he would sell it
for a 5 percent commission. Air New Zealand agreed and Udvar-Hazy
sold the airplane and made a $50,000 commission.
</P>
<P>
   He was then 21 years old and he said that he carried on the deal
via Telex because, he said, ``I was afraid if someone saw me,
they'd be disappointed in how young I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy is now 53 and earlier this year The Los Angeles
Business Journal estimated his fortune at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Udvar-Hazy, Gonda and Gonda's son, Louis, sold their
company, the International Lease Finance Corp., to American
International Group, the insurance company, for $1.3 billion in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy and the elder Gonda stayed on to run the company for
the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Gonda is also a Hungarian refugee, now 80, who lost much of his
family in the Holocaust and came to the United States in 1963 after
going first to Venezuela in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He said Udvar-Hazy and his brother, Andre, were taken by their
parents, Ernest and Ethel, to Sweden when the Soviet Union put down
the Hungarian uprising in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The family then moved to New York City, where Udvar-Hazy
attended elite Stuyvesant High School, and then to California.
Udvar-Hazy lives with his wife, Christine, their four children and
his mother (his father has since died) in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Morten S. Beyer, chairman of MBA, an aviation consulting firm,
said the company Udvar-Hazy founded is one of the largest owners of
Boeing and Airbus planes, although it has no 747s like the one that
will be installed at Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like the economics for the lessor,'' Beyer said of
Udvar-Hazy's aversion to the 747.
</P>
<P>
   After word of the donation got out, the secretary of the
Smithsonian, I. Michael Heyman, noted that it was the latest in a
series of ``exemplary gifts to the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was the bequest by Dr. Paul Singer of his huge
collection of ancient Chinese artifacts to the Smithsonian's Arthur
M. Sackler Gallery announced on Sept. 8. The collection has been
valued at $50 million to $60 million.

COMMENTARY: MANICHAEAN MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's assume the curator of the National Gallery in Washington
came up with a show called ``Outrage.'' It featured a statue of
Moses wearing a Nazi swastika on his chest, a painting of a violent
Martin Luther King Jr. forcing Elizabeth Cady Stanton into
submission, and an avant-garde collage of the cutest puppy you ever
saw being tortured to death by a sadistic homosexual. As Mort Sahl
used to say, ``Is there anybody I haven't offended?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes; Christians. In a real-life abuse of public responsibility,
good taste and artistic license, the curator of the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is presenting ``Sensation,'' featuring a portrait of the
Virgin Mary with her breast decorated by a piece of what is
described delicately as elephant dung. (As they say with a smirk at
the Brooklyn Museum, ``dung happens.'')
</P>
<P>
   The museum's serenely elitist board members are either
incredibly stupid or knew _ and did not care _ that this would (a)
offend the religious, (b) anger and divide the city, (c) make a ton
of money for the exhibition's owners, and (d) make the museum's
staff the heroes of free expression with their own set.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew, or should have, that their publicly financed
thumb in the eye of the faithful was a supremely political act.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani had to respond to reflect his values, and did;
the artist's press agent in London had to denounce the mayor's
withdrawal of funds as ``totalitarian and fascist,'' as he
delightedly did; and the mayor's senatorial opponent, Hillary
Clinton, had to march in liberal lock step with the rest of the
city's embarrassed, unhappy but principled cultural establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the hubristic Brooklyn Museum plunged the city into a
lose-lose battle. It's now the ``right to free artistic
expression'' versus ``the accountability of the spending of public
funds.'' Everybody to the ramparts and to hell with comity.
Absolutists of the world, unite: Go to court over the issue of free
hate speech and grind the losers' faces in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever wins, everybody loses. When basic principles are in
conflict, democracies work out compromises that reflect the
majority and protect the minority. A civil libertarian believes not
only in liberty but in civility.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as a big First Amendment type. I was
all for the Nazis' right to parade through Skokie and think the
flag-burning amendment is a travesty and sedition must be defended.
I'm for a private gallery's right to display outrage and sensation
and an offended public's right to picket peaceably.
</P>
<P>
   But limits exist: you can't steal this essay, protected by
copyright, and put it on your Web site. Nor can a museum defiantly
spend money raised by taxation for causes opposed by the majority
or disgust a significant minority. Sooner or later, the public's
elected representatives direct that spending or are replaced.
Freedom of expression is a right, but public payment for it is not
an entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Free-speech lawyers I know and respect say the mayor will lose
because the Supreme Court frowns on any ``penalty on disfavored
viewpoints.'' Maybe so; maybe the court's decision last year that
governments could impose a decency standard on taxpayer-paid
expression will not apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But believers in unfettered expression looking for an exciting
``Kulturkampf'' to drive the Yahoos from the temple should stop
before they win a Pyrrhic victory. If public museums win in federal
court the right to offend egregiously without being punished by
losing their subsidies, they will lose their subsidies beforehand.
The art world is thoughtlessly flirting with a democratic public's
pre-emptive censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Surely artists would be freer to shock if unworried by the loss
of taxpayer support. Privately financed institutions and commercial
galleries have that constitutionally protected advantage. But is
heavier reliance on private philanthropy what our cultural
Houyhnhnms really want?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the authors of this Manichaean madness _ museum
curator, chairman and the benefactors of ``Sensation'' _ send their
contributions directly to the Buchanan campaign? Nothing is helping
bigots more in dividing religions and races.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs mediators, not gladiators. This is not the Good
Fight; this is the wrong fight. Settle it before everybody loses.  &QL;

PROSECUTORS BEGIN INVESTIGATION OF MOSCOW BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian prosecutors have opened the first criminal
investigation into a Moscow bank since the government was rocked by
accusations of money laundering through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the prosecutor's investigative unit, Vladimir
Minayev, said Russian authorities had uncovered evidence of
suspicious deals carried out by the Flamingo Bank, a small bank
based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev declined to say whether Russian officials had uncovered
information that Flamingo had channeled money through suspicious
accounts at the Bank of New York. He said the investigation was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian executives say Flamingo was one of several Russian banks
suspected of funneling under-the table payments from Russian
importers through foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is a widespread means of avoiding taxes and
tariffs. And some Russian businessman have said it may account for
some of the money that passed through accounts at the Bank of New
York that the FBI is examining. Some $7.5 billion passed through
their accounts over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Flamingo Bank did not respond to repeated requests
for comment. The bank received a license in October 1994, according
to the Central Bank. It has a license to deal in foreign currency,
as well as rubles. But its official assets are so small that it has
escaped attention by some Western bank-rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspicions involving the Bank of New York were
publicized, Russian officials first denounced the charges as a
conspiracy to humiliate Russia. More recently, however, leading
officials and tycoons have argued that Moscow should take visible
steps to crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia's business community has suddenly been
swept by a new sense of rectitude. There is, however, a pervasive
sense that many Russian executives, legitimate as well as shady,
will be hurt as long Russia is seen as deeply corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev was among the officials who recently traveled to the
United States to discuss the money-laundering case that is swirling
around the Bank of New York. He insisted in an interview that the
investigation into the Flamingo Bank had not been prompted by the
United States, but was based on Russian law-enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev said the investigators who searched the bank had found a
sum of hard currency with no documentation to indicate where it
came from. Russian press reports said the hard currency totaled
$430,000.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions of money laundering, Minayev said, were one reason
that Russian authorities began their investigation. ``We have not
launched a campaign against the banks,'' he said. ``But we are
trying to investigate illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo is not the only bank that Russian executives said
might be linked to schemes to avoid tariffs. Other banks include
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank and the Sobin Bank. Those banks have
denied violations.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers questioned whether the case against Flamingo was
the start of a serious anticorruption drive. Rather, they said, the
authorities are making an example of Flamingo to impress the West.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant published an article on the case under
the headline, ``The General Prosecutor's Office Launders
Reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamingo, Kommersant wrote, is a ``scapegoat in a noisy
anticorruption campaign.''

   NEW YORK _ As Bobby Valentine hurried into Shea Stadium for
Wednesday night's game with the Braves, a middle-aged fan, James
McCahan of Brooklyn, handed the Mets' manager a big white envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me: `Hey, Bobby, do me a favor. I scored every game
this season and here are my scoresheets,''' Valentine was saying
during batting practice. ``He told me: `I love the team. Show the
guys these scoresheets so they'll know how good they've been all
year.' I haven't yet, but I'm going to show it to them before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything for inspiration. Anything to snap the Mets out of their
seven-game losing streak that began last week in Atlanta when John
Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux put them into a tailspin that
continued in Philadelphia and has now jeopardized the Mets' hope
for a wild-card berth in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the Mets lost again to Glavine, now 13-11, and
Wednesday night they were confronted by Maddux, who went to the
mound with a 19-8 record. In Thursday night's finale, they will be
facing Kevin Millwood, the 24-year-old right-hander with an 18-7
record and a 2.69 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about the reasons for any slump, Valentine mentioned
``injuries, fatigue, and sometimes good pitchers put you in a
slump.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that maybe those good pitchers in Atlanta
had triggered this Mets' slump, he agreed, saying: ``Yeah,
probably. That was the start of this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mets don't recuperate in time, they will be the first
team to have blown the wild card in a collapse since the wild card
was dealt into the postseason in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have blown the pennant when the pennant meant first
place either in the league or the division, notably the 1964
Philadelphia Phillies, who were 6 1-2 games up with 12 games
remaining. But the Phillies proceeded to lose 10 straight before
winning their last two in Cincinnati. Too little, too late, as the
St. Louis Cardinals rallied to win the pennant and then disposed of
the Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Mauch, then the Phillies' manager, acknowledged that he
``just wore the pitching staff out,'' alluding to having started
Jim Bunning and Chris Short on two days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillies returned on their charter flight from
Cincinnati that final Sunday of the season, some 2,000 fans were at
the Philadelphia airport to cheer and console them. As their plane
rolled up to the gate, Mauch turned to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the first one off,'' he said. ``You guys didn't
lose it. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillies' owner, Bob Carpenter, didn't hold Mauch
responsible. Mauch, who had been hired in 1961, remained the
Phillies' manager until he was dismissed during the 1968 season. He
later managed the Montreal Expos, the Minnesota Twins and the
California Angels, but he's mostly remembered as the best manager
never to guide a team to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Two other teams _ the 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers and the 1978 Boston
Red Sox _ blew big leads, but didn't really collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Between games of a doubleheader on Aug. 11, 1951, the Brooklyn
Dodgers were 13{ games ahead of the New York Giants, who would
catch them on the final weekend of the season and then win the
pennant on Bobby Thomson's home run off Ralph Branca at the Polo
Grounds in the ninth inning of their decisive third playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers had not really collapsed. They finished with a
26-22 stretch, but the Giants were a remarkable 37-7.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 Red Sox were 14 games ahead of the Yankees on July 11.
Then the Yankees, sweeping four games at Fenway Park in a September
massacre, jumped past them before the Red Sox won their final eight
games to force a one-game divisional playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been prouder of anybody in baseball,'' Don Zimmer,
then the Red Sox manager, told his players. ``Don't nobody ever
tell me this team choked.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Bucky Dent hit a home run, only his fifth that
season, off Mike Torrez into the screen above the Green Monster at
Fenway Park. The Yankees went on to win the American League pennant
in a playoff with the Kansas City Royals, then won their second
straight World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So those '78 Red Sox didn't really collapse. Neither did those
'51 Dodgers. But the '64 Phillies did. And now the Mets might be
discarding a wild card.

PROSECUTORS BEGIN INVESTIGATION OF MOSCOW BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian prosecutors have opened the first criminal
investigation into a Moscow bank since the government was rocked by
accusations of money laundering through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the prosecutor's investigative unit, Vladimir
Minayev, said Russian authorities had uncovered evidence of
suspicious deals carried out by the Flamingo Bank, a small bank
based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev declined to say whether Russian officials had uncovered
information that Flamingo had channeled money through suspicious
accounts at the Bank of New York. He said the investigation was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian executives say Flamingo was one of several Russian banks
suspected of funneling under-the table payments from Russian
importers through foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is a widespread means of avoiding taxes and
tariffs. And some Russian businessman have said it may account for
some of the money that passed through accounts at the Bank of New
York that the FBI is examining. Some $7.5 billion passed through
their accounts over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Flamingo Bank did not respond to repeated requests
for comment. The bank received a license in October 1994, according
to the Central Bank. It has a license to deal in foreign currency,
as well as rubles. But its official assets are so small that it has
escaped attention by some Western bank-rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspicions involving the Bank of New York were
publicized, Russian officials first denounced the charges as a
conspiracy to humiliate Russia. More recently, however, leading
officials and tycoons have argued that Moscow should take visible
steps to crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia's business community has suddenly been
swept by a new sense of rectitude. There is, however, a pervasive
sense that many Russian executives, legitimate as well as shady,
will be hurt as long Russia is seen as deeply corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev was among the officials who recently traveled to the
United States to discuss the money-laundering case that is swirling
around the Bank of New York. He insisted in an interview that the
investigation into the Flamingo Bank had not been prompted by the
United States, but was based on Russian law-enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev said the investigators who searched the bank had found a
sum of hard currency with no documentation to indicate where it
came from. Russian press reports said the hard currency totaled
$430,000.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions of money laundering, Minayev said, were one reason
that Russian authorities began their investigation. ``We have not
launched a campaign against the banks,'' he said. ``But we are
trying to investigate illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo is not the only bank that Russian executives said
might be linked to schemes to avoid tariffs. Other banks include
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank and the Sobin Bank. Those banks have
denied violations.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers questioned whether the case against Flamingo was
the start of a serious anticorruption drive. Rather, they said, the
authorities are making an example of Flamingo to impress the West.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant published an article on the case under
the headline, ``The General Prosecutor's Office Launders
Reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamingo, Kommersant wrote, is a ``scapegoat in a noisy
anticorruption campaign.''

COMMENTARY: MANICHAEAN MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's assume the curator of the National Gallery in Washington
came up with a show called ``Outrage.'' It featured a statue of
Moses wearing a Nazi swastika on his chest, a painting of a violent
Martin Luther King Jr. forcing Elizabeth Cady Stanton into
submission, and an avant-garde collage of the cutest puppy you ever
saw being tortured to death by a sadistic homosexual. As Mort Sahl
used to say, ``Is there anybody I haven't offended?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes; Christians. In a real-life abuse of public responsibility,
good taste and artistic license, the curator of the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is presenting ``Sensation,'' featuring a portrait of the
Virgin Mary with her breast decorated by a piece of what is
described delicately as elephant dung. (As they say with a smirk at
the Brooklyn Museum, ``dung happens.'')
</P>
<P>
   The museum's serenely elitist board members are either
incredibly stupid or knew _ and did not care _ that this would (a)
offend the religious, (b) anger and divide the city, (c) make a ton
of money for the exhibition's owners, and (d) make the museum's
staff the heroes of free expression with their own set.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew, or should have, that their publicly financed
thumb in the eye of the faithful was a supremely political act.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani had to respond to reflect his values, and did;
the artist's press agent in London had to denounce the mayor's
withdrawal of funds as ``totalitarian and fascist,'' as he
delightedly did; and the mayor's senatorial opponent, Hillary
Clinton, had to march in liberal lock step with the rest of the
city's embarrassed, unhappy but principled cultural establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the hubristic Brooklyn Museum plunged the city into a
lose-lose battle. It's now the ``right to free artistic
expression'' versus ``the accountability of the spending of public
funds.'' Everybody to the ramparts and to hell with comity.
Absolutists of the world, unite: Go to court over the issue of free
hate speech and grind the losers' faces in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever wins, everybody loses. When basic principles are in
conflict, democracies work out compromises that reflect the
majority and protect the minority. A civil libertarian believes not
only in liberty but in civility.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as a big First Amendment type. I was
all for the Nazis' right to parade through Skokie and think the
flag-burning amendment is a travesty and sedition must be defended.
I'm for a private gallery's right to display outrage and sensation
and an offended public's right to picket peaceably.
</P>
<P>
   But limits exist: you can't steal this essay, protected by
copyright, and put it on your Web site. Nor can a museum defiantly
spend money raised by taxation for causes opposed by the majority
or disgust a significant minority. Sooner or later, the public's
elected representatives direct that spending or are replaced.
Freedom of expression is a right, but public payment for it is not
an entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Free-speech lawyers I know and respect say the mayor will lose
because the Supreme Court frowns on any ``penalty on disfavored
viewpoints.'' Maybe so; maybe the court's decision last year that
governments could impose a decency standard on taxpayer-paid
expression will not apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But believers in unfettered expression looking for an exciting
``Kulturkampf'' to drive the Yahoos from the temple should stop
before they win a Pyrrhic victory. If public museums win in federal
court the right to offend egregiously without being punished by
losing their subsidies, they will lose their subsidies beforehand.
The art world is thoughtlessly flirting with a democratic public's
pre-emptive censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Surely artists would be freer to shock if unworried by the loss
of taxpayer support. Privately financed institutions and commercial
galleries have that constitutionally protected advantage. But is
heavier reliance on private philanthropy what our cultural
Houyhnhnms really want?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the authors of this Manichaean madness _ museum
curator, chairman and the benefactors of ``Sensation'' _ send their
contributions directly to the Buchanan campaign? Nothing is helping
bigots more in dividing religions and races.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs mediators, not gladiators. This is not the Good
Fight; this is the wrong fight. Settle it before everybody loses.  &QL;

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interrogation techniques used during Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile were the same used by British
forces in Northern Ireland and found by the European Court of Human
Rights not to constitute torture, the lawyer leading the general's
defense told a London court. Spain is seeking the extradition of
Pinochet, 83, to stand trial on torture charges.

   BRITAIN: BLAIR INVITATION TO TORIES
</P>
<P>
   A day after assailing ``conservative forces,'' in his address to
the annual Labor Party convention, for holding Britain back, Prime
Minister Tony Blair invited Conservatives to desert their party for
his, saying Labor now represented ``traditional'' conservative
values better than a ``Conservative Party more extreme than ever.''
The Tory leader William Hague said Blair's attack showed
``incredible hypocrisy.''

   Scotland opened its first all-Gaelic public primary school in an

The school, in Glasgow, has 109 students and will hold all classes

U.N. IS READY TO CONSIDER SENDING PEACEKEEPERS TO SIERRA LEONE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council is preparing to consider
whether to dispatch peacekeepers to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   A British draft resolution circulating Wednesday among Security
Council members proposes sending peacekeeping troops for an initial
period of 12 months. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended last
Thursday that 6,000 soldiers be deployed in Sierra Leone, which has
been ravaged by years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told the Security Council Wednesday that Africans are
closely watching its deliberations on Sierra Leone and Congo,
another country torn by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not be surprised to hear me say that many Africans,
remembering the failure to intervene effectively in Rwanda to stop
the genocide, at times regard the council as indifferent to the
continent's plight,'' Annan said. He referred to the ethnic
slaughter of more than a half-million Tutsi by Hutu militias in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers are needed in Sierra Leone to enforce a fragile
peace agreement between the government and rebels that was signed
in July in Lome, Togo, by helping to disarm as many as 45,000
combatants and restoring stability in a country reeling from
lawlessness and atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the numbers, but in general we are very
supportive of the idea,'' an American diplomat said. ``I think
there is a general recognition that the U.N. needs to be involved
following a reduction in the numbers of Nigerian troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians account for most of the 12,000 troops in the West
African peacekeeping force now in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has said that
intervening in Sierra Leone is costing his country $1 million a
day, which it cannot afford, and he has told Annan that he would
have to begin withdrawing his troops at the rate of 2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, several diplomats said, the deployment of
U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone would involve transferring as
many as four battalions of the Nigerian troops to U.N. command,
because they are already there and know the problems, and paying
their costs through the U.N. peacekeeping budget.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo is said to be amenable.
</P>
<P>
   In his report last Thursday, the secretary-general estimated
that the U.N. mission would need six infantry battalions and other
support units with helicopters and armored personnel carriers.
Annan expressed the hope that ``a significant part'' of the
peacekeeping force would come from West Africa, including Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. has only an observer mission in Sierra Leone, amounting
to 105 military observers and two medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Annan envisaged deploying U.N. peacekeepers throughout Sierra
Leone, while leaving the security of the capital, Freetown, and the
international airport at Lungi to what remained of the existing
West African force.
</P>
<P>
   John Hirsch, the former U.S. ambassador to Sierra Leone, said
that the country could slide back into chaos without a U.N.
presence. ``After 30 years of internal collapse and eight years of
war, if there's ever going to be a revival of Sierra Leone, it is
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The British draft resolution also urges Foday Sankoh, the leader
of the principal rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, to
return to Sierra Leone and assume his obligations under the Lome
peace accord. The rebels were promised a number of ministerial
posts in a coalition government, but in return were expected to
help disarm their fighters.

BILLIONAIRE, ONCE REFUGEE, DONATES MILLIONS TO SMITHSONIAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A refugee from the 1956 Hungarian uprising who came
penniless to the United States will give the Smithsonian
Institution $60 million, its largest donation ever, the Smithsonian
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The donor, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, became a billionaire by leasing
airliners, and his gift to the Smithsonian will be directed to a
new museum at Dulles International Airport to open in four years
that will contain objects too big _ like the space shuttle and a
747 jetliner _ for its National Air and Space Museum on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the gift, the Smithsonian is expected to name the
Dulles museum for Udvar-Hazy (pronounced OOD-var HAH-zee), perhaps
at the next meeting of its governing board of regents in January.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the space shuttle and the 747, the Dulles museum will
also house the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima in 1945; an SR-71, once a secret spy plane, and a B-17,
another World War II bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy was traveling in Asia Wednesday and not available for
comment, but the chairman of his leasing company, Leslie Gonda,
described how Udvar-Hazy's knack for aviation had brought him a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he was an undergraduate at UCLA, he gave classes to
graduate students in airline management and administration,'' Gonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the University of California at Los Angeles that
Udvar-Hazy learned that he could make money by buying an airplane
from one company and selling it or leasing it to another.
</P>
<P>
   According to an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 1990,
Udvar-Hazy learned in 1967 that Air New Zealand was trying to sell
an old Lockheed Electra and told the airline that he would sell it
for a 5 percent commission. Air New Zealand agreed and Udvar-Hazy
sold the airplane and made a $50,000 commission.
</P>
<P>
   He was then 21 years old and he said that he carried on the deal
via Telex because, he said, ``I was afraid if someone saw me,
they'd be disappointed in how young I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy is now 53 and earlier this year The Los Angeles
Business Journal estimated his fortune at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Udvar-Hazy, Gonda and Gonda's son, Louis, sold their
company, the International Lease Finance Corp., to American
International Group, the insurance company, for $1.3 billion in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Udvar-Hazy and the elder Gonda stayed on to run the company for
the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Gonda is also a Hungarian refugee, now 80, who lost much of his
family in the Holocaust and came to the United States in 1963 after
going first to Venezuela in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He said Udvar-Hazy and his brother, Andre, were taken by their
parents, Ernest and Ethel, to Sweden when the Soviet Union put down
the Hungarian uprising in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The family then moved to New York City, where Udvar-Hazy
attended elite Stuyvesant High School, and then to California.
Udvar-Hazy lives with his wife, Christine, their four children and
his mother (his father has since died) in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Morten S. Beyer, chairman of MBA, an aviation consulting firm,
said the company Udvar-Hazy founded is one of the largest owners of
Boeing and Airbus planes, although it has no 747s like the one that
will be installed at Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like the economics for the lessor,'' Beyer said of
Udvar-Hazy's aversion to the 747.
</P>
<P>
   After word of the donation got out, the secretary of the
Smithsonian, I. Michael Heyman, noted that it was the latest in a
series of ``exemplary gifts to the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was the bequest by Dr. Paul Singer of his huge
collection of ancient Chinese artifacts to the Smithsonian's Arthur
M. Sackler Gallery announced on Sept. 8. The collection has been
valued at $50 million to $60 million.

EDUCATORS FOCUS ON `PAIN' OF STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, N.C., Wis., Iowa)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when most of the nation's governors and dozens
of corporate leaders joined President Clinton at an education
summit meeting in Palisades, N.Y., only 14 states had standards
outlining what students should know and be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the word ``standards'' a near mantra of politicians
and educators _ by spring, 49 states will have adopted some form of
them in at least some grades and subjects _ the delicate and
politically charged task of meeting such lofty guidelines is
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, millions of students could fail, or be held back.
</P>
<P>
   To anticipate such hazards and sustain the momentum generated at
the last gathering, the same group is reconvening Thursday and
Friday at the same place, an IBM conference center on the New
York-New Jersey border.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to an opening talk from Clinton, the 117 leaders
_ including 28 governors, 21 state school superintendents and 34
executives _ are committed to figuring out what comes next:
defining the standards so that they make sense to students and
parents; setting aside new funds to retrain teachers; drafting
tests that gauge the students' new knowledge, and standing firm
when some students invariably fall short.
</P>
<P>
   How the leaders decide to proceed will ripple across the country
in the coming months and years, affecting the academic experiences,
and futures, of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   IBM chairman Louis Gerstner, and the driving force behind both
conferences, said the current gathering would focus on what he
called ``the pain,'' which he defined as the sting that teachers,
principals and students feel when they realize that they are now
being held accountable for their performance and will be
disciplined accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `Oh my God, these kids are going to fail,'
or, `They're not going to make it, so we need to lower standards
because we're going to hurt their esteem,''' Gerstner said in an
interview. ``We understand the pain. And we're going to have to
deal with it. But we're not going to deal with it by backing off.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are already indications that some states are doing
just that. In New York, some teachers and principals are saying
that although a new high school graduation test is more difficult
than previous versions, a lower passing score and lenient grading
guidelines make it easier for students to pass.
</P>
<P>
   While standards have been hailed as a means to insure that
students in rich and poor schools alike are covering the same high
ground, there is hardly unanimity among educators that establishing
such goals is the best course for American schools. Among the
movement's loudest critics is Alfie Kohn, an author whose most
recent book, ``The Schools Our Children Deserve'' (Houghton
Mifflin), laments that standards stunt the creativity and
flexibility of the classroom teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Iowa,'' Kohn said, of the only state that has
declined to write standards, deferring instead to districts and
schools. ``Because of the sensibility reflected in this conference,
whole schools across the country have been transformed into giant
test-prep centers, where not much thinking is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teachers union, said his members support the
idea that they should be ``held accountable for student learning.''
But he added that when he addresses the conference participants, he
intends to give them a bracing report from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' he wrote in a recent essay, ``the
prevailing mindset among too many politicians is something out of
`Field of Dreams': `If we set high standards, students will
magically achieve.' And they are deluding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of such criticism, Gerstner and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, who are leading the event, have put together a 100-page
briefing book of the states' experiences with standards, warts and
all. They write, for example, that many states have crammed their
standards with so many topics to memorize as to paralyze students,
and then have written tests that bear no connection to the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   They also lament that although so many states have put standards
on the books in the last three years, in no state has a majority of
either fourth- or eighth-grade students been judged to be
``proficient readers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the pain that Gerstner has described, the
briefing book refers to New York state, among others, where more
than half of all fourth graders failed a new English test given
last January, a performance that shattered the confidence of even
the most elite districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is bleak, though.
</P>
<P>
   The conference attendees, including the leaders of Du Pont,
Glaxo Wellcome and Novell, are likely to hear much about Texas,
where 76 percent of third graders passed the state's standardized
test of academic skills last year, up from 58 percent in 1994. Gov.
George W. Bush, who presided over much of that progress, will not
be in attendance, citing presidential campaign commitments.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. James Hunt will be there, though, and he
intends to discuss his own success story: a rise in test scores
that he has attributed, at least in part, to incentives that raise
teachers' salaries by as much as $1,500 for their schools' good
work, and threatens their dismissal if their students lag.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner has said he hopes that the participants will depart
Friday by issuing a statement of consensus on the direction the
states should head next. Given that the composition of the group is
bipartisan, and the egos strong, it is unclear how much they will
be able to say, especially with divisive issues like publicly
financed vouchers at the top of the agenda of many governors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the predecessor of the 1996 summit meeting, a similar
event convened by President George Bush in 1989, ended on a rousing
note, with commitments to make American children first in the world
in math and science by 2000. It is a goal that, according to
standardized tests, is nowhere within reach.

BRADLEY SEEKS TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE HEALTH CARE A PRIORITY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's health care proposal
seeks to put the issue back on the national agenda after the
failure to pass universal health insurance in 1994 humiliated
President Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And while his Senate career was not marked by leadership on
health care, it was distinguished by spotlighting important,
complex and sometimes stupefyingly dull issues, from the debt of
developing countries to tax simplification. He made Washington pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Bradley argued insistently that having nearly
one-fifth of the population uninsured was an urgent national
problem and that it could not be solved on the cheap. His $65
billion-a-year plan, he said, involves ``a great deal of money.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, it is far from clear that it can be solved as cheaply
as Bradley proposed; subsidies of up to $1,800 a year may not get
all that many lower-wage earners insured. A Bradley aide
acknowledged on Wednesday that the sum was ``probably a little bit
low,'' adding, ``It gets people in the door, if not the parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan, and he said it was evolving, skirted two major rocks
that sank the Clinton program _ requiring employers to insure their
workers and an attempt to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling employers to insure their workers was central to the
president's plan, and stirred deadly opposition from small
business. Cost containment, a health-care problem beginning to
emerge again now after several quiet years, antagonized health-care
providers whose support the administration had counted on.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley plan is also an important political token _ both
much broader than anything Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's
opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, has advocated
and a venture into an area widely regarded, in the capital at
least, as political quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, it is not unlike the senator's position on gun
control, demanding registration of all handguns _ a step
conventionally considered politically unattainable, especially when
House Democrats recall that their anti-gun votes helped cost them
control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one argues that the administration's occasional
efforts to pass legislation to curb soft money and issue
advertisements have cost it political support, campaign finance is
another area where Bradley is now demanding more ``reform'' than
either the Clinton-Gore administration or any sizable faction in
Congress is now pushing.
</P>
<P>
   But his health-care proposal is more than another effort to
one-up the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an example of Bradley's promise to focus on a few
major issues in his campaign, and, he hopes, his presidency. That
was a style he showed in the Senate, where he sometimes buried
himself in a single subject for months.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that can work in a presidential campaign over the long
run, let alone in the White House, where problems are thrust upon
presidents, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short run, at least, his initiative was welcomed on
many fronts as an important attention-getting move.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Feder, a veteran of the Clinton effort who is now dean of
policy studies at Georgetown University, said, ``I think it's great
to hear an expression of support for a move toward universal
coverage, and a commitment particularly that all low-income people
ought to have full government support and a recognition that it
takes money to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, which brought the nation the ``Harry and Louise''
commercials against the Clinton plan, praised the proposal as
``realistic and thoughtful.'' But Kahn did say he feared that
details of the Bradley proposal would lead to ``expensive so-called
patient protection mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from a finished plan, and some very obvious
questions lead only to guesswork. (But the completeness of the
Clinton plan of 1993-94 seemed to present a new target with every
difficulty it anticipated.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the obvious questions is what would be the effect
of opening up the federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which
now insures nine million people from a stable, educated and
above-average-income work force, to any American who wanted to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be likely to draw in many people whose poor health is
a factor in their not being insured today, thereby making the
federal pool more expensive to insure? The Bradley aide said no one
could know, but it was just as possible that it would draw in more
young, healthy people and reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bradley sailed around the politically ruinous issue of
requiring employers to provide insurance, he could not put it over
the horizon. Most Americans now get their health insurance through
employers, but why should hard-pressed employers insure their
workers if the government will? Again, no one knows how many
employers might stop insuring their workers, but it could be enough
to have a serious impact on the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for supporters of universal care, if not necessarily of
the Clinton variety, the doubts were outweighed by just seeing
their issue on the front pages again.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Rowland, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation here, said, ``It really goes beyond some of the
incremental stuff we've been looking at.'' Ms. Rowland said Bradley
had acknowledged this problem ``needs to be addressed in a bigger
way than just hoping everyone will get insurance.''

JAPAN'S DISDAIN FOR FOREIGNERS SURFACES IN CRIME ANXIETIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With a graph of its sales mirroring the path of lemmings
falling from a cliff, Japan's largest lockmaker, Miwa Co., settled
on a recent ad strategy that fanned Japanese fears of crime, and
spiced it with a foreign twist.
</P>
<P>
   The insecurity spreading through the society, the advertisements
announce, is due to Chinese ``theft gangs'' that maintain ``secret
bases'' in the country. ``The damage by foreign theft gangs is
increasing swiftly now,'' one ad reads in boldface. ``It is time to
invest in safety like those in America and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which brought a burst of interest in Miwa
locks, offers a window on a deep streak in Japanese society to look
askance at most things foreign, especially fellow Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials deny that their advertisements reflect any
racism. A spokesman said, moreover, what the police confirm: that
crime by foreigners in general, and that crime by Chinese in
particular, is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, what the advertisements do not say but the
police do is that over all the crime problem in Japan, a society
known for its safety, is considered to be well under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been expecting this kind of crime to come to Japan,
because the world is becoming borderless, and so crime is becoming
borderless too,'' said Yukio Akamatsu, the official responsible for
the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With foreigners making up less than 1 percent of the population,
Japan remains determinedly monoethnic and continuously on guard
against any ``corruption'' of its purity by fellow East Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and Koreans living in this country have long complained
that they have difficulty finding housing because of the prejudices
of Japanese landlords. Visa applications by Asians are said by many
to receive closer scrutiny than those of others, ostensibly for
fear of allowing a proliferation of aliens who outwardly resemble
Japanese. And in interviews, people here freely attribute problems
to the foreigners in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese experts on racial stereotypes say that whatever the
most recent police statistics indicate, a tendency to point a
finger at Chinese reflects a mixture of fear and contempt that has
been present since a failed Mongol invasion of Japan in the 15th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that since its collision with the West toward
the middle of the 19th century, Japan has used Westerners and
Asians as flip sides of the same coin of racial complexes,
struggling to ``catch up'' to the one while despising the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude to this is very complicated, and discussion is
kind of taboo,'' said Hiroyoshi Ishikawa, a professor at Seijo
University in Tokyo. ``The Japanese government had a very conscious
effort to copy the customs of Europeans first, and then
Americans,'' he added. ``And in the depths of their hearts, the
Japanese people have had some kind of contempt for the Chinese and
the Koreans. Since the end of the 19th century, the attitude has
been whites are superior, other Asians are inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese seem openly conscious of these attitudes, or seem
to have considered that airs of superiority and aloofness may have
helped lead Japan into its brutal colonial adventurism in Asia,
which ended disastrously in World War II. Few also seem to consider
the unfair impact of negative stereotypes of foreigners on the
lives of the Asians and other non-Westerners who live here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many illegal aliens are causing crimes, but the media reports
often say it is suspected that the culprits are Chinese, even when
the facts aren't known,'' said Chiu Xiong Yin, president of the
Tokyo Association of Chinese Residents. ``The media seems to be
influenced by discriminatory feelings toward Chinese people: they
take tiny incidents and blow them up into huge affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to live as a Chinese in Japan. We are so
tired of these things, but we try not to make our anger public.''

CITY ACCUSES BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF CONSPIRING TO PROMOTE PRIVATE
COLLECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new line of attack in the city's vehement
opposition to a controversial art exhibition, senior City Hall
officials on Wednesday accused the Brooklyn Museum of Art of
conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value of the
artwork in the show, all of which is privately owned by the British
advertising executive Charles Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials vowed to file a lawsuit in State
Supreme Court seeking to seize control of the museum by contending
that it had violated its lease with the city in part by misusing a
public institution to promote a private collection.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would not try to block the exhibition from
opening on Saturday and were instead preparing for a tough legal
battle. On Tuesday, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to cut off the museum's city financing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Joseph
J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, accused the museum of ``hucksterism'' and
of perpetrating a ``scam'' by conspiring with Christie's auction
house, which is a sponsor of the exhibition, to enrich Saatchi by
inflating the value of his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   In making the allegations of conspiracy, officials capitalized
on news reports that noted the awkward role of Christie's, which is
a promoter and financial supporter of the exhibition as well as a
purveyor of artwork belonging to Saatchi, who is a major collector
and an important client. Christie's also supported an installation
of the show at the Royal Academy in London.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts of interest, some museums do not exhibit
private collections unless they have been promised to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scam and taxpayers dollars should not be used to
support that,'' Hess said at Wednesday's news conference.
``Taxpayers' dollars should be used for educating children, for
building roads, for supporting the homeless, not for pushing up the
value of a private art collection.'' He added, ``We'll bring all of
this out in court. We are going to do some aggressive discovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Christie's quickly rejected the allegations as a
desperate and feeble attempt by the mayor to quash the museum show,
which Giuliani has called ``disgusting'' and offensive to Catholics
because it includes a painting of the Virgin Mary surrounded by
elephant dung and pornographic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani away on a three-day political trip to the West
Coast, officials at City Hall were clearly seeking to retake the
offensive in the museum dispute. The Giuliani administration had
been on the defensive since late Tuesday when the museum abandoned
its efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations with City
Hall and announced the show would go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that every day, the city comes up with a new
pretextual claim,'' said Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who is
representing the museum in its suit against the city. ``Now they
have come up with another argument. Each and every one of them is
nothing more or less than further pretext in an effort to punish
the museum for the exercise of its First Amendment rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, which was said to have given less than $50,000 to
the show, also rejected the conspiracy charges. ``We are aware of
these bewildering accusations,'' the auction house said in a
prepared statement. ``They have absolutely no substance, are not
true. Christie's has a long history of sponsorships of exhibitions
in the United States and internationally. Nothing in this
exhibition is for sale nor is their any expectation for any of the
works from the exhibition to be sold by Christie's.'' The statement
was followed by a long list of shows that the auction house has
supported.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the museum, through a spokesman, issued a statement calling
the accusations ``preposterous and misleading.'' It said, ``The
Mayor's latest charge simply reflects the depths to which he will
go to undermine the First Amendment.'' The spokesman, Fred
Schroeder, said Christie's financial contribution to the show
represented a small fraction of its total cost. &QL;

REGULATORS SMILE ON BELL ATLANTIC'S LONG-DISTANCE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, La., S.C., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, workers dispatched by Bell Atlantic
Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone company, began
unloading 30 boxes of documents from trucks outside the Washington
offices of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes contained three copies of Bell Atlantic's application
to sell long-distance communications services to consumers and
businesses in New York state. If the petition is granted, Bell
Atlantic will become the first regional Bell admitted to the $80
billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its physical heft, Bell Atlantic's application was
matched in significance by a statement of merely four sentences
issued a few hours later by Maureen Helmer, chairwoman of the New
York Public Service Commission, which is highly regarded at the FCC
and which has been jawboning Bell Atlantic to open its local
network for years.
</P>
<P>
   All but formally endorsing Bell Atlantic's long-distance
aspirations, Ms. Helmer insured that Bell Atlantic's rivals, which
will try to convince the FCC to reject the application, have a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that Bell Atlantic's progress in meeting the
terms of the 271 checklist has reached the point of a filing with
the FCC,'' her statement read, referring to the section of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 that details the steps that a Bell
company must take before entering the long-distance market. ``The
cooperation of all the parties during the course of this review has
facilitated a tremendous amount of progress by the company in
opening its local market to competition. If the filing is
consistent with the terms and conditions that we have established,
and the record we have developed over the past 2{ years, I am
optimistic that I could offer my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Helmer was under no obligation to share her optimism
Wednesday; the New York PSC will not make its formal comments to
the FCC for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks leading up to Bell Atlantic's application
Wednesday, many communications experts said that the FCC was likely
to follow the guidance of the New York regulators _ or at least
give New York's recommendation far more weight than it had lent to
earlier long-distance endorsements for other regional Bells from
regulators in other states. Applications in some states _ including
Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma _ were rejected, with people
close to the FCC saying that the commission had not been convinced
of the rigor and independence of the regulators in those states.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, FCC Chairman William Kennard was positively glowing
Wednesday in his praise of the New York PSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the New York Public Service Commission for its work
on Bell Atlantic's application to enter the long distance market,''
he said in a statement. ``The dedication and expertise displayed by
New York's Public Service Commission and its staff are truly
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's regard for the New York regulators may be enhanced by
the fact that his chief of staff, Kathryn Brown, spent three years
as director of the New York PSC's consumer services division.
</P>
<P>
   So at this point the tea leaves indicate that the application
will be approved. That still does not necessarily mean Bell
Atlantic is set to define the One True Path for other Bells to
reach their long-distance nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, SBC Communications Inc. is scheduled to receive
results of a test of the openness of its network Friday, with the
next meeting of the state's regulatory commission to discuss SBC's
long-distance plans set for Oct. 21. If SBC is lucky _ and good _
it will be able to apply to the FCC for permission in Texas soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But the way SBC has opened its network in Texas is in some
technical aspects quite different from Bell Atlantic's model.
Because of the high concentration of lucrative business customers
in New York, especially in Manhattan, many competitive local phone
companies in New York City have found it economical to assemble
relatively extensive networks of their own and to buy access to
Bell Atlantic's systems piecemeal. In working with the state's
regulators, Bell Atlantic has spent a lot of time and effort
developing the capacity to sell access to many discrete parts of
its network.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive local carriers in Texas, on the other hand, appear
to have more appetite for bigger chunks of SBC's network, perhaps
putting more focus on less lucrative residential customers because
the Texas business market is not quite as attractive as that of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``SBC is following a different model and also has a pretty good
chance of getting in on a slightly later time track,'' said former
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who is now a consultant for McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is whether or not both of them are
accepted,'' he said. ``If they are, the country will see two
different models and different states will go with different
models.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To many telecommunications analysts and executives, Bell
Atlantic's model seems to require more work on the part of the
incumbent. That is why executives at other regional Bells have been
heard to complain that Bell Atlantic has been too conciliatory,
perhaps setting a bar too high for the other Bell companies to
hurdle easily.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has every reason to be more conciliatory because
it has already lost so much corporate business in big metropolitan
markets to upstarts. It is not a new pattern. In 1990, for
instance, Nynex _ later acquired by Bell Atlantic _ became the
first Bell to set aside space within its switching centers for
competitors to place their own equipment. The other Bells howled
that Nynex was making them look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would say that's being conciliatory,'' said Ivan
Seidenberg, who was chairman of Nynex before becoming chairman of
Bell Atlantic. ``I would say we're the first company that faces
competition in the industry every time. And I can go ahead and say
we have been right every time because everybody has followed suit
sooner or later, though they tend to do it kicking and scratching
because it's convenient to say, `New York made us do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to trade some things to get access to larger
markets, I think that's the right trade-off,'' Seidenberg added.
``While I could get excited about the word conciliatory, I might
want to replace that with savvy and strategic.''

REPUBLICANS PLAN DELAY OF EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT PAYMENTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans, desperate for money to
finance their spending bills without raiding Social Security funds,
Wednesday devised a plan that relies almost entirely on delaying
billions of dollars in federal tax credits for millions of
working-class families.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was immediately questioned by Democrats and some
Republicans, who called it an accounting gimmick that could hurt
people on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Frank Salizzoni,
the chief executive of H&AMP;R Block Inc., said it ``could cause
confusion and disrupt the personal lives of hard-working American
families.''
</P>
<P>
   A chart detailing the plan, obtained from a senior House
Republican leader, shows Congress on course to spend $7.6 billion
in surplus contributions to Social Security to run the government
in the 2000 fiscal year, which begins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But because under the new plan about $8 billion would not be
spent in the 2000 year, the Republicans' calculations show $400
million in black ink, rather than a $7.6 billion dip into Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   But the figure could be higher. The Congressional Budget Office
released new figures Wednesday night estimating that Republicans
were actually on course to spend $17.9 billion out of the Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republican leaders, who have vowed daily, and
fervently, that they will not spend the funds, stood together
Wednesday under a banner reading ``Stop Robbing Social Security''
and unveiled a new campaign of television commercials renewing
their pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' own calculations show that the only way
they can avoid raiding Social Security is to distribute the
politically popular earned-income tax credit payment in 12 monthly
payments next year, rather than paying it in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, payments for October,
November and December 2000 would be counted against the 2001
budget, according to John Feehery, spokesman for Speaker Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   So the plan actually saves no money, but instead uses an
accounting device that allows three months of the tax-credit
payments to be counted in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Feehery said delaying the payments would hurt no one and help
the government ``weed out waste, fraud and abuse'' that he said was
rampant in the earned-income tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old tax credit payment program was designed to be an
incentive to keep people working and paying taxes. About 20 million
Americans in households earning from $10,200 to $30,580 are
eligible for the credit. They received $28.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The average family received $1,890 in a single annual payment,
allowing some to pay off debts, make a down payment on a car or pay
tuition. Under the Republican plan, that same family would receive,
instead, a check for $157.50 a month, a sum better suited for
buying groceries or paying utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic
Council, called the plan ``a forced interest-free loan to the
government'' from ``people scraping to get by.'' The White House
budget director, Jack Lew, called it ``kind of Dickensian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican idea of using the tax credit to offset billions
in spending was first floated two weeks ago, but not as the
centerpiece of a plan to leave Social Security alone. Even then, it
was received unenthusiastically by much of the Republican
rank-and-file. Wednesday some conservative Republicans said the
plan still made them uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have real concerns,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who
called the plan ``a gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move people from welfare to work,'' Souder
said. ``But a number of our proposals seem to hit people moving
from dependency to independence. Regardless of how you look at it,
it's a reduction in benefits for those people.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican aide expressed confidence in the plan. ``It
can be passed and it will be passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress were skeptical. ``Why don't they go after
some corporate tax break instead of the poorest of the poor?''
asked House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, said, ``It boggles my mind that they
would be that callous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' calculations directly conflict with the new
figures released Wednesday night by the Congressional Budget
Office. The budget office's figures, requested by Rep. John M.
Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House
Budget Committee, show Congress on course to spend $17.9 billion in
Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   The differing figures can be explained by the fact that the
Republicans have ordered the budget office to make billions of
dollars in what are called ``directed scorekeeping'' adjustments.
That means they have told their numbers-crunchers not to count
those billions, a process that Stan Collender, a federal budget
expert at Fleishman-Hillard, defines as ``lying about the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, Spratt said, ``were not playing by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculations by the Republicans also assume that almost
everything else in the increasingly chaotic congressional spending
process will turn up as they hope, which may be unlikely. Congress
made no progress today in passing spending bills, leaving eight of
the 13 measures incomplete.

CITY ACCUSES BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF CONSPIRING TO PROMOTE PRIVATE
COLLECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new line of attack in the city's vehement
opposition to a controversial art exhibition, senior City Hall
officials on Wednesday accused the Brooklyn Museum of Art of
conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value of the
artwork in the show, all of which is privately owned by the British
advertising executive Charles Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials vowed to file a lawsuit in State
Supreme Court seeking to seize control of the museum by contending
that it had violated its lease with the city in part by misusing a
public institution to promote a private collection.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would not try to block the exhibition from
opening on Saturday and were instead preparing for a tough legal
battle. On Tuesday, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to cut off the museum's city financing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Joseph
J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, accused the museum of ``hucksterism'' and
of perpetrating a ``scam'' by conspiring with Christie's auction
house, which is a sponsor of the exhibition, to enrich Saatchi by
inflating the value of his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   In making the allegations of conspiracy, officials capitalized
on news reports that noted the awkward role of Christie's, which is
a promoter and financial supporter of the exhibition as well as a
purveyor of artwork belonging to Saatchi, who is a major collector
and an important client. Christie's also supported an installation
of the show at the Royal Academy in London.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts of interest, some museums do not exhibit
private collections unless they have been promised to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scam and taxpayers dollars should not be used to
support that,'' Hess said at Wednesday's news conference.
``Taxpayers' dollars should be used for educating children, for
building roads, for supporting the homeless, not for pushing up the
value of a private art collection.'' He added, ``We'll bring all of
this out in court. We are going to do some aggressive discovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Christie's quickly rejected the allegations as a
desperate and feeble attempt by the mayor to quash the museum show,
which Giuliani has called ``disgusting'' and offensive to Catholics
because it includes a painting of the Virgin Mary surrounded by
elephant dung and pornographic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani away on a three-day political trip to the West
Coast, officials at City Hall were clearly seeking to retake the
offensive in the museum dispute. The Giuliani administration had
been on the defensive since late Tuesday when the museum abandoned
its efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations with City
Hall and announced the show would go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that every day, the city comes up with a new
pretextual claim,'' said Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who is
representing the museum in its suit against the city. ``Now they
have come up with another argument. Each and every one of them is
nothing more or less than further pretext in an effort to punish
the museum for the exercise of its First Amendment rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, which was said to have given less than $50,000 to
the show, also rejected the conspiracy charges. ``We are aware of
these bewildering accusations,'' the auction house said in a
prepared statement. ``They have absolutely no substance, are not
true. Christie's has a long history of sponsorships of exhibitions
in the United States and internationally. Nothing in this
exhibition is for sale nor is their any expectation for any of the
works from the exhibition to be sold by Christie's.'' The statement
was followed by a long list of shows that the auction house has
supported.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the museum, through a spokesman, issued a statement calling
the accusations ``preposterous and misleading.'' It said, ``The
Mayor's latest charge simply reflects the depths to which he will
go to undermine the First Amendment.'' The spokesman, Fred
Schroeder, said Christie's financial contribution to the show
represented a small fraction of its total cost. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul II: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.

   BAUCAU, East Timor _ Unexpectedly from around the corner, a
group of smiling teen-age girls appeared Wednesday afternoon,
singing a United Nations song: ``Brothers and sisters of East
Timor, it's time to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, here in East Timor's second city, people were
shopping at a small outdoor market. Power and water were operating
normally. In the lovely Portuguese-built center of town, only one
building had been burned.
</P>
<P>
   This is the East Timor that could have been, if armed men had
not rampaged through the territory this month looting, burning and
depopulating almost every town and village.
</P>
<P>
   With desolation the norm throughout East Timor, there is an
unreal, ``through the looking glass'' feel to Baucau.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with other cities was heightened Wednesday when
soldiers in the capital, Dili, discovered nine charred bodies in
the back of a pickup truck in a junkyard on the western outskirts.
Military officers said additional bodies had been lying in the
surrounding bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no initial information on who they were or who
had killed them, the nine bodies, lying in a grotesque tangle in
the small white truck, were evidence of what is apparently the
largest-scale atrocity discovered to date from the recent weeks of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the man who appears to have saved Baucau from
destruction, the Roman Catholic bishop, Basilio do Nascimento,
slipped off his sandals as he received visitors in his cool
hillside residence. His electric clock ticked quietly on the wall,
and the smell of cooking floated from his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Such comfort and normalcy contrasted with the fate of his fellow
bishop, Carlos Belo, the winner of the Nobel Prize for peace in
1996, whose residence in Dili was burned and who was forced to flee
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, do Nascimento said, with Dili a charred
ruin 80 miles to the west, Baucau, a city of 27,000, could become
the temporary capital of the emerging new nation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   His visitors Wednesday included representatives of the United
Nations, which has just opened an office in Baucau _ with an
initial staff of eight _ its first in East Timor outside Dili.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the representatives, Nicholas Birnback, said he was
stunned to hear the teen-aged girls singing the U.N. song, a sign
that at least some of the optimism that had flourished before this
month of terror was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The song was written to advertise the Aug. 30 referendum in
which nearly 80 percent of the people of East Timor voted for
independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is preparing to run a transitional
administration for two to three years in East Timor if the
Indonesian Parliament endorses the independence vote, as expected,
in October.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, whose strong baritone amplifies his soft words,
professed to be puzzled that Baucau escaped other towns' fate.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody else here seemed to have any doubt. For months before
the referendum, the bishop held weekly consultations that included
representatives of the militia, of the military, of
pro-independence forces and of the local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we tried to do something in this sense,'' the bishop
said. ``There was very good cooperation among all of us, it is
true. There was a great deal of goodwill among all of these people.
If we collaborated to preserve Baucau from all this catastrophe, I
am very glad.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the city was entirely spared. In the
outer sector known as New Baucau, he said, about 50 buildings were
burned, only two of them private residences. As in other cities
government buildings were burned and the main marketplace was razed
along with many surrounding shops.
</P>
<P>
   And as in other cities, the militias terrorized many residents
into fleeing into the hills. But the residents are returning now in
large numbers and this is perhaps the only place in East Timor
where people feel safe enough to stroll the streets in the cool
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop seemed to confirm a report here that he had paid off
the departing Indonesian military not to destroy the power station,
as it did when it pulled out of many other towns. ``Before their
departure, they sold us oil,'' he said. ``We bought some oil from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an embryonic sign that the East Timorese are beginning to
assert control over their land for the first time in centuries,
motor bikes could be seen in town with riders carrying two-way
radios _ a step towards filling a security vacuum left by the
withdrawing Indonesian military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem at this moment is concerning authority,'' the
bishop said. ``We have no power and we have no control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bishop suggested to his U.N. visitors Wednesday that they
coordinate their police activities with the men on the motorcycles
_ representatives of the pro-independence forces that will form the
core of a future East Timorese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem at this moment is concerning authority,'' he
said. ``We have no power and we have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   But like so much else in a newly free East Timor _ like the
burned and flattened homes that can be seen all along the road from
Dili to Baucau _ the country's laws and system of justice will have
to be constructed from the bare foundations.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official, Alan Castle, who was visiting Wednesday to put
the first four unarmed foreign police officers in place, said the
four U.N. officers, all from the Philippines, would be empowered to
carry out the full range of law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem they will run into is what laws apply,'' he
said. ``Yes, you can hold someone in custody. But don't ask me
under what real power. And don't ask me where they would hold
them.''

POLICE BREAK UP ANIT-MILOSEVIC DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Riot police swinging batons broke up a
peaceful demonstration on Wednesday night, preventing some 20,000
demonstrators from marching to the suburb where President Slobodan
Milosevic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 people were injured, including at least five reporters,
cameramen and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to break up the march was a clear departure from
police tactics since daily demonstrations began Sept. 21. While the
police action is likely to swell what has been a disappointing
number of daily demonstrators, it also seemed intended to advertise
and underline Milosevic's determination to use force to hold on to
his job.
</P>
<P>
   During the last major demonstrations in the winter of 1996-97,
which lasted 88 days, police were careful not to confront marchers.
Clearly, Milosevic wants no repetition of that three-month
embarrassment, which ended when he accepted opposition victories in
local elections and fired the police and television chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Alliance for Change said on Wednesday night that
although they wanted to test the police, they did not want
violence. They said the purpose of the march was designed to draw
more people to these nightly rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we're playing with dangerous stuff,'' said Milan
Protic, one of the Alliance leaders, before the police charged. But
in speeches after the march, before a thin and shaken crowd in
Belgrade's Square of the Republic, Protic and Zoran Djindjic,
leader of the Democratic Party, appealed to demonstrators not to
confront the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marathon,'' Djindjic said. ``I beg of you to be more
wise than they are.'' But he also noted with glee: ``The regime
showed that they are more scared of us than we thought an hour
ago.'' And he announced that demonstrators would make the same
march again on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a tense standoff between demonstrators and police
blocking Kneza Milosa Street, in front of the Defense Ministry
building still blasted from NATO bombs. Opposition leaders, after
talking to the police, urged their followers to turn up another
route.
</P>
<P>
   But the marchers did not follow them, so the leaders returned to
sit in front of police lines, to prevent a confrontation and urged
protesters to sit. After about 20 minutes, 75 riot police then
marched down Nemanjina Street and started to drive the marchers
back with their shields and batons.
</P>
<P>
   A Djindjic bodyguard, Vlada, was badly beaten on the head, and
with an eye swollen shut, said on Wednesday night of Milosevic:
``It won't be that easy to make him leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's clash, leaders of the divided political
opposition to Milosevic moved to make another effort to create a
common front around the issue of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly rallies, the
leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly seeking a
rapprochement with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest opposition
party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former central banker who is their choice for prime minister in
any transitional government. Avramovic believes, he said in an
interview, that Milosevic can easily ignore a divided opposition,
and that the turnouts thus far have been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties will
attend a ``round table'' on necessary conditions for free and fair
elections. If the round table succeeds, then Draskovic says he will
throw his support to rallies intended to press for early elections,
as the best and only effective way to oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance has been insistent that Milosevic must resign
first, if there would be any chance of fair elections. But their
campaign thus far shows no sign of bringing about any resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join these rallies, calling them
``pointless'' and ``a waste of time.'' He has not lent them his
party's organizational skills or helped publicize them on the
Belgrade city television station he controls, Studio B.
</P>
<P>
   But Studio B covered Wednesday night's clashes, and the violence
will add pressure on Draskovic, once known for his fiery boldness
in earlier demonstrations, to join these.

CALIFORNIA RACIAL PROFILING BILL IS VETOED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Playing both sides of a divisive racial issue,
Gov. Gray Davis of California has vetoed a bill requiring
law-enforcement agencies to provide information to determine
whether they are stopping a disproportionate share of racial
minority members. But while he questioned the usefulness and cost
of the measure, which is strongly supported by civil rights groups,
Davis ordered the state highway patrol to collect that information
and urged local police departments to do so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill contended that at a cost of less than $2
million a year it would have produced evidence of whether motorists
from minorities were being stopped by law-enforcement officers for
questioning because of the driver's race. The bill would have
required police to record the race, sex and other information about
every motorist they stop.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message late on Tuesday, the governor, who was
supported in his election campaign last year by the usually
conservative police groups that opposed the measure, disputed the
cost estimates of the bill's supporters and said ``it is
questionable whether the information gathered _ at a potential cost
of tens of millions of dollars _ would provide any more meaningful
information than is currently available.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that although there might be a few specific instances
of racial profiling ``there is no evidence that this practice is
taking place statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Davis noted approvingly that more than 30 local
law-enforcement agencies around the state were voluntarily
collecting information on the people being stopped by police, and
said he had ordered the sole law-enforcement agency under his
direct control, the California Highway Patrol, to record the
ethnicity as well as other data on the people stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' communications director, Philip Trounstine, said he
believed that there was no contradiction in the actions and that
what the governor principally objected to was mandating every
police agency in the state to collect the statistics. He said the
governor felt police should undertake the collection of racial data
on their own and only where it seemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups have said that the targeting of minorities,
largely black and Hispanic motorists, is a longstanding practice
among some police departments and, most recently, President Clinton
ordered federal law-enforcement officials to collect information on
the race and sex of people they stop. Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey has acknowledged that state police there had engaged in
racial profiling and she has appointed a new chief to attack the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, a Democrat,
supported the bill, saying it would increase public confidence in
law enforcement. But several police associations said having to
record the data would be an unnecessary burden and would contradict
the training officers receive to ignore the race of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have required police officials to record the
apparent ethnicity of every motorist they stop, as well as other
information like age, sex, whether they conducted a search and
whether a citation was issued. The officers would not have asked
the racial background of the motorists, but would have relied on
their own visual determination.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would have lapsed at the end of 2004, included
no provisions to halt the practice of racial profiling, if it were
found to exist, but would have provided the first comprehensive
data in the state on what kinds of people were being stopped by
police and whether the figures varied by district. Civil rights
groups have argued that such information is an important first step
in rooting out what they contend is a pattern of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sponsored by state Sen. Kevin Murray, an L.A.
Democrat and an African-American who earlier had sued the Beverly
Hills Police Department, contending that he had been stopped by a
policeman there purely because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   Murray harshly criticized the governor Wednesday, saying, ``What
we have now is the largest state in the union, with the largest
population of minorities, which has now said it's not going to do
anything on this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Trounstine disputed the suggestion that Davis was doing nothing
and insisted that the dispute was largely over the best way to
achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may argue about whether mandating the collection of
data is the proper state function,'' Trounstine said, ``but no one
can question Governor Davis' commitment to civil rights and equal
protection under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis followed up his veto by writing to Mayor Richard Riordan
of Los Angeles, whose police chief had criticized the bill, and
urging him to begin collecting the data voluntarily, as some other
cities are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor can't rely on volunteerism, rely on
law-enforcement agencies to volunteer to do this,'' said Elizabeth
Schroeder of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California.

BUSH DENOUNCES PEROT AND BUCHANAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas sternly
denounced Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan on Wednesday, suggesting that
``personal vendettas'' may be driving their apparent alliance to
have Buchanan seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asserted that both men helped undermine his father's
unsuccessful campaign for re-election to the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the 1992 campaign was hard for my dad to
get traction in the race because of, first, Patrick J. Buchanan,
and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush said in
response to questions at a news conference during a two-day
California campaign swing. ``If the adage is true _ you die a death
of a thousand cuts in politics _ Ross Perot was a part of the
thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's display of a festering resentment toward Perot and
Buchanan was unusual in a campaign in which he has tried to strike
an accommodating tone to win over a broad spectrum of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks reignited the feuds that started with his father
_ and make it less likely that Bush would ever reach an
accommodation with Perot or Buchanan. Buchanan weakened President
George Bush by taking him on in the primaries in 1992; Perot's
independent candidacy cost him voters in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Many other politicians have taken care not to criticize Perot,
the founder of the Reform Party, whose profile has diminished but
who still has considerable influence among some in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the front-runner for the Republican nomination, and many
of his advisers view Buchanan as a serious threat because if he
wins the Reform Party nomination he could siphon Republican support
from Bush in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's expected bid for the nomination had thus far had the
tacit backing of Perot, whose advisers have briefed the Buchanan
campaign on the byzantine Reform Party nominating process. Even
Buchanan's advisers said they know the unpredictable Perot could
undermine their effort by plunging into the nomination race himself
_ or backing another contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was particularly critical of Perot, recalling the Texas
business executive's endorsement of Gov. Ann Richards, the
Democratic incumbent, when Bush ran against her in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a personal relationship with Mr. Perot in that about
one week before the 1994 election, up pops Mr. Perot and he
endorsed my opponent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Buchanan and Perot were motivated by bad blood
toward his family, Bush said, ``I hope not.'' But he went on to
raise the notion of vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people enter the political process with what's best
for the country in mind _ not making decisions based on personal
vendettas,'' Bush said. ``I don't know Mr. Perot well enough to be
able to tell you whether or not he's got personal animus toward me.
All I got to tell you is the one time I did have political
experience with him is when he endorsed my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot was traveling and could not be reached for comment. But
Russell J. Verney, the Reform Party chairman who is close to Perot,
dismissed Bush's remarks as ``paranoia'' from the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   ``After '92 the Bushes couldn't accept responsibility for their
loss, so they call it a vendetta,'' he said. ``There's no vendetta.
There's no animus. The Bushes have to take full responsibility for
`read my lips _ no new taxes' and a miserable campaign in '92.''
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on reports that Buchanan was considering running
for the Reform Party nomination, Bush made his most vigorous appeal
to Buchanan not to defect _ even as other Republicans are
condemning Buchanan for his comments about the West's response to
Hitler in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, his revisionist history about World War II is
wrong,'' Bush said. Still, making clear that he is trying not to
alienate Buchanan's supporters, he added, ``If he goes, he's gone,
I understand that. The question is whether some of the people who
support Pat Buchanan who are loyal Republicans stay with the
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a rival for the nomination who
has declared that Buchanan no longer has a place in the Republican
party, sought to draw a contrast with Bush's handling of the
renegade Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Wednesday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley,
Calif., where Nancy Reagan sat in the front row, McCain cloaked
himself in the memories of Reagan, whom he recalled as a great
American hero who would never stand for aggressors like Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Ronald Reagan's words stand too as a challenge,'' McCain
said in a passage that his advisers said was a reference to Bush's
handling of Buchanan. ``For not only must Americans be prepared to
defend the honor and glory of our country, but to speak out
forcefully against those who would urge us to abandon our world
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reagan did not endorse McCain or speak publicly Wednesday,
but she met with him before his speech and people close to the
senator said she has privately encouraged his bid.
</P>
<P>
   McCain first met the Reagans in the early 1970s when they had
dinners to welcome prisoners of war home from Vietnam. Meeting with
reporters in front of a chunk of the Berlin Wall on display at the
library, McCain said he disagreed with Bush, who said of Buchanan,
``Let Republicans decide whether or not his ideas make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain put forth a different view: ``When someone takes the
positions that Mr. Buchanan did on the issue of World War II, that
is not longer in the realm of debate of the Republican Party,'' he
said. ``I won't stoop to debate that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Buchanan as a ``marginal figure now _ he's gained
no traction in New Hampshire or anyplace else.''

AS IRAN'S REFORMER SPEAKS, ANTI-REFORMERS SIT AND SCOWL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Thousands of jubilant university students
gathered Wednesday to hail the country's reformist president inside
the sprawling, golden-domed shrine to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the puritanical Muslim cleric who led Iran's Islamic revolution 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The students pressed against barriers inside the shrine to chant
the name of the president, Mohammad Khatami, punched the air with
hand-lettered signs bearing slogans of support and raised cries of
``Death to the opponents of Khatami!''
</P>
<P>
   So dense was the crowd that many students were pressed almost
against the glass walls of the green-roofed pavilion within the
shrine that encloses the tomb of Khomeini, who died in 1989 at age
90, and that of his son, Ahmad Khomeini, a cleric who died in 1996
in his mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   But if the students' enthusiasm carried the unmistakable sense
of a society in transition, it was also redolent of the formidable
obstacles that Khatami, 53, a high-ranking cleric himself, will
have to overcome to build a ``civil society'' in Iran _ his catch
phrase since his landslide election victory 28 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In casting their votes, 20 million Iranian voters backed
Khatami's pledge to establish a tolerant, law-abiding democracy
that he has said would mitigate the harshness of Islamic rule
without allowing it to be swept aside by Western-style secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has been called the ``Iranian Gorbachev,'' a reference
to Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts as Soviet leader to reform the
Communist system, which ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union
and his ouster in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One similarity is that Khatami is an authentic member of the
political establishment that he now challenges. He emerged from the
same ultraconservative Islamic seminary in Qom as the hard-line
clerics who still cling doggedly to the legacy of Ayatollah
Khomeini, and with them he took part in the ``Islamic revolution''
that overthrew the Shah in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the difference in Khatami's case were the years
before his election in 1997, when he was sidelined by clerics to a
position as director of the national library. There he plunged into
a study of Western political thought and emerged with ideals that
drew heavily from the 18th-century liberal philosophers who
influenced the American Revolution, including Hobbes, Locke and
Rousseau. Khatami's 290-page book on Western political thought is
now a best-seller around the campus of Tehran University, where he
draws powerful backing.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's supporters, concentrated among the
two-thirds of Iran's population of 70 million who are under 30
years old, are at least counterbalanced, for now, by his opponents,
as Wednesday's events at the shrine demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a few feet away from the podium used by Khatami, rows of
Muslim clerics and other influential figures responded impassively
to Khatami's hourlong speech. They included Hassan Khomeini, the
ginger-bearded grandson of the Ayatollah; he is 28, a
middle-ranking cleric who has become an icon to Islamic
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Through waves of cheering and chanting by the students, the
clerics offered no applause. Some stroked their beards pensively,
others played distractedly with prayer beads, still others fanned
themselves with programs for the gathering, which was part of a
10-day celebration of the 100th anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The clerics' glumness was not relieved even when Khatami,
responding to the cries of ``Death to the opponents of Khatami!''
rebuked the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I don't like to hear slogans like that,'' Khatami
exclaimed. ``I don't like to hear `Death to opponents' or death to
anybody, because as matters stand in our society at present, it
will be interpreted in a very negative way, as meaning that anybody
who does not share your views should be silenced, and that's not
right at all. The Iran that we want should be one where there will
be room for all the different viewpoints, for all ideologies, even
those that oppose the president. They, too, must have the right to
express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Iranian clerics are aligned with Khatami, many
others, probably a majority, are in the conservative camp with
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Iran's Supreme Leader, a title
bequeathed by Ayatollah Khomeini, Khamenei remains the country's
most powerful figure, with effective control of the army, the
police, the judiciary and the intelligence agencies, as well as the
theological establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, Khatami's powers as president are
limited, and he relies heavily for his influence on the persuasive
power of his popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, who did not attend Wednesday's gathering, has been
engaged in a game of political cat-and-mouse with Khatami, blocking
many of the president's initiatives and maneuvering to discredit
and even jail some of his associates, but managing to avoid a
direct political confrontation that many Iranians fear could lead
to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the struggle has been waged with only occasional
violence, and both sides seem keen to keep it that way as they
approach the next crisis point: parliamentary elections next
February, in which Khatami will attempt to wrest a majority from
the conservatives.

   Wednesday's meeting with the students was laden with political
overtones, coming as it did in the aftermath of rioting in July on
the university campus, the worst disturbances since the 1979
revolution. The July riots began with student protests over the
closing of a reformist newspaper, but they spiraled out of control
as the police and gangs of Islamic militia members attacked a
student dormitory, killing at least two students.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives appeared to have won the day then by calling
huge crowds into Tehran's streets in a counterdemonstration, but
popular outrage at the students' deaths prompted Khamenei to
condemn the attack on the dormitory as ``criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July the conservatives have remained on the offensive.
Earlier this month, they used a press court to close another
leading reformist newspaper, Neshat, and to sentence its editor to
a 30-month jail term, now under appeal, for ``insulting the
sanctity of Islam,'' among other things, through its coverage of
the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Although a government inquiry condemned the police for the
campus attack, a revolutionary court, also under conservative
control, announced two weeks ago that it had sentenced four people,
apparently students, to death for their roles in the disturbances.
No announcement has been made that the sentences were carried out,
and reformers hope they will be commuted to jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest skirmish, hard-liners have attempted to stir
public outrage against the reformers over the publication of a
satirical essay in a Tehran campus magazine that featured a student
telling the 12th imam _ a central figure in the theology of Iran's
Shiite Muslims _ that he would be too busy with exams to attend the
reappearance on earth of the imam, an event that holds a sanctity
among Shiites similar to the second coming of Jesus among
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative newspapers have run banner headlines on the affair,
not mentioning that the original article appeared in a publication
with a press run of 150 copies, and conservative students have
rallied on the university campus, demanding the resignation of the
culture and education ministers, key allies of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the new attacks, Khatami's tactic has been to
parade his own Islamic credentials while offering oratorical
strikes against the conservatives. At Wednesday's meeting, he
lavished praise on Ayatollah Khomeini and emphasized the importance
he attached to university learning, as if to say that conservatives
who condemn the campuses as centers of anti-Islamic sentiment and
urge that they be closed have betrayed Ayatollah Khomeini's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   While attacking the anit-imam satire as ``an insult to religious
values,'' he said the ``bigger crime'' was that of the
conservatives ``who have tried to convert a small wave into a big
storm'' in a bid to isolate the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly Khatami concentrated on an appeal to the students to
avoid provoking the hard-liners and giving them a pretext for
another campus confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should remember that there are hands at work in our country
that want to foster divisions among us and to set one group against
another, with a view to creating chaos,'' he said. ``So while you
should defend your values, don't allow divisions to rule life on
the campuses. You are there to ask questions, to learn, to engage
in dialogue, not to allow the universities to descend into chaos.''

MARKET PLACE: STOCK FUND SALES LAG AS BROADER MARKET COOLS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Be careful what you ask for, the saying goes, because
you may get it.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors who ignored the indexing phenomenon in
hopes that their fund would eventually beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 are getting their wish, as the average U.S. diversified equity
fund appears poised to top the index for the second consecutive
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But that is little comfort to investors, who liked things a lot
better when the S&AMP;P 500 was beating most other funds and posting 20
percent-plus annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   With the S&AMP;P index down 7.3 percent since June 30, and now up
only 4.2 percent for the year, investors' impatience is showing:
fund sales, which were strong in the second quarter, have slacked
off considerably in the last two months as the broad stock market
has drifted lower.
</P>
<P>
   Investors put $9.2 billion into stock funds in August, down 25.7
percent from July sales of $12.4 billion, according to new figures
from the Investment Company Institute, and September has shaped up
about the same. Charles Biderman, president of Trimtabs.com
Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates total
September stock-fund sales of $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the stock market declined, but it has once again
begun to narrow. While small-capitalization and mid-capitalization
funds performed better than large-cap funds this quarter, the much
noted rotation from growth stocks to value stocks earlier this year
has abated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., large-cap growth funds lost an average
of 4.2 percent this quarter through Sept. 23, compared with an 8.3
percent drop for large-cap value funds. Mid-cap growth funds broke
even, but mid-cap value funds fell 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bigger value funds, Vanguard's $32 billion Windsor II,
which had managed decent returns in recent years even though its
value style was out of favor, has slumped 14.7 percent so far this
quarter, hurt by big holdings in financial stocks and Waste
Management Inc. Its sister value fund, Vanguard Windsor, which
soared in the spring, is down 11.1 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For many diversified mutual fund managers, who are on track to
post single-digit returns for the first time in several years, the
pressure is on to improve results in the fourth quarter. Overall,
the average U.S. diversified equity fund fell 5.7 percent in the
quarter through Sept. 23, according to Lipper Inc., compared with a
loss by the S&AMP;P 500-stock index of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That performance may be causing fund flows to narrow somewhat,
too. Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks
fund flows, estimates that 70 percent of fund sales in the first
three weeks of September went to technology funds and index funds,
which tend to draw a high proportion of money every month no matter
how they do against other funds because they are a mainstay of
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is tightly focused on these two sectors,'' said
Adler, who noted that technology funds were one of the few bright
spots this quarter, up an average of 6 percent through Sept. 23,
according to Lipper. (Gold funds have soared this week and will
also rank among the top funds for the quarter, which ends
Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Top-selling Vanguard said its stock funds have taken in $2.2
billion this month, up from $2 billion in August. The only fund
company with more assets under management, Fidelity Investments,
says its stock funds drew $500 million in September through Monday.

PENTAGON SAYS IT HAS NO PROOF OF U.S. TROOPS' MASSACRE OF KOREANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The Times is running this story with the Associated Press
story, ``Death at the Bridge: Ex-GIs tell of Korean War refugee
killings.''  
 (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without denying that Korean civilians were killed
at the Bridge of No Gun Ri 49 years ago, Pentagon officials said
Wednesday that a search of their archives turned up no documents
that prove that U.S. soldiers massacred the civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Army Center for Military History has reviewed its
records and has found no information that substantiates the claim
that United States Army soldiers perpetrated a massacre of South
Korean civilians at No Gun Ri,'' said Col. Ed Vega, spokesman for
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials said there are no plans to conduct
a far-reaching investigation. In the absence of archival records,
the Pentagon would have to undertake a major research project
pulling records, interviewing Korean and American witnesses and
cross-checking the information with other documents in order to
find evidence about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Military and academic historians interviewed said they were not
surprised that civilians were killed in the early months of the
Korean War, although they disagreed about the meaning of the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago, who first wrote
about reports of an incident near the bridge in his book ``The
Origins of the Korean War, Volume II'' (Princeton, 1990), said he
relied in part on the contemporary reporting of Walter Sullivan in
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Though in his July 22, 1950, article about the fighting,
Sullivan did not report the killing of civilians, he did write
this: ``The American G.I. is now beginning to eye with suspicion
any Korean civilian in the cities or countryside. Watch those guys
in white! _ the customary peasant dress _ is the cry often heard
near the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the diary of a dead Korean soldier and U.S. military
records, Cumings said he had showed that Korean civilians had died
during U.S. aerial bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   This bombardment and strafing could have driven the civilians to
take refuge under the bridge. Cumings said that The Associated
Press reporting ``makes it unquestionable that tens or hundreds of
Koreans were killed by Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   William Stueck, a history professor at the University of Georgia
and author of ``The Korean War: an International History''
(Princeton, 1995), said that since there was infiltration of United
States lines by enemy troops posing as civilians, the reaction of
U.S. soldiers was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the incident happened, Stueck said, ``it wouldn't
surprise me that American soldiers were very sensitive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of the rule of law for the military to use
civilians to mask their operations in war.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stueck and Cumings said there was no previous report of any
atrocity of this magnitude by U.S. forces in the Korean War. They
and other historians noted that the many atrocities committed
during the conflict were largely by Koreans against each other.

 &HT;    Foster-care system in crisis
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELPHOS, Ohio _ Elida Road is ruler-straight blacktop that
slices though rural Ohio's checkerboard of wheat, soybeans, corn
and its newest cash crop: America's castoff children.
</P>
<P>
   Along this stretch of heartland, the fate of many neglected,
abused or unmanageable kids is decided in a one-story, red-brick
office building.
</P>
<P>
   Like a modern-day Rumplestiltskin spinning straw into gold,
officials at Specialized Alternatives for Family and Youth
negotiate with state public agencies for a potentially valuable
commodity: the children nobody else wants.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years, SAFY has grown from a tiny agency in northwest Ohio
to one of the nation's largest private foster-care providers, with
branches in seven states, millions of dollars in revenues and
control over 1,300 children.
</P>
<P>
   In the foster-care industry, it is viewed as a success story, a
thriving and much-needed agency that finds, trains and administers
a network of foster parents willing to take in some of the nation's
most seriously troubled youth.
</P>
<P>
   But SAFY _ and hundreds of agencies like it across the country _
operates with limited oversight from government regulators and has
little financial incentive to run quality homes. Such agencies can
squeeze profits from a system that rewards those who negotiate the
highest prices from government agencies and the lowest prices from
parents who open their homes to difficult, sometimes hostile,
children.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that Bruce Maag, SAFY's founder and
president, pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a
minor in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maag surrendered his license to take foster children
into his own home, he remains a licensed social worker and
continues to operate SAFY with the state's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News also found that Maag and another SAFY
official appear to have profited by buying property and selling it
to SAFY, the nonprofit corporation they administer.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY's real-estate dealings were fueled by the agency's growth.
In 1997 alone, SAFY had $4.5 million in net assets and $538,000 in
cash _ an enterprise built from an industry increasingly swamped
with children.
</P>
<P>
   These children generate income for private, nonprofit agencies
such as SAFY, which serve as brokers in a marketplace where the
government pays most of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The children are less likely to benefit than the agencies that
place them. With a nationwide shortage of foster homes, many
children are taken from abusive or neglectful families only to be
placed in unsafe, filthy or dilapidated homes in run-down
neighborhoods. Others move from home to home with little time to
form lasting relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mansfield, SAFY's attorney and executive vice president of
operations, said the agency has some ``spectacular'' foster homes,
where children are well cared for and parents do all they can. But
he also acknowledged it has homes that are not up to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in homes and I walk out of there ... and I'll ask
whoever I'm with, `What the hell is going on?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Walter, deputy director of the Ohio Department of Human
Services, concedes that the foster-care system is deeply flawed.
Many agencies and the parents they employ, ``are working very hard
at loving kids and taking care of them,'' she said. ``At the same
time, I'm sure there are some providers doing things less than
ethical, and in some cases illegal, and we need to hold them
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Accountability, however, appears to be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government knows little about the children it
spends billions of dollars to support in foster care. In fact, 13
years after Congress ordered states to hand over basic information
on these children, 26 states _ including Ohio _ face penalties for
not complying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judges across the country have found what one called
``outrageous deficiencies'' in the child-protection system. So far,
27 judges in 16 states have issued court orders requiring reforms.
A lawsuit in Broward County, Fla., claims agencies routinely place
foster children who are sexual offenders into foster homes where
they can molest other children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio officials acknowledge the state has been
``rubber-stamping'' the licensing of foster homes and failing to
monitor foster agencies. ``We absolutely believe the system is
broke from the state on down,'' Walter said. ``We're hearing of too
many instances where kids are in unsafe homes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ State confidentiality laws have the unintended effect of
keeping secret the details of financial mismanagement, abuse and
child deaths. Florida and Washington, for example, claim the names
of children who die in their care are confidential, making it
impossible to verify how they died. And detailing criminal
histories of foster parents is impossible in many states because
officials won't disclose the names of the people they license.
</P>
<P>
   _ Officially sanctioned financial irregularities are easy to
find. In two states examined by the Dayton Daily News _ Texas and
Ohio _ officials told the federal government they spent money on
foster children when the funds actually went to foster-care
administration. The misreporting allows states to get millions of
dollars in federal overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government no longer closely monitors the
foster-care money it sends to the states. Washington declared a
``moratorium'' on in-depth audits in 1993, after states
successfully skirted federal attempts to get them to repay millions
in misspent federal foster-care money. As this moratorium enters
its sixth year and costs continue to rise, federal officials are
experimenting with friendlier audits to entice states to comply
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) calls the continued lack of
oversight ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   ENDLESS STREAM OF KIDS
</P>
<P>
   While the government looks the other way, the cost of foster
care is rising dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, experts estimate that federal, state and local
governments spent $9 billion on foster care. Because there is no
cap on federal spending, the cost for children in federally funded
foster care has risen 183 percent in the last 11 years _ even after
adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has more and more money being pumped into it, and
it has just gone crazy,'' said Maureen Hogan, executive director of
Adopt America Advocates, a national group that lobbies for putting
more foster children up for adoption. ``If this was a different
industry, you would hear a hue and cry over what is happening in
foster care. Can you imagine if the government put a moratorium on
inspecting nuclear power plants?''
</P>
<P>
   The bill for foster care is getting bigger because kids are
flooding the system. Between 1986 and 1998, the number of children
in foster care nationally rose 90 percent, to 520,000.
</P>
<P>
   The children showing up at the government's doorstep are, in
part, a tragic byproduct of the escalating use of hard drugs,
particularly the crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 U.S. General Accounting Office survey found that an
estimated two-thirds of the 84,600 children in foster care in Los
Angeles County and Cook County, Ill., had at least one parent who
abused drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   This would be less a problem if enough good homes could be found
for these children, but that isn't the case. The GAO said the
dramatic increase in the number of foster children, and the fact
that children often stay in foster care for years, makes homes
increasingly difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   With more kids in the system, and few controls once they get
there, more and more children are being placed in substandard
foster homes, said Richard Wexler, director of the National
Coalition for Child Protection Reform in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say we are taking children from danger to safety when many
times, it is the other way around,'' Wexler said. ``The rate of
maltreatment in foster care is far, far higher than generally
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said even by the industry's own figures, foster children
make up less than 1 percent of all children but account for 3
percent of the instances of child abuse. He suspects the actual
figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this stuff is so badly under-reported is the
child-welfare system never looks closely at what it doesn't want to
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wexler and others say the system provides incentives
for foster-care agencies to ignore what happens once a child is
taken off the government's hands and placed in a private home.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Public agencies recruit their own foster parents to take in
younger and easier-to-handle children. Typically, those parents
receive less money for accepting children than those recruited by
private agencies because the children are easier to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   However, public agencies send many of their seriously troubled
children, who make up an estimated 30 percent of the children in
foster care, to private foster-care agencies. These agencies _ 150
of them in Ohio alone _ often tout their treatment homes for youth
with severe emotional or behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although private agencies say these treatment homes specialize
in caring for sex offenders, juvenile delinquents and other
troubled youth, no national standards exist to ensure that the
parents in those homes are equipped to handle such complex
problems. In fact, in Ohio, officials acknowledge that licenses are
granted almost automatically to foster homes recommended by private
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these homes have been mislabeled as treatment homes
in order for providers to charge higher rates,'' said Elizabeth
Clark, who for years ran the CopperCare foster-care agency in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies collect a per diem _ from $15 to hundreds of dollars
each day _ for every child placed. The more difficult the child,
the more money an agency charges. That agency, in turn, generally
pays parents about half that money, with the rest going for
administration, salaries and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that successfully negotiate low rates with parents can
keep a larger share of the per diem.
</P>
<P>
   What they do with that per diem is a matter of growing concern.
In Ohio, auditors reviewing the financial dealings of private
foster agencies have concluded that the private foster-care
industry is rife with fiscal abuse. A state audit of one agency in
Columbus found directors using foster-care money to care for their
quarter horses, to buy season hockey tickets and to pay for hair
salon and tanning visits.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN AS PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   SAFY has expanded from a business operating out of a house in
Lima to a multistate organization with 280 employees. According to
SAFY, the expansion has brought some impressive losses. However,
the numbers bear examination.
</P>
<P>
   Although SAFY has its national offices on Elida Road in Delphos,
northwest of Lima, there is a separate nonprofit SAFY corporation
in each state where the agency operates.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY of Ohio, for example, reported to the IRS in 1997 that it
had lost $377,324. There was also grim news from SAFY corporations
in Oklahoma, Texas and South Carolina. SAFY of Nevada did eke out a
small surplus of $18,000, but that was more than offset by SAFY of
Indiana, which lost $134,000.
</P>
<P>
   Submerged in all this red ink is a contract between each of the
state SAFYs and the two national nonprofit companies headquartered
on Elida Road: SAFY of America and SAFY Holding Co.
</P>
<P>
   The local SAFYs are required to lease all their equipment from
SAFY Holding Co. and to have their programs managed by SAFY of
America. Thus, SAFY of Indiana, the subsidiary reporting a $134,000
loss in 1997, was billed for $668,000 in management fees from SAFY
of America in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Are the SAFY foster-care agencies in each state losing money?
The answer is yes. They reported losing a total of $763,971 in
1997. But in that same year, the agency's IRS records show that
SAFY of America amassed a $1 million surplus while SAFY Holding Co.
netted $58,000.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of being a foster parent are, in some ways, as
convoluted as the accounting systems of the agencies they serve.
</P>
<P>
   In this system, a perverse pecking order develops. Children with
the worst problems rise to the top because they carry with them the
largest per diems, providing an enticement for some of the poorest
parents to take the most troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Vondrell, director of Daybreak, a Dayton runaway shelter
that helps foster children, said most foster parents provide good
care. But she said some financially strapped parents are so reliant
on the government money they receive that little of it is spent on
caring for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foster parents will warehouse youths. They are getting
$800 a month (per child) and they have seven or eight kids in the
home,'' Vondrell said. ``I had one foster parent, she listed an
income of three times what I make and her total income is foster
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Children in the system repeatedly tell of living with foster
parents who spend money intended for their care on everything from
home furnishings to new clothes. As one Dayton foster child
explained, ``They say they are not in it for the money, but you sit
and watch everything get redecorated. ... The lady's daughter has a
new wardrobe and I am still asking for a new pair of shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler believes the system drives out the best parents, who must
fight so hard to make sure their foster kids get proper services
that they eventually burn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foster care doesn't pay enough to be a good foster parent, but
it pays more than enough to be a lousy one,'' he said. ``If you are
a good parent, you still dip into your own pocket to pay for things
to make a child really feel like part of a family. But if you are a
bad parent and want to milk the system, there is enough money to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and children are both shortchanged in a system driven by
money, said one Dayton-area couple, who didn't want to be named
because they said SAFY sent out a letter asking foster parents not
to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the whole foster-care system is in a quandary,''
the father said. ``It ceases to be about kids. It's all about
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   FOSTER-CARE TREK
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no nationwide figures, those involved in the
system say it's not unusual for foster children to live in eight or
more homes before turning 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move from foster home to foster home, so they don't
bond,'' said Sue Durant, a Piqua foster parent who has cared for
foster children with problems ranging from schizophrenia to
attachment disorders.
</P>
<P>
   She recently started caring for a mentally retarded girl who had
already lived in five foster homes and had so much trouble
adjusting she smeared feces around the house and threw screaming
fits. To make matters worse, Durant said she finds such children
are typically overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time she moved, the parents had taken her to the doctor
and when I got her she was on nine medications,'' Durant said,
shaking her head. ``Now she is on three.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Taylor, 26, of Hamilton lived in 12 foster homes and with
various relatives in three states before she turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the (case file), you'd be like, what the hell are
they doing? I was in 18 different homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One Dayton girl, whose name isn't being used because she's not
yet 18, said she lived with six foster parents in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady kicked me out because her boyfriend tried to do
something to me,'' she said. Next she was placed in a home with
five other women, ranging in ages from 15 to 85, who argued all the
time. In another home, she said, her foster parent persuaded a
physician to put her on an anti-depressant other foster kids in the
home were taking.
</P>
<P>
   She rebelled. ``I didn't take it because I was convinced that
I'm not crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The nomadiclike trek through foster care is caused, in part, by
the children themselves. Parents tell of children who start fires,
steal money and threaten their lives. One foster parent recalls a
child who laced her contact lens solution with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up wearing a patch for a long time,'' said Elaine
Redmond Scott of Dayton. ``It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her living room on Salem Avenue, Scott cried as she
talked about her foster children. The boy who laced her contact
solution was taken from his crack-addicted mother. The boy's
mother, father and an uncle are all in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids ... are angry with their caseworker who promises
them things they don't come through with,'' she said. ``And they
are angry because they know their parents don't want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they're just angry. And when that anger spills out,
some frustrated foster parents hand the children back to the
agencies that placed them _ and those agencies have few choices
other than to place them in other homes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time these children turn 18 and ``age out'' of care,
experts say, their ability to cope with life's problems is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most telling indictments of foster care can be found
in a police report from Shawnee Twp. in Allen County. Attached to
the incident report about a foster child threatening a social
worker is the youth's handwritten note. The boy, who describes
being bounced through eight foster homes, struggles to explain why
he is so angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows how I feel. I've grown up with hate in my heart
against everybody. The county took me away from my family. They
think they did me a favor but they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just made my life worst.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Top executives from three of the nation's top copper
companies secretly convened in a room at the Trump International
Hotel in Manhattan last Friday to try to resolve one of the
nastiest, most convoluted corporate takeover fights in recent
years. When they emerged more than two hours later, it was nastier
and more convoluted than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting brought together Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps
Dodge, the nation's largest copper producer, with the chief
executives of two competitors, Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals
Co., that had agreed last July to merge with each other. Yearley,
rather than see his smaller rivals join hands, had launched his own
$2.8 billion hostile offer to acquire both of them for Phelps
Dodge. Finally, after weeks of rebuffing Yearley, Francis
McAllister of Asarco and Milton Ward of Cyprus Amax had agreed to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley presented his best offer, he recalled. But he was not
willing to meet their demand _ $3.1 billion for the combination.
When the meeting broke up, Yearley was still determined to own both
companies and McAllister and Ward, eager to protect their
interests, quickly began a search for a white knight, adding yet
another player to the corporate chess game.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, a brawl in the copper industry was unthinkable.
Ailing economies in Asia and Latin America had left demand for
copper waning. Prices plummeted to a 12-year low then _ a paltry 63
cents a pound. Profits at copper mining companies tumbled, with
some companies forced to cut production to help arrest the price
slide. In fact, the industry's bleak outlook was the catalyst that
prompted McAllister to talk to Ward in the first place last May.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly that world has changed. Copper prices have risen 33
percent since then. Now, Asarco and Cyprus Amax, instead of being
left alone to embrace each other out of desperation, have, in
effect, become much more valuable prizes on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as soon as they walked out of the meeting last Friday,
the two sought a bid from Grupo Mexico, a little-known Mexican
copper producer and Asarco's largest shareholder. Grupo Mexico,
which had been eying the action for a while, immediately offered to
pay $1.03 billion in cash for Asarco, barely edging out Phelps
Dodge's $1.01 billion stock and cash offer. Asarco and Cyprus Amax,
essentially acknowledging that their original deal was no longer
viable, postponed shareholder votes scheduled for Thursday on the
merger, giving each other until Tuesday to reconsider their
options, even ditch merger plans altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The four-way fight is endemic of what has happened in stagnant
commodity-driven industries seeking some way to shore up production
without losing their shirts in the process. Low prices in
slow-growing industries, including oil, aluminum, copper and
chemicals, have made even the most unattractive partners appealing
to formidable competitors hoping to cut costs and restore
profitability to their slim-margin businesses. And with 1980s-style
corporate takeover tactics back in vogue, properties expected to
benefit from rising prices are now worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When copper was 65 cent per pound, no one thought anyone would
have been fighting over these two companies,'' said Tom Burnett,
founder of Merger Insight, which is based in New York. ``The worm
has turned. Commodity prices are on the move and companies don't
want to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Asarco and Grupo Mexico said executives would not
comment on recent events. Executives at Cyprus Amax did not return
phone calls. But people involved in the talks said Cyprus Amax had
been scouting for another partner and could possibly strike a deal
soon with Phelps Dodge. Asarco too has been negotiating with other
suitors this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McAllister of Asarco, who only became chief executive last
spring, never planned for his company to become a target,
executives close to him said. Instead his solution to Asarco's woes
was for him to act as buyer, squeezing savings out of any merged
entity. McAllister wanted to turn Asarco's fortunes around, one
person said, and he found a willing partner in the older Ward, who
was looking for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the negotiations said Ward had
already approached a handful of potential merger partners for
Cyprus Amax last year. So it was with little fanfare that Ward and
McAllister announced July 15 that their companies would join forces
in a merger of equals, valued then at $737 million in stock. Stock
traders yawned at the news: the stock of both companies dropped 3
percent on the day the deal was announced.

 &HT;    Living site turns into party house
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAWNEE TWP., Allen County _ Fort Shawnee Police Chief Rich
Rohrbaugh can't remember whether both teen-age girls were naked, or
just one.
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember whether they both ran across the road, or only
one did.
</P>
<P>
   But the officer, who came across the girls while on patrol in
the early '90s, does recall that he caught up with one of them
hiding in the bushes. And he's certain they came from an
independent-living program operated near Lima by Specialized
Alternatives for Family and Youth.
</P>
<P>
   The place wasn't easy to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a drug house, that's what it was,'' said former
resident Nicholas Morris, now 22. ``I did acid there. I did crack,
crystal meth and anything I'd come upon. I was surprised by how
much freedom we had. We'd sneak out and go party, and we'd sneak
people in and party. That's all we did was just party.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other independent-living programs that popped up across the
country in the past decade, the program run by SAFY, a private
foster-care agency headquartered in Delphos, was supposed to teach
older foster kids how to land jobs and live on their own.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, SAFY officials say they took teen-age boys and
girls they thought would do well in independent living and put them
in an old schoolhouse converted into 10 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The foster children were given an allowance and taught basic
living skills, such as managing a budget. And because the goal was
to teach kids to live independently, no supervisor lived in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The results were predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night we heard someone screaming, `I've got a gun and I'm
going to shoot you.' The police came out of the woodwork,'''
recalled Jim Dempsey, who lived next door. ``The police did drug
raids. The police were there quite a bit. It was a sad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, police, former residents and a former SAFY official
describe the independent-living facility as a place out of control.
Records at the Ohio Department of Human Services show police were
called to the apartment complex 62 times in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Police found kids using drugs, drinking, fighting, running away
and causing other problems.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY officials acknowledge there were problems at the site but
say it eventually was shut down in 1995 because it was ``fiscally
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFY's tenuous control over the independent-living program was
not the only issue. A Dayton Daily News investigation found the
wives of two SAFY officials bought the building and leased it to
SAFY for five years before selling it to the agency for more than
the original purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY, it seems, was expected to police itself. The federal
government has had a moratorium on in-depth financial audits of
foster-care money since 1993. The government also has declined to
set standards for how independent-living programs should operate.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio auditors say some of SAFY's financial dealings are beyond
their jurisdiction. And officials with the Ohio Department of Human
Services say they have never audited an independent-living
program's operations. Cheri Walter, the department's deputy
director, acknowledged that oversight has been lax but promised
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not monitor foster care in this state very well. We
recognize that it is not a good system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one outside agency examining SAFY while the
independent-living program was running its course.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, SAFY applied for the seal of approval by the
prestigious Council on Accreditation, a group that says it
``champions quality service for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most everything related to foster care, what the council
looked at is secret. But with this accreditation, SAFY could
identify itself as an ``organization in which consumers can have
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   LAND DEAL LAUNCHES PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   The independent-living program began with a property transaction
involving two people close to SAFY executives Bruce Maag and Ron
Jones: their wives.
</P>
<P>
   That SAFY was able to conduct business with the family members
of executives shows how much freedom these agencies have to
operate. Details of the transaction show something else: Bad
programs don't necessarily mean bad business.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes of a SAFY board meeting on Jan. 27, 1990, note that
Maag, SAFY's founder and president, and Jones, a vice president,
were ``in the process of purchasing property at 1130 Shawnee Road,
Lima, Ohio, and were proposing to lease the property back to
SAFY.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, nonprofit corporations are cautioned against doing
business with themselves as individuals. However, the board
unanimously approved renting the building from Maag and Jones even
before the pair had purchased it. The motion to rent the property _
a rambling old brick schoolhouse with a small ranch-style house
behind it _ stipulated that SAFY would pay market rate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the property was not purchased by Maag and Jones but by
their wives who, according to property records, bought the land for
$185,000 just weeks after their husbands had gotten the rental
commitment from the SAFY board.
</P>
<P>
   The women paid for the property without putting up any of their
own money, records show. They obtained two loans. One was from the
Citizens National Bank of Bluffton for $138,750. The other was from
the seller, who gave them a second mortgage of $46,250.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mansfield, SAFY's attorney and vice president of
operations, said SAFY rented the building from the women for
$24,000 a year. However, a copy of SAFY's audited financial
statement from 1994 says the rent that year was $35,966.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its money, SAFY got a building for its teen-agers
that was, according to former residents, dilapidated. The place was
a ``hellhole,'' said Morris, who lived there for a year starting in
1994. ``There was holes in the walls, stains on the walls from
water. It was real dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, the neighbor, said the old schoolhouse was divided into
tiny apartments, filled with used furniture and had a common living
area with a television secured to the wall. ``It's no place I would
put my own children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one girl in the program got pregnant. Another teen
frequently asked him for money. And he ended up giving a winter
coat to a resident who was going to school without one.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these conditions, the state never stepped in to shut
down the program or even raise questions about how it was
operating. Ohio Department of Human Services records show it
investigated the independent-living program only after the
department received a complaint in 1995 _ five years after it
opened _ from Donald Zlotnik, former vice president of development
for SAFY.
</P>
<P>
   Zlotnik told officials he resigned from SAFY in July of that
year because, among other things, Maag and Jones ``made money'' off
of SAFY while children suffered, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they were leery of Zlotnik's complaint
because he wanted the state to hire him as a consultant. Department
records also show Zlotnik had written to Maag the week after he
resigned threatening to go public about SAFY's problems unless Maag
paid him $100,000. If he received the payment, Zlotnik wrote, he
would ``pack up my computer and leave for the north woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield called Zlotnik a disgruntled former employee whose
allegations are ``garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the human services department report said many of
Zlotnik's allegations were out of the state's purview. However, the
investigator looking into SAFY's independent-living program noted
that police were concerned that ``program youth were buying drugs
with the stipend they received.'' The report found ``There may be a
shred of truth to some of Mr. Zlotnik's allegations,'' but many
were unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that (the program) was mismanaged,'' said
Ron Browder, a state human services department deputy director,
``but it was run very loose.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOWHERE ELSE TO GO'
</P>
<P>
   Pat Sheets of Lima said she knows the program all too well.
Sheets said that when she first started visiting her son, Michael,
there, she thought SAFY ran ``a really good program.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets recalled that her son, now 26, who had been in and out of
trouble as a youth, was learning how to contact-paper old cupboards
and had put together a family photo album.
</P>
<P>
   During subsequent visits, the picture turned bleak. Sheets said
she frequently saw beer cans in the trash and eventually discovered
the resident manager actually lived in the house behind the
complex, so no one supervised the teens after dark. When she found
a pair of panties in Michael's room, she learned his girlfriend
often spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't care if the girls spent the night with guys,''
Michael Sheets said. He said workers didn't seem concerned about
much else, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was a big teen-age party. You didn't work. You
didn't do nothing. There was no supervision,'' Sheets said. ``Was
it a good setting? No. It didn't do nothing good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Sheets, who allowed her son to go to the program because he
was unmanageable, is proud that her son recently got certified to
operate heavy equipment and is turning his life around. But she
doesn't credit SAFY.
</P>
<P>
   He left SAFY's program because he was sent to jail for two
weeks. He was a juvenile at the time, and he and his mom declined
to talk about the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets was not the only person to go to jail from SAFY's
independent-living program.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who said he developed a taste for crack cocaine while in
the program, is now at Madison Correctional Institution in London.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his drab prison garb in a white, concrete block room,
Morris said the parties were going strong when he arrived in 1994.
``My first day there, I got drunk and puked everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who is from Cleveland, ended up in foster care after his
mother committed suicide when he was 9 years old. He never knew his
father. ``There was nowhere else to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After moving through a couple of foster homes, Morris turned 16,
started high school and got expelled for hitting a teacher. That's
when SAFY placed him in independent living.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was 17 at the time, said he hadn't used hard drugs
before moving to the SAFY apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Strung out on drugs, Morris said he eventually lost his job at
McDonald's. So one evening he waited for the resident manager to
leave her house behind the apartment building, broke in and stole
$105 to buy crack.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was charged with aggravated burglary and sentenced to
four to 15 years in prison. Instead of going to prison, he was
given probation, and Morris said two SAFY workers tried to help him
straighten out his life. But crack was more powerful. He violated
his probation and started serving his original sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Morris blames himself for getting hooked on drugs while he was
in the program, but he wishes it had been a different kind of
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put teen-agers into a house like that, you know, they
really didn't teach us nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Evans, the independent-living coordinator who supervised the
resident manager, said the program had the usual problems faced by
troubled teen-agers. She said teens were sometimes in the building
alone because they were supposed to be learning to live
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a group home. It was not designed for intense
supervision where somebody is eyeing you seven days a week,'' she
said. ``It was a life-skills development place to help (teens)
become independent and function on their own. Therefore, children
must experience cooking, cleaning and making decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the success of Eric Hunt, a former resident who lived
in the complex for two years until 1994, is proof that the program
helped kids.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a 22-year-old mechanic, husband and father of two,
confirmed that SAFY ran an ``excellent program.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he party there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Always,'' he said. ``It was a party house.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident manager found it tough ``for one person to control
a bunch of out-of-control kids,'' said Hunt, who lives in Lima. He
said he used to sneak in a six-pack of beer on Friday nights and
drank ``a lot'' as an underage teen in the house _ but only beer.
He added that he never saw the other foster kids use hard drugs _
just marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other teens took the partying ``to extremes,'' Hunt
acknowledged. ``We definitely had the police there.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of them, it was too much freedom too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   TEARING IT DOWN TO THE GRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Today, a gravel lot is all that's left of the old schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   To Nicholas Morris, who had watched as SAFY eventually bought
new windows and started other renovations on the house, it didn't
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the crazy part,'' he said. ``I ended up moving and the
next thing I know, it's torn down after they fixed it all up and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange turn of events was driven by SAFY's land deals.
</P>
<P>
   The building renovation began around the time the Council on
Accreditation was beginning its inspection of SAFY in 1993.
Although SAFY did not own the building, Mansfield acknowledged the
agency paid for the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the accreditation council was not happy that SAFY
was renting a building owned by family members of SAFY officials.
To avoid a conflict, Mansfield said the SAFY board solicited
several appraisals, decided what it would pay for the building and
dictated to Mrs. Maag and Mrs. Jones terms of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY paid the women $200,000 _ $15,000 more than they had paid
five years earlier. This was on top of SAFY paying them rent and
paying for repairs on the building.
</P>
<P>
   David Nell, chairman of the SAFY board, had no recollection of
anything connected with the Shawnee Road property. He said he did
not recall the renovation, appraisals or the agency's decision to
buy the property from the wives of Maag and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said Nell is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale complete, SAFY won the Council on Accreditation's
seal of approval, but SAFY didn't hold the Shawnee Road property
for long. In October 1995, 10 months after SAFY bought the
property, it turned a quick profit, selling the land to the owners
of the adjoining properties, a funeral home and an old age home,
for $236,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Chiles, one of the purchasers, said their first act was to
tear down the old schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why, he said: ``protection.'' He feared what new
business would pop up next to his funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   While the Shawnee road property is gone, SAFY continues to
operate an independent-living program, although now it's a
``scattered-site'' program, meaning one or two teens live in single
apartments at various areas in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said independent-living programs are difficult to
operate, in part because some teen-agers just aren't ready to live
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY stopped placing children together in an apartment complex
for good reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty you have with the Shawnee Road property is you
are talking about this being independent living, so the kids are by
themselves. Any kid you provide ... with an apartment and they've
been in supervision for however many years and, yeah, they are
going to cut loose a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So can you imagine putting eight or 10 or 12 of them together?
Oh, Jesus.''

 NEW YORK: was announced.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts at the time said the ho-hum response was because
neither of the companies' shareholders were paid a premium and they
did not understand how the duo could successfully improve profit
margins without cutting production. ``People wanted to see how
they'd perform before they bid up the stock,'' said Ali Agha, a
metals and mining analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. But the
merger did catch the attention of Yearley, who said he thought a
three-way merger with Asarco and Cyprus Amax could be just the
ticket to make Phelps Dodge the premier low-cost global copper
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge is one of the few copper companies to turn a
profit. And after mulling over the combination, he said he called
both Ward and McAllister on Aug. 10 to propose they meet. The two
rebuffed his offer, saying their merger agreement barred them from
independently talking to other suitors. Still, Yearley followed up
with a letters to the chief executives and boards of directors,
requesting a reply within a week.
</P>
<P>
   None came, until the two companies publicly dismissed Phelps
Dodge's offer Aug. 20 and reconfirmed their own merger. So Phelps
Dodge went public with a sweeter offer that day, offering stock for
the pair with a combined value of $2.6 billion, a 30 percent
premium to the companies' trading prices the previous day. Five
days later, Asarco and Cyprus Amax snubbed that bid, suggesting
they would be willing to negotiate only if Phelps Dodge put a much
better deal on the table. To deter stockholder interest in the
Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco and Cyprus Amax also sweetened the terms
of their own merger, offering an extra payment of $5 a share in
cash once the deal was completed. Undaunted, Phelps Dodge launched
a tender offer for shares in the two companies Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley was not the only interested party, however. Grupo
Mexico, Mexico's largest diversifed mining company, owned a 9.7
percent stake in Asarco, the largest single holding. Its chairman,
German Larrea, watched the brouhaha intensely. Not only was he
interested in getting the best price for his shares, executives
said, he also was potentially interested in a piece of the action
himself. Larrea, according to documents recently filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, held separate meetings in late
August and early September in Mexico City with both McAllister of
Asarco. Executives from Phelps Dodge also tried to woo him to vote
for their bid, Yearley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Larrea was an attentive suitor. An executive
close to the company said Larrea ``didn't want to do something
hostile'' after Asarco's announcement in July. But now, with Phelps
Dodge in the picture, he said, Larrea ``perceived himself as the
good guy.'' A spokesman for Larrea said he was not granting
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Larrea had a problem, though. Because Grupo Mexico's stock did
not trade in the United States, it would have to offer cash. So the
company hired Chase Securities Inc. as its adviser and to arrange
financing for its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enthusiasm for Phelps Dodge's offer was growing on
Wall Street, particularly after the company increased its bids
again, on Sept. 22, to a stock and cash offer worth about $2.8
billion for the two companies together. Regulators were believed to
be giving the nod to the three-way merger, despite initial
antitrust concerns, according to executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco and Cyprus Amax, after finally agreeing to meet Yearley,
laid out several demands at the session last Friday. First, said
Yearley, they wanted Phelps Dodge to pay a 55 percent premium to
their stocks' prices prior to the Phelps Dodge bid Aug. 20. Next,
they wanted Phelps Dodge to take the risk of any antitrust
approval. They also wanted to avoid paying a $45 million breakup
fee for canceling their merger. Top executive pay packages would
have to be honored. If Yearley could agree to those terms, he had a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley said he agreed to almost everything except price.
Already Phelps Dodge was offering about a 40 percent premium to buy
the companies. ``We thought we'd gone far enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the skirmish took an unexpected twist later that afternoon.
A representative of Credit Suisse First Boston, which was advising
Asarco, contacted Larrea of Grupo Mexico, documents filed with the
SEC show, and made him an offer: Asarco would be willing to
consider ``an all cash firm offer for all of its shares at $26 per
share.'' Cyprus Amax was mentioned too, but Grupo was not
interested, said an executive close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the talks said Asarco executives did not
know that Larrea was interested in buying the company _ despite
having had several discussions with key executives at Asarco _
describing the call as ``one of those interesting coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Grupo Mexico announced its plans to launch a tender
offer for Asarco for $26 a share, slightly higher than the $25.47
Phelps Dodge had proposed two days earlier. ``As you know, in the
past we have expressed an interest in exploring the possibility of
a combination of our two companies' operations,'' Larrea wrote in a
letter to McAllister that evening. ``Briefly put, we believe our
proposal is in the best interest of your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   As advisers and executives sort through the offers this week, it
is not yet clear which company will buy Asarco or Cyprus, or if
they end up together.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, said one banker involved in the deal, ``It was a
good attempt that didn't work out that well.'' More to the point,
he added, ``Althought it will end up being good for shareholders,
it may not be necessarily be good for management.'' &QL;

CORRUPTION CHARGES HAVE HURT U.S.-RUSSIA-TIES, SAYS FORMER
PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin
said Wednesday that accusations of Russian corruption and
money-laundering had poisoned relations with the United States, and
he urged political and business leaders in both countries to help
keep the investigation from derailing the larger strategic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who was prime minister from 1992 to 1998, also
defended Vice President Al Gore's leadership skills and insisted
that President Boris Yeltsin of Russia was ``incapable'' of
profiting from corruption. He said he could not vouch for members
of Yeltsin's family, whose bank accounts in the Cayman Islands are
under scrutiny by investigators and who have been accused of using
credit cards provided by a Swiss construction company that did work
for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's remarks at a luncheon given by the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce came during a visit to Washington and New York this
week that seems intended to tamp down fears among American
corporate investors in Russia, who have expressed alarm at the
money-laundering allegations as well as the flight of capital from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said that critics had exaggerated the scope of
corruption in Russia. ``Of course, we have lots of problems, but
they're trying to present everything being corrupted in Russia, and
that the whole of Russia is criminal,'' Chernomyrdin said through a
translator. ``We do not deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended his own role in Russia's painful evolution toward a
free-market democracy. ``I can face anyone,'' Chernomyrdin told
business leaders and reporters in free-wheeling remarks laced with
humor. ``All the allegations, all the speculation won't get anyone
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, of course, has every reason to play down the
reported corruption. As the head of Russia's huge gas monopoly,
Gazprom, he has been publicly accused of using his influence over
the company's privatization program to make himself rich.
</P>
<P>
   And the CIA uncovered what its analysts believed to be
conclusive evidence of Chernomyrdin's personal corruption in 1995.
But when the classified report was sent to Gore, it was rejected
and sent back to the CIA with a barnyard epithet scrawled across
it, U.S. intelligence officials said last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's critics say this example illustrates how the
administration is dismissive of ``inconvenient'' intelligence about
foreign leaders with whom White House and State Department
officials have developed close personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said Wednesday that Gore repeatedly expressed
concern about corruption in Russia and how the United States could
help combat it during semiannual meetings between the two leaders
beginning in 1993. ``I could always pick up the phone and call Al
Gore, and he helped out,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   Combating capital flight from Russia, both in legal transactions
and criminal enterprises, is difficult, he said. Russia has no
legal mechanisms to stop capital flight or to monitor
money-laundering. ``If someone is involved with dirty money, we
have to sort it out and punish someone,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister urged American business leaders to
ride out the current problems. Executives from Enron, Caterpillar
and Lockheed-Martin who attended the lunch nodded in agreement.
Caterpillar, for example, plans to open a new $50 million plant
south of St. Petersburg that will employ 300 Russians.

 &HT;    Trading at the foster-care bazaar
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Ohio _ Dejuan is a skinny, 11-year-old kid with what
stockbrokers call great ``upside potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he never go home to his crack-addicted father, he
is a troubled kid who can be difficult to handle. In the economics
of foster care, that makes him a valuable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Children such as Dejuan (his real name is not being used in
order to protect him and his foster parent) can generate hundreds
of thousands of dollars in government-assistance payments during
the years they are in care. That revenue is the fuel that drives
the giant engine of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In Dejuan's case, the revenue flowed to Specialized Alternatives
for Families and Youth, the private, nonprofit foster-care agency
that won the contract from a county agency to care for him. SAFY
kept part of the payment for administrative costs and gave a
portion to a foster parent. Under such a system, the less agencies
spend on caring for a child, the more they can earn in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY placed Dejuan in a house in Troy that real-estate ads would
best describe as a ``fixer-upper.'' His bedroom is an enclosed
patio with a bare, masonry floor. The curtain over the only window
is a black, plastic garbage bag that blocks out sunlight. The twin
fluorescent lights don't help. They are burned out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cost-effective room.
</P>
<P>
   To describe how such children as Dejuan are turned into revenue
sources for the nation's foster-care industry is to describe a
bazaar where those involved in the trade haggle over prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even when social workers, foster parents and others have good
intentions, the system encourages bargaining over children. As
billions of dollars flow each year from the federal government
through public and private agencies, the players negotiate a larger
share of the payments that come with the child.
</P>
<P>
   It is in some ways a lawless system.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government subsidizes care for foster children, most
of whom come from low-income families. But by its own admission,
Washington's control over billions of dollars in subsidies is, at
best, shaky. Some states, which cheat, get too much money while
others get too little.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Youth Commission, for example, has a contract to pay
SAFY $58 a day for each child in SAFY's care. Of that amount, SAFY
must spend $30 on a child's food, clothing and shelter. It keeps
the balance for administration and training.
</P>
<P>
   But a youth commission financial official acknowledged that the
state tells the federal government a much different story when it
applies for subsidies. It tells Washington that it spends $52, not
$30, for the child's food, clothing and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Texas takes in significantly more federal dollars
than it should because money spent on direct care is reimbursed at
a higher rate than money spent on administration.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is by no means unique. Earlier this year, Ohio auditors
examining foster-care records in Montgomery County found a similar
practice. State officials were reporting administrative expenses as
money spent on foster children and getting back more money from the
federal government as a result.
</P>
<P>
   State auditors estimated that the federal government, which
reimburses counties for foster care, overpaid the county $3 million
in one year. The auditors also estimated that they would find more
overpayments if they examined Ohio's other 87 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Texas or Ohio might have to pay back the money. Or then again,
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfin, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services in Washington, said states have a history of
violating foster-care reimbursement rules, then convincing Congress
to let them slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``States don't like to have to fork over money,'' Kharfin said.
``They did seek congressional intervention so they wouldn't have to
pay those dollars back.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many states escaping penalties, Kharfin's agency in 1993
stopped conducting in-depth audits on how states spent federal
foster-care dollars. Instead, the department is trying to establish
less confrontational ways to persuade states to comply. Meanwhile,
foster-care caseloads are exploding, pushing more troubled kids
into the system. And with more children than they can handle, state
and county government agencies are relying more on private foster
care agencies to take in the most difficult kids.
</P>
<P>
   Private agencies find and train foster parents willing to take
in children who may be suicidal, delinquents, arsonists, or have
other emotional and medical problems. In return, private agencies
may charge governments as much as $300 per child, per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, private agencies are paid on a per-diem
basis. They are paid to keep the bed filled (with foster kids),''
said Richard Wexler, director of the National Coalition for Child
Protection Reform in Washington. ``In foster care, as in anything
else, what gets paid for gets done. Foster care gets paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have studied this private system say private
foster-care rates are as negotiable as anything else in the bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Foster-care rates) are astoundingly different from one part
of the country to another,'' said Charlotte McCullough, who studies
these rates for the Child Welfare League of America. ``A lot of
these agencies have historically been successful in negotiating
what their rate is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the same community, she said, you might find one agency
being paid 20 percent to 30 percent more than another agency
providing essentially the same services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have just been better at negotiating a higher rate,''
McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good broker, private foster-care agencies have to buy
low and sell high. Private agencies that convince the government a
child needs intensive services get more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have to have an idea of what type of child you are
dealing with, what level of care he or she needs,'' said Steve
Mansfield, SAFY's attorney and executive vice president of
operations. ``If I am the county, I am going to say, `not much.' If
I am SAFY, I am going to say, `Oh, my God, the kid needs a lot of
help.' It's a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the deal, to make money the agency must
convince foster parents to take in children for the least amount
possible. In these negotiations, parents say the private agency has
the edge. Many financially strapped parents will accept lower per
diems because they need the money.
</P>
<P>
   The agency controls the supply of foster children and all the
information about those children. If an agency thinks a parent is
asking for too large a share of the per diem, it can simply drop
the parent from the program. For parents, many of whom rely on the
extra income, that is a potent threat.
</P>
<P>
   The foster parent who took in Dejuan said SAFY temporarily
stopped sending him children after he pushed for higher rates.
However, when the agency couldn't find a home for Dejuan, who had a
history of setting fires, SAFY agreed to place him at the man's
home in Troy. The Dayton Daily News is not identifying Dejuan or
the foster parent to protect the 11-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   For Dejuan, SAFY collected $90 a day from Hamilton County and
paid his foster father $42.50, the man said. He said foster parents
don't get their fair share of the per diem. ``When you have tough
kids like the ones they send you, you're not making any profit. You
have to pay for food and everything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY's attorney isn't sympathetic. ``If he doesn't like his
rate, there are other agencies,'' Mansfield said, shrugging. ``It's
a free-enterprise system.''
</P>
<P>
   While the foster parent and the agency split the government's
per-diem payment, it is anybody's guess how much will actually be
spent on the child.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY uses its share to administer the program and train the
parents, Mansfield said. He said those costs add up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to track the money so we have to have a financial
department. We have to hire the caseworkers. The caseworkers have
to be supervised. They have to have a local office. They have to
have a secretary in the local office. Foster parents have to be
recruited. They have to have desks, office space, computers,'' he
said. ``It just goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, SAFY's per-diem payments helped the agency accumulate
more than $5 million in assets and cash by the end of 1997, records
show. Mansfield said SAFY, which currently operates in seven states
and is poised to begin operations in three more, uses hundreds of
thousands of dollars from its ``surplus'' when it expands into
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said it costs $200,000 to $250,000 each time SAFY
starts an operation in a state because it takes two years or more
to place enough kids to start making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies aren't the only ones keeping significant portions of
the per-diem payments. Foster children and others say financially
strapped parents spend foster-care money on everything from new
clothes to furniture, leaving kids to fend for themselves. Nicholas
Morris, 22, who entered foster care when he was 9 years old, said
his first foster parents had five foster children, plus two kids of
their own. He suspects money was the family's reason for taking in
foster children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hand-me-downs and real cheap clothes and then they'd go
to the mall and buy their daughter Guess jeans and nice clothes,''
he said. ``You get a lot of anger out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejuan could have ended up being shipped from home to home, but
he may be one of the lucky children in foster care. Each night, his
father sleeps on a battered couch in a small room just outside
Dejuan's door. During the day, the two spend a lot of time together
in this room with its bits of faded brown carpet covering a
concrete floor and an old barber chair in a corner under a creaky
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   The father keeps this vigil to make sure Dejuan does not slip
away or get it in his head to start another fire.
</P>
<P>
   The man is immensely proud of his home, purchased decades ago
for $10,000, and he points out architectural details and new
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   He is also proud of himself and his ability to raise children.
After he and his wife parted, he said, he raised his four children
on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is raising Dejuan. After first taking in the boy as a
foster child, he adopted him in April.
</P>
<P>
   Dejuan's room may be dark and sparsely furnished. He may have
few toys. But he has a father who cares for him enough to give him
something he never had before. Today he is beyond the reach of
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Dejuan, a soft-spoken boy with sad eyes, looked around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more better than where I was,'' he said.

 &HT;    Many foster children slip through cracks at age 18
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The day Aimee Taylor graduated from high school,
her foster parents gave her a unique gift.
</P>
<P>
   They put her out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out of school early. ... We went out to eat, me and one
of my friends. Then we were going to go home and get our outfits
for graduation,'' recalled Taylor of Hamilton. ``I went home and
all my stuff was on the porch. I just took it and left. What else
could I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Taylor's case may seem extreme, each year thousands of
foster kids find themselves on their own at 18. The state stops
paying foster parents after a child is legally an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Although some foster parents voluntarily continue to help
children past their 18th birthdays, a U.S. General Accounting
Office study found an overwhelming majority of foster children
leave foster care ``with the expectation they will be
self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The results, according to the GAO, are catastrophic. A 1998
Wisconsin study found that almost 40 percent of the state's foster
children were unemployed a year after leaving care. A 1997 study in
New York City found a majority of young adults in homeless shelters
had been in the foster-care system. And a 1991 study of foster
children in eight states discovered that 40 percent had moved from
foster care to welfare or some other kind of government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is that far too often, graduates of the American
child-welfare system become America's homeless, prisoners, public
assistant recipients and psychiatric patients,'' said Bill Pinto,
program director for the Connecticut Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocates say governments that take custody of kids have a
responsibility to help them find housing and jobs before taking
away their support. They say teens should have the option of moving
into subsidized apartments while completing independent-living
programs that teach life skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people, if asked, would say no kid should
have to be on his own at 18, but there is no public outcry that
says kids should be cared for until they are 21,'' said Robin
Nixon, director of Youth Services for the Child Welfare League of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and other child advocates asked Congress to pass
legislation that would pay for kids to remain in care longer if
needed. But lawmakers balked at the price tag _ $1 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the U.S. House voted in June to double the amount of
money spent on independent-living programs to $140 million a year
and expand some services to 21-year-olds. The Senate is expected to
follow suit. Rep. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.) said he sponsored the
legislation because, ``Under current law, foster children are
abruptly set adrift.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the new funding would help the 20,000 kids who ``age
out'' of foster care each year, experts say it's far from enough to
reach the 150,000 teens eligible for independent-living programs.
And, they say, even when kids do get into such programs, many of
them are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Fagnoni, a director in the GAO's human services
division, said her investigation into independent-living programs
in California, Maryland, New York and Texas found
``independent-living services fall far short in key areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Contra Costa County, Calif., San Antonio, Texas, and New York
City, for example, foster youths take independent-living classes in
everything from health and hygiene to sexual responsibility. But
few actually have the opportunity to live on their own. In fact,
some group homes keep household items such as laundry detergent and
cooking utensils locked away.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to teach youths to be independent without putting them in
their own housing is like ``having drivers who train without a
car,'' said Mark Kroner, director of self-sufficiency for
Lighthouse Youth Services, a Cincinnati agency that started one of
the country's first independent-living programs in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Without hands-on training, kids ``wander around for years,
becoming homeless or ending up in jail because they steal to
support themselves,'' Kroner said. ``You ask them, 'Do you know how
to live by yourself?' and they say, 'Yeah.' But you put them in an
apartment and they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many former foster youths end up homeless or
in other dire situations because most states don't collect such
information. More than half the states have been unable to report
how many former foster-care youths finished high school, found
employment and lived independent of public assistance, although
such data is required by federal law. This year alone, 26 states,
including Ohio, failed to submit even enough information to avoid
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on independent-living programs also are nonexistent.
``There are no reporting requirements,'' said Shelly Davalos,
program coordinator for the National Independent Living
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio, for example, gets $2.5 million a year out of the $70
million the federal government spends to support independent-living
programs. But only about 30 of Ohio's 88 counties use the money to
provide even partial programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either counties are not interested or they're spending the
money elsewhere,'' Kroner said. ``It's incredible to me. You ask
people what happens to kids who live in the system and they say, 'I
don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say tracking outcomes is difficult because many kids who
leave foster care don't want to be found. A Maryland official said
that only 15 percent of youths returned follow-up letters seeking
information about their status. Local officials in Texas estimated
that they lose touch with about a third of the youth within three
months of their leaving care.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Massinga, former head of child services in Maryland and
chief executive officer of the Casey Family Program, which has
children in foster care in 14 states, says governments must do a
better job tracking outcomes. ``We must know what actually happens
to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Massinga said foster-care officials have focused on process
instead of how well kids do in their care. ``Far too many are not
prepared to handle adult life,'' she said. ``At the end of the day,
we're not able to say, systematically, that we're attending to
their well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   If officials do start finding out what happens to foster kids
after they leave the system, what they learn might not be pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Taylor's graduation present was just one more unpleasant
memory from a childhood that still haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her battle to get her own children out of foster care
in Butler County, Taylor got an attorney and managed to obtain
caseworker notes, court orders and other papers that depict her
life in the foster system. The picture that emerges is chilling.
</P>
<P>
   She was living in Florida with her mother and stepfather when,
at the age of 3, she entered foster care. A social worker described
Taylor and her two brothers as ``love-starved kids who attached
themselves easily to their foster parents. They all three are
well-behaved and loving children.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not to last.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming few years, Taylor was to be placed in 12 foster
homes in three states. She was reunited with family members, then
removed again and sent to a group home, where she repeatedly ran
away. By the time she was 18, Taylor said she had been molested,
beaten with a paddle and moved back and forth among relatives and
foster parents at least 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos took its toll. After a move from a foster home in
Florida to relatives in North Carolina and then back to the same
home in Florida, a caseworker reported that Taylor ``was doing very
poorly in school.'' Other reports said she fought with other
children in a foster home and had a ``severe reaction'' to renewed
contact with her mother. Counseling was recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried the first time I sat down and looked at (these
reports),'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving care, Taylor said she ended up involved in other
abusive relationships. At 26, she has had five children by two men.
She gave the first two up for adoption. The other three were taken
by Butler County Children Services and placed in a foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said children services' contention that she neglected her
children is wrong, and she hopes to win them back. But even if she
fails, she still expects one day to raise a child.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Taylor landed a job as an officer in the Lebanon
Correctional Institution. She's studying criminal justice at Miami
University so she can be a probation officer for teens. And last
month, she got married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have had a bad life, but I'm making it better,'' she
said. ``When I have another baby, and I plan on it, I'm not ...
letting them take it. I'm not going to open my door to them
anymore.''

 &HT;    Criminal record doesn't disqualify foster parents
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ If you only looked at the police mug shot of Diane
Adams, you wouldn't get the full picture.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a Cleveland woman who has taken care of 38 foster
children in the past 11 years, has a house full of kids and toys _
even rabbits who nibble on pellets in the front foyer. She said her
foster children have given her strength during the rough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really love me,'' said Adams, smiling at a 3-year-old in
her lap.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old foster mom also has a criminal record. She
pleaded guilty in 1994 to charges of theft and attempted
trafficking of food stamps. The judge suspended a prison sentence
and ordered Adams to pay restitution and complete a year and a half
of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conviction, Cuyahoga County continued to put foster
children in Adams' care _ and into the care of at least three other
county residents with criminal records, a Dayton Daily News
computer analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, these foster moms have been convicted of
charges ranging from attempted grand theft and food-stamp
trafficking to receiving stolen property, records show. They are
only three of dozens of names that surfaced when the newspaper
compared a list of 10,000 foster parents in Ohio with the names of
adults charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the names of parents and children can be identical, it's
difficult to determine exact figures based on computer data alone.
But a random check of eight computer matches in Cleveland found
that half were foster parents with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers did not surprise Laurel Conrad, spokeswoman for
Cuyahoga County Children Services. ``I'd venture you missed a
few,'' she said. ``I know a lot more than that with criminal
backgrounds. They just aren't as recent as the ones you found.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a growing shortage of foster parents and 6,000
children to place, Conrad said the county cannot be too choosy
about an applicant's criminal history. As it is, the county already
rejects almost three-quarters of its applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you eliminate everybody who has a history off the bat, it
makes it so much harder to find foster families,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ohio law, Conrad said, having a record does not
automatically bar someone from being a foster parent. The law says
people convicted of misdemeanors must be out of jail for three
years before accepting foster children; felons must be out of jail
for 10. The law does prohibit people with certain convictions _
crimes against children, for example _ from working in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad could not explain how Adams continued to care for kids
immediately after her conviction. But after a review, she said the
children living there, as well as those in the other homes of
parents with criminal records, are receiving good care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that removing any of the children, at this time,
would not be in their best interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocates say the need to place foster children with
people convicted of crimes illustrates just how severe the foster
parent shortage is in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio alone, the number of foster cases has almost tripled in
the past decade, to 32,000 in a year. The figures are just as stark
nationwide. Since 1986, the number of children in foster care has
risen 90 percent, to more than half a million. Yet the number of
foster homes during that period has decreased by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wexler, director of the National Coalition of Child
Protection Reform in Washington, D.C., questioned why governments
will spend thousands of dollars a year to take children away from
their own troubled homes only to place them with possibly troubled
foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic. The argument the system makes for endlessly
removing children is `don't take chances.' So why take a chance on
foster parents with criminal records?''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said he has no doubt some of those people can turn their
lives around and do a good job raising children.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, he said, is that if social workers were to help
biological parents straighten out their lives, it would not be
necessary to recruit foster parents who need rehabilitation.
Children should not be taken from their homes and put into a system
that has few places for them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, what (officials are) saying is we have to scrape
the bottom of the barrel because we have a serious shortage of
foster parents,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams could not be reached for a follow-up interview to discuss
her record, once her conviction was confirmed. But the single mom
said she didn't know what she would do if the county stopped
placing children in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who raised four of her own children, recently adopted
four of the foster children placed in her home _ the 3-year-old and
three 7 year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of people saying, `I don't want to get in foster
care because I don't know anything about the kids.' To me, these
kids need a lot of love,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes to spend the rest of her life raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these babies are 16, I'm going to do it again,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Executives deal in children and real estate
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Ohio _ Running a multimillion-dollar private foster-care
agency has brought its president, Bruce Maag, recognition among his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   It has also brought him something else _ money.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving a $130,000 yearly salary, bonuses and
other incentives, a Dayton Daily News investigation found that Maag
and another high-ranking company official appear to have profited
by dealing with their own agency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Maag and agency Vice President Ron Jones,
or their wives, bought real estate at least three times, property
records show. Each time they rented the property to their agency,
Specialized Alternatives for Family and Youth, before selling it to
SAFY for more than the original purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Maag declined comment, but Steve Mansfield, an attorney and SAFY
official, defended the land deals. Mansfield said SAFY did not pay
above-market rates.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, however, say agency executives should not
benefit from dealing with their own nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the manager of a nonprofit is buying and selling property
to that nonprofit, I'd say there is a lot of self-dealing going
on,'' said Ohio Auditor Jim Petro. ``That would potentially be an
abuse of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Rohling, acting director of the Ohio Association of Non
Profit Corporations, also questioned the propriety of selling
property to your own agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not seem ethical or appropriate to engage in business,
to personally profit, because of your relationship with the
nonprofit you are affiliated with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maag is well known within the foster-care industry. In addition
to SAFY, he also heads the National Institute for Alternative Care
Professionals, which trains foster-care professionals throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Less known are Maag's property transactions, some of which blur
the line between Maag as agency director and Maag as businessman.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1985, Maag and Jones purchased an unpretentious
two-story brick house on West North Street in Lima for $30,000,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   They put down $3,000 and agreed to pay the seller $273 a month
until the building was paid off. Maag and Jones then rented the
building to SAFY as its headquarters for $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the pair decided to sell the building to their
nonprofit corporation. Courthouse records show the deal went as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ On March 16, 1989, Maag and Jones paid off the original owners
and obtained clear title to the building. As detailed in the 1985
agreement, the purchase price was $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ As the owners of the North Street property, Maag and Jones
then sold the property on the same day to SAFY for $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ To finance the purchase, SAFY took out a loan of $32,000 from
the Citizens National Bank of Bluffton, and Maag and Jones loaned
SAFY $8,000 to cover the balance of sale.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush it would appear that Maag and Jones made $10,000
in a matter of minutes by selling their property to their nonprofit
corporation. But Mansfield, SAFY's attorney, said this is not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield first said Maag and Jones actually paid $40,000 for
the property, even though the conveyance fee on the deed indicates
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That figure there may not be an accurate figure,'' Mansfield
said, referring to the conveyance fee. He then acknowledged he did
not know for a fact if the conveyance was accurate, but he was
certain that Maag and Jones bought the property for $40,000 and
then sold it for the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   How did he know this?
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said that Jones told him that ``many moons ago and
again this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   At a second interview, Mansfield acknowledged that Maag and
Jones did indeed buy the property for $30,000 and sell it the same
day for $40,000, but he insisted they did not make a profit. The
reason: They had to sink substantially more than $10,000 into the
building in repairs during the four years they owned it and were
renting it to their agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Nell, the SAFY board chairman, could not recall the
purchase. But he said the fact that Maag sold property to his own
agency ``does not raise any questions with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it did happen,'' he said, ``I'm sure it was all perfectly
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a year after SAFY bought the property from Maag and
Jones, their wives bought an abandoned schoolhouse on Shawnee Road.
They soon started renting the property to SAFY, then sold it to
SAFY almost five years later for $15,000 more than they paid
originally.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, SAFY was expanding rapidly and in need of
additional office space. Again, Maag and Jones would figure in a
property transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse records show that the pair bought a former church on
Elida Road in Delphos for $160,000 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the purchase, Maag and Jones began renting the
building to SAFY for what Mansfield guessed was $2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Maag's role as landlord came to an end in December 1994 after
SAFY invited the Council on Accreditation to inspect the agency.
According to Mansfield, the council sent SAFY a clear message: If
you want to win accreditation, you must end your business ties with
your president.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Accreditation) did cause the sale of the Elida Road property
... because of Maag ownership,'' said Mansfield, who also
acknowledged that the council forced the sale of the old
schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the SAFY board of directors formed a committee to
determine the fair market value of the property on Elida Road, the
company's new headquarters. Although Mansfield said that Nell,
SAFY's board chairman, headed the committee, Nell declined to give
specifics about the deal .
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the committee consulted several appraisers to
determine the value of the property and then ``laid it on the
table'': Maag and his partner would accept $270,000 _ a 68 percent
increase above the original purchase price.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it would reinvent itself as
kind of Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular web site to
merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling
powerhouse, which started as an online bookstore, will gather an
unprecedented amount of precious information on the buying habits
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called zShops, begins Thursday with 500,000 new
products _ about four times the offerings of the average Kmart _
the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to
buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

 &HT;    Agency president stays in charge despite conviction
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper, Elliot Jaspin and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bruce Maag, the founder and president of a
private foster-care agency responsible for 1,300 children in seven
states, surrendered his license to take kids into his own home just
before he pleaded guilty in 1987 to contributing to the delinquency
of a minor. Maag was charged in 1986 with two misdemeanor counts of
contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly giving
alcohol to his foster daughter and her friend, and with one
misdemeanor count of abuse alleging he had improper contact with
his foster daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse charge and one of the delinquency counts were later
dropped, according to interviews and documents from the state of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Maag has been able to continue as president of his agency
because Ohio law at the time did not specifically bar anyone
convicted of crimes against children from working in a foster-care
agency. Although the law was changed in 1993, by then Maag's
conviction had been expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Maag was also shielded from public scrutiny by the blanket of
confidentiality that is supposed to protect children. Because his
case involved a minor, it was heard in juvenile court where the
details were kept secret. Even the Ohio department that licenses
his agency had no record of the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is disturbing,'' said Cheri Walter, deputy
director of the Ohio Department of Human Services, which licenses
Maag's agency. ``The system is designed so nobody has to own it. A
number of times we seem to have passed the buck onto someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with a history of abuse or neglect is not a person we
want running a foster-care agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Maag declined to talk about his case, saying his attorney told
him, ``Anything I say can be used against me.'' Maag's attorney
said his client couldn't comment because his agency, Specialized
Alternatives for Family and Youth, is currently in litigation: a
sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by one of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although a SAFY caseworker in 1986 told officials in Logan
County that Maag admitted kissing his foster daughter, who was 16,
the charges involving her were dismissed after she refused to take
the stand. Maag pleaded guilty to the remaining count of giving
alcohol to her friend.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Maag's 1987 conviction, Allen County Judge David
Kinworthy ordered the records expunged. The judge's order sealed
the records forever.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Maag giving alcohol to a minor are still secret,
but the Dayton Daily News has pieced together from state and county
documents and numerous interviews the following series of events
that led to Maag's plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The girl Maag took in as his foster daughter was put into SAFY's
care by Logan County officials because she had been repeatedly
sexually abused, starting when she was a young child.
</P>
<P>
   Anna (she asked that her real name not be used) said the first
time Maag saw her she was living in a SAFY home with a foster
parent who was an alcoholic. A short time later, Maag, then a
licensed foster parent, moved her into his home.
</P>
<P>
   Anna, now 30, said Maag showered her with attention, gave her
credit cards and took her shopping. He encouraged her to be a
model. The two talked for hours. ``He gave me everything I
wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who had grown up in poverty, starved for attention,
it was heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the attention also came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give details about the year she spent in Maag's
home. But she did say that when she arrived there she felt
vulnerable. She felt intimidated by Maag, she said, and her
caseworker had just given her some devastating news: Her mother
never wanted to see her again.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually abused since the age of 4, moved from one foster home
to another, Anna said she got ``to a place that you just didn't
fight anymore. If you wanted to live peacefully, you would just
yield.''
</P>
<P>
   After roughly a year in Maag's home, Anna said she told a SAFY
caseworker, Dru Whitaker, that she had to get out of Maag's house.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was removed and placed in a group home, then a juvenile
detention center. When Anna ran away from the center, she called a
musician she knew in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The musician said he first met Maag and Anna at a bar near
Maag's vacation home in Michigan. He said Anna was very upset when
she called him, so he drove to Ohio and picked her up. Shortly
after Anna's 17th birthday, the two got married.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a letter from Whitaker about the alleged contact
between Maag and Anna moved county officials to investigate Maag.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, who is now SAFY's chief operating officer, wrote Logan
County Children Services on Sept. 22, 1986, saying that her boss,
Maag, admitted to her that he became involved with Anna. Whitaker
interviewed Maag and Anna together in Maag's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce began to tell me there were now complicating factors
that would make it impossible for (Anna) to remain living in his
home,'' the letter says. ``Bruce indicated he and (Anna) made a
mistake. One evening when everyone was gone, Bruce came in after
having a few beers and went to his room. (Anna) gave him a back rub
and he gave her a back rub. She rolled over and they kissed
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Maag then admitted that he felt uncomfortable about what
happened and said the incident was ``not appropriate,'' the letter
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gillespie, a Logan County Children Services worker, later
told state officials the county's case files show, that ``Maag
admitted to drinking beer and (Anna) rubbed his back, he rubbed her
back and they kissed.'' Gillespie also said the county records
contain ``information that would lead one to conclude that more
than back rubbing was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Caron Vernon, executive director of the Logan County Children
Services agency, confirmed Gillespie's account and said she
immediately removed Anna from SAFY's care. She still refuses to
place children there today. ``When I get their stuff, it goes right
in the trash can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon said a caseworker in Allen County, where the alleged
abuse occurred, investigated the complaint and reported his
findings to the sheriff's department. A sheriff's detective did his
own investigation and charges were filed Jan. 13, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, SAFY board Chairwoman Rose Watts wrote a letter
to the state human services department's Toledo office, saying Maag
was being investigated and was ``directed to have no further
contact with the youth in the program.'' Maag offered to take a
leave of absence, but Watts wrote that the board refused because
the ``program could not be without his services.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed, as one prosecutor acknowledged, is ``Megan's
Law'' in reverse _ a series of official decisions that shielded the
charges against Maag from the public and eventually caused the
allegations, his conviction, the sentence and any reference to the
incident to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   While the purpose of closed hearings in juvenile court is to
protect children, Allen County Prosecutor David Bowers said there
was an unintended result in this case: For the public, it ``never
did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he couldn't talk about a case that had been expunged
but recalled Maag's hearing because the agency president has a
``high-profile name'' in Allen County.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon said a Logan County caseworker found the girl's report of
abuse to be credible and was prepared to testify on her behalf. But
the day of the hearing, she received a phone call saying the
caseworker's testimony wasn't needed because Maag had pleaded
guilty to one charge.
</P>
<P>
   Maag's sentence remains a secret, but when he stepped out of the
courtroom in May 1987 following his conviction, he was still firmly
in charge of SAFY.
</P>
<P>
   Maag, 51, a tall, heavyset man with a booming voice who stands
out in a crowd, founded SAFY in 1983 after working at another large
foster-care agency. SAFY is, by all accounts, his passion. His
former accountant described him as a hard-charging manager who
dreams of making SAFY the biggest foster-care agency in the
country. In fact, one official from a national child-advocacy group
said Maag liked to tell others that he handpicked his board members
to make sure SAFY would always remain under his control.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, SAFY board members have demonstrated loyalty to Maag.
</P>
<P>
   A letter on file with the Ohio Department of Human Services
shows Maag's board chairwoman sought to minimize the damage after
the 1987 conviction. Watts, who first notified state officials in
Toledo about the investigation into Maag's conduct, sent a
follow-up letter that said, ``Things have been satisfied to what
we, the board, feel is a satisfactory resolution. The allegations
made by the foster daughter were dismissed. We, the board, feel
there is no reason Bruce should not continue to work in the
capacity in which he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   What the letter doesn't say is that Maag had just pleaded guilty
to one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Maag
also had surrendered his license to be a foster parent, and the
Department of Youth Services had voted not to renew SAFY's license
to care for children who had been in the state's juvenile detention
center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stream of children flowing to SAFY was interrupted,
it was by no means stopped. In Allen County, where the case was
tried, children services officials continue to place children with
SAFY.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Loescher, deputy director of Allen County Children
Services, said she doesn't know what results came from the agency's
1986 investigation of Maag. She doesn't recall his conviction,
although she vaguely recalled that his case was expunged. Nor could
she explain why Allen County officials didn't contact Logan County
to obtain its records about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Loescher said. ``I could not
locate a record of anything happening.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Maag's conviction, Judge Kinworthy ordered the
records sealed. Said Kinworthy: ``There are no records of Bruce
Maag ever appearing before this court.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the judge's decision became clear in 1995, when a
former SAFY official made a number of complaints about Maag's
operation, including allegations that SAFY neglected children and
that Maag engaged in sexual misconduct. By then, SAFY had grown
into a multimillion-dollar agency with hundreds of children in
foster homes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator from the state human services department,
looking into the allegations following the 1995 complaint, at first
found no indication of charges filed. She later learned from a
Logan County caseworker that there had been charges but could find
no records. In the end, the state did not substantiate the
allegations involving Maag.
</P>
<P>
   The state human services department's Walter said the decision
to expunge Maag's conviction means the department has no grounds to
investigate whether Maag's past should bar him from working in a
foster-care agency.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations surrounding Maag also were turned over in 1995
to the Ohio Board of Counselors and Social Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Farnsworth, director of the board, won't say whether an
investigation was launched because all complaints and cases before
the board are confidential. But Farnsworth, who was unaware of
Maag's guilty plea, said the board may pursue more details. ``If he
was convicted of a misdemeanor of that nature relating to his
practice, we would investigate this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mansfield, SAFY attorney and the agency's executive vice
president of operations, said that as president and CEO, Maag has
no day-to-day contact with children. ``He is layers away from
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said he didn't know about the case, but it is legally
a nonevent because the records have been sealed. ``It's been
expunged. I can't tell you a thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFY has no legal liability for what happened to Anna, Mansfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Does it have a moral obligation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Morals? Go talk to the church or your priest,'' Mansfield
said. ``Everybody has different morals. I can separate myself from
those issues. I've had to do that in my years of practicing law.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 years after leaving foster care, Anna said her
memories of abuse are very real.
</P>
<P>
   The slender, soft-spoken blonde, who is now a Christian and
helps abused kids through her church, lives in a house at the end
of a dirt road on an isolated lake in Michigan and has an unlisted
phone number. She's made a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned you don't have to succumb to what people say to
you. I'm 30. I have a beautiful life,'' she said. ``Faith in God
has brought me as far as I've come.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she decided to talk to reporters to show that foster
care can destroy the children it's supposed to save.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of abuse happens in the hands of states which place kids
in foster care,'' she said. ``To me, more damage was done in my
life in the hands of the state than in my home.''

 &HT;    Incentives lacking to fix foster care
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each year, hundreds of thousands of children
languish in America's foster-care system with little hope of
reuniting with their parents or being adopted.
</P>
<P>
   These are boom times in foster care and many child advocates say
the government is at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money drives policy,'' said U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio),
considered on Capitol Hill to be an expert on issues affecting
children. He and others complain that agencies have little
incentive to take kids out of foster care because of the
government's open-ended commitment to pay the bills no matter how
long a child remains in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Governmental financial incentives pose a ``major, major
problem,'' DeWine said, and an overhaul is needed. But DeWine and
others are skeptical that Congress and the Health and Human
Services Department, which administers the multibillion foster-care
program, will ever bring about reform.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, DeWine waged a battle in Congress to pass the
Adoption and Safe Families Act, which is designed to boost the
number of foster children who are adopted. He said the experience
convinced him his colleagues aren't interested in doing the work
required to untangle an entrenched bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 500,000 kids in foster care, you've got a huge
issue in this country,'' DeWine said. ``But the intricacies of
foster care are not something on Congress's radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, foster care doesn't appear to be on the radar screen of
even the officials in the administration who are paid to watch out
for foster children. Six years ago, Health and Human Services
declared a moratorium on auditing how states spend federal dollars
on foster children. The moratorium remains in place.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfin, Health and Human Services spokesman, said the
department is overseeing pilot programs in 12 states to develop
better accounting procedures. Although he couldn't say when,
Kharfin said new regulations are coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Carpenter, an aide to DeWine, said officials made the same
promise a few years ago, but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in this issue,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said the lax oversight is embarrassing. ``They can't just
throw up their hands and say, `Gee, golly, we're not going to do
it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hogan, executive director of Adopt America Advocates, a
lobbying group that wants more foster children adopted, said Health
and Human Services will remain ineffective unless Congress changes
the culture of foster care by putting limits on how long children
can spend in care.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the department won't properly oversee state foster
systems because it fears the states will lobby Congress to cut the
department's budget. Instead, the department placates the states,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to account for federal foster-care dollars
won't be easy. The federal government is struggling to get states
to comply with a law that requires them to report how well children
are doing in their care. This year, 26 states failed to give Health
and Human Services complete information despite facing millions of
dollars in federal fines.
</P>
<P>
   Some key information isn't even required.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of children, for example, die each year in foster care.
But because state and federal record keeping is so chaotic, no one
knows the exact total.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent federal data show 276 children died in foster
care in 1996, but that figure only accounts for the 17 states that
reported to the federal government that year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if foster-care officials in all the states obeyed the law,
Health and Human Services would not know why these children are
dying because the agency never asked, Kharfin said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wexler, spokesman for the National Coalition for Child
Protection Reform in Washington, said the lack of recordkeeping is
another example of lax oversight in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental responsibility the state has when they
decide they are going to be a better parent is to keep that child
alive,'' Wexler said. ``States are incapable of showing when they
are messing up and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler cites numerous instances in which foster kids have been
abused, neglected or killed. Like other child advocates, he wants
the foster system overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   But he said changes should put the emphasis on family
preservation, not adoption. ``The best way to fix foster care is to
have less of it. Children would be better off if services were
provided to keep the family together rather than tearing it
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine's legislation _ which did away with the requirement that
social workers use ``reasonable efforts'' to reunite children with
their biolog is harder than they imagined. Leah McBride, now 25,
said Lighthouse helped her get her own place her senior year in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact I had to pay my bills and if I didn't the phone would
be cut off eventually sank in,'' she said. ``After I paid my bills,
I normally had $10 to $15 left each month.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride said she was taken from her abusive home at 12.
Separated from her three sisters _ one who committed suicide _ she
was placed in two foster homes before getting her own place through
Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a 5-cent-an-hour raise working at a day care
center, McBride realized college was her best chance of escaping
poverty. Now she's majoring in criminal justice at Northern
Kentucky University.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she addressed a Lighthouse conference on
independent living. Dressed in a crisp suit, with her hair pulled
back in a bun, McBride looked like the defense attorney she plans
to become.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed much of her success to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Counties across Ohio refer youths to Lighthouse, which screens
for those who appear ready to try being on their own. The agency _
which charges $55 a day per kid _ helps them find their own
apartments, helps pay the rent until they get on their feet and
monitors them until they are ready to leave care.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthouse oversees about 50 kids ages 16 to 19. The agency
gives them about $60 weekly as an allowance and puts $15 into
savings accounts, which the teens are given when they leave care.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the help, it's not easy being on your own, McBride
said. But it has one big advantage: ``Nobody can abuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroner said 600 foster kids have been through Lighthouse's
program and most left with a place to stay, a small amount of
savings and a job. There are no long-term statistics, however, and
Kroner concedes many don't manage as well as McBride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls from kids who say things like, `Mom moved in and
cleaned me out,' or a kid gets kicked out and says he didn't get it
until he spent a night under an overpass,'' Kroner said. ``What we
can say is that 75 percent of our kids have a potentially stable
place to stay, and if they play their cards right, they will do
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers say helping foster teens come to terms with their
pasts is a tougher challenge than helping them plan a stable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the family dysfunction, Patrick Nelson, a
psychologist at Lighthouse, said most teens who leave foster care
will return to their biological families, at least temporarily.
Independent-living staffs must try to teach kids how to best deal
with their families because family bonds, even destructive ones,
are strong.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home his point, Nelson asked the teens in one
conference session to talk about their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may never be going home, but they are still my family and
you need to respect that,'' said one 15-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Another boy was angry because his caseworker would not let him
attend his brother's funeral in Chicago. His brother was a gang
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what you're saying is those of us who work with you need to
make it possible to stay connected?'' Nelson asked.
</P>
<P>
   The boy nodded.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl in the group started to get emotional. ``I would
like to be able to see my mom. She's come so far. She'd actually be
able to handle me now if I wasn't so bumpy,'' the girl said. ``I'd
like to visit with my family alone, instead of having it supervised
in some place I don't know where we are at, some supervisor's
office. That's not family time, sitting in some place with two
chairs and a table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to make sure you're safe,'' Nelson told her, but
the response made her angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been physically unsafe with my mom,'' she said.
``I'm not just a hermit crab and I don't want to be treated like
one either. I don't want my cage cleaned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say such anger and conflicting emotions are common, but
Daybreak's Vondrell said teens with the right guidance can and do
recover.

 &HT;    AS FISCAL YEAR BEGINS, PARTIES BLAME EACH OTHER FOR EXPECTED
RAID ON SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With two days to go until the start of a new fiscal
year, Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday could have been
celebrating a near halt to the decades-long practice of raiding the
Social Security surplus to finance the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two parties were laying the groundwork for blaming
each other when, as predicted by budget experts, they dip into the
pension surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget is still in the works. Congress has passed a
temporary spending bill to give itself three more weeks to resolve
remaining differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances will I vote to spend one penny of the
Social Security surplus on anything other than Social Security,''
vowed House Republican Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas. ``It's time to stop
the Democrats and the president from raiding Social Security, as
they have done for almost _ since 1967 _ to pay for more big
government programs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all ``in the best schoolyard tradition,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart replied. He ticked off a list of the
bookkeeping gimmicks that Republicans are using, such as labeling
the census count as an off-budget ``emergency,'' to hide what he
said are their budget-busting ways.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also blasted a House Republican plan to stretch tax
credits for the working poor over 12 months instead of making a
lump sum payment. That would push some $9 billion into the
following fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the squabbling, some budget watchers are stepping
back to note a historic reversal.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the two parties have joined in using billions of
dollars in Social Security trust funds. In the year that begins at
week's end, forecasters say the government will borrow a relatively
modest $30 billion from the pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although that does not fulfill their solemn promise, even some
budget hawks are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made great progress,'' said Robert Bixby, policy
director for the Concord Coalition, which has been pressing
Congress to stop deficit spending. ``They tried to go cold turkey
this year'' and largely succeeded, even if they fell off the wagon
a couple of times, Bixby said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the finger-pointing now, Bixby said, ``I don't think
either one trying to blame the other is going to have much
credibility with the American public.'' He predicted that it would
take two more years before the Social Security funds are left
completely untouched.
</P>
<P>
   At the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,
Robert Greenstein offered a similar forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Greenstein said that the country has benefited because
the two parties have been so deadlocked in the budget battle this
year. President Clinton has failed to enact major new social
spending he proposed, and his veto killed the tax cut that
Republicans passed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rising overall surplus, which will be used to
reduce the publicly held debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying down the debt is one of the best things we can do
now,'' Greenstein said.

<P>
   LONDON _ Top executives of the Bank of Scotland went on a road
show of sorts Wednesday, traipsing around London in the rain in an
effort to persuade shareholders of National Westminster Bank of the
merits of their $34 billion hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots had some impressive evidence in support of their case:
the bank reported a 12 percent increase in pretax earnings for the
fiscal first half, better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps to allay concerns about taking on a bank twice its
size, the Bank of Scotland also said Wednesday that it was
exploring an alliance with an American partner. ``We are talking to
a number of major U.S. companies and a number of smaller ones,''
the bank's chief executive, Peter Burt, said. It declined to
identify possible partners.
</P>
<P>
   While The Bank of Scotland is the only bidder so far for
Natwest, The Royal Bank of Scotland is said to be mulling over a
counteroffer of its own, according to executives that have been
briefed on the plan. Abbey National PLC is also said to be
interested in Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Natwest are still trading above The Bank of Scotland's
original bid around 12.50 pounds a share, or $20.55, as investors
eagerly await a suitor to announce a counteroffer. Wednesday, they
declined 28 pence to close at 14.23 pounds, or $23.40.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, the Bank of Scotland reported Wednesday
that pretax profit for the six-month period ending on Aug. 31
increased to 471 million pounds , or $776.8 million, from 420
million pounds in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts seemed impressed with the bank's financial
performance, Natwest, which has been desperately trying to fend off
the Scottish suitor, had harsh words about its would-be parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid lending growth and buying market share are storing up
problems for the future,'' said Sir David Rowland, the chairman of
Natwest, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Bank of Scotland's net interest margin shrank 9
percent and expenses increased 10 percent, adding, ``Natwest Group
is totally committed to achieving the best value for its
shareholders and continues to believe that the offer by Bank of
Scotland is ill-thought-out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland, in a statement of its own, responded:
``With all their problems and their track record, how can Natwest
criticize a bank with one of the lowest cost-income ratios?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this war of words, most analysts here seemed more
interested in the takeover battle than they were in the the
company's financial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were OK,'' said John Tyce of SG Securities, and
then immediately changing the subject. ``Where is the next bid
coming from?'' he asked. ``Who's coming to the rescue?''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Bank of Scotland rose as much as 5.3 percent in
early trading, and then fell back later in the day, as analysts
became worried about the company's future growth prospects and
about the emergence of another suitor for Natwest. The stock closed
at 7.24 pounds, down 21.5 pence, or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders are fed up with Natwest,'' said Peter Walters, a
banking analyst at ABN Amro here. ``The market looks at this so
much more positively than at the Legal and General deal,'' he
added, referring to Natwest's planned acquisition of Legal and
General PLC, a big British insurer, which has been suspended
pending the outcome of the Bank of Scotland's bid for Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the Bank of Scotland said Wednesday that
it had actually considered acquiring Legal and General itself
months ago and had discussed the idea on a preliminary basis with
the life insurance and pension group.
</P>
<P>
   Burt, who has harshly criticized Natwest's intended acquisition
of Legal and General, said that the Bank of Scotland decided
against buying the company because he saw no merit in such a deal.

 &HT;    Foster-care system in crisis
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELPHOS, Ohio _ Elida Road is ruler-straight blacktop that
slices though rural Ohio's checkerboard of wheat, soybeans, corn
and its newest cash crop: America's castoff children.
</P>
<P>
   Along this stretch of heartland, the fate of many neglected,
abused or unmanageable kids is decided in a one-story, red-brick
office building.
</P>
<P>
   Like a modern-day Rumplestiltskin spinning straw into gold,
officials at Specialized Alternatives for Family and Youth
negotiate with state public agencies for a potentially valuable
commodity: the children nobody else wants.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years, SAFY has grown from a tiny agency in northwest Ohio
to one of the nation's largest private foster-care providers, with
branches in seven states, millions of dollars in revenues and
control over 1,300 children.
</P>
<P>
   In the foster-care industry, it is viewed as a success story, a
thriving and much-needed agency that finds, trains and administers
a network of foster parents willing to take in some of the nation's
most seriously troubled youth.
</P>
<P>
   But SAFY _ and hundreds of agencies like it across the country _
operates with limited oversight from government regulators and has
little financial incentive to run quality homes. Such agencies can
squeeze profits from a system that rewards those who negotiate the
highest prices from government agencies and the lowest prices from
parents who open their homes to difficult, sometimes hostile,
children.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that Bruce Maag, SAFY's founder and
president, pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a
minor in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maag surrendered his license to take foster children
into his own home, he remains a licensed social worker and
continues to operate SAFY with the state's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News also found that Maag and another SAFY
official appear to have profited by buying property and selling it
to SAFY, the nonprofit corporation they administer.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY's real-estate dealings were fueled by the agency's growth.
In 1997 alone, SAFY had $4.5 million in net assets and $538,000 in
cash _ an enterprise built from an industry increasingly swamped
with children.
</P>
<P>
   These children generate income for private, nonprofit agencies
such as SAFY, which serve as brokers in a marketplace where the
government pays most of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The children are less likely to benefit than the agencies that
place them. With a nationwide shortage of foster homes, many
children are taken from abusive or neglectful families only to be
placed in unsafe, filthy or dilapidated homes in run-down
neighborhoods. Others move from home to home with little time to
form lasting relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mansfield, SAFY's attorney and executive vice president of
operations, said the agency has some ``spectacular'' foster homes,
where children are well cared for and parents do all they can. But
he also acknowledged it has homes that are not up to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in homes and I walk out of there ... and I'll ask
whoever I'm with, `What the hell is going on?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Walter, deputy director of the Ohio Department of Human
Services, concedes that the foster-care system is deeply flawed.
Many agencies and the parents they employ, ``are working very hard
at loving kids and taking care of them,'' she said. ``At the same
time, I'm sure there are some providers doing things less than
ethical, and in some cases illegal, and we need to hold them
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Accountability, however, appears to be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government knows little about the children it
spends billions of dollars to support in foster care. In fact, 13
years after Congress ordered states to hand over basic information
on these children, 26 states _ including Ohio _ face penalties for
not complying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judges across the country have found what one called
``outrageous deficiencies'' in the child-protection system. So far,
27 judges in 16 states have issued court orders requiring reforms.
A lawsuit in Broward County, Fla., claims agencies routinely place
foster children who are sexual offenders into foster homes where
they can molest other children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio officials acknowledge the state has been
``rubber-stamping'' the licensing of foster homes and failing to
monitor foster agencies. ``We absolutely believe the system is
broke from the state on down,'' Walter said. ``We're hearing of too
many instances where kids are in unsafe homes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ State confidentiality laws have the unintended effect of
keeping secret the details of financial mismanagement, abuse and
child deaths. Florida and Washington, for example, claim the names
of children who die in their care are confidential, making it
impossible to verify how they died. And detailing criminal
histories of foster parents is impossible in many states because
officials won't disclose the names of the people they license.
</P>
<P>
   _ Officially sanctioned financial irregularities are easy to
find. In two states examined by the Dayton Daily News _ Texas and
Ohio _ officials told the federal government they spent money on
foster children when the funds actually went to foster-care
administration. The misreporting allows states to get millions of
dollars in federal overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government no longer closely monitors the
foster-care money it sends to the states. Washington declared a
``moratorium'' on in-depth audits in 1993, after states
successfully skirted federal attempts to get them to repay millions
in misspent federal foster-care money. As this moratorium enters
its sixth year and costs continue to rise, federal officials are
experimenting with friendlier audits to entice states to comply
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) calls the continued lack of
oversight ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   ENDLESS STREAM OF KIDS
</P>
<P>
   While the government looks the other way, the cost of foster
care is rising dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, experts estimate that federal, state and local
governments spent $9 billion on foster care. Because there is no
cap on federal spending, the cost for children in federally funded
foster care has risen 183 percent in the last 11 years _ even after
adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has more and more money being pumped into it, and
it has just gone crazy,'' said Maureen Hogan, executive director of
Adopt America Advocates, a national group that lobbies for putting
more foster children up for adoption. ``If this was a different
industry, you would hear a hue and cry over what is happening in
foster care. Can you imagine if the government put a moratorium on
inspecting nuclear power plants?''
</P>
<P>
   The bill for foster care is getting bigger because kids are
flooding the system. Between 1986 and 1998, the number of children
in foster care nationally rose 90 percent, to 520,000.
</P>
<P>
   The children showing up at the government's doorstep are, in
part, a tragic byproduct of the escalating use of hard drugs,
particularly the crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 U.S. General Accounting Office survey found that an
estimated two-thirds of the 84,600 children in foster care in Los
Angeles County and Cook County, Ill., had at least one parent who
abused drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   This would be less a problem if enough good homes could be found
for these children, but that isn't the case. The GAO said the
dramatic increase in the number of foster children, and the fact
that children often stay in foster care for years, makes homes
increasingly difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   With more kids in the system, and few controls once they get
there, more and more children are being placed in substandard
foster homes, said Richard Wexler, director of the National
Coalition for Child Protection Reform in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say we are taking children from danger to safety when many
times, it is the other way around,'' Wexler said. ``The rate of
maltreatment in foster care is far, far higher than generally
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said even by the industry's own figures, foster children
make up less than 1 percent of all children but account for 3
percent of the instances of child abuse. He suspects the actual
figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this stuff is so badly under-reported is the
child-welfare system never looks closely at what it doesn't want to
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wexler and others say the system provides incentives
for foster-care agencies to ignore what happens once a child is
taken off the government's hands and placed in a private home.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Public agencies recruit their own foster parents to take in
younger and easier-to-handle children. Typically, those parents
receive less money for accepting children than those recruited by
private agencies because the children are easier to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   However, public agencies send many of their seriously troubled
children, who make up an estimated 30 percent of the children in
foster care, to private foster-care agencies. These agencies _ 150
of them in Ohio alone _ often tout their treatment homes for youth
with severe emotional or behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although private agencies say these treatment homes specialize
in caring for sex offenders, juvenile delinquents and other
troubled youth, no national standards exist to ensure that the
parents in those homes are equipped to handle such complex
problems. In fact, in Ohio, officials acknowledge that licenses are
granted almost automatically to foster homes recommended by private
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these homes have been mislabeled as treatment homes
in order for providers to charge higher rates,'' said Elizabeth
Clark, who for years ran the CopperCare foster-care agency in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies collect a per diem _ from $15 to hundreds of dollars
each day _ for every child placed. The more difficult the child,
the more money an agency charges. That agency, in turn, generally
pays parents about half that money, with the rest going for
administration, salaries and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that successfully negotiate low rates with parents can
keep a larger share of the per diem.
</P>
<P>
   What they do with that per diem is a matter of growing concern.
In Ohio, auditors reviewing the financial dealings of private
foster agencies have concluded that the private foster-care
industry is rife with fiscal abuse. A state audit of one agency in
Columbus found directors using foster-care money to care for their
quarter horses, to buy season hockey tickets and to pay for hair
salon and tanning visits.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN AS PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   SAFY has expanded from a business operating out of a house in
Lima to a multistate organization with 280 employees. According to
SAFY, the expansion has brought some impressive losses. However,
the numbers bear examination.
</P>
<P>
   Although SAFY has its national offices on Elida Road in Delphos,
northwest of Lima, there is a separate nonprofit SAFY corporation
in each state where the agency operates.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY of Ohio, for example, reported to the IRS in 1997 that it
had lost $377,324. There was also grim news from SAFY corporations
in Oklahoma, Texas and South Carolina. SAFY of Nevada did eke out a
small surplus of $18,000, but that was more than offset by SAFY of
Indiana, which lost $134,000.
</P>
<P>
   Submerged in all this red ink is a contract between each of the
state SAFYs and the two national nonprofit companies headquartered
on Elida Road: SAFY of America and SAFY Holding Co.
</P>
<P>
   The local SAFYs are required to lease all their equipment from
SAFY Holding Co. and to have their programs managed by SAFY of
America. Thus, SAFY of Indiana, the subsidiary reporting a $134,000
loss in 1997, was billed for $668,000 in management fees from SAFY
of America in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Are the SAFY foster-care agencies in each state losing money?
The answer is yes. They reported losing a total of $763,971 in
1997. But in that same year, the agency's IRS records show that
SAFY of America amassed a $1 million surplus while SAFY Holding Co.
netted $58,000.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of being a foster parent are, in some ways, as
convoluted as the accounting systems of the agencies they serve.
</P>
<P>
   In this system, a perverse pecking order develops. Children with
the worst problems rise to the top because they carry with them the
largest per diems, providing an enticement for some of the poorest
parents to take the most troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Vondrell, director of Daybreak, a Dayton runaway shelter
that helps foster children, said most foster parents provide good
care. But she said some financially strapped parents are so reliant
on the government money they receive that little of it is spent on
caring for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foster parents will warehouse youths. They are getting
$800 a month (per child) and they have seven or eight kids in the
home,'' Vondrell said. ``I had one foster parent, she listed an
income of three times what I make and her total income is foster
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Children in the system repeatedly tell of living with foster
parents who spend money intended for their care on everything from
home furnishings to new clothes. As one Dayton foster child
explained, ``They say they are not in it for the money, but you sit
and watch everything get redecorated. ... The lady's daughter has a
new wardrobe and I am still asking for a new pair of shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler believes the system drives out the best parents, who must
fight so hard to make sure their foster kids get proper services
that they eventually burn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foster care doesn't pay enough to be a good foster parent, but
it pays more than enough to be a lousy one,'' he said. ``If you are
a good parent, you still dip into your own pocket to pay for things
to make a child really feel like part of a family. But if you are a
bad parent and want to milk the system, there is enough money to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and children are both shortchanged in a system driven by
money, said one Dayton-area couple, who didn't want to be named
because they said SAFY sent out a letter asking foster parents not
to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the whole foster-care system is in a quandary,''
the father said. ``It ceases to be about kids. It's all about
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   FOSTER-CARE TREK
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no nationwide figures, those involved in the
system say it's not unusual for foster children to live in eight or
more homes before turning 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move from foster home to foster home, so they don't
bond,'' said Sue Durant, a Piqua foster parent who has cared for
foster children with problems ranging from schizophrenia to
attachment disorders.
</P>
<P>
   She recently started caring for a mentally retarded girl who had
already lived in five foster homes and had so much trouble
adjusting she smeared feces around the house and threw screaming
fits. To make matters worse, Durant said she finds such children
are typically overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time she moved, the parents had taken her to the doctor
and when I got her she was on nine medications,'' Durant said,
shaking her head. ``Now she is on three.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Taylor, 26, of Hamilton lived in 12 foster homes and with
various relatives in three states before she turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the (case file), you'd be like, what the hell are
they doing? I was in 18 different homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One Dayton girl, whose name isn't being used because she's not
yet 18, said she lived with six foster parents in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady kicked me out because her boyfriend tried to do
something to me,'' she said. Next she was placed in a home with
five other women, ranging in ages from 15 to 85, who argued all the
time. In another home, she said, her foster parent persuaded a
physician to put her on an anti-depressant other foster kids in the
home were taking.
</P>
<P>
   She rebelled. ``I didn't take it because I was convinced that
I'm not crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The nomadiclike trek through foster care is caused, in part, by
the children themselves. Parents tell of children who start fires,
steal money and threaten their lives. One foster parent recalls a
child who laced her contact lens solution with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up wearing a patch for a long time,'' said Elaine
Redmond Scott of Dayton. ``It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her living room on Salem Avenue, Scott cried as she
talked about her foster children. The boy who laced her contact
solution was taken from his crack-addicted mother. The boy's
mother, father and an uncle are all in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids ... are angry with their caseworker who promises
them things they don't come through with,'' she said. ``And they
are angry because they know their parents don't want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they're just angry. And when that anger spills out,
some frustrated foster parents hand the children back to the
agencies that placed them _ and those agencies have few choices
other than to place them in other homes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time these children turn 18 and ``age out'' of care,
experts say, their ability to cope with life's problems is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most telling indictments of foster care can be found
in a police report from Shawnee Twp. in Allen County. Attached to
the incident report about a foster child threatening a social
worker is the youth's handwritten note. The boy, who describes
being bounced through eight foster homes, struggles to explain why
he is so angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows how I feel. I've grown up with hate in my heart
against everybody. The county took me away from my family. They
think they did me a favor but they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just made my life worst.''

 &HT;    GOP again bumbles budget bills
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republicans in Congress are making like the Gang Who
Couldn't Legislate Straight. For the fourth year out of the five
they've been in the majority this decade, they've failed to pass
crucial appropriations bills before the start of the federal fiscal
year. And this year they aren't even close to fulfilling their vow
to meet the deadline, completing just five of the required 13
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Only by postponing the day of reckoning by three weeks with a
stopgap measure passed Wednesday did they avert another
embarrassing government shutdown. Dissension within the GOP is a
major reason for this legislative breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture bill is stymied because of internal wrangling
over the Cuba trade embargo and milk pricing policies for the South
and Northeast. And leading GOP lawmakers are divided over the fate
of the F-22 stealth fighter, thus holding up action on the defense
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the riders, the perverse legislative attachments
so popular with legislative mavericks and meddlers. The foreign
operations bill is being held up as the single-minded
anti-abortionist Chris Smith (R-N.J.) attempts to rewrite U.S.
population-control policy. Several other bills are littered with
riders that invite and deserve Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leaders may be tardy, but they're determined to stay
within spending caps enacted two years ago. So where do they look
first to economize?
</P>
<P>
   One big chunk of savings, they say, can come from deferring
earned-income tax payments to the working poor. And they hope to
recoup billions more by retrieving excess welfare funds made to
state governments to finance their welfare-reform programs; that's
money the states are wisely holding as a hedge against the
consequences of the next economic downturn. Both proposals are out
of the question.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of vying with Clinton, Republicans in Congress
continue to stumble through the appropriations process like the
Mets folding before the Braves. Isn't it time their Senate and
House teams tried new managers?

 &HT;    Warm-up starts for millennial finish

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Major magazines are anticipating the millennium with
special editions that usually look at past achievements and ahead
to what the experts think life in the 21st century will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Oct. 4) looks at ``the Internet age'' in a
special edition that also marks the publication's 70th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power to navigate the world at the click of a mouse is a
force that is transforming our lives like none before,'' says the
theme story. ``Anyone with a computer is a citizen of the world _
and a richer world at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes ASAP (Oct. 4), a publication of Forbes magazine, devotes
its millennial edition to ``the great convergence,'' with articles
by Tom Wolfe, Bill Gates, George Gilder, Kurt Vonnegut and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something immense is occurring around us,'' says ASAP in
explaining convergence. ``Everywhere you look, things are flowing
together, creating new connections, new hybrids, new ways of seeing
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries that separate technology, science and religion
are giving way as these disciplines move closer to each other, the
magazine contends.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THEIR HITS
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta-based blue chips _ beverage giant Coca-Cola and home
improvement retailer Home Depot _ get smacked in the chops in the
latest Worth (October).
</P>
<P>
   Staff writer Nick Pachetti says the recall of Coca-Cola products
in Belgium last summer ``raises a worrisome question for Coca-Cola
investors: Who's looking after the world's greatest brand?''
</P>
<P>
   The company has since sought to heal these ``self-inflicted
wounds,'' but Pachetti says some investors ``wonder if management
is up to the job of stewarding one of the world's most valuable
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist John Rogers puts Home Depot on his list of ``stocks to
avoid,'' arguing that rising interest rates could hurt the company
in two ways: All high-priced stocks are susceptible to rising
rates, and higher rates may hurt the company's housing market.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR DIVIDENDS
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Reserve has become concerned that corporations
don't pay out enough of their profits in dividends. Kiplinger's
Personal Finance Magazine (October) also looks at this situation in
its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
   That dividends don't get much respect shouldn't come as much of
a surprise, given the sharp increase in share prices in this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   While a strategy of buying only dividend-paying stocks has its
problems, ``dividends and income-oriented stocks still have a place
in many investors' portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund manager Stephan Klaffke gave Kiplinger's this
diversified income portfolio of stocks whose yields range from 0.2
percent to 9.7 percent, and average 3.8 percent: Bell Atlantic,
Chevron, First Union, Ford, Intel, H.J. Heinz, First Industrial
Realty Trust, International Flavors &AMP; Fragrances, National Fuel
Gas, J.C. Penney and Washington Mutual.

 &HT;    2 Atlanta pioneers toast city rebirth
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta today is facing problems that come from
growing up too fast, says John Portman Jr., one of Atlanta's
premier architects and developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving faster than our maturity is able to keep up,''
Portman said. ``We grew up too fast _ from a country town, to a
bigger town, to a regional city and then an international city.
That's all been done in the last 50 years. There's been such rapid
change. Looking back, I can tell you I never envisioned Atlanta
being where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman has been a key player in the growth of Atlanta in the
past half century _ Peachtree Center, the Hyatt Regency, the Westin
Peachtree Plaza, the Marriott Marquis, the Atlanta Merchandise
Mart, the Atlanta Gift Mart, the Atlanta Apparel Mart, Inforum,
SunTrust Plaza _ to name a few of his projects.
</P>
<P>
   Portman and his longtime colleague _ Mickey Steinberg (who left
Portman to later become chairman of Sony Retail Entertainment) _
sat down for lunch earlier this week and reflected on the changes
in Atlanta, a city that is partly their creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we had to do it over again what we could
change,'' said Portman, who welcomes Atlanta's inward development
shift after decades of growth moving farther and farther out.
``What happened had more to do with demographics. There's no way to
go back and change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, however, said Atlanta had ``great missed
opportunities'' in how it developed. ``Development in downtown
Atlanta was fractured and there became competing nodes. It's
happening today. You have Underground Atlanta and what they are
trying to do with the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman, 74, attributed those forces to a downtown in
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once retail left, the southside of downtown lost its
raison-d'etre. We tried everything. But there was no there,
there,'' he said. ``Now there is great substance coming from
Georgia State University, the government and CNN. And housing is
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing has always been a key missing ingredient for downtown,
and Portman acknowledged that Peachtree Center would have been
stronger had there been a residential component.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to everything is financing,'' Portman said. ``All of
Peachtree Center was financed one building at a time by different
lenders. We couldn't finance a residential tower.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg agreed. ``We drew housing every way you could imagine
it. There was no way it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they understood how critical housing was to central
Atlanta's success, Portman said they had to rationalize development
plans. ``Our rationale was that the bigger the job base we created
in downtown, the more demand there would be for housing in the
future. We wanted to build a job base for housing.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Atlanta has changed in the past 50 years, it's the
pace of current change that intrigues Portman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we are getting ready to enter the 21st century, more things
are happening in a shorter period of time. Technology is moving at
such an unbelievably blinding speed, it's mind-boggling,'' Portman
said. ``We are in an era that is similar to the last turn of the
century when we were moving from an agrarian economy to an
industrial economy. At the end of this century, the engine that's
driving us now is not industry, but technology.''
</P>
<P>
   NO CONFLICT FOR ISAKSON
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) wanted to make sure there was
no conflict of interest when the Trust for Public Land approached
him about buying some land in which he has a small interest.
Isakson is a minority owner in the Wilde Timber residential
development. He and his partners were approached by the trust ,
which is interested in buying about 22 acresalong the Chattahoochee
River for a greenway.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is providing $25 million to help in the
$100 million-plus effort to create the Chattahoochee Park. That's
an effort Isakson supports, but he wanted to be sure that no one
thought he was doing so with thought of personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   So he asked the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct for guidance. The committee ruled
that Isakson's small interest in the property (1.3 percent) should
not bar him from debating or voting on the park.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson took it a step further. If he should ever receive any
money for the sale of his interest in theland, he will donate it to
the Trust for Public Land.

 &HT;    Ga. governor visits Japan to seek trade increase
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes departs Saturday for Tokyo on his
first trip abroad to drum up more foreign investment for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will attend the annual meeting of the Japan/U.S.
Southeast Association, a trade and investment conference for
Southeastern governors. He will also drop in on several companies
that are considered prospects for new or expanded investments in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the leading foreign investor in Georgia, pumping $3.5
billion into the economy by the end of last year and accounting for
more than 28,000 jobs. It's also the No. 2 market for Georgia
exports, or $1.5 billion worth last year, after Canada. Though the
Japanese economy has been in a recession for several years, Barnes
hopes to set the stage for more investment when it recovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their economy is rebounding, and as they rebound there'll be
more investment,'' Barnes said. While his visits will also focus on
export promotion, ``investment is what I'm looking at,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will the trip be Barnes' first overseas trade mission,
but it will be his first trip outside the United States, except for
vacations within the Western Hemisphere. Barnes, 51, grew up in
Mableton, was educated at the University of Georgia, then served in
the General Assembly for 16 years and practiced law before his
election as governor last year.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the trip, he was briefed on Japanese customs and
protocol by the Southern Center for International Studies, an
Atlanta-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also spoke with former Govs. George Busbee, whose
administration saw the first rush of Japanese investment in 1975;
Joe Frank Harris, who serves on the board of AFLAC, the
Columbus-based insurer that gets 80 percent of its revenue from
Japan; and Zell Miller, who lured a number of foreign companies to
the state during trade missions and now works for a German real
estate firm. During his weeklong visit to Tokyo, Barnes will also
get the chance to compare notes with other Southeastern governors
on how they handle foreign trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who is being joined by his wife, Marie, and is flying
commercially, will also be accompanied by R.K. Sehgal, board
chairman of the state Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism;
Randolph Cardoza, commissioner of the department; and a Georgia
business delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, citing the crush of business at home, is opting out of a
trade and investment conference for the governors in Korea and
sending Cardoza in his stead.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the members of Barnes' trade delegation were attending
the business confabs in Japan and Korea anyway but were asked to be
part of the official Georgia delegation. Barnes said many of them
have local contacts that have been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation includes Raymond L. MacCain, vice president at
Cartersville-based Chemical Products Corp.; Ki Man Nam, president
of Good Nutrition of Norcross; Kevin Young Park, president of
Fashion World Enterprises of Union City; and Young Kyo Shinn,
chairman of Atlanta Oriental Food Wholesale Co. of Doraville.
Harris is also expected in Tokyo because of his AFLAC connection.

 &HT;    People's Republic turns 50
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The whole world will be watching as the People's
Republic of China observes its 50th birthday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Brown Bullock, president of Agnes Scott College, needs
no special occasion to pay attention to China. She's been a
professional China watcher throughout her career.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was born there. She grew up in Asia _ Korea and Japan
_ where China was always a looming presence. And, after graduating
from Agnes Scott, she earned a Ph.D. in Chinese history at Stanford
University. Since 1974, she has traveled to mainland China at least
once a year.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent conversation, Bullock shared her views on China
as its Communist government began its anniversary celebration.
Excerpts from the interview follow:
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was your most recent visit?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was most recently there this summer in June. I was with the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. We were talking with
Chinese government leaders about the aftermath of the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (during NATO's air strikes against
Yugoslavia) and the freezing up of U.S.-China relations at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What sort of response did you get?
</P>
<P>
   A: At that moment, the atmosphere was very hostile, and everyone
we met _ students, taxi drivers, old friends of mine as well as
government officials _ was exceedingly angry at not just the U.S.
bombing but the aftermath and the explanation. They did not believe
the explanation. ... We met with students at Beijing University who
had participated in the demonstrations at the American Embassy.
These were bright (students), and they were really insulted at the
way CNN and the American press had characterized their
participation. The American press, the world press, characterized
them as being manipulated by the government _ being bused in there
to demonstrate at the embassy. And there was undoubtedly some of
that. But they said, `You know, we had a legitimate right to be
angry.' And they reminded us that when the two American embassies
in Africa were bombed (by terrorists), we ordered (retaliatory)
military strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan. Someone said, `Well,
haven't you been influenced by the Chinese media?' And they said,
`We read the world media. We're on the Internet everyday, so we've
read The New York Times, we've read all the European media. We feel
well enough informed to make an independent judgment.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: China is observing the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic. Has this 50-year period been more significant than other
50-year periods in China's long history?
</P>
<P>
   A: This has been a tremendously significant period for China.
... On the 50-year indicators of life expectancy, literacy, per
capita income, the move to international prestige, China has
improved more for its people in this 50-year period than in any
period in its history. ... Also, China was a pariah state in 1950,
isolated from the world. Today, whether people like the government
or not, it's a major player.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the most likely scenarios you see emerging
there?
</P>
<P>
   Q: My crystal ball, you mean? ... I think the most likely
scenario is the continuation of a fairly authoritarian government
but with increasing pluralism, a continuation of the model somewhat
as you have it. I don't see a full-scale democratic government
emerging in a 10-year period. ... But you do find far more
pluralism in local government, in village elections, within the
organizations that comprise the party system. ... But I think that
the other issue is the extraordinary economic and social challenges
China faces today that are very destabilizing. They are committed,
and the Jiang Zemin government seems to be reaffirming the effort,
to continue restructuring the state-owned enterprises. ... They are
trying to turn them over to the market, and this brings with it
significant unemployment. And the level of unemployment in China
has risen dramatically. Q: You don't see them going to a full
market economy any time soon, though?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you look at other models in Asia of a market economy, you
find a variation on how much state involvement stays in the market.
Japan, (South) Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, all have more government
involvement in the market than we do. There are Asian models that
they are looking at that have more government involvement. And it
will take longer for them to develop some of the banking
infrastructure ... and to fully deregulate their state-owned
enterprises. Q: China's crackdown against the Falun Gong
meditational movement got a lot of attention here. Did that
surprise you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was surprised that their crackdown was as severe as it was.
But if you know anything about Chinese history you know why they
are so worried about Falun Gong. Falun Gong brings together
elements that are deep in Chinese history of cults, of heretical
religious groups and of very indigenous Chinese traditions. ... And
it has been movements of groups like that in the past that have
brought down dynasties. ... Another reason is the Chinese communist
state is at its core very modern and very anti-superstition.
They're embarrassed. My Chinese friends who are not party members
but are intellectuals are embarrassed by the continuation of deep
cults and superstition in Chinese society. So it has been also a
theme of this century to cut out superstition, and that is not just
a communist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you describe China's relations with other Asian
nations?
</P>
<P>
   A: China is paying a lot of attention right now to the nature of
its relations with other Asian countries. ... You could say it has
never enjoyed better relations. It has very active relations with
South Korea, economic and political. Its relations with Japan took
a downturn six months ago but they're trying to bring that back up.
It is an active player throughout the area. It has worked hard to
improve its relations with India, at the same time continuing as an
ally with Pakistan. China has been a behind-the-scenes player in
the Pakistan-India issue and did not give Pakistan all the support
it wanted in this latest conflict. So it was playing an important
positive role. By all accounts it has been an important force _
maybe not as key as we would like but nevertheless important _ in
keeping down North Korean adventurism, maybe not solving the
problems but keeping the lid on them. It plays a very important
role in the region. There is no question that (Asian) countries
worry about the power of China. It is the 800-pound gorilla that
they worry about economically and politically. And that is why many
of the Asian countries would like to have the U.S. stay involved in
the region as a potential counterweight to China.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of rising generation do you see in China?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you take a 19 year old in China today, they were born in
1980. Mao had been dead four years. They were born into the Deng
Xiaoping era. They do not know the Cultural Revolution; their
parents do not like to talk about it. They are 9 years old at the
time of (the) Tiananmen (Square massacre). And they have only seen
rising affluence and technology and sort of prosperity in their
time. There's no particular reason for them to be opposed to this
government as a generation, and they would be far more oriented
toward economic success than toward political revolution. In that,
they are not that different from my students.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the state of U.S.-China relations today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we need a new start. I think the next administration
needs to give high priority to developing a new bipartisan
consensus on China _ and on Asia, for that matter. China is too
important of a relationship to be held to single-issue American
domestic politics. ... There needs to be consistency and there
needs to be leadership. ... We need an administration that will pay
as much attention to Asia as to the Middle East and NATO. ... You
have India and Pakistan, you have Korea, you have Indonesia, you
have China, you have the No. 2 economy in the world _ Japan. ... I
feel that we're muddling through and that's not good enough. There
are genuine differences between our government and China's
government. We should be concerned about human rights and we should
be concerned about trade imbalance. But it's how you put that in a
broad consistent policy. ... I get discouraged by the lack of deep
understanding on both sides. I think it's going to take a lot of
hard work.

 &HT;    Putting the `there' back into politics
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Note from the campaign trail: There have been big
strides in the technology of ticker tape.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Sen. John McCain's kickoff rallies this week
in Nashua, N.H., and Charleston, S.C., was made more festive by the
use of a couple of gadgets generically called confetti guns.
</P>
<P>
   One, a sort of cross between a wood chipper and a cannon, blasts
showers of confetti into the air with the use of CO2 cartridges.
Another, a device that appears fashioned out of PVC pipe, shoots
out long streamers with bulletlike speed. According to Roberta
Greenspon at Party Land, a local emporium of celebratory items,
confetti guns have been around a year or so, but this presidential
campaign marks their first appearance on the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the pressing issues being thrashed out in this
presidential campaign _ such as whether the United States should
have gotten into World War II, a question that preoccupied the chat
shows for a weekend after the publication of Pat Buchanan's new
book _ it may seem trivial to dwell on confetti guns.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything any of the candidates are saying right now,
however, this innovation points to a significant fact about the way
politics is practiced as we approach the millennium. In an age of
fax debates and Internet campaign contributions, confetti guns
point to a fundamental urge to gather some place, listen to a
speech, stand in a shower of colored paper and feel a visceral
connection with the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow from Gertrude Stein, the use of new gadgets to liven
up rallies suggests that in politics, there still needs to be some
``there'' there.
</P>
<P>
   To a great degree, modern politics is still shaped by a couple
of 19th-century inventions, the railroad and the telegraph, which
allowed candidates to vanquish the challenges of distance and
appeal to voters with a revolutionary immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whistle-stop tours long ago gave way to campaign fly-arounds,
and much of the significant communication in politics is done these
days by cell phone. But the dramatic staging of campaign politics _
the breathless arrival from the last stop on the trail, with the
latest word on the candidate's lips _ still borrows heavily from
the days when high-speed transportation and instantaneous
communication were a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   There was more evidence of the enduring primacy of place in Vice
President Al Gore's announcement that he's moving his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it might have been more convenient to
keep the headquarters in Washington, where Gore lives _ although
with modern technology, it could as easily be located in Minot,
N.D., or Truth or Consequences, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   While it no longer matters much where a campaign installs its
phone banks, however, there's an enormous symbolic meaning _ only
belatedly realized by the Gore camp _ in where a campaign lifts its
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The location of a headquarters, in the age of the Web, remains
central to the question of who a candidate is, and where a
candidate goes still signifies who a candidate cares about. How
long this will remain the case, in an era when the meaning of place
and distance is being transformed, is uncertain. But for the first
campaign of the next century, at least, being there still counts
for something.

 &HT;    Tipper Gore talks to Atlanta airport vendors
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tipper Gore used the Atlanta airport Wednesday as a
backdrop to demonstrate her husband's support for affirmative
action. But where Vice President Al Gore stands on the city's
beleaguered program of race-based preferences remained an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's wife campaigned for her husband's
presidential bid by talking with Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and a
group of women and African-Americans who own businesses at
Hartsfield International Airport. Many told Gore they have
succeeded only because of the city's affirmative action program _ a
program that a conservative legal foundation has sued to overturn.
</P>
<P>
   She praised Campbell's ``extraordinary leadership for small
businesses experiencing and finding access here in the airport,''
which she described as a ``climate of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband,'' she added, ``has a strong, long-standing
commitment to affirmative action. ... It's very important the
federal government stands for affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a reporter asked Gore what she thought of Atlanta's
program, Campbell interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Mrs. Gore knows much about our particular
program,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's unfair to ask her about
the specifics of the court challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions did not fit into an event orchestrated so tightly
that the pocket of Gore's navy blue suit held the exact change for
the decaf cappuccino she bought at an airport coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and Secret Service agents escorted Gore into the airport's
Terminal B from the tarmac, even though she had driven to the
airport after spending Tuesday night in Atlanta and attending a
luncheon earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And she had little to say about politics, even about speculation
that actor Warren Beatty would announce later in the day whether he
will challenge her husband and former Sen. Bill Bradley for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard the speech yet,'' she said. ``I think he's a
wonderful actor.''

 &HT;    Shelters shift to Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The 600-plus displaced Pitt County residents
who remain in six school shelters after flooding caused by Hurrican
Floyd will be moved today so classes can resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With more permanent housing for some likely not available for
another two weeks, emergency officials decided Wednesday to shuttle
the 626 remaining shelter residents to Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Hurricane Floyd hit the area, officials
scrambled to find housing for the hundreds of displaced residents
who can't return home because of flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   Crews continued Wednesday preparing foundations and utility
hookups on a County Home Road site earmarked to accommodate 200
trailers, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency will assign
to displaced residents. Those units won't be ready until the
weekend at the earliest, said FEMA spokesman Rudy Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Two more trailer sites, north of the Tar River, have been
identified, but officials aren't sure whether there will be enough
trailers there to accommodate all those displaced on the north side
of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the shelters are the first concern,'' said
Arlen Holt, Pitt County spokesman. ``We are working on every
possible angle. Hotel rooms are full. Apartments are full _ at
least the ones that are open. We are doing everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   As officials search for housing, city and county teams continue
to inspect dwellings that have been flooded. While some of those
renters and homeowners are able to return, about three-fourths of
the structures county teams examined need some repair before they
can be lived in, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's anything from as small as replacing electrical outlets
to demolishing the structure,'' he said. ``(Inspectors) are finding
a mixed bag of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city has extended a state of emergency into a
third week.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which will expire Monday evening, allows
Greenville officials to restrict access to areas that remain
flooded or haven't been inspected for health and safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 11 days in a school shelter, Evette and Gregory
Cogdell moved to their cousin's house Tuesday night. With their
Grifton home a total loss, they started looking for a permanent
place to stay Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for another home, but it's a fight because a lot
of people are looking for a home,'' Evette Cogdell said after
completing paperwork for Red Cross assistance. ``It's very
frustrating ... think about all the people who lost their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of residents fled their homes after Hurricane Floyd
dumped more than a foot of rain on already saturated ground two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After cresting at a record-shattering 29.72 feet Sept. 21, the
Tar River fell to 20.1 feet at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday, about a foot
less than the Tuesday night level.
</P>
<P>
   Rain showers during the past few days are keeping the river from
subsiding as quickly as officials had estimated, said Katie
Veilleux, the city's public information officer. It is dropping
about 1.5 feet daily.
</P>
<P>
   The rain also has hampered efforts to install the FEMA trailers
because of the soggy ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very difficult to get the heavy equipment on
there. That has to happen before the trailers can move in,''
Hernandez said. ``We are working as hard as we can. Weather
permitting, we should start seeing some real progress in four to
five days.''
</P>
<P>
   In four days, students at the Pitt County Schools will return to
class for the first time since Sept. 15, a day before Hurricane
Floyd hit. Teachers and staff report to work today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic that there will be alternate housing for the
folks in the shelters so we can get school going,'' said Barry
Gaskins, the schools' public information director. ``We are moving
forward at a feverish pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes resume Monday on a two-hour delay, which will give the
busses time to maneuver around damaged roads, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   In arranging housing at the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs, county officials
tried to find a spot where the evacuees could stay for several
weeks until permanent shelter is found, Holt said. Displaced
residents who fled to Greenville shelters were moved last week
after the city lost water service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we are concerned about is we don't want to keep
moving people around. We want to be sensitive to that,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also are developing a mobile home site north of the
Tar River, which was hit hard by the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Crews are conducting environmental assessments on a site east of
Oak Grove Estates. If the site is approved for mobile homes,
residents could move there by mid-October, City Manager Ron Kimble
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a race to make sure we get temporary housing on the
ground before those families have to hit the streets,'' Kimble
said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two weeks of staying in shelters, some evacuees are
anxious to find some type of housing somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to leave. I'm ready to get settled,'' said Sandra
West, who has stayed at the Ayden Elementary School shelter for
more than a week. Her Grifton home isn't inhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   Stephlee Simmons, who has stayed at a shelter since she fled her
Grifton house Sept. 19, returned home for a peek at the damage
Tuesday. Mold had already started growing inside the house and
nearly all the contents were soaked, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'm going to go to right now,'' Simmons
said while thumbing through photos of her damaged home. ``It's just
questionable. You just wonder what you are going to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, city officials estimated the flood has cost
the city $23.5 million in damage, cleanup and overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   That includes $5.5 million each for the Pitt-Greenville Airport
and the housing authority, $5 million for debris removal, $4.5
million in damage to buildings and facilities and $1.5 million each
for street damage and overtime for emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate will be forwarded to FEMA, which reimburses
governments for costs incurred during natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary county estimates top $200 million, but are likely to
increase as county officials continue assessing damages.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville Utilities, which had its water plant, electric
substation and operations center submerged, is still compiling its
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA already has earmarked $2.9 million for temporary housing in
eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,835 Pitt County residents _ the most of any North
Carolina county _ have applied for all types of FEMA aid, including
housing, small business loans and unemployment assistance,
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials aren't sure how many of those applicants need housing
or whether the trailers arriving here will be enough to accommodate
the homeless. Still, Hernandez says, the government will do
whatever it takes to arrange housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we are constantly reassessing,'' he said.
``Will there be enough travel trailers? I don't know.''

 &HT;    Equipment big issue for `sewn products'
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Outsourcing and technology are the top issues facing
the apparel industry as the Bobbin Americas show opens in Atlanta
today at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of manufacturing overseas and the increased
competition from foreign investors have long been issues in the
industry. But the traditionally labor-intensive industry is
increasingly relying on technology to make manufacturing and
distribution more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the primary draw is the equipment,'' said Jack
Morgan, a spokesman for the Virginia-based American Apparel
Manufacturers Association, which co-sponsors the event. ``This is a
competitive business. Everybody is looking to see how technology
can enhance competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 buyers and sellers of equipment, products and
services for the ``sewn products'' industry will be in Atlanta for
the show and the annual convention of the AAMA. Sewn products
include apparel, home textiles, carpets and rugs, footwear,
luggage, accessories, medical products, toys, crafts and
upholstered furniture. Apparel, alone, represents a $180 billion
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The show attracted about 14,000 last year in Atlanta. Exhibitors
are down to 1,900 from 4,200 last year. But organizers say the 1998
show, an exhibit called Bobbin World that is held every three
years, always attracts more interest. Bobbin Americas, held in the
two years between international exhibits, focuses on the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt the convention is probably smaller because
of attrition among U.S. manufacturers. The United States continues
to lose manufacturing, said Sergio Cruz, a vice president of Kurt
Salmon Associates, although Asia is no longer the hot spot.
Increasingly, manufacturing is moving to the Caribbean and Mexico,
where labor is cheap but plants are close to the United States
market.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of sales from goods made in the United States is
expected to fall to 36 percent in 2000 compared with 41 percent
this year, while it will rise to 16 percent from 13 percent in
Mexico and 18 percent from 16 percent in the Caribbean and Central
America. Asia will remain steady at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing is going south,'' Cruz said. ``In Mexico, there
is a more favorable trade environment. We're seeing more Asians _
especially Hong Kong-based and Taiwanese investors setting up
capacity in Mexico.''

 &HT;    Home Depot boosts Olympics dreams
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Derek Mills certainly is one of the fastest recruits
at Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   If you see an orange streak dashing through the electrical
department, it's probably him. Mills is part of a new crew of
Olympic hopefuls employed by Home Depot during the countdown to
next year's Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   As a sponsor of the U.S. and Canadian teams, the Atlanta-based
home improvement retailer has hired 71 sprinters, boxers, kayakers
and other athletes as part of an Olympic job program.
</P>
<P>
   The company pays the athletes full-time wages and benefits, but
they work an average of 20 hours a week. The rest of the time is
used to train for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program works perfectly for the athletes because it
allows us to train at top speed and make money,'' said Mills, who's
hoping to compete in the 400-meter run. Mills won a gold medal in
the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta as part of the men's 1,600-meter
relay.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot effort, which includes the opportunity to buy
stock, is a lucrative option for the amateur athletes. Many are
used to cobbling together a living by waiting tables or coaching
kids at summer camps, said Kelli James, a field hockey player who
just finished her second year at a Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to retire from hockey because I couldn't support
myself financially before I got this job,'' said James, whose team
won a bronze medal in the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Field hockey competition requires trips abroad that may last up
to three months, James noted. The athletes typically work
additional hours while not training to make up for extended travel
time. Home Depot is the largest Olympic supporter among three U.S.
companies that pay athletes full-time wages for part-time work. The
other two are JC Penney and U.S. West Communications. Home Depot
also sponsors a similar Olympic program in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 other companies employ athletes through typical
part-time arrangements, said Keith Bryant, manager of the U.S.
Olympic Committee Athlete Services division. The committee acts as
a broker between athletes and sponsors. Home Depot spent more than
$1 million a year to subsidize salaries and benefits for athletes
in the 1996 Olympics. The retailer won't say how much it is
spending now.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a goal of employing 100 Olympic and Paralympic
athletes and has Olympic sponsorships through 2004.

 &HT;    Investor accused of attempting to defraud companies of $26
million
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Federal authorities believe Austin investor
Brian Russell Stearns conspired with unidentified accomplices to
defraud two foreign corporations of $26 million earlier this year,
according to documents filed in a New York federal court.
</P>
<P>
   None of Stearns' alleged accomplices has been arrested,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. postal inspectors in New York City have accused Stearns,
29, of telling a trust administrator that he owned $48.4 million in
bonds, which later turned out to be nonexistent, according to a
wire fraud complaint filed in court.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns is accused of conspiring with others to use the fake
bonds as collateral to secure $26 million in loans from the trust
representing the Panama-based Ivor Wolfson Corp., and Tremmer Ltd.,
headquartered in the British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the loans, Stearns, working with an unidentified
``investment adviser,'' promised in February to repay double the
trust's initial $20 million loan by March 2000 by trading in
medium-term notes, according to the complaint signed by U.S. Postal
Inspector Robert Mignogna.
</P>
<P>
   The two corporations filed a civil lawsuit against Stearns in
August seeking to recover their money.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns rejects claims that he defrauded the companies and
denies any criminal wrongdoing, said his attorney, Laird Palmer of
Mason. Stearns' attorneys in New York have filed a counterclaim
against Wolfson and Tremmer, alleging the companies charged him an
excessive fee for the $26 million in loans, Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies charged Brian a highly usurious rate for the
loans,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney Thomas Moreland, who represents Wolfson and
Tremmer, declined to comment when contacted by phone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents raided Stearns' $2
million-plus Lake Austin estate last week, charging him with
defrauding a Georgia investor of $3.3 million. Authorities also
seized Stearns' property, including two jets worth more than $10
million, a $2 million helicopter and $800,000 worth of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns had hired several area off-duty police officers,
including Austin Parks Police and city marshals, to guard his home.
An Austin police detective was paid to run personal errands for
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns, convicted of felony grand theft in Maryland in 1994,
faces additional charges of illegally possessing firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities also are investigating allegations that
Stearns may have defrauded more than 100 residents of the town of
Brady of more than $4 million in another investment scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns married Brady's then-reigning Miss Heart of Texas,
19-year-old Raegan Martin, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, her parents and about 30 of Stearns' friends and
relatives from Brady were in federal court in Austin on Wednesday
as a show of support for Stearns, making an initial appearance on
the New York wire fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing handcuffs and a jail-issued jump suit, Stearns gave his
supporters a double thumbs-up sign as U.S. marshals ushered him
into the courtroom. After the hearing, Stearns, a naturalized U.S.
citizen from Korea, turned around to the packed gallery and said,
``Thanks for coming, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in federal custody at the Bastrop County Jail;
bail has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   According to the wire fraud complaint, Stearns and his
unidentified Texas attorney met with the trust director in New York
City in March to close on the $20 million loan from Wolfson using a
$40 million Federal Home Bank bond as collateral. About this same
time, the Texas attorney faxed the trust director what turned out
to be a forged bank letter confirming Stearns' ownership of the
bonds, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns later agreed to wire the bonds to a New York securities
firm, which would hold them as collateral until Stearns repaid the
debt, according to the complaint. But when the trust director
contacted the securities firm to verify it had the bonds, he
received a letter saying the firm did not receive the bonds and
that Stearns' account had been closed, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   When the trust director confronted Stearns with that
information, Stearns allegedly had Austin-based Trans-Global Asset
Management Group Inc. send the director copies of the lien on the
bond. What Stearns did not tell the director, the complaint says,
is that Stearns owns Trans-Global.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, Stearns persuaded the trust director to loan him
another $6 million from Tremmer with the promise that Stearns would
repay the trust $8.4 million by June 28. As security for the loan,
Stearns put up what turned out to be fraudulent Barclay's Bank
bonds purporting to be worth $8.4 million, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   When the June 28 repayment deadline passed with no word from
Stearns, the trust director flew to Austin to talk to Stearns, the
complaint says. Stearns allegedly agreed to have $10 million wired
directly to Tremmer, but when the director contacted the company's
bank, he learned only $10,000 had been wired to the account,
according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns then allegedly picked up the phone, dialed a number and
handed the director the phone. A person identifying himself as a
bank employee was on the line and confirmed that the full $10
million had been deposited, according to the postal inspector's
report.
</P>
<P>
   The trust director hung up the phone and then called the bank
back and was told the money had not arrived, the complaint says.
The trust director filed a complaint with the U.S. Postal Inspector
earlier this month.

 &HT;    Bottom line, not kids' welfare, drives foster system
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Public money is supposed to go toward a public
purpose, but that's not always how the foster-care system works.
</P>
<P>
   Some private agencies approach foster care as a business and
turn what they call a ``profit'' from money received to serve
foster children.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Ohio-based Specialized Alternatives for
Families and Youth, one of the largest private, nonprofit foster
agencies in the country, considers profit margins before deciding
where to expand, said Steve Mansfield, SAFY's attorney and
executive vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different really than being a for-profit
corporation,'' Mansfield said. ``Every state is different. It's
bizarre. You want to see a nightmare, you ought to see Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   In that state, SAFY doesn't ``make a profit'' until it places
46.5 children, he said. But the state limits each foster-care
office to a maximum of 48 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote on it today, I'd stay out of Alabama,''
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY operates in seven states and has taken steps to move into
three others. By 1997, it had built $4.5 million in assets and
about $538,000 in cash because, just like any other company, it
needs a cushion for bad times, Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, SAFY generated revenues of $21.2 million.
Virtually all of its money comes from government payments.
</P>
<P>
   County officials in Ohio who contract with private agencies
understand money drives decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their discretion. It's a private vendor,'' said David
Hess, director of administration for Montgomery County Children
Services. ``If I buy a telephone for $90, and it only costs them
$45, then that's their profit. It's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said the county's contract with SAFY stipulates that tax
money paid to the agency must go to foster parents or
administrative expenses. In May, Montgomery County paid SAFY about
$4,700 a day to care for an estimated 90 kids. If SAFY has money
left over, Hess said, the county has no say over it.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohio Auditor Jim Petro and other state officials say the
system has some serious accountability problems if agencies can
spend money as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get into a bidding system where we are saying, `We'll
throw a bunch of money at you, and throw a bunch of kids at you,
and if you can make some bucks on it, it's OK,''' Petro said. ``It
will end up being a boondoggle where everyone will drive a Mercedes
at public expense.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over private agency spending was spurred by a Dayton
Daily News series last year detailing serious flaws in Ohio's
foster-care system. The series prompted Petro to investigate
private foster agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While final results are still out, Petro said he's become
convinced major changes are needed. ``We've identified weaknesses
in the system that allow public funds intended to be used for
children to be used for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Petro said many private agency officials believe if governments
pay them $35 a day to take care of a child but they spend just $10,
they should be able to ``put $25 in their pocket and we should have
no say in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at it that way,'' Petro said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most private foster agencies operate with 100 percent
public money and should be held accountable for how they spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Rep. Jeff Jacobson (R-Phillipsburg) agrees. He and Petro
are working together on legislation to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of game-playing that goes on with agencies who
claim public money is not public money once it's paid to them. But
there won't be any room for argument once we get finished with this
bill,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, Jacobson will push for laws that limit how
much private agencies can spend on administration and that require
money earmarked for Ohio children be spent on Ohio children. SAFY,
for instance, has used its resources _ built in part on Ohio
foster-care payments _ to expand into other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people do not know what it means to be a nonprofit,''
Jacobson said. ``Nonprofit means you are a charity. Charities are
not designed to enrich you.''

 &HT;    Georgia Tech goal: Take care of business
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the season, Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary
said one goal for the program was to maintain its lofty standing.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 9-ranked Yellow Jackets have done that. Now, they must
live up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, upstart Maryland visits Bobby Dodd Stadium. The
undefeated Terrapins not only are determined to prove they are for
real, they also are relishing the chance to measure themselves
against one of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Georgia Tech has become, in the last two years, a
top-10 program,'' Maryland coach Ron Vanderlinden said Wednesday.
``That's such a weighty statement that they are in that company,
and deservedly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech has stayed true to its slogan of approaching the year as
``Eleven One-Game Seasons,'' but it is doubtful that this date
against Maryland _ which, with three victories, has matched its
1998 total _ was lumped into the big-game category.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, every Tech game has major implications, with no margin
for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chore (tonight) to make sure that we take care of
business,'' O'Leary said. ``We're 0-1 (in the ACC), and we can't
afford any other losses. It's a big game, and our players
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ESPN cameras on hand, the game presents another
opportunity for quarterback Joe Hamilton to impress Heisman Trophy
voters and for the Jackets to make a mark with poll voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play on Thursday night, it's a good game, because
it gives you so much exposure _ good and bad,'' O'Leary said. ``We
have to go out and do well.''

 &HT;    Hurting personnel slowing pass rush
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In falling from Super Bowl team to 0-3, the Atlanta
Falcons' pass rush has been awful.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has gotten only two sacks, both in the same game, and
has just 16 quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are last in the NFL, with one sack every 41 passing
plays; the NFL average is one every 13.9 passing plays.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, they will end up with 11 sacks and 85 pressures.
Last season, Atlanta had 38 sacks and 159 pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really bad right now,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We've
got to keep working... because you don't... become that bad that
quick with the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Archambeau, 32, led the team with 10 sacks last year.
Travis Hall, 27, Shane Dronett, 28, and Chuck Smith, 29, are not
old by NFL standards. But they are beat up.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a sprained right big toe, and, because he is slowed at
right end, offensive lines sometimes cheat their pass protection on
that side toward tackle Dronett.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Hall tore left thumb ligaments two weeks ago and
will continue wearing a cast for a couple of months. He also has
battled a deep hip bruise, and his reduced effectiveness lets
offenses cheat toward left end Archambeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Smith has been a shadow of his former self,'' defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``Travis' hand is a problem. We're
not shrinking the pocket with pressure up the middle. Without that
push up the middle, Lester has not been effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side is we're not covering (receivers) well enough
to force the quarterback to hold the ball'' long enough to be
sacked, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett has a badly strained right calf, and, although he said
he will try to practice today, Reeves expects him to miss at least
one game.
</P>
<P>
   Backup tackle Ed Jasper is definitely out at least two weeks
with a partially torn left knee ligament. The team's fourth
defensive tackle, Ben Huff, spent last season on the practice
squad, and right foot and ankle injuries have bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   And blitzing brings inherent dangers. ``When you do that, they
get man coverage, or you have zones... you can't account for,''
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone has injuries. The players must compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play nicked in this game,'' Archambeau said. ``Winning the
NFC Championship, people study your defense, study your players,
and they have better answers. But part of it is we're just not
playing well, especially our four starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to come out there with more intensity, more
enthusiasm, flying around, knocking balls loose, like we did last
year? Or are we not?''

 &HT;    Revamped line clears the path for Peterson
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even with three new starters, Georgia Southern's
offensive line has opened up enough holes for the Eagles to average
404 rushing yards and 55.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   With senior Tom Jiles taking over at center, junior Michael
Anderson at right tackle and Brian Scott at left guard, Georgia
Southern also is averaging 7.1 yards per rushing attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But the coaching staff is proving to be a tough bunch to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're making progress, but they're not where we want
them to be,'' head coach Paul Johnson said. ``They're playing hard,
and when that happens, it gives you a chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson admits to being extremely tough in grading each player
game by game. His Eagles (3-1, 2-0 Southern Conference), headed by
senior quarterback Greg Hill and All-American fullback Adrian
Peterson, use six plays, for the most part. The wrong footwork or a
bad read or reach on a block affects a player's grade.
</P>
<P>
   In a 49-10 rout of conference foe Chattanooga, Tenn., over the
weekend, senior tackle Rich McGrath of Snellville, a four-year
starter, had the highest grade among offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGrath graded out a little above 30 percent,'' Johnson said.
``We're not like a lot of coaching staffs that grade players at 95
percent even when the team is winning by only six or seven points.
Our players understand that if they get over 50 percent, they've
played well.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who had the highest grade against Chattanooga was
Peterson, with 84 percent, Johnson said. Peterson carried the ball
21 times for 222 yards and four touchdowns. Against Virginia
Military on Saturday, he can tie the Division I-AA record of 20
consecutive 100-yard rushing games.

 &HT;    Daly: `I did it my way'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ John Daly says he's loose again, as in
relaxed and free and no longer depriving himself of booze and
blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   People who know and love Daly also say he's loose, as in, ``God,
please help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fired by Callaway Golf on Sept. 15 after refusing to enter a
treatment facility for his alcohol and gambling addictions, Daly,
33, has decided to fight the battle by himself. He is drinking and
is confident he can control the disease. He can handle a few beers,
he says. He's well-schooled in the advice from others: When you're
an alcoholic, it's like trying to stop the falling hammer of a
loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I know the odds are not great,'' Daly said while hitting
range balls at Callaway Gardens, site of today's first round of the
Buick Challenge. ``I'm truly able to accept that.... I'm not saying
it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the scariest part. Daly, his chocolate-brown shirt
sweat-drenched in heavy humidity, talks as if his battle finally
has ended. Instead, he could be approaching the worst part of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Elvis, baby,'' said Daly, who has decided that
living according to others' wishes is like laying up on par-5s.
``When I die, and they bury me on the 18th teebox up at Bay Ridge,
six feet above the ground, I'm going to put, `I did it my way,' and
they're going to play that song.''
</P>
<P>
   That Daly mentions death only makes the prognosis more
frightening. While Daly is smoking Marlboros and mashing golf
balls, a steady stream of people come by _ PGA Tour commissioner
Tim Finchem included _ to ask how he's doing. Hugely overweight and
bloated, Daly breaks out a cigarette every few shots.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial question is obvious: What makes Daly think it will
be different this time? What evidence is there that the furniture
in his hotel room will survive?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: There is none. Daly simply decided that he would
rather crash and burn than continue a life of avoidance. ``It's in
my blood,'' he explained last week, the statement featured later on
a Golf World magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it's not going to go to the extremes it
did before,'' Daly says. ``Who's to say? I'm thinking and hoping
maturity has a lot to do with it. I feel like I've grown up a
little. Maybe not a lot. I think I've signed every scorecard this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he won the British Open four years ago, Daly has generated
few performance-related headlines. The news has been of divorces,
drinking binges, tournament withdrawals and double-figure scores.
He hasn't managed a top-25 finish since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to get a front cover on a golf magazine when I
hadn't played worth a crap for four years,'' Daly said. ``I felt a
little bad because (Brad) Faxon won (at the B.C. Open) and (Tom)
Watson wins his first senior tournament, and they don't get on the
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly still plays his Callaway's Hawkeye woods and irons _ ``Mr.
C is still like a father to me,'' he said _ but caddie Brian
Alexander carries a brown leather bag with a red Arkansas Razorback
logo, given to him by a Memphis, Tenn., car-dealer pal who won it
in a tournament. Daly owns the ``Grip-It-And-Rip-It'' name, which
will be on a new white bag that's on order.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name, the hog on it, white with big letters _ it's gonna be
sweet,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's PGA Tour colleagues are confused. They glance at him,
eyes widening at his newly expanded girth. The goggled sunglasses
already give him an Elvis-type look. That he owns two major
championships, the 1991 PGA and the 1995 British Open, is sometimes
a staggering reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think,'' Jay Haas said. ``I suppose past
history shows he shouldn't be doing what he's doing. Whether he can
handle it this time remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon said last week after hearing about Callaway's
decision, ``It's about time we stopped feeling sorry for John and
somebody kicked him in the (rear).''
</P>
<P>
   For 1998 U.S. Amateur champion and rookie Hank Kuehne, an
alcoholic at 19 who has now been sober for nearly five years,
Daly's choice is particularly troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's his own man, and obviously he's making whatever decisions
he thinks are right for him,'' Kuehne said. ``At least I got to go
through my recovery on my own. He's in the spotlight. Man, the
lowest point I've ever seen was when he's on ESPN (during play at
the 1998 Vancouver Open) crying and cold-sweating, and it's 90
degrees outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Daly has multiple addictions _ alcohol, gambling,
sugar, cigarettes _ Kuehne said, ``It's all the same demon. It just
takes on different forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the status of his gambling, Daly says, ``Uh, not good....
But it's fun. It's so damn much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions in gambling losses have added to Daly's near-$40,000
monthly obligations for child support, alimony and mortgage. He
recently had to sell one of his cars, a $50,000 Corvette. His only
endorsement contract, now that Callaway has fired him, is with the
Ancona shirt company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be able to live the way the way I used to
live,'' Daly said, ``but the way I look at it, as long as I've got
enough money to pay for my caddie, Brian, enough that my house is
paid for, enough gas in the cars, enough to pay my girls each
month, what else do I need?''
</P>
<P>
   Daly contends that his personal life is better. His fiancee,
Shanae Chandler, is able to understand him, he says, where the
women of three failed marriages have not. And he's more relaxed on
the golf course. Daly said now that he's drinking again, he enjoys
``being able to sit at home with some buddies, have a beer and
watch some football games.'' The social chains, he said, have been
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to stay sober and trying to play golf, I wasn't the
same guy,'' he said. ``For the last three years, I've been so damn
tense out here, worrying about it, afraid if I missed one shot....
It was weird. I felt like I'd lost a lot of contact with the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind amber sunglasses, Daly will step to the first tee today
at 8:59 a.m., embarking on the improbable mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any expectations this week,'' he said. ``Just go
out and play, enjoy the fans, quit worrying. I don't need to worry
about it anymore.''

 &HT;    Love speaks from heart
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Davis Love III doesn't want to hear any
more about it. For the Europeans to be griping about poor behavior
from American fans and players at the Ryder Cup, he said, clearly
indicates either sour grapes, short memories or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just got pounded into the ground Sunday, and they're
embarrassed by it, as we were at Oak Hill (in 1995), '' Love said
Wednesday after arriving to begin play today in the Buick Challenge
at Callaway Gardens. ``We didn't cry when we lost two in a row . .
. . It's too bad there's all this bickering when it was the best
Ryder Cup ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Love said the fans were rude to both Americans and Europeans
last week. Love heard snide references to his 0-4 record at
Valderrama in 1997. Playing a team match with David Duval, he heard
several barbs thrown at the former Georgia Tech player, asking,
``So, how do you like the `exhibition' now?''
</P>
<P>
   Love also remembers the 1993 Ryder Cup matches at The Belfry in
England and ``people poking umbrellas through the fence trying to
trip us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how long,'' Love said, ``have they been calling our wives
`flight attendants' and `blond bimbos'?''
</P>
<P>
   At Valderrama in Spain in 1997, Love said, people ``were
downright ugly to us . . . coughing and yelling and cheering when
we missed a putt.''
</P>
<P>
   European players and captain Mark James this week have hinted of
a boycott of the matches at Oakland Hills in 2003 as fallout from
the Americans' celebration on the 17th green Sunday and fan
rowdiness at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that they're whining so much,'' Love said. ``I guess
when you get pounded like that, you've got to find some reason for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard, the man of the moment Sunday, said, ``If grudges
are held, there's nothing I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If one thing really bothers Love, it's the relentless, personal,
embarrassing attacks on Scotland's Colin Montgomerie. Not only are
they unfair, they're pushing Montgomerie to some tremendous golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our fans need to do is quit doing it, because it's making
Monty play better,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Love said he is not worried about relationships among the
American players being strained, because they survived comments by
Montgomerie before Valderrama. Montgomerie later apologized for
remarks he made about Brad Faxon's divorce and Scott Hoch's missed
putt at the 1989 Masters influencing their Ryder Cup play.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the American players were upset all week with the
Europeans' slow play. Love insisted it was an intentional motive on
their part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you a million dollars their strategy was slow play,
because they knew it frustrated us,'' Love said. ``Somebody's got
to have told them, `Put it into `Four Corners. It will bother these
guys.'. . . Nobody heard Mark O'Meara complain about (Padraig)
Harrington taking 10 minutes to get off a shot at 18.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the fan conduct, which has grown worse by the month on
the PGA Tour, Love would favor another look at beer sales. Combined
with the close proximity of the fans last week in an event oversold
by about 10,000 persons per day, beer consumption loosened plenty
of tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that if they cut off beer sales at a baseball
game in the seventh innning, they ought to cut it off at 2 o'clock
at a golf tournament,'' Love said. ``They sold an awful lot of
tickets last week. There were an awful lot of people there.''

 &HT;    Door open for Arsenal
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when it looked as if Barcelona would be the only
team with a perfect record emerging from the first half of
first-round group play in the European Champions League, Arsenal
had a dramatic answer to keep the dreaded Group B race tight.
</P>
<P>
   Nwankwo Kanu slammed home a rebound in the 81st minute, and the
Gunners earned a 1-1 draw Wednesday at the formidable Estadio Nou
Camp. Barcelona still leads the London club seven points to five.
Fiorentina, with only two points, lost ground in a scoreless draw
with AIK Solna in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The Champions League takes a three-week break before the final
three group match days resumes on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal appeared to be a beaten team just a minute before the
equalizer, when Gilles Grimandi was sent off for elbowing Barca's
Josep Guardiola. But Kanu, who had come off the bench in the second
half, finished off Davor Suker's initial strike at goalkeeper Ruud
Hesp, who couldn't clear. Luis Enrique's 16th-minute goal
symbolized the early dominance of the Spanish club, but the second
half was all Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only late comeback Wednesday. Manchester United's
bad form looked like it would sink the defending European
champions, who trailed Olympique Marseille 2-1 late at Old
Trafford. But Andy Cole tied the match in the 79th minute and Paul
Scholes got the winner with seven minutes left as the Red Devils
won 2-1 to take a one-point lead over the French club in Group D.
</P>
<P>
   And in Group C, Rosenborg Trondheim rallied from a 2-0 deficit
to tie Borussia Dortmund, with John Carew's 68th-minute goal
getting the Norwegians a point to keep them tied with the German
giants at the top. Bayer Leverkusen couldn't hold on to a 1-0 lead
at home in Group A, as Dynamo Kyiv pulled out a 1-1 draw in the
71st minute. Lazio leads the group thanks to a 4-0 romp over
Maribor of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid took charge in Group E by defeating previously
spotless Porto 3-1 on Tuesday. In Athens, Barcelona castoff
Giovanni struck for two goals for the second time in the Champions
League, and Olympiakos routed Norwegian side Molde 3-1 to stay a
point behind Porto. ... Bayern Munich managed a testy 1-1 home draw
with Valencia, with both teams tied at the top of Group F. Glasgow
Rangers got an 83rd-minute goal from substitute Jorg Albertz to
defeat PSV Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea earned its first Champions League victory 1-0 over
Galatasaray, with midfielder Dan Petrescu scoring in the second
half. But the English side remains a point behind Group H leaders
Hertha Berlin and AC Milan, which tied 1-1 on Tuesday. Oliver
Bierhoff evened up matters in the 74th minute for the Italian
champions.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL: IS 'ANIMAL' CRACKERS?
</P>
<P>
   Eccentric Vasco de Gama forward Edmundo scored four goals last
week, but the player known as ``The Animal'' got more headlines for
the way in which he threw a party for his son's first birthday.
Authorities in Rio de Janeiro said they might prosecute the former
Fiorentina player for animal abuse after he served beer to a
chimpanzee borrowed from a local circus troupe. On Sunday, Edmundo
scored two goals as Vasco stayed in contention for the Brazilian
national championship with a 2-0 win over Internacional.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: 'GOLES' GALORE
</P>
<P>
   The eight games played on the Invierno schedule over the weekend
produced 39 goals, none more surprising than in the 5-0 rout by
mediocre Atletico Celaya over Guadalajara. Carlos Pavon had a hat
trick and Luis Fernando Soto had the other two for Celaya. ....
Carlos Maria Morales scored a hat trick as Toluca ripped Toros Neza
6-1 to remain on top of the overall league lead with 19 points.

 &HT;    When Dayne was little, he was big
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ With size now one of his greatest assets, it's
hard to believe Ron Dayne once was too big to play football.
</P>
<P>
   As a 5-9, 230-pound eighth-grader in Berlin, N.J., Dayne was
banned from youth football because coaches feared he'd hurt the
smaller players. He hadn't been allowed to play as a sixth- or
seventh-grader, either. Instead, he played soccer, where his
imposing figure made opponents scatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine kids getting in his way?'' said Dayne's uncle,
Rob Reid, who raised his nephew from the eighth grade on. ``He'd
kick that ball and you didn't want to be in front of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, Wisconsin's 5-10, 255-pound record-breaking tailback, has
a similar effect on college defenders. Though they've dared to get
in his way, they've had little success stopping him or even slowing
him down. On Saturday, No. 12 Ohio State will get its chance.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne comes to Ohio Stadium as the Big Ten's all-time rushing
leader (5,703 yards) after recently surpassing former conference
rushing king and two-time Heisman Trophy winner, Archie Griffin of
Ohio State (5,589 yards). These statistics include bowl games. If
he averages 157.9 yards in Wisconsin's seven remaining
regular-season games, he will replace Ricky Williams (6,279) as the
NCAA's top career rusher. NCAA statistics do not include bowl
games.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to get Dayne, a Heisman Trophy candidate, to talk
about his run for the record is as tough as trying to tackle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it,'' he said. ``I'm all about team.
I'd rather win than get the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne gave himself the opportunity to make NCAA history when he
decided to stay in Madison, Wis., for his senior season instead of
leaving school early for the NFL. Friends and family say his
predicted status in this past spring's draft as a second- or maybe
third-round pick and his desire to earn a college degree and be
with his 1-year-old daughter, Jada, all influenced him to stick
around for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really the joy of his life,'' Wisconsin senior
linebacker Donnel Thompson said of Jada. ``He kind of melts around
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has a 4-year-old son, Donnel Jr., and he and Dayne
often take their kids to the zoo or the beach together. Dayne said
he spends every Friday with Jada, who turns 2 in November, and
stops by his girlfriend's apartment almost every night to tuck his
daughter into bed. On game day, she wears a miniature version of
her daddy's No. 33 jersey or a red and white Badgers cheerleader
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Dayne didn't expect to be a father this soon, but he's
proud that his nephew hasn't shirked his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly could have disconnected himself, but he really
stepped up,'' said Reid, a social worker who is Dayne's legal
guardian along with his wife, Debbie. ``Ron has a special affection
for little kids. He will sign autographs for little guys until his
hand drops off. I think because he went through a period of time
where his parents weren't doing the best and he had to raise his
younger sister (Onya) himself, he was kind of used to being the
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's parents divorced when Ron and Onya were young and drug
problems made it difficult for his mother to care for the kids. Rob
Reid said he didn't want his nephew to become ``another black kid
who was just swallowed up without a father figure,'' so Dayne moved
in with him, his wife and three kids. Onya went to live with
another aunt and uncle nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Being a kid in a man's body was a burden for the young Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was misunderstood by people,'' Reid said. ``He was
always the biggest kid in his class, so he got special attention
from students who wanted to be his best friend and from teachers
who thought, `I'd better stay on top of this kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne found his place on the football field where he was a
bruising All-American fullback who occasionally spent time at
tailback. Wisconsin coaches thought his greatest potential was at
the latter position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had great vision,'' Alvarez said. ``And he had legitimate
track times (Dayne runs a 4.5 40-yard dash) and was very good in
the open field. We thought regardless of his size he could be a
very good tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dayne rushes for 1,105 yards more, he could be the NCAA's
best.

 &HT;    Thrashers get serious
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ School opened in earnest Wednesday for the Atlanta
Thrashers. The last exhibition had been played, the roster
shrinkage nearly complete and Curt Fraser felt the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   When the Thrashers coach sensed his players were suffering from
mental lapses during drills at practice, he called the team
together at center ice and dropped a few verbal grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure they got the point that we have to be
creative in practice so that when we get in games we can use that
to our advantage,'' Fraser said later. ``The game is all about
habits. When I see players bring poor habits from other teams here,
I'll put a stop to it. We want them to start fresh. Create better
habits. Down the road, it will make us a better team. Bad habits,
bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of urgency now because Fraser realizes that,
short some tweaking by general manager Don Waddell, the team is
complete and the season opener is Saturday against New Jersey at
Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks after opening training camp in Orlando, Fla., with 65
players, the Thrashers are left with pretty much what Waddell
anticipated when he was penciling mock expansion drafts in June: a
team that should be strong in goal, solid on defense and short on a
scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this doesn't leave the Thrashers dramatically
different than most other NHL teams. As center Ray Ferraro said,
``There's probably only 10 gifted goal scorers in the league. We
don't have a Brett Hull who can sit around and bury goals on the
power play. We don't have a (Joe) Sakic or a (Peter) Forsberg. But
most other teams don't either.'' A breakdown of the likely
opening-night roster, with the number likely to be kept at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   _ Goaltenders (2): Damian Rhodes and Norm Maracle both looked
sharp in exhibitions, rarely allowing what could be termed a weak
goal. Maracle probably had the strongest showing of any goalie in
training camp and figures to start about 25 games. Fraser,
envisioning a tilted ice surface, smiled and said, ``Believe me, he
will get his work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense (7): The Thrashers still have nine on the roster, with
Maxim Galanov and Brett Clark (neither of whom played in the final
exhibition) the likely players to go. The play from the blue line
generally has been strong, particularly that of Darryl Shannon,
Petr Buzek and Yannick Tremblay. Gord Murphy, Kevin Dean, Chris
Tamer and David Harlock round out the unit. Dean, Tamer, Buzek and
Harlock all can be physical players. Buzek, Tremblay and Murphy all
are strong with the puck. Shannon has been solid all the way
around. Galanov probably is the best offensive defenseman on the
roster but has made several errant passes in his own end.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left wingers (5): Andrew Brunette, Johan Garpenlov, Denny
Lambert, Matt Johnson and Vladimir Vujtek are the keepers. But
there are problems. Vujtek (facial cut) is at least one week from
returning, more likely two weeks. Brunette and Garpenlov both have
been counted on for goal scoring but neither is getting near the
net. Roster movement is possible, although Garpenlov's salary
($975,000) makes a trade or demotion to the minors unlikely.
Lambert, a physical spark plug, had a strong preseason. Johnson
started slow and finished strong. In Orlando (IHL) is Jason
Botterill, who impressed coaches but was the victim of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Centers (4): Ferraro (back) and Patrik Stefan (groin), the No.
1 and No. 2 centers, were ailing as the preseason ended, but
neither injury is considered serious. Mike Stapleton's play led to
Terry Yake being lost in the waiver draft. The No. 4 spot currently
is filled by Per Svartvadet. But the Thrashers like Andreas
Karlsson, who is in Orlando, and Svartvadet could be moved back to
left wing, pending vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right wingers (5): Toughness and size aren't a problem with
Kelly Buchberger, Steve Staios and Ed Ward. Nelson Emerson, being
counted on for offense, hasn't stood out, and Fraser believes he is
putting too much pressure on himself. Martin Prochazka, signed as a
free agent out of the Czech Republic, also has yet to break loose.
Potential has won him a job for now. Jody Hull will be either sent
down or traded.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, who played with the expansion Predators last year,
said, ``In Nashville, a lot of guys had career years. I'm sure
that's what they're looking for here.''

 &HT;    Ankiel pleads not guilty to drug charges
 &HT;    By Michael Van Sickler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Richard Ankiel pleaded not guilty
Wednesday morning to federal charges that he and three others
conspired to distribute marijuana and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old father of Rick Ankiel, a promising rookie
pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, did not speak to reporters as
he and attorney Juan Torres of Fort Pierce left the federal
courthouse in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, Ankiel clutched his hands and stared at
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson set Ankiel's bail at $100,000.
She set the same amount for Dale Jackson, 41, and Cindy Rohn, 42,
both of Fort Pierce. All were charged Sept. 22 after a lengthy
investigation into the so-called Captain Jump-Off gang, a Bahamian
smuggling network.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip W. Kennedy, 25, will appear in court to hear the charges
against him at a later date because of a scheduling conflict, said
assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, Jackson and Rohn do not have to post the $100,000 bond
unless they break the conditions set by Johnson. Among the
conditions are that they not get arrested for a felony offense,
that they are prohibited from contacting other government
witnesses, and that they have to be tested for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could signify that they want to cooperate with
federal authorities, the three agreed to waive their right to be
indicted by a grand jury, which will save the U.S. attorney's
office time it otherwise would spend preparing information for the
grand jury. Instead, the three agreed to have U.S. Attorney Thomas
Scott sign off on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scheduled an Oct. 29 status conference with the U.S.
attorney's office and the attorneys for the defendants _ including
Mark Orr of Fort Pierce, representing Jackson, and Jack Goldberger
of West Palm Beach, representing Rohn.

 &HT;    New York police identify body found in barrel
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ New York police have identified the
pregnant woman whose long-dead remains they pulled from a barrel
beneath a home once owned by a suburban Boca Raton family.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna Angelica Marroquin, a native of rural Tonacatepeque, El
Salvador, was 28, the mother of a toddler and nine months' pregnant
when someone killed her with a single blow to the skull at least
two decades ago, homicide detectives in Mineola, N.Y., said
Wednesday. When the killing was complete, someone stuffed Marroquin
into a barrel that was hidden beneath a suburban home in Jericho,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for Marroquin's killer led police to Palm Beach County
and Howard Elkins about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that Marroquin was pregnant with Elkins'
baby when she called his wife, Ruth, to confront her with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidante we talked to remembers a telephone call in
which (Marroquin) says she called the wife,'' Nassau County Police
Lt. Kevin Caslin said. ``Marroquin told her friend, 'Now Howard is
so mad he could kill me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic phone call made in early 1969, Marroquin asked the
confidante, whose name was not revealed by police, to come to a
residence in New Jersey where her boss, Elkins, had put her up. The
confidante was a volunteer at a home for women operated by nuns in
Manhattan, where Marroquin lived shortly after coming to the United
States in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman arrived, the front door was wide open and she
found a meal still warm on the table, but Marroquin was not there.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, she went to the local police department but they
told her since she was not a family member she could not file a
missing persons report. The woman returned home to New York. That
was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to identify the body after finding
Marroquin's Social Security number and the name, address, and
telephone number of the confidante inside a barely legible,
decaying address book found still soaking in body fluids on the
bottom of the tightly sealed drum, Nassau County Police Detective
Sgt. Robert Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pages were like pulp, stuck together and saturated,''
Edwards said. ``Detectives in our documents unit brought the book
back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Also found in the book was Elkins' name.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins was 70 and living with his wife and son in a $130,000
home in the gated Crescent Lakes community west of Boca Raton when
Nassau County police came calling on Sept. 8. It had been nearly 30
years since the Elkins family lived at 67 Forest Drive in Jericho,
N.Y. Police said Marroquin's remains lay hidden under that house
since at least 1972, when the Elkins family moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said earlier this month that he spoke with Howard Elkins
for more than an hour that day. He asked what Elkins knew about the
crime and requested a saliva sample that could be used to match DNA
with that retrieved from the body.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins refused to provide saliva, Edwards said. But Elkins did
admit to having an affair with a woman who worked at Melrose
Plastics, the Manhattan maker of plastic flowers that Elkins once
co-owned. And police have since confirmed that Marroquin worked on
the assembly line at Melrose Plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins asked Edwards for time to discuss the matter with his
wife. The next day, he killed himself with a shotgun in the garage
of a family friend. Police are careful not to call Elkins a
murderer. They admit they may never solve the mystery of how
Marroquin died.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have spoken to Ruth Elkins once since her husband's
suicide, Caslin said.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the investigation said she is not being
investigated in Marroquin's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Elkins could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York police released the photograph of Marroquin on
Wednesday in the hopes that someone will call (800) 244-TIPS to add
details of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would really break the case would be for
someone to come forward _ an accomplice, maybe,'' Caslin said.

MONET WAS A MASTER OF THE CANVAS AND CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mmmmonet.
</P>
<P>
   The great painter was not only a master of the palette, but the
palate as well.
</P>
<P>
   As much time as he spent in ``continual torture'' capturing the
reknowned haystacks on canvas at perfect light, he spent in agony
each Sunday over which vegetables from the garden would make it
into that week's stockpot. If the vegetables had not been picked at
precisely the right time, the gardener would hear about it, and
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous rage of 1908, when Monet destroyed three years'
worth of paintings after deeming them unsatisfactory, was
reproduced in miniature on those occasions when Marguerite, the
family cook, committed culinary heresy by altering one of his
beloved sauces.
</P>
<P>
   The meticulous timing that he brought to catching the lily pond
at the instant the sun turned the water to fire was also carried to
his noon meal; Monet would not allow the servants to offer seconds
if his stepson-in-law, Theodore Earl Butler, a notoriously slow
eater, was visiting from America. It vexed him to watch Butler plod
his way through his plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, to call Monsieur Claude Monet a master is precise in all
senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Monet lorded over his Giverny, France, estate, a place of
Eden-like gardens that yielded wonderful meals. He had waited for
so long to net the recognition to afford the sprawling home, and he
worked so fervently to make it the spot that produced some of the
world's most beautiful paintings, that we can hardly frown upon his
ways.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit of the canvases Monet completed during this time is
now at the Phoenix Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At Giverny, he would finish his life, see the country through
the turn of the century, and produce work so modern, so
contemporary, that it befuddled the world just to look at his
splotchy canvases. And it was here, at a time when France's modern
haute cuisine movement was just taking off, that Monet and his
family enjoyed a cuisine quite contemporary as well.
</P>
<P>
   The family adhered to strict rules of freshness in an era not
graced by the Frigidaire. Careful selection was already warranted
for the blend of dishes at each meal during the time when formal
menu compilation became a standard. For Monet, ``style, you see,
style (was) everything,'' and he carefully tailored his dishes,
interior decor and entertaining menus to reflect his dedication to
the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Monet was just so very ahead of his time.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that his life and correspondences are well
documented and kept today. It has been said that Monet was keen to
his future position in history and took steps to preserve all of
his writings and correspondence for posterity. Indeed, that bearded
pack rat, wherever he may be, is no doubt grinning as we write
about him today.
</P>
<P>
   Among Monet's carefully preserved writings are his cooking
journals, which detail carefully the ways (begin ital) pour faire
un bon consomme (end ital) (to make a good clear broth) and which
share the recipe for ``Christmas pudding (a good one).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a distant relative, Claire Joyes, compiled them into
``Monet's Table,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) a cook/history book that
chronicles his life, especially as it relates to the table.
</P>
<P>
   We've included a few of his recipes on this page, but know that
counting fat grams was not on the mind of the average (begin ital)
fin-de-siecle (end ital) French cook. The Tarte Tatin is an ode to
butter and the Coq au Vin could do just as well without it. Made
with less butter, and even none at all, the method still produces a
lusty sauce worthy of the best crusty baguette available.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, what recipes. Take an afternoon, listen to Debussy (an
Impressionist composer), and prepare these dishes favored by Monet.
Oddly, it makes his genius seem a bit closer.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's day nearly revolved around his meals, a tidbit perhaps
evident by his portly figure.
</P>
<P>
   He would rise early to check the day's light, bathe and come
down to the table in his (begin ital) tres moderne (end ital)
lemon-yellow dining room. He favored a host of foods gleaned from
his world travels _ English or Dutch cheese, eggs and bacon, toast
and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it was back to the canvas until 11:30, the strictly kept
time of the noon meal, which was the main meal in the Monet
household. Because Monet nearly went to pieces if he was in bed
later than 9:30 p.m., guests were invited to the household only for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   If food was on the table a minute later than he required, he was
known to terrorize the cooks by making coughing sounds. Dinner was
served, always, at 7 p.m., and involved a soup of some sort. Never
did the Monets begin an evening meal without a soup.
</P>
<P>
   Much is known about the specifics of the holiday meals of the
household, courtesy of Monet's cooking journals. Yet there was
little written on the subject of his everyday cuisine by the scores
of journalists who trekked to Monet's home in Giverny to talk and
sup with this master. (The writers did mention, however, that they
often were invited for lunch, and always at 11:30 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would have been a sin to write of the food when
surrounded by all of that prowess and uniquely conceived painting.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Monet didn't feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   From his journals, we know that for Christmas every year,
Marguerite would make a special banana ice cream (just add banana
puree to your own), and that one year, she accidentally seasoned it
with salt, much to Monet's annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Each year on his birthday, Monet would demand that one of his
sons or staff members hunt for a woodcock for his main course.
Monet would always personally carve the meat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Monet can say he invented only one recipe _ wild mushrooms
sprinkled with garlic and parsley, then drizzled with olive oil and
roasted in the oven. The rest of his collection is a lifetime of
loved dishes. There is a bouillabaisse recipe from fellow painter
Paul Cezanne, a favorite egg dish made with truffles, and a recipe
for creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   There is a process for making Tarte Tatin, a dish Monet and his
family would visit the Tatin sisters to taste. When he discovered a
dish he liked so well, he would set his cook to replicating it.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially particular about his vegetables. He had a
2{-acre kitchen garden at another end of town attended by a
specially hired gardener. Monet liked his vegetables picked at the
height of ripeness, simply steamed, and he did not include many
recipes for cooking them in other ways. He enjoyed a salad, but
would blacken it with so much pepper that only his daughter-in-law,
Blanche Hoschede-Monet, would share it with him. The rest of his
family had to have a separate bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Monet prided himself on impressing company. He would spare no
expense to procure the freshest pike fish for a visit from his
dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, and would be sure to set out the special
lemon yellow and robin's egg blue dinnerware the family favored on
such occasions.
</P>
<P>
   (If you really want to be true to his table, the Phoenix Art
Museum will be selling paper versions of Monet's yellow and blue
plates, and Crate &AMP; Barrel has a similar pattern, called Capri.)
</P>
<P>
   For everyday, a Japanese-style blue-and white-pattern was used,
always set on a yellow tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   To imagine his table, set and waiting for guests, is to see
patches of blue sky peeking through the rays of a jubilant yellow
sun, a scene Monet painted so many times outdoors. We can't help
but think that maybe this is why he so favored the pair.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the table was always an ode to Monet's beloved
flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I must have flowers, always, always,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That yellow tablecloth was quite the canvas, indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tarte Tatin (Upside Down Apple Tart) &QL; 
(Modified from ``Monet's Table'') &QL; 
2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup unsalted butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   6 dessert apples, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Pour flour into a bowl, make a well in the center and in it put
half the sugar, the salt, the egg yolk and warm water. Mix well,
then add 1/2 cup of the butter. Mix the dough until smooth, then
roll out into a rectangle. Fold up the rectangle by folding 1/3
toward the center, then folding the remaining over the top of the
folded part. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 1 hour.
Roll out the dough again into a circle 1/4-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange apple slices in a deep pie
dish. Add rest of the pieces of butter, and sprinkle with the rest
of the sugar. Cover with the dough. Bake for 45 minutes. Turn the
tart out onto a plate so the pastry is on top.

<P>
   2 cups burgundy
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Fried 1/2-inch croutons
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a Dutch oven or flame-proof casserole dish with a
lid and saute bacon pieces and pearl onions until onions are
transparent. Remove and reserve bacon and onions. Saute chicken
pieces, turning them several times as they cook. Add garlic clove,
bouquet garni, and mushrooms (if any are rather large, slice them
in half). Cover casserole and cook for 15 minutes. Skim off surface
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Add brandy and flame. Add burgundy. Cover casserole and cook for
an additional 35 minutes. To check whether the chicken pieces are
cooked, prick them with a fork. If the juice runs clear, they are
cooked; if the juices are pink, continue cooking. When chicken is
cooked, set it aside in another dish and keep it warm. Remove
garlic clove and garni, and return remaining sauce in the casserole
to low heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the rest of the butter with the flour
until you have a smooth, thick paste. Break off bits of it and stir
them into the sauce, stirring until each has melted before adding
the next. As soon as the sauce is thick and smooth, return the
pieces of chicken to it, and bacon and onions, if you wish. Garnish
chicken with fried croutons.

MONET WAS A MASTER OF THE CANVAS AND CUISINE

<P>
   PHOENIX - Mmmmonet.
</P>
<P>
   The great painter was not only a master of the palette, but the
palate as well.
</P>
<P>
   As much time as he spent in ``continual torture'' capturing the
reknowned haystacks on canvas at perfect light, he spent in agony
each Sunday over which vegetables from the garden would make it
into that week's stockpot. If the vegetables had not been picked at
precisely the right time, the gardener would hear about it, and
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous rage of 1908, when Monet destroyed three years'
worth of paintings after deeming them unsatisfactory, was
reproduced in miniature on those occasions when Marguerite, the
family cook, committed culinary heresy by altering one of his
beloved sauces.
</P>
<P>
   The meticulous timing that he brought to catching the lily pond
at the instant the sun turned the water to fire was also carried to
his noon meal; Monet would not allow the servants to offer seconds
if his stepson-in-law, Theodore Earl Butler, a notoriously slow
eater, was visiting from America. It vexed him to watch Butler plod
his way through his plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, to call Monsieur Claude Monet a master is precise in all
senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Monet lorded over his Giverny, France, estate, a place of
Eden-like gardens that yielded wonderful meals. He had waited for
so long to net the recognition to afford the sprawling home, and he
worked so fervently to make it the spot that produced some of the
world's most beautiful paintings, that we can hardly frown upon his
ways.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit of the canvases Monet completed during this time is
now at the Phoenix Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At Giverny, he would finish his life, see the country through
the turn of the century, and produce work so modern, so
contemporary, that it befuddled the world just to look at his
splotchy canvases. And it was here, at a time when France's modern
haute cuisine movement was just taking off, that Monet and his
family enjoyed a cuisine quite contemporary as well.
</P>
<P>
   The family adhered to strict rules of freshness in an era not
graced by the Frigidaire. Careful selection was already warranted
for the blend of dishes at each meal during the time when formal
menu compilation became a standard. For Monet, ``style, you see,
style (was) everything,'' and he carefully tailored his dishes,
interior decor and entertaining menus to reflect his dedication to
the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Monet was just so very ahead of his time.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that his life and correspondences are well
documented and kept today. It has been said that Monet was keen to
his future position in history and took steps to preserve all of
his writings and correspondence for posterity. Indeed, that bearded
pack rat, wherever he may be, is no doubt grinning as we write
about him today.
</P>
<P>
   Among Monet's carefully preserved writings are his cooking
journals, which detail carefully the ways (begin ital) pour faire
un bon consomme (end ital) (to make a good clear broth) and which
share the recipe for ``Christmas pudding (a good one).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a distant relative, Claire Joyes, compiled them into
``Monet's Table,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) a cook/history book that
chronicles his life, especially as it relates to the table.
</P>
<P>
   We've included a few of his recipes on this page, but know that
counting fat grams was not on the mind of the average (begin ital)
fin-de-siecle (end ital) French cook. The Tarte Tatin is an ode to
butter and the Coq au Vin could do just as well without it. Made
with less butter, and even none at all, the method still produces a
lusty sauce worthy of the best crusty baguette available.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, what recipes. Take an afternoon, listen to Debussy (an
Impressionist composer), and prepare these dishes favored by Monet.
Oddly, it makes his genius seem a bit closer.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's day nearly revolved around his meals, a tidbit perhaps
evident by his portly figure.
</P>
<P>
   He would rise early to check the day's light, bathe and come
down to the table in his (begin ital) tres moderne (end ital)
lemon-yellow dining room. He favored a host of foods gleaned from
his world travels _ English or Dutch cheese, eggs and bacon, toast
and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it was back to the canvas until 11:30, the strictly kept
time of the noon meal, which was the main meal in the Monet
household. Because Monet nearly went to pieces if he was in bed
later than 9:30 p.m., guests were invited to the household only for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   If food was on the table a minute later than he required, he was
known to terrorize the cooks by making coughing sounds. Dinner was
served, always, at 7 p.m., and involved a soup of some sort. Never
did the Monets begin an evening meal without a soup.
</P>
<P>
   Much is known about the specifics of the holiday meals of the
household, courtesy of Monet's cooking journals. Yet there was
little written on the subject of his everyday cuisine by the scores
of journalists who trekked to Monet's home in Giverny to talk and
sup with this master. (The writers did mention, however, that they
often were invited for lunch, and always at 11:30 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would have been a sin to write of the food when
surrounded by all of that prowess and uniquely conceived painting.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Monet didn't feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   From his journals, we know that for Christmas every year,
Marguerite would make a special banana ice cream (just add banana
puree to your own), and that one year, she accidentally seasoned it
with salt, much to Monet's annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Each year on his birthday, Monet would demand that one of his
sons or staff members hunt for a woodcock for his main course.
Monet would always personally carve the meat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Monet can say he invented only one recipe _ wild mushrooms
sprinkled with garlic and parsley, then drizzled with olive oil and
roasted in the oven. The rest of his collection is a lifetime of
loved dishes. There is a bouillabaisse recipe from fellow painter
Paul Cezanne, a favorite egg dish made with truffles, and a recipe
for creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   There is a process for making Tarte Tatin, a dish Monet and his
family would visit the Tatin sisters to taste. When he discovered a
dish he liked so well, he would set his cook to replicating it.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially particular about his vegetables. He had a
2{-acre kitchen garden at another end of town attended by a
specially hired gardener. Monet liked his vegetables picked at the
height of ripeness, simply steamed, and he did not include many
recipes for cooking them in other ways. He enjoyed a salad, but
would blacken it with so much pepper that only his daughter-in-law,
Blanche Hoschede-Monet, would share it with him. The rest of his
family had to have a separate bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Monet prided himself on impressing company. He would spare no
expense to procure the freshest pike fish for a visit from his
dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, and would be sure to set out the special
lemon yellow and robin's egg blue dinnerware the family favored on
such occasions.
</P>
<P>
   (If you really want to be true to his table, the Phoenix Art
Museum will be selling paper versions of Monet's yellow and blue
plates, and Crate &AMP; Barrel has a similar pattern, called Capri.)
</P>
<P>
   For everyday, a Japanese-style blue-and white-pattern was used,
always set on a yellow tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   To imagine his table, set and waiting for guests, is to see
patches of blue sky peeking through the rays of a jubilant yellow
sun, a scene Monet painted so many times outdoors. We can't help
but think that maybe this is why he so favored the pair.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the table was always an ode to Monet's beloved
flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I must have flowers, always, always,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That yellow tablecloth was quite the canvas, indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tarte Tatin (Upside Down Apple Tart) &QL; 
(Modified from ``Monet's Table'') &QL; 
2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup unsalted butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   6 dessert apples, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Pour flour into a bowl, make a well in the center and in it put
half the sugar, the salt, the egg yolk and warm water. Mix well,
then add 1/2 cup of the butter. Mix the dough until smooth, then
roll out into a rectangle. Fold up the rectangle by folding 1/3
toward the center, then folding the remaining over the top of the
folded part. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 1 hour.
Roll out the dough again into a circle 1/4-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange apple slices in a deep pie
dish. Add rest of the pieces of butter, and sprinkle with the rest
of the sugar. Cover with the dough. Bake for 45 minutes. Turn the
tart out onto a plate so the pastry is on top.

Coq au Vin &QL; 
(Modified from ``Monet's Table'') &QL; 
1/4 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced lean bacon (preferably low-sodium)
</P>
<P>
   12 pearl onions
</P>
<P>
   1 boiling fowl (about 5 pounds), cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   1 bouquet garni
</P>
<P>
   6 cups mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 cups burgundy
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Fried 1/2-inch croutons
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a Dutch oven or flame-proof casserole dish with a
lid and saute bacon pieces and pearl onions until onions are
transparent. Remove and reserve bacon and onions. Saute chicken
pieces, turning them several times as they cook. Add garlic clove,
bouquet garni, and mushrooms (if any are rather large, slice them
in half). Cover casserole and cook for 15 minutes. Skim off surface
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Add brandy and flame. Add burgundy. Cover casserole and cook for
an additional 35 minutes. To check whether the chicken pieces are
cooked, prick them with a fork. If the juice runs clear, they are
cooked; if the juices are pink, continue cooking. When chicken is
cooked, set it aside in another dish and keep it warm. Remove
garlic clove and garni, and return remaining sauce in the casserole
to low heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the rest of the butter with the flour
until you have a smooth, thick paste. Break off bits of it and stir
them into the sauce, stirring until each has melted before adding
the next. As soon as the sauce is thick and smooth, return the
pieces of chicken to it, and bacon and onions, if you wish. Garnish
chicken with fried croutons.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is excellent if left to cool, refrigerated and then
reheated in a bain-marie.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging that he faces
a serious challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination,
announced Wednesday that he was relocating his campaign
headquarters from Washington to his home state of Tennessee and
paring back a top-heavy campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Nashville is part of a broad strategy that his aides
hope will symbolize a break from the Beltway _ and the Clinton
administration. And it comes in response to the steady rise in the
polls, and in the public imagination, of former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, the sole Democrat who dared challenge Gore and his
vast institutional apparatus for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore backers have been dispirited by national polls
that show Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner,
sustaining a strong lead that Gore has been unable to dent.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Gore campaign has only vaguely focused on Bush
and acted as if Bradley did not exist. But the former basketball
star has demonstrated his ability to raise serious money. And now
that Bradley has drawn even with Gore in opinion polls in key
states like New York and New Hampshire, the Gore camp can no longer
ignore the Bradley threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the challenge for the nomination has changed,''
Gore acknowledged Wednesday, noting that the Bradley camp had
established ``a baseline of competence and credibility.'' He added:
``We're in a completely new campaign. So we're going to adapt to it
and adjust to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals is to cut expenses by limiting the number and
salaries of senior staffers. The need to conserve money is a
consequence of Gore's lackluster fund raising: He collected an
unimpressive $6.5 million in the last three months and has spent
almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's cash has been drained in part by efforts to raise money
and build state organizations. But that focus has resulted in
negative news accounts of a bulging campaign top-heavy with
Washington consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The move will mean lower rents in Nashville and will provide a
face-saving way for some of Gore's high-priced talent to leave the
campaign without being fired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is reporting that it has just $10 million in cash
on hand. Bradley's campaign refused to divulge how much it raised
in the last quarter and how much it has on hand, but the
expectation is that in financial reports to be made public on
Thursday, he will show he is competitive with Gore. Three months
ago, the Gore campaign said it had $9.4 million on hand; Bradley
had $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville is also part of a broader effort to
revitalize the campaign. Other elements include an accelerated
schedule of debates with Bradley to showcase the vice president's
verbal skills, an emphasis on meetings with smaller and less formal
groups and a rejiggered stump speech designed to show a more
passionate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More tactical plans include working aggressively behind the
scenes to try to win the endorsement of groups that Bradley has so
far neutralized, most prominently the AFL-CIO, which is meeting in
California in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the new campaign seeks to feature a
new Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked over the weekend how he planned to overcome the challenges
he faces, a suddenly plain-speaking Gore, stung by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's devastating pronouncement last week that he is
unelectable, had a blunt and urgent answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoeleather and hard work and a lot of handshaking and talking
with people one on one and getting out of this 4-by-4 that I ride
around in and walking down the sidewalks and Main streets and going
in stores and coffee shops and looking voters in the eye and
talking to them one by one,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dryly noted Gore's abrupt change in strategy,
particularly the vice president's apparent eagerness to debate.
``For the last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign have
been ignoring me and now they want to debate me,'' he said while
campaigning in California. ``I think that shows we're making some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the address of Gore's headquarters mattered little.
What the move shows, he said, is ``the Democratic side is clearly
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers in and out of Washington have said that Gore needs to
shed the trappings of the vice presidency, and the move to
Tennessee, where he spent his boyhood summers, should help him do
that.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the broader need for Gore to project some of
the ``outsider'' status that has helped propel the Bradley
campaign. It also signals Gore's need to establish a presence in
the South, where Bush looms with a strong advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee itself, a poll conducted Sept. 16 for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee found Bush leading Gore among
registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the 17 states that
make up the South, a new poll conducted for the American
Association of Health Plans showed Bush leading Gore 53 percent to
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the campaign was moving ``lock, stock and barrel to
Nashville so that we can get closer to the American people, closer
to the grassroots and out of the Beltway and into the heartland.''
He said he would formally open a Nashville office next Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, including President Clinton, have long been
telling him that he needs to connect better with voters. They want
him in intimate exchanges with people about what really matters in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent more than an hour on Sunday with 10 people in a
livingroom in the tiny outpost of Berlin, N.H., said Wednesday that
he would go ``directly to the voters in small groups, without
intermediaries, responding to their questions, telling them about
my vision for the future, asking for their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also been told to sharpen his message, reveal some
passion and try to appear as often as possible with his playful,
spontaneous wife, Tipper, to show that he is a ``real person,'' a
family man _ and not Bill Clinton. Even so, his advisers are
divided over how much he should try to separate himself from his
political patron. A base more than 500 miles from Washington could
help keep at a distance the Clinton scandal, and the shadow it
casts over a Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speech now includes a reference to an earlier period
in his life when he was ``disillusioned'' with politics, the
result, he says, of the Vietnam War, Watergate and watching his
father, a senator from Tennessee, go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With these glancing references to the tumultuous 1960s and '70s,
Gore hopes to begin to add some complexity to his personal
narrative and to counter the impression that he has been a
politician and Washington insider all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers say the Bradley surge is a blessing in
disguise. ``It's better than shadow-boxing out there by
ourselves,'' said one. It has energized the candidate and his
campaign staff and cast them in a role that Americans love: that of
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to fight,'' said Tony Coelho, his campaign
manager. ``We've unshackled him. We've liberated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Gore is still a cautious politician. While
he is taking some stands that may be popular locally but are risky
nationally, like supporting timber cutting in New Hampshire's White
Mountains, he still refuses to say whether he believes Clinton was
right to grant clemency to a group of imprisoned Puerto Rican
nationalists. ``I have not reviewed the record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He can also signal an air of desperation. In a recent speech to
Democratic activists, he blurted out: ``I care.'' The words
inadvertently recalled former President George Bush's struggle to
sympathize with voters. ``Message: I care,'' Bush had said in 1992,
drawing ridicule for needing to spell out what he had been unable
to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often turns to this none-too-subtle approach as he seems to
regard his listeners as interest groups. ``I am FOR the veterans!''
he will announce. Or, as he said last week: ``For the
environmentalists here, the first word I learned to spell was green
_ G-R-E-E-N!''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Nashville adds to the risk that Gore will be seen as
desperate. ``It redefines the `Hail Mary,''' said one Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats perceived the move as a welcome sign that
Gore was ready to take control of his campaign and put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals a change in attitude,'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant who ran Clinton's insurgent campaign from
Little Rock, Ark., in 1992. ``And it allows you to make changes, to
do things you need to do underneath without creating a three- or
four-day brouhaha,'' he said, referring to the downsizing of the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this move to be an opportunity for transformation,''
Gore said
</P>
<P>
   Part of that transformation will be a willingness to challenge
Bradley directly and to begin drawing contrasts with a man he has
not mentioned by name until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to engage Bradley on specific issues, including
education, health care and the environment.

GRAND CANYON'S LESS TRAVELED SIDE HAS ITS REWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
HAS ART; RUNS WITH NORTHRIM-GO box  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK _ The North Rim of the Grand Canyon
is inconvenient. It lies at the end of a long, dead-end road, many
miles from any city of reasonable size. It is also unpredictable,
subject to summer thunderstorms and winter blizzards; the heavy
snows, in fact, cause it to close its doors for half the year. It
is a wild, rugged place.
</P>
<P>
   And this is precisely why it is so appealing to the few people
who have discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   The South Rim of this vast, yawning gorge in northwestern
Arizona? It's easily reached, as 4.1 million annual visitors can
attest. The South Rim lies only 59 miles north of Williams off
heavily traveled Interstate 40. It can also be part of an easy loop
trip to Monument Valley or Lake Powell. The tour-bus companies
can't resist it.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Rim has endured such heavy visitation over the
last 10 years that a massive parking lot will be built outside the
park boundary by 2002, with summer day-use visitors required to
deposit their vehicles there and use the South Rim's mass-transit
system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended to ease bumper-to-bumper traffic and packed
viewpoint parking areas during the summer peak. Enjoyment of the
quiet grandeur of the canyon tends to be undermined when an
excursion feels &QL; 
!dlim!like Saturday morning at Costco.
</P>
<P>
   The North Rim offers an escape from this crush. You just have to
work much harder to get there.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles, the drive requires between 10 and 11 hours.
Even from Las Vegas, it is a 272-mile haul, requiring a slash
across the desert on I-15 and a circuitous ramble through high
desert and red-rock country on Utah 9 and 59, Arizona 389, 89A and
67. The latter route terminates at the canyon edge _ the literal
dead end.
</P>
<P>
   But what a tremendous payoff. The North Rim, with an elevation
that ranges between 8,000 feet and 8,800 feet, sits much higher
than the South Rim (7,000 feet), which results in much cooler
summer temperatures and radically different terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The scrubby environment of the South Rim _ stunted juniper and
pinyon trees _ is swapped for a lush, richly forested region known
as the Kaibab Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Here are thick stands of trees _ Douglas fir, blue spruce,
quaking aspen _ and verdant meadows that burst forth in summer with
wildflowers: the bright yellow of the hairy gold aster (that really
is its name), the aptly named scarlet bugler, the purple of
fleabane and lupine.
</P>
<P>
   At the edges of those meadows, if you look closely, you'll have
a good chance of seeing mule deer (who use their enormous ears as
radar dishes) and wild turkeys. In the woods, you might catch a
glimpse of the reclusive Kaibab squirrel, whose bizarre coloring
combines a black body with a white, bushy tail; the species is
found nowhere else in the world but here.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the relative isolation of the North Rim, these
attributes have long been well-kept secrets. But the whispered word
is getting around.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last dozen years, annual visitation of the North Rim
has jumped by 100,000 people, to a current average of about
460,000, according to figures provided by National Park Service
spokeswoman Sandi Perl.
</P>
<P>
   That total represents only 10 percent of the people who cross
Grand Canyon National Park's borders each year. Tour buses, which
don't seem to want to bother with the place, are still infrequent
sights.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limited accommodations here, and the squeeze is
being felt. Grand Canyon Lodge, which has 228 cabins and 40
motel-like rooms, routinely takes reservations a year in advance _
and up to two years for one of its four rim-view cabins _ according
to front-desk supervisor Nikki Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge will close in the middle of next month, just before
the winter snowstorms usually arrive, and reopen in mid-May, thaw
permitting. For a stay in summer of 2000, now is the time to book.
</P>
<P>
   After venturing here, you might decide never to visit the South
Rim in summer again.
</P>
<P>
   The North Rim's appeals are subtle but substantial. They begin
with the main lodge building itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was constructed in 1927 (rebuilt in 1932 after a major fire)
from chunks of Kaibab limestone lying about and whole trunks of
ponderosa pine. But unlike its cousin to the south, the El Tovar
Hotel, which is set back from the rim, the Grand Canyon Lodge
clings to the very edge of the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a 1931 Union Pacific Railroad brochure correctly
observes that the lodge ``rises directly from the very brink of the
canyon, so that it gives the impression almost of having sprung
full-grown from the rock walls of the chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The lodge's Sun Room, with towering picture windows and
comfortable easy chairs, takes full advantage of the view, as does
the many-windowed dining room, but the most enduring feature of
this place is its veranda. It stretches along the canyon edge and
features a row of rough-hewn rocking chairs (emphasis on the
rough).
</P>
<P>
   This is where hikers, walkers and mule-riders congregate over
refreshments in the late afternoon. If you're early enough to lay
claim to a chair, and you fold a sweatshirt into a back pad, it's
easy to get alternately lost in a book and the view.
</P>
<P>
   The sun sets just to the right of this vantage point, and one
night in late August it produced a multitiered exhibit of hot-pink
swatches on the thunderheads of the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon Lodge doesn't have TVs or VCRs or CD players in
the guest rooms, the saloon, the lobby. This is probably why:
Gazing at the many-colored stripes of the canyon, seeing the sun
glint off such odd-shaped buttes as Angels Gate, Brahma Temple and
Zoroaster Temple is entertainment enough.
</P>
<P>
   The windows of the Sun Room will provide the big screen. And if
you're up for a walk, the park rangers will deliver the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Several guided programs are offered, from a morning nature walk
to a nighttime stargazing walk to a daily children's program that
includes storytelling, songs and games (details on all of the
options can be found at the Visitor Center, a few steps from the
lodge).
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, National Park naturalist Karla Martin
conducted the daily geology walk, which involves a mile round trip
of only moderate climbing out to Bright Angel Point.
</P>
<P>
   Kids listened with rapt attention as she told of the canyon's
formation over hundreds of millions of years, how this area was
once a mountain range as tall as the Himalayas, then a swamp with
dragonflies of 2-foot wingspans, then a desert the size of the
Sahara, then a vast inland sea. Each story was right there in the
precise, multihued layers of rock.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully avoiding the dry jargon of scientists, Martin told of
how an uplift effect beneath the Earth's surface was ``unique in
that it was gentle, like a layer cake rising slowly in the oven,
leaving all of these layers intact.''
</P>
<P>
   With a guide book or two (the Visitor Center has a superb
selection), you can also stray out into the park for a self-guided
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The depths of the canyon itself attract most of the hardier
visitors. The North Kaibab Trail is the only route into the canyon
from this north side, and many don't think a stay here is complete
until they descend it.
</P>
<P>
   It should be approached with healthy respect, though. The Grand
Canyon represents the ultimate upside-down hike, in that many
unsuspecting day trippers have skipped down the trail when they
were fresh only to pay a dear price on the grueling climb out. This
trail in particular undergoes a significant elevation drop just
below the rim _ more than 3,000 feet in the first 4.7 miles of
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity's a trap that lures people down,'' said park ranger
Lynn Picard. ``We warn people that it takes twice as long to get
out as it takes to get down, and it gets hotter as you go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature also seems to be a bit angrier, a bit rougher over here
on the north side. This past spring, floods washed out a
substantial stretch of trail near the bottom, causing a closure of
the route to Phantom Ranch on the canyon floor. In late August, a
heavy and prolonged thunderstorm produced flash floods near the top
that caused the trail to be shut down temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mule ride was not exempt from natural hardship. An
outbreak of botulism _ believed carried to the animals' feed in the
droppings of crows _ killed six mules and so sickened the others
that all rides were halted for the season in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   For those visitors not inclined to venture into the canyon by
any means, the North Rim has a wealth of alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are three hiking routes that take in considerable sections
of the canyon rim, including the Transcept Trail, a gentle 1{-mile
walk between the lodge and the National Park Service campground to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   Another rim hike that is highly recommended is the Widforss
Trail, which requires only some moderate climbs and offers the
rewards of several peeks deep into Transcept Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure available at the trail head provides information on
several numbered spots along the walk _ if you can get past the
heavy-handed environmental sermonizing in the text. The hike skirts
a shaded forest slope, rich with knee-high Christmas trees,
toadstools, emerald moss and quaking aspens, whose leaves shimmer
in the breeze and give the appearance of a shivering tree.
</P>
<P>
   Even a drive in the car can be rewarding. The dramatic vistas of
Point Imperial and Cape Royal lie at the end of two dead-end roads
that spur off the main dead-end road. Cape Royal features the only
spot on the North Rim from which you can see the Colorado River in
the depths of the canyon. The drive also includes distinctive
Angels Window, a giant hole in a rock overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Still another option is included nowhere in the Park Service
literature. It's as simple as waiting until an hour or so before
sunset, then driving north on the main road (Route 67). For 28
miles, the route is rimmed by meadows and forest, and at dusk the
deer come out to graze near the protection of the tree line.
</P>
<P>
   As you search for them, particularly on your return drive, you
might be in danger of being blown off the road by vehicles tearing
into the park, the eyes of the drivers riveted forward.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who haven't yet discovered the subtle appeals
of the Grand Canyon's North Rim. They're the ones who are
undoubtedly grinding their teeth and wondering why it's taking so
darn long to get there. &QL;

There are a number of hiking trails that skirt the edge of the
North Rim, including the Widforss Trail, which offers several views
into the depths of Transcept Canyon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unlike the El Tovar Hotel, its counterpart on the South Rim, the
Grand Canyon Lodge is built on the very edge of the North Rim. It
was constructed in 1927 from Kaibab limestone boulders found in the
area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The North Kaibab Trail is inherently challenging for hikers. It
makes a 3,000-foot drop in elevation in the trail's first 4.7
miles, which means the descent is a breeze, the climb out a stiff
test of endurance. &QL;

GOP LOOKS FOR WAYS TO PAY FOR SPENDING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending their summer recess promoting a tax
cut to be paid for out of projected budget surpluses, Republican
leaders are now scrambling to find ways to meet their spending
priorities without tapping into the Social Security Trust Fund they
have vowed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The job is ``hard work,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert said
Wednesday. But he joined other GOP leaders in pledging once again
to keep Social Security money off limits to congressional budget
negotiators as they head toward another showdown with President
Clinton over annual spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy. Because there's a lot of different spending
priorities around here,'' Hastert said, referring not only to
disagreements over funding and policy issues with the president but
within his own party as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Congress passed a temporary spending measure to keep
the government operating through Oct. 21, a move that gives
lawmakers more time to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   But as the start of the 2000 fiscal year approaches Friday,
Republican leaders are still showing little interest in negotiating
a deal with Clinton _ especially one that calls for closing
corporate tax loopholes or increasing cigarette taxes to cover new
spending, as he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republican leaders seem determined to pass a number of
controversial 2000 appropriations measures that fall short of
Clinton funding requests, knowing that he will veto them. The goal
of the strategy appears aimed at forcing Clinton's hand on his own
pledge to protect Social Security, while trying to finance some of
his more expensive proposals like his plan to hire 100,000 new
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are so sure that Clinton will try to ``raid the
Social Security Trust Fund,'' as House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, put it Wednesday, that they have already prepared a series
of ads to be aired this fall and in next year's elections accusing
him and the Democrats of doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Democrats say that GOP leaders have already broken
``the pledge'' themselves by using accounting gimmicks to hide the
fact that some of their own spending increases may end up having to
be paid for with Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have already floated a number of proposals that
would declare some routine government expenditures as
``emergencies'' to avoid spending limits agreed to in 1997 or that
would borrow from future budgets to help finance current programs.
They also advocate cutting or delaying a number of programs
designed to help the poor, including housing vouchers and home
heating credits.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said earlier this
week that GOP lawmakers are also considering a plan that would
delay the full benefit of an earned income tax credit for the
working poor by spreading it out over 12 months rather than making
lump sum payments. A Republican leadership aide said the change
would save about $8 billion next year ``without hurting anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican appropriators have already used up nearly $15 billion
in non-Social Security surpluses taken in this year to help pay for
so-called emergency spending. By borrowing money from future
budgets and delaying funding for some programs, they hope to find
enough money to pay for increased defense and other spending, and
to cover the cost of ``local'' projects demanded by some Republican
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has warned in an analysis that
the Republican budget proposals, as they stand now, will have to
borrow $16 billion to $30 billion from Social Security to finance
increased spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay said that the CBO analysis ``is based on false
assumptions'' about what the final appropriations bills will look
like when all 13 of them are finally approved and sent to Clinton.
Only five have been approved so far, and Clinton has vetoed two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, we will have maintained the
balanced budget (agreement) and we will not have spent a dime of
Social Security surplus, and it will be certified by the
Congressional Budget Office,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texan declined to say just how the GOP spending
would be offset to avoid tapping Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said that the president
doesn't have to wait for the GOP's final offsets to know that this
year's budget process is a ``horror show'' and that Republicans are
``doing exactly what they say they're not doing'' _ borrowing from
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the proposals put forward by Republicans to cut or
delay programs for low-income Americans resembles the ``bleak
stories'' found in the novels of Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at this approach, when you've got Armey and
you've got Rep. DeLay, you don't need Dickens,'' Lockhart quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., called on Republican
leaders to open budget negotiations with the White House, warning
that there are no guarantees a government shutdown can be avoided
when the temporary funding bill expires in three weeks.

RUNS WITH TRAVEL-NORTHRIM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
IF YOU GO
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: The Grand Canyon's North Rim is a 565-mile drive
from Los Angeles via I-10, I-15, Utah routes 9 and 59, and Arizona
routes 389, 89A and 67. It's probably best to allow 10 to 11 hours
for that drive. A flight to Las Vegas and a car rental will knock
off half the time. Many travelers combine the North Rim with visits
to such nearby attractions as Utah's Zion and Bryce national parks,
or Lake Powell, which stretches out along the Arizona-Utah border.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: The National Park Service charges a $20 fee per vehicle.
It is good for seven days and for both the North Rim and the South
Rim of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The cabins and motel rooms of the Grand Canyon Lodge
are the only accommodations in the national park aside from the
campground. The setting _ in a thick evergreen forest, near the
canyon edge _ is delightful, though the rooms are tiny and sparsely
furnished. (You probably won't be wanting to spend a lot of time in
your room, though.) Because the lodge is the only game in town, it
can command from $80 to $104 per night. Be forewarned: Rates can
change without notice _ and routinely do. Even if your confirmation
slip lists the lower rate, you'll be required to pay the new one.
It's best to book six months to a year in advance. Reservations:
(303) 297-2757. Web: www.amfac.com. The National Park campground,
which has no hookups, charges $15 to $20 per site. Reservations:
(800) 365-2267.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The restaurant at Grand Canyon Lodge features a towering
ceiling, tall windows, spectacular views ... and passable food. The
prices are reasonable _ $12 to $20 for dinner; California wines in
the low $20s _ but the preparation was found to be uninspired and
inconsistent (heavy sauces, red potatoes and penne h &LR; j5t

GEORGE W. CANS ISSUE-ORIENTED GHOSTWRITER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; George W. Bush  &LR; has fired  &UR; Mickey Herskowitz &LR; , ghostwriter of
his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep,'' because Herskowitz kept
pressing him for positions on various issues. According to MSNBC,
the book was to be 30 percent biography, 70 percent policy.
Herskowitz, who writes for the Houston Chronicle and has written
books about  &UR; Bear &LR;   &UR; Bryant &LR;  and  &UR; Mickey Mantle &LR; , couldn't make his
subject conform to the ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz told MSNBC that when the book's deadline approached,
Bush and his people ``felt it would be a mistake to talk about
issues because position on those issues is still evolving. It
wasn't that the issues were scary or sensitive or whatever, it was
just that it didn't make sense to come out now with positions that
might change.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer said that Bush's staff had given him hundreds of
speeches from which he was to cull ideas, but ``if you know
politicians, it was really four or five speeches slightly altered.
The press office already had at its fingertips what it thought
should be the book, so I swallowed my pride and said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz, who said he has no ill feelings, said that  &UR; Karen &LR; 
 &UR; Hughes &LR; , who works for the Bush campaign, is completing the
forthcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIGHTY FINE ARTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, where New York
Mayor  &UR; Rudy Giuliani &LR;  was backstage to present a plaque to
 &UR; Placido &LR; 
 &UR; Domingo &LR; , His Honor was booed. ``The liberal-arts crowd sticks
together,'' noted the New York Post; the booing was because of
Giuliani's attempt to cut funding for the Brooklyn Museum of Art
because he is offended by an artist's use of elephant dung in a
work that involved the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a quote in a new book about painting on velvet,
``Leetig of Tahiti'' by  &UR; John Turner  &LR; (Last Gasp; $29.95), includes
one educated opinion about artists' use of unconventional
materials:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no longer a hierarchy of materials that
establishes the seriousness of a work of art,'' said  &UR; John Lane &LR; ,
who was then the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art &LR; , &LR;  in 1988. ``Since  &UR; Marcel Duchamp &LR;  called a urinal a
sculpture, those kinds of hierarchies have been out the window. ...
I believe that what you are looking for is the significance of the
work of art, and I don't believe whatever the material is made of
either elevates or denigrates its value.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In Istanbul last week,  &UR; Muhammed Sevim &LR; , 21, attacked two
paintings by  &UR; Salvador Dali &LR;  _ portraits of  &UR; Michelangelo  &LR; and
 &UR; Leonardo da Vinci &LR;  _ breaking glass, cutting his hand, &LR;  and leaving
blood stains on the paintings. Police said he had suffered from
depression, and he was admitted to a mental hospital shortly after
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Art Vandals Web site www.art.a.se/artvandals,
constructed by Swedish artist  &UR; Felix Gmelin &LR; , describes 12 works
that had been previously subject to vandalism. Among them is
``Painting Modernism Black,'' an example of vandalism committed in
1996 against ``Away From the Flock,'' a work by the controversial
 &UR; Damien Hirst &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The original work included a fluffy white lamb floating in
formaldehyde. Artist  &UR; Mark Bridger &LR; , the vandal, poured black ink
into it and retitled it ``Black Sheep.''
</P>

<P>
   &UR; George W. Bush  &LR; has fired  &UR; Mickey Herskowitz &LR; , ghostwriter of
his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep,'' because Herskowitz kept
pressing him for positions on various issues. According to MSNBC,
the book was to be 30 percent biography, 70 percent policy.
Herskowitz, who writes for the Houston Chronicle and has written
books about  &UR; Bear &LR;   &UR; Bryant &LR;  and  &UR; Mickey Mantle &LR; , couldn't make his
subject conform to the ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz told MSNBC that when the book's deadline approached,
Bush and his people ``felt it would be a mistake to talk about
issues because position on those issues is still evolving. It
wasn't that the issues were scary or sensitive or whatever, it was
just that it didn't make sense to come out now with positions that
might change.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer said that Bush's staff had given him hundreds of
speeches from which he was to cull ideas, but ``if you know
politicians, it was really four or five speeches slightly altered.
The press office already had at its fingertips what it thought
should be the book, so I swallowed my pride and said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz, who said he has no ill feelings, said that  &UR; Karen &LR; 
 &UR; Hughes &LR; , who works for the Bush campaign, is completing the
forthcoming book.

   _ At the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, where New York
Mayor  &UR; Rudy Giuliani &LR;  was backstage to present a plaque to
 &UR; Placido &LR; 
 &UR; Domingo &LR; , His Honor was booed. ``The liberal-arts crowd sticks
together,'' noted the New York Post; the booing was because of
Giuliani's attempt to cut funding for the Brooklyn Museum of Art
because he is offended by an artist's use of elephant dung in a
work that involved the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a quote in a new book about painting on velvet,
``Leetig of Tahiti'' by  &UR; John Turner  &LR; (Last Gasp; $29.95), includes
one educated opinion about artists' use of unconventional
materials:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no longer a hierarchy of materials that
establishes the seriousness of a work of art,'' said  &UR; John Lane &LR; ,
who was then the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art &LR; , &LR;  in 1988. ``Since  &UR; Marcel Duchamp &LR;  called a urinal a
sculpture, those kinds of hierarchies have been out the window. ...
I believe that what you are looking for is the significance of the
work of art, and I don't believe whatever the material is made of
either elevates or denigrates its value.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In Istanbul last week,  &UR; Muhammed Sevim &LR; , 21, attacked two
paintings by  &UR; Salvador Dali &LR;  _ portraits of  &UR; Michelangelo  &LR; and
 &UR; Leonardo da Vinci &LR;  _ breaking glass, cutting his hand, &LR;  and leaving
blood stains on the paintings. Police said he had suffered from
depression, and he was admitted to a mental hospital shortly after
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Art Vandals Web site www.art.a.se/artvandals,
constructed by Swedish artist  &UR; Felix Gmelin &LR; , describes 12 works
that had been previously subject to vandalism. Among them is
``Painting Modernism Black,'' an example of vandalism committed in
1996 against ``Away From the Flock,'' a work by the controversial
 &UR; Damien Hirst &LR; .
</P>

   The original work included a fluffy white lamb floating in
formaldehyde. Artist  &UR; Mark Bridger &LR; , the vandal, poured black ink

CLINTON WIDENS PLAN FOR POOR DEBTOR NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday announced a major
expansion of American efforts to forgive the debt of the world's
poorest nations, saying those countries would not have to pay back
any of the billions of dollars they borrowed from American aid
agencies if they could show the savings were being plowed into
poverty reduction and education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Wednesday of 100 percent debt forgiveness
for the world's most indebted nations _ mostly in sub-Saharan
Africa _ expands a previous commitment by the United States in June
to write off up to 90 percent of the money they owe. But the
process may take years, and it is contingent on congressional
approval of a $1 billion debt-forgiveness program that Clinton sent
to Capitol Hill last week as an amendment to his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, administration officials say, is that many of the
countries that will benefit from the program never had much hope
repaying more than a fraction of the $5.7 billion they currently
owe the U.S. Treasury. In fact, much of that debt has already been
lessened on the government's ledger books, reflecting estimates
that the United States was likely to recover only pennies on the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by the magic of Washington's budget rules, the $5.7
billion in debt can be wiped out with a congressional expenditure
of only $1 billion. Still, it is far from clear that Congress will
go along with the move, especially as elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here, just as the
two financial institutions were putting the finishing touches on a
$50 billion debt-reduction program that involves their own massive
lending to poor nations. Clinton's announcement, during a brief
appearance in a hotel ballroom where thousands of delegates of
countries around the world were gathered, seemed to take many here
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United
States,'' Clinton said, ``when _ and this is quite important _ when
needed to help them finance basic human needs and when the money
will be used to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said that Clinton's move had ``symbolic importance that
goes beyond its economic significance,'' especially in countries
that are choosing between paying off their international loans or
building more schools or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's program would initially aid countries like Uganda and
Mozambique, which have gone the furthest in meeting requirements
set out in 1996 for debt relief. But ultimately it could help
another 34 nations, from Tanzania to Zamabia and Ivory Coast to
Nicaragua and Honduras to rogue nations like Myanmar if they are
willing to meet the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not extend his spirit of forgiveness, however, to
one country that is deeply indebted, and deeply in trouble, with
the IMF: Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the head of the fund, Michel Camdessus, said that
``it would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on
this great nation; we will not do that.'' He urged that all the
allegations of misappropriation of funds should be weighed against
seven years of ``real progress,'' and praised Russia for continuing
to develop a ``modern market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus' comments, and the absence of balancing words of
warning to Russia, infuriated some White House officials who felt
it undermined their effort to send a stern message to Moscow.
Clinton, talked Wednesday only about Russia as an example that the
fund must heed as it reviews ``its procedures and controls to
strengthen the safeguards'' on use of its money.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets' impending divorce from Scottie Pippen grew ugly and
near completion Wednesday when the team moved close to a deal to
ship Pippen to Portland and Pippen blistered Charles Barkley in a
televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said Wednesday there was ``no reason to spend three or
four years'' with a team that would have Barkley and said he wanted
``to get away from playing with'' Barkley, whom he had called a
close friend last season.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Pippen's comments were made public, the Rockets
were already working on a trade that would move him less than eight
months after he been acquired to be a key part of their future.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Pippen, the Trail Blazers would send the Rockets
six players, at least half of whom would be included only for cap
reasons. None could be considered a replacement superstar.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets would receive forward Walt Williams, center Kelvin
Cato, forward Stacey Augmon, forward/center Carlos Rogers, forward
Ed Gray and guard Brian Shaw, according to several sources who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The trade would give the Rockets 19 players, four more than they
could have on the roster (including players on the injured list)
when the season begins Nov. 2. But the Rockets would have to take
on the extra contracts to balance the $14.75 million of cap space
(in salary and incentives deemed likely to be earned) taken by
Pippen's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The trade will not be completed until Saturday at the earliest,
according to a source close to the discussions. The Rockets'
training camp will begin Tuesday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets officials, citing team policy, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always trying to improve this team,'' Rockets vice
president Carroll Dawson said. ``We never sit down and say, `This
is good enough.' We'll be looking at everything. You're always
trying to make the team better. We never rest on our laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   This trade, however, would be made in part to rid the Rockets of
Pippen's escalating contract and increasing dissatisfaction with
the team. The last two seasons of Pippen's five-year, $67 million
deal (excluding incentive bonuses Pippen received last season)
would be worth $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new collective bargaining agreement, Pippen's contract
would likely push the Rockets so far over the salary cap that it
would cost them a severe tax and tie their hands in any player
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Williams, who has two seasons remaining on his deal,
the players the Rockets would receive are all in the last season of
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In Williams, a 6-8 forward with outstanding shooting range, the
Rockets would land a player they sought in the 1997-98 season when
they attempted to acquire guard Damon Stoudamire from Toronto.
Cato, a 6-11 shot-blocker, is considered an outstanding defensive
talent, though he has struggled to receive consistent playing time
in his two seasons out of Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had requested a trade to the Lakers to be reunited with
his Bulls coach, Phil Jackson. Though Jackson remains a staunch
supporter of Pippen and has argued that he could help ease LA's
transition to the triangle offense, the Lakers have opted to try to
make their current mix work rather than offer a package that would
include Glen Rice and Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley told the Chronicle last month and ESPN on Tuesday that
Pippen owed him an apology for asking to be traded less than a year
after they jointly decided to sign with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day before he signed,'' Barkley said, ``Scottie was
calling me and asking me if I was going to be (in Houston). He said
he wasn't coming if I wasn't staying. I gave him my word, and
that's why I signed for what I did ($1 million for one year) when I
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it threw me for a loop,'' Barkley said of the trade
request. ``I almost fell out of my chair. I felt very frustrated
very betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Scottie the next morning and told him how disappointed
I was in him. It really rubs me wrong that he'd try to bail out on
the team after one season. It's unbelievable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said in August that Pippen could repair the damage
caused by his trade request.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Scottie owes the Rockets' fans an apology,'' Barkley
said. ``They've been terrific to him. Second, he owes the Rockets
an apology. And third, he owes me an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie needs to stand up and be a man. If he does, we can
move on. Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ESPN interview on Wednesday, Pippen offered a stinging
rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,''
Pippen said. ``He can never expect an apology from me. If anything,
he owes me an apology for coming to play with his fat butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Barkley had defended Pippen's play in Tuesday's
interview, contending Pippen was overtaxed by ball-handling
responsibilities that would now go to rookie Steve Francis, Pippen
said he was the one who should be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very selfish guy,'' Pippen said of Barkley. ``He
doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my reason for
wanting to get away from playing with him anymore _ because he just
doesn't show the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should've listened to Michael (Jordan) a year ago
when he said that Charles will never win a championship because he
doesn't show any dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley averaged 16.1 points (making 48.3 percent of his shots),
12.3 rebounds (second in the NBA) and 4.5 assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game, his lowest scoring average
since his rookie season in 1987-88, and made a career-low 43.2
percent of his shots. He also averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists
and was named to the NBA's All-Defense first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is definitely one of the guys that needs to show more
leadership for this ballclub to be successful, and he don't show
that to me,'' Pippen told ESPN. ``He feels that if he gets 10
rebounds and double-figure points, he's done a good job. But that's
not what the game's about. It's about defending, being professional
and coming to work every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shocked to see what type of player he was by
spending half a season with him. I'm a guy that's dedicated to
winning, and I put out a lot of effort on the court. I expect that
from my teammates, especially from a guy of his caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he's not willing to go the distance. There's no
reason for me to put my last three or four years at risk of never
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen complained throughout last season about his role and said
Wednesday he would like to play for Jackson in a return to the
triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to play for Phil,'' Pippen said. ``(But) I'm not
demanding a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But with his scorched-earth, bridge-burning comments, Pippen
could have assured a trade _ if one were not already in the works.

THE GOOD, THE BAD OF TALES OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the greatest feats of survival is finally
getting the attention it deserves. Caroline Alexander has captured
the drama, horror and heroism of the 1914 voyage of the British
sailing ship Endurance in a book of the same title (Alfred A.
Knopf; $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Ernest Shackleton was eager to achieve his
longtime goal of hiking across the Antarctic from the Weddell Sea
to the Ross Sea after failing on a previous endeavor. To modern
eyes, the risks so far outweighed the possible gains as to make the
voyage seem mad; back then, exploration was done for the hell of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton and his men never succeeded. That they survived at
all is a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was trapped in pack ice in January 1915, just a month
and a half after leaving a whaling station in the South Atlantic.
The men lived aboard in relative comfort for nine months as they
looked ahead to a time when they might free the ship.
</P>
<P>
   That never happened. Instead, the ship was crushed by ice in
October, accompanied by the eerie, mournful crying of emperor
penguins. The men moved onto an ice floe. Then their descent into
misery began.
</P>
<P>
   They drifted on ice floes for hundreds of miles before they were
forced to take to the small boats they had carried with them. Their
only chance was to make land, so they rode lifeboats to Elephant
Island. When they reached the island seven days later, they were
sick, dehydrated and wasted. It was their first day on solid ground
after 497 days on their ship and ice floes. But their ordeals had
barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   The party's provisions were running low. Shackleton decided the
only chance was to ride one of the boats _ at 22 feet long with two
tiny sails, hardly designed for the open sea _ and make for the
same whaling station from which they had originally embarked, some
800 miles away. Six men undertook the journey; the rest of the
group stayed behind, fully appreciating their only chance rested on
the perfect navigation of their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men were soaked to the bone and frostbitten,'' Alexander
writes of the nightmarish odyssey. ``They were badly chafed by wet
clothes that had not been removed for seven months, and afflicted
with saltwater boils. Their wet feet and legs were a sickly white
and swollen. Their hands were black _ with grime, blubber, burns
from the Primus (heater) and frostbite. The least movement was
excruciating.''
</P>
<P>
   The 214-page ``The Endurance'' is an engrossing account of a
superhuman feat of derring-do written in crisp, plain language. New
Hampshire author Alexander does not get carried away by the scope
of the tale, which could easily have led to overwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the crew found the experience transcendent.
Shackleton wrote afterward: ``We had pierced the veneer of outside
things. We had `suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down yet
grasped at glory, grown bigger in the bigness of the whole.' We had
seen God in his splendors, hear the text that nature renders. We
had reached the naked soul of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 140 incredible photographs help bring the story to life.
Australian Frank Hurley took photos that are Ansel Adams-like in
their stark beauty; he ensured the images would endure by soldering
the film into metal containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition''
is well-rendered, even inspiring. Our rating: Four stars &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   Another 214-page title about staying alive is not nearly so
well-written.
</P>
<P>
   Lene Gammelgaard, the first Scandinavian woman to conquer Mount
Everest, has added to the growing collection of works about the May
1996 disaster on its summit in which eight climbers were caught in
a storm and died. But her journal-like style in ``Climbing High: A
Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy'' (Seal Press;
$25) subtracts from what should be a powerful story, while annoying
New Age-speak further weakens the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: ``But it's obvious that now I must grow, I must strive
to reach my full potential.'' And: ``To grow up is to learn that
one's mature life consists of a personal choices and decisions, and
to realize the options gives true freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that Abba music I hear in the background?
</P>
<P>
   When she finally does get around to describing the storm that

she slid down the mountain, using a rope, and barely survived.

   Some parts are composed with imagination. But Gammelgaard has
neglected to prune out unnecessary details, especially the arrival,

PORCH FITS PALMEIRO IN HIS OWN `HOUSE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not exactly true what Rafael Palmeiro always said about The
Ballpark in Arlington _ that it was built for him.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Rangers team president Tom Schieffer explains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rafael took more interest in the design of the park than any
player we had at the time. He was always dropping by the office,
looking over the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we did was set the dimensions of our park with Yankee
Stadium in mind. Make it handy for left-handed hitters, yet have
the deep left-field power alleys that favor pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Schieffer willingly copied a long-standing successful
model in building the new yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rafael's swing fit that model,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fit it so perfectly that after only one season back ``home,''
Palmeiro already owns the park's right-field porch, not to mention
every home run record in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's not Sammy or Big Mac, but Palmeiro is challenging
Junior Griffey for long-ball supremacy in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, home run feats in baseball are becoming almost a blur.
Biceps have taken over the game. The once fabled ``61'' is long
gone as the most magical number in sports. Fences are being cleared
in record numbers, so much so that the ``juiced'' ball conspiracy
theory is almost accepted as fact, while the splendid art of
consistently hitting home runs has been cheapened.
</P>
<P>
   Which for the Rangers, by the way, is nothing new. It was
forever a franchise that was both cursed and cussed for being too
home run intensive while wasting away in such areas as pitching and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, however, is going this season where Burroughs, Zisk,
Parrish, Sierra, and even Gonzalez have never been. And it does
make you wonder what would have happened if Rafael had played the
previous five seasons at the new Arlington park.
</P>
<P>
   He left, of course, in a contractual huff after the season
(1993) that Arlington Stadium was closed. Rafael's parting words
were that the Rangers would dearly miss him at the new ballpark. He
was clearly right.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has tied Juan Gonzalez' 1996 club record for home runs
(47), and 28 of those have come at home, the most ever at either
Arlington park.
</P>
<P>
   During five seasons in Baltimore, Palmeiro certainly took
advantage of Camden Yards' right-field porch. But this season has
produced career home run numbers (his high with the Orioles was 43
last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Rafael, we've seen for the first time the design of
the ballpark benefit the club,'' Schieffer said. ``He's a
left-handed hitter who is making it work on behalf of the
Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Schieffer is also the first to admit ``much
concern'' over the current home run glut in baseball. And although
no longer a member of Tom Hicks' executive-level team (he resigned
in May), when Schieffer speaks, it pays to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Here was and is a heart-and-soul baseball man who once also had
the ear of commissioner Bud Selig and other owners. The Rangers
dearly miss that, particularly on such issues as the back-room
politics involved in having the club finally removed from a Pacific
time zone division.
</P>
<P>
   But when those of us in the media need ``background'' on
something like the ``juiced-ball conspiracy,'' Schieffer remains
the best local source.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the 1993 season, the last one before the devastating
lockout and shutdown of baseball, to this season, and home runs are
up a large 25 percent. And that percentage has grown every year
since 1993. A long-standing theory says the ball was secretly
doctored to create home run excitement in hopes of soothing an
angry fandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just never happened,'' said Schieffer, laughing. ``I was in
all those meetings. I would have known. And besides, there has
never been any issue in baseball all the owners would first agree
on, and then take a vow of silence. It would be impossible to keep
something like that a secret. With owners, there are no secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer said the only ``conspiracy'' has been the desire to
build home run-friendly parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arlington, we went against that trend,'' he added, ``but
what baseball also has are hitters who are stronger than ever,
diluted pitching, and smaller parks. All that adds up to more home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, with McGwire and Sosa, that was great for the
game. But if you are going to have a home run hitting contest
``every'' year, then the appeal is quickly gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One local exception, however, is Rafael Palmeiro. He has given
the Rangers new appeal, and a new dimension in a ballpark built for
a sweet swing from the left side. nn

TEXAS TECH'S RICKY WILLIAMS IS OUT FOR THE SEASON 
CANSECO SOUNDING UPBEAT ABOUT FUTURE WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Tech's injury-marred season took another disappointing
turn Wednesday when tailback Ricky Williams was declared out for
the season after reinjuring his left knee in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Medical tests performed Wednesday showed that Williams, the Big
12's top returning rusher from 1998, will need surgery after
aggravating a sprained knee suffered Sept. 6 against Arizona State.
Williams, a junior from Duncanville, slumped to the turf while
making a cut during noncontact drills in a Tuesday night practice
and had to be carted off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes, who watched his team lose four offensive
starters for extended periods in the Arizona State game, called the
injury ``gut-wrenching.'' He said Williams' spot will be taken by a
trio of backs when the Red Raiders (1-2, 0-0) begin Big 12 play
against No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M (3-0, 0-0) at 6 p.m. Saturday in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart to see something like this happen to good
people,'' Dykes said. ``The worst thing about athletics is
injuries, because these kids put their whole life into it. And it
can be taken away in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Tayrien, Tech's running backs coach, said the Red Raiders
would ``play it by committee and go with the hot hand'' when
dividing playing time for backup tailbacks Shaud Williams (no
relation), Rickey Hunter and James Easterling.
</P>
<P>
   A preseason candidate for the Heisman Trophy and the Doak Walker
National Running Back Award, Ricky Williams rushed for 1,582 yards
and 13 touchdowns in 1998. He was cleared last week to return to
practice after suffering the sprained knee against Arizona State.
Williams will be redshirted and will have two years of eligibility
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tech players said they were disappointed to lose one of their
team co-captains for the season, but vowed press on in Williams'
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just going to have to play harder,'' said left guard
Curtis Lowery, a senior from Stephenville. ``We can't get too upset
about losing one person. He isn't the whole team. He's just a good
part of it. If we just go out there and give up, then we might as
well not go out there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Tech's two most productive rushing performances of
the season came with Williams sidelined. Easterling, a Crowley High
School graduate, ground out 105 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-17
victory against Louisiana-Lafayette. Shaud Williams, a freshman
from Andrews, had 151 yards and two touchdowns in the team's 21-14
loss to North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Morris, Tech's starting fullback who has not played since
the Arizona State game because of a bruised shoulder, is expected
to start against A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes said Shaud Williams (5-foot-8, 175 pounds) is the tailback
most likely to emerge as Tech's primary playmaker in the absence of
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a little different dimension than we're used to,''
Dykes said of Shaud Williams. ``He has great quickness and a
tremendous burst of speed. He's just going to get better and
better.'' nn

THE FORGOTTEN WATERS OF LAKE CUYAMACA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JULIAN, Calif. _ Lake Cuyamaca is San Diego County's secret
fishing spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best-kept secret in Southern California. There's not
a weekend that goes by that I don't hear from a long-term San
Diegan something to the effect, `I've lived in this place for 25
years and I didn't know this place was here.' It's amazing,'' lake
manager Hugh Marx said.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret is getting out lately and starting to spread far
and wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully 25 percent of our anglers drive two to 2{ hours to get
here,'' Marx said. ``We have them come from Yuma, the Imperial
Valley, Palm Springs, Riverside, the San Fernando Valley, all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour's drive northeast of downtown San Diego and it is
angler-friendly, with fishing jetties, inexpensive boat rentals and
a wide variety of game species. The reservoir is stocked with
44,000 pounds of trout a year, and, unlike other waters in the
region, it supports a year-around rainbow fishery. Bass, crappie,
bluegill, bullheads and catfish are thrown in for good measure. But
it is the trout fishery that attracts most of the more than 60,000
people who visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Marx likens the impoundment to something more appropriately
found in the Sierra Nevada. It sits at an elevation of 4,600 feet
in the Cuyamaca Mountains on the northern boundary on Cuyamaca
Rancho State Park. The lake's American Indian name means, ``where
the rain falls''; it is almost Alpine in character, with pines on
the hillsides above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as Crowley Lake South.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy fits because, like Crowley, Cuyamaca is heavily
planted with trout that adapt quickly to the natural forage in the
reservoir and reach large dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   While most anglers catch trout fresh from either the Department
of Fish and Game's Mojave River hatchery or the Whitewater Trout
Farm, many fish elude their pursuers and grow fat on a diet of
midge larvae, damselfly nymphs and small baitfish, which makes
their meat a rich, pinkish color, like their brethren in Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   The lake-record rainbow is a 14-pound, 1-ounce specimen taken in
October 1995 by fly-fisherman Tim Halley of San Diego on a small
hare's ear nymph on 2-pound test tippet while float-tubing near the
boat dock.
</P>
<P>
   While such behemoths are not common, 2- to 3-pound 'bows are
hooked with regularity, especially in the fall. The bulk of anglers
use a 2- to 3-foot leader with either inflated night crawlers or a
processed floating baits. However, lure fishermen and fly-anglers
often catch bigger fish casting small baits that resemble the
lake's forage fish. There also are some periods of incredible
dry-fly fishing, when even the heaviest trout cruise the outside
edges of weed lines to feeding on midges. Again, this is a lot like
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyamaca also has a very prolific crappie fishery. Lake staff
recommend anglers keep all the crappie they catch. Most of the fish
are small and stunted, not much larger than 4 or 5 inches. From
late spring throughout the summer, they provide excellent fishing,
especially for kids who are more interested in action than
substance. And, in keeping with the premise, this reminds anglers
of Crowley's Sacramento perch fishery.
</P>
<P>
   And like most San Diego County waters, Cuyamaca has
Florida-strain largemouths. ``The bass are the biggest secret in
the lake. We're mostly thought of as a trout fishery, but we have
some very large bass,'' Marx said.
</P>
<P>
   With little bass-angling traffic and a steady stream of good
prey species _ most notable smaller crappie and rainbows _ some of
the bass here are simply huge. Mike Long of Poway amazed many
regulars by catching a 14-pound, 3-ounce largemouth in June to set
a lake record.
</P>
<P>
   Bass angling is best in spring, as the bucketmouths make
spawning beds in the shoreline shallows. The smallmouth bass
fishery is improving after two plants made since 1995. Channel
catfish can reach 20 pounds, and white sturgeon also are frequently
hooked, but none have been keeper size of 46 inches in the lake ...
yet.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its similarities, Crowley has no bass, cats or
sturgeon, and Cuyamaca is hours closer to home. Your choice. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING ... &QL; 
A public, nonprofit facility, Lake Cuyamaca is situated in Central
San Diego County, south of Julian along Highway 79. From the San
Diego Freeway (5) south of Oceanside, travel east on Highway 78
through Escondido and Ramona, then south on 79.
</P>
<P>
   Fees: Angling, $4.75 for adults, $2.50 for ages 8 to 15;
children 7 and younger fish free. (Fishing classes are offered
Saturdays mornings at 10.) Day-use parking, $5 per vehicle.
Motorboat rentals, $25 per day, $20 after 1 p.m., $10 twilight
rate. Camping, $12 per site, $17 with hookups. Information: (760)
765-0515 or the lake's www.lakecuyamaca.org Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent Cuyamaca Rancho State Park offers wonderful wildlife
viewing opportunities. The meadows just to the south of the
reservoir have one of the largest concentrations of southern mule
deer in this subspecies' range; it is not uncommon to see 40 or 50
deer early in the morning or late in the evening. Coyotes, bobcats
and wild turkeys also are common sights, along with one of the most
varied bird populations in North America. Camping, hiking and
mountain biking are available. Cuyamaca Rancho park also is thought
to be one of the finest settings to see the changing of colors of
fall foliage. Information: (760) 765-0755.

CLINTON OFFERS TO OVERLOOK DEBTS OF POOR COUNTRIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling it an economic and moral imperative,
President Clinton said Wednesday the United States would forgive
all debt owed it by poor nations if they use the break to lift
their citizens from poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
   His offer would cost about $1 billion and could affect 36
nations. Those nations collectively owe $5.7 billion, but their
debts, most dating from the 1970s and 1980s, already have been
written down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's gesture before the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank officials received a standing ovation
from the executives who specialize in trying to save troubled
economies.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a renewed pledge this week by the IMF and the
world's seven wealthiest nations to make good on a June agreement
to forgive 90 percent of the debt owed by poor countries if their
governments used the debt relief to begin education, health and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton asked Congress to add $120 million over four
years to his previous requested $850 million for debt forgiveness
under that Group of Seven agreement. Congress must approve the
debt-relief request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am directing my administration to make it possible to
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe the United
States ... to help them finance basic human needs,'' Clinton told
the executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an economic and moral imperative that we use this moment
of global consensus to do better,'' Clinton said, pledging ``I will
do everything I can to aid this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the debt forgiveness issue will become his personal
priority. He said it was unacceptable that at a time when the
United States is enjoying historic prosperity more than 1.3 billion
people live on less than $1 a day and 40 million die annually of
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't believe we can possibly agree to the idea
that these nations that are so terribly poor should always be that
way,'' Clinton said. ``I don't think we can, in good conscience,
say we support the idea that they should choose between making
interest payments on their debt and investing in their children's
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the effort by the Group of Seven, the world's
wealthiest nations, to reduce the debt load on poor countries will
benefit 430 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initiative seeks to tie debt relief to poverty reduction
and to make sure that savings are spent where they should be: on
education, on fighting AIDS and preventing it, on other critical
needs,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bolivia, it could mean double the number of people with
access to clean water by 2004. For Uganda, it could mean a 50
percent increase in education and health spending by 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Uganda has new anti-poverty programs in place, it was
among the first to qualify for the G7 debt-relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very welcome, of course, most welcome,'' Tumusiime
Mutebile, permanent secretary to the Ugandan treasury, told the
Washington Post after Clinton's speech. Uganda owes about $3.5
billion to foreign creditors, about half the country's economy as
measured by gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The G7 program, amounting to $27 billion in relief, applies to
debt owed to international agencies such as the World Bank.
Clinton's announcement concerned money owed to U.S. government
bodies such as the Agency for International Development and the
Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the annual meeting to highlight a request by
Pope John II and other church leaders that rich nations provide a
gift for the new millennium to poor countries. ``Simply put,
unsustainable debt is helping to keep too many poor countries and
poor people in poverty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he wants the World Trade Organization,
the international body that governs trade rules, to focus on jobs
and development when it convenes for a new round of trade talks in
Seattle this November.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative drew praise from groups who have long
lobbied for more G7 help in developing nations. ``This will put a
lot of pressure on the other rich countries to increase their debt
relief proposals,'' said Carole Collins, national coordinator for
the Jubilee 2000-U.S.A. campaign, which includes church leaders,
environmentalists and nonprofit groups fighting hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Clinton's request is embodied in a debt-relief
measure introduced by U.S. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the
House Banking Committee.

<P>
   What is a hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane is an intense tropical storm that has winds of 74
mph and higher, according to the National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   These winds blow in a large spiral around a calm center, called
the ``eye.'' The eye is 20-30 miles wide. In the Northern
Hemisphere of the Earth, winds move counterclockwise around the
eye. In the Southern Hemisphere, winds circulate clockwise.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes develop over tropical ocean waters and many remain
there. When a hurricane does approach land, skies begin to darken
and winds strengthen. The hurricane begins driving water ahead of
it in a storm surge or tidal wave that can be 20 feet at its peak.
Hurricanes can also trigger tornadoes and floods.
</P>
<P>
   How are hurricanes named?
</P>
<P>
   The World Meteorological Organization has chosen an alphabetical
list of names for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the list
rotates every six years. That practice started in 1953. Names used
for storms this year are the same that were used in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The names of tropical storms and hurricanes used to be all
women's names until 1978 and '79. Now, men's names are alternated
with women's.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a hurricane is particularly destructive, the
name is retired, which means the name can't be used for at least 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   One such name was Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and
Louisiana in 1992. The storm caused 54 deaths and up to $30 billion
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in context, the Galveston, Texas hurricane of 1900
(before hurricanes were named) caused 6,000 deaths, the most in
U.S. history, according to the World Almanac and Book of Facts.
</P>
<P>
   Where and when are most hurricanes in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Florida has the most hurricanes in the United States, the
National Hurricane Center reports.
</P>
<P>
   Other places vulnerable to hurricanes are the coasts along the
Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic Ocean, from Texas to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30, and peak months
are August and September.
</P>
<P>
   Which hurricanes and tropical storms have formed in the Atlantic
Ocean this year?
</P>
<P>
   Arlene: This tropical storm formed on June 11 and spent its life
at sea in the central Atlantic. Winds reached 65 mph.

DID YOU KNOW ... ALL ABOUT HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH? 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   Did you know that Hispanics are expected to be the United
States' largest minority group, with 36 million people, by 2005,
according to Census Bureau projections?
</P>
<P>
   So it makes sense that we should all learn about the cultural
contributions to the nation by people of Hispanic origins, such as
Mexicans in North America, Salvadorans in Central America or
Ecuadorians in South America.
</P>
<P>
   We're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month, Sept. 15 to Oct.
15, a period devoted to recognizing and celebrating the many
cultural and political contributions and talents shared by
Hispanics. Hispanics can be of all races and skin colors.
</P>
<P>
   The observance of a weeklong celebration was made into law in
1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat from Texas.
Congress extended it to a month in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other facts: If Puerto Rico ever becomes a state, it would be
the first state with a population almost entirely Hispanic. The 3.5
million Puerto Rican residents are U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico
consists of one main island and three small ones.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico came under
the control of the United States. It now has its own elected
government and is called a commonwealth.

CHURCH SHOOTING TRAGEDY ELICITS MORE LETTERS FROM AREA KIDS

   Many students wrote to CLASS ACTS and the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram to tell us how they felt after the deadly shooting at
Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. Here are some of
their responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the news, I was at my church and my heart broke.
I have never prayed so hard for someone as I did that night for the
victims. I feel that if we can't be safe in our own church, where
can we be safe? The church in general has been known as a place for
refuge, safety, since the beginning. That man took that feeling
away from me and everyone else. That is the most painful part of it
all for me. I will never have the same safe feeling I had before at
the church. I will never be the same; he changed my life forever. I
never thought something like this could happen so close to home.''
_ Rachael Lyn Ragsdale, junior high school student, Arlington,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would never happen here but I was wrong. You
can't even go to church without being interrupted by a maniac. The
world has a weird way of affecting people's minds. There are some
crazy people in the world. _ Stacey Palmek, 18, high school
student, Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch the news and put myself in the children's position
that were at the church during the shooting. What would I have
done? Would I have prayed or screamed or just run for my life?
Honestly I don't know what I would have done and I'm hoping that
I'm never in that situation. Thinking about what those kids went
through makes me get goosebumps all over and makes my mind rush.''
_ Sarah Hargrove, high school student, Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world is filled with hate and violence, but God can bring
good out of any situation. For example, the world got to see young
people at Wedgwood worshipping God. The Christian faith has been
discussed on the news a lot and pastors have been interviewed.
Also, this tragedy has caused many people to pray for the dead and
their families, the wounded and their families, and everyone who
was there. Many Fort Worth residents have been working together to
plan memorial services and other acts of kindness for the victims'
families. All of these actions show that goodness can grow out of
tragedy. I have to live my life as if I could die any second, I
also have to realize that wherever, whenever and however, God has a
plan for my life and is in control of my life.'' _ Cameron Leitch,
high School student, Fort Worth.

FACES: JOEL SERNA, ``JEOPARDY!'' BACK TO SCHOOL WEEK WINNER 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By MEREDITH RAINE 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name: Joel Serna.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 12.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: won the Jeopardy! Back to School Week contest.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies: reading, meteorology.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Fort Worth student was in last place, he had
wagered all his winnings, and he didn't know the question to the
final answer on Alex Trebek's game show.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jeopardy!'' show tune was playing and time was running
out, so the seventh grader from Wedgwood Middle School took a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``It is reported that on this date King George III
wrote in his diary, `Nothing of importance happened this day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Serna guessed ``this day'' was July 4, 1776. He was right.
The other two contestants, ages 11 and 12, were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He can't help but smile about the show, which was taped in July
in Los Angeles and televised nationwide on Sept. 9. He won $12,200,
plus a $5,000 bonus for having the highest earnings at the end of
the show's Back to School Week. He also won a trip for four to
Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to buy some things that I need,'' Joel said.
Translation: Nintendo 64, a television and videocassette recorder,
a few CD-ROMs and a Pokemon video game.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his winnings will go into a bank account for
college, where he'll prepare for a career in meteorology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm projected to be in the Class of 2005, but in all
probability I'll be graduating in 2004,'' Joel said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel goes through ``periods,'' as he likes to call them, where
he gets interested in a subject and reads every book he can about
it.
</P>
<P>
   And when he reads it, he remembers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have somewhat of a photographic memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel wasn't always so sure of himself, his mother, Shelia Serna,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before `Jeopardy!' he was considered a troublemaker in
school,'' she said. ``People tried to put labels on him. We had
some real tough years, and he had a real low self-esteem before
this happened.''

<P>
   CLASS ACTS student reporters review TV's latest hot shows. (Air
time is Central.)
</P>
<P>
   Show: ABC's ``Odd Man Out''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Erik von Detten.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in: 8:30 p.m. Fridays, starting this week.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? The show centers on Andrew, the only male in an
all-female family. Being surrounded by women has its good and bad
sides. Andrew, 15, understands girls better than most guys his age
as he is surrounded by the female friends of his older sister
Paige, but he is constantly barraged with stereotypes about
teen-age guys. Andrew and his best friend, Keith, try to survive
teen-age life as Andrew's sisters _ who are somewhat cruel to their
brother _ and mother comment on their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: I did not really like this show. It reminded me of a
cross between ``Full House'' and ``Ally McBeal.'' The corny way the
family deals with problems seems odd alongside all the sexual
jokes, which are neither funny nor original, and are frequently in
bad taste. None of the characters shows any kind of real emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1-10 rating: 3.
</P>
<P>
   Show: NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: John Daley and Linda Cardellini.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in: 7 p.m. Saturdays, starting this week.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about?: You've seen ``Saved by the Bell.'' You've seen
``Beverly Hills, 90210.'' What is high school like for everyone
else, though? In this show, you'll find out. A 103-pound freshman,
Sam Weir, and his older sister, Lindsay Weir, are students in the
1980s who get picked on and are always having problems that aren't
always solved in 30 minutes, like those of other TV characters.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This show has viewers walking away with a smile and
excited about what's going to happen next. The actors are very
real-to-life, and the script is well written. Some scenes for
example _ the ones with a mentally disabled child named Eli _ are
quite depressing, but the show somehow transforms this sadness.
This might sound like a drama, and it is in some ways, but other
scenes will have viewers laughing like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this show is a real treat, and I believe it will get
top-notch ratings in the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1-10 rating: 8.
</P>
<P>
   Show: UPN's ``The Parkers''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Countess Vaughn and Mo'Nique.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in: 7:30 p.m. Mondays. Premiered Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about?: Vaughn, who co-stars with singer Brandy in
``Moesha,'' takes her character, Kim Parker, off to Santa Monica
Junior College. But when her mother, Nikki, decides to attend the
same school, Kim begins to chafe at the invasion of her personal
life. There's also Twilight Zone-style narration done by Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The phrase ``canned ham'' comes to mind. In fact,
canned seems to be the running adjective for this show. Everything
from the canned jokes to the canned laughter to the cookie-cutter
characters who have virtually no distinctive personalities smacks
of LSS. That stands for Lame Spin-off Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1-10 rating: 4.
</P>
<P>
   Show: UPN's ``Grown Ups''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Jaleel White, best-known as Steve Urkel from ``Family
Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Tune in: 8 p.m. Mondays. Premiered Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? J. Calvin Frazier is a single young man living
in an apartment in the same building as his longtime best friend,
Gordon. In the pilot, Calvin is competing with his friend Marcus
for his old high school crush. While Marcus has the upper hand in
the beginning, Calvin seems to gain an advantage toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: While Jaleel does have a certain boyish charm, his
jokes and sophomoric romantic fantasies fall flat. His friendly
enemy, Marcus, is actually the most appealing character, but even
he seems a bit one-sided. The show has potential, but in its
current incarnation leaves much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1-10 rating: 6.

 By JACK EPSTEIN 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Humberto Falcao, a soybean farmer in
the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, is always looking for
ways to improve his harvest. So when he heard about gene-altered
seeds developed by U.S.-based Monsanto Corp. that were resistant to
bugs, viruses and fungus, he was eager to try them out.
 &HT;    He won't get the chance any time soon. Last June, a Brazilian
federal court judge temporarily halted Monsanto's hopes of
marketing the seeds in Brazil until the federal government can
regulate and define the rules of bio-safety. ``I believe that the
irresponsible speed to introduce the advances of genetic
engineering is inspired by the greed of economic globalization,''
Judge Antonio Souza Prudente wrote in his decision.
 &HT;    The ruling enraged soybean farmers like Falcao, who believes
ample testing shows that transgenic seeds are safe for the
environment and consumers. ``In a democracy, we should have the
right to choose new technology,'' says Falcao, who also serves as
vice president for the Association of Rio Grande do Sul Seed
Producers.
 &HT;    And what a technology it is. Falcao and many other farmers claim
that modified soybeans increase crop yields, making farmers more
competitive on the world market. Most importantly, they say it
saves up to $70 a hectare (2.4 acres) since the seeds are as
resistant to weeds and worms as a strong pesticide. Monsanto's
Roundup Ready and other altered seeds eliminate the need for a more
expensive _ and potentially harmful to the environment _
combination of toxins to fight off insects and disease.
 &HT;    But critics say the seeds manufactured by Monsanto, the world's
second-largest seed company and third-largest agrochemical company,
could accelerate the evolution of resistant insects. They say that
the spread of new genes to weeds via wind-blown pollen could lead
to the inadvertent creation of ``super weeds'' that won't die when
sprayed.
 &HT;    There is also the fear that more studies are needed to gauge
long-term health effects from eating transgenic foods. In the
United Kingdom, such products have been dubbed ``Frankenstein
Food'' and ``Mutant Grub.'' Just last May, a European Union
commission postponed a decision on Monsanto's gene-altered corn
after laboratory studies at Cornell University found that pollen
from the corn, when eaten by larvae of Monarch butterflies, killed
nearly half and stunted the rest.
 &HT;    For Monsanto, a St. Louis-based company, the stakes in Brazil
are high. Monsanto Brasil is the parent corporation's leading
moneymaker outside the United States, generating revenues of $650
million in 1998. The company plans to build a $550 million plant in
the northern state of Bahia to supply Roundup, the world's
largest-selling herbicide. ``Brazil is an important market for us
and a major global soybean player,'' says Lisa Watson, a Monsanto
spokeswoman based in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    James Wilbur, who follows Monsanto for Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, calculates that the licensing of transgenic soybean seeds
to Brazilian farmers would add $1 billion a year to the
multinational's coffers if _ as expected _ it quickly captured 50
percent of the soybean market.
 &HT;    But that would just be the beginning. Once soybeans are given
the green light, Monsanto plans to introduce into the world's
eighth-largest economy 10 more modified crops, including corn,
cotton and other varieties of soybeans.
 &HT;    Today, only three countries _ the United States, Canada and
Argentina _ commercially grow transgenic soybeans. Abot 45 percent
of U.S. soybeans are genetically engineered. That leaves Brazil,
the largest soybean producer after the United States, as the only
major grower not using Roundup Ready, which accounts for about
one-fifth of Monsanto's annual sales of $8.6 billion. Last year,
Brazilian soybean growers harvested 31.5 million metric tons and
exported $4.7 billion in soy and soybean products, according to
Brazil's Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
 &HT;    Monsanto's eagerness to sell gene-altered seeds has become a
major trade issue in Brazil at a time when worldwide transgenic
crop sales for products ranging from potato chips and microwave
popcorn to ketchup and soy sauce have skyrocketed from $4 billion
in 1997 to $19 billion, according to Salomon's Wilbur.
 &HT;    In the past year, federal courts have intervened twice after
Monsanto received approval by the federal government to sell
transgenic soybeans, and two farm-state governors have vowed to
make their areas ``transgenic free.''
 &HT;    In recent months, Rio Grande do Sul Governor Olivio Dutra has
halted transgenic seed production at 79 experimental sites,
claiming the farms lacked proper environmental-impact studies. Rio
Grande do Sul is Brazil's third-largest soybean-producing state
with a harvest of 4.2 million metric tons in 1998.
 &HT;    In Mato Grosso, Brazil's second-leading soy producer at 7
million metric tons annually, state congressman Gilney Viana has
called for an official investigation into transgenic products. Next
door in Mato Grosso do Sul, a state with 42 experimental corn
plots, Governor Jose Orcinio dos Santos has called for a five-year
moratorium on gene-altered seeds.
 &HT;    The press has also questioned Monsanto's right to patent its
seeds. Under the headline ``Genetic Bomb,'' a recent editorial in
the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil criticized Monsanto for forcing U.S.
farmers to sign patent agreements not to save seeds from one
harvest to the next. ``Transgenic soybeans would be economically
disastrous, joining the most important sector of our agricultural
exports to one or two suppliers with a world monopoly on seeds,''
the editorial read.
 &HT;    Even some soybean farmers have questioned the wisdom of selling
transgenic crops to Europe, which is Brazil's largest buyer of
soybean oil, clamoring for conventionally grown soybeans: ``Each
week, we exchange information with Europeans who tell us stories
about mad cow disease and tainted Coca-Cola,'' says Antonio Wustin,
president of Rio Grande do Sul's 6,500-member Cotrimaio
Agricultural Cooperative. ``They are afraid of transgenic
products.''
 &HT;    Rio Grande do Sul Agriculture Secretary Jose Hermeto Hoffman
argues that banning transgenic crops makes good economic sense
because Europeans are willing to pay more for conventional
soybeans. Over the last few months, he has received several
delegations from Europe's largest supermarket chains and food
producers, including France's Carrefour and the United Kingdom's
Tesco, Marks &AMP; Spencer, and United Biscuit. Each has told him that
they are willing to pay a higher premium for non-altered soybeans.
 &HT;    ``Brazil has the historic opportunity to become the world's
largest producer of conventional soybeans,'' Hoffman says. ``That
would give us a captive market.''
 &HT;    Yet farmers like Falcao doubt Europeans will pay that much more
for conventional soybeans. He says state farmers are so anxious to
use transgenic seeds that they are buying them from door-to-door
salesmen from neighboring Argentina, where the seeds are legal. He
says farmers have already planted 642,000 acres, or 30 percent of
the state's crop, with contraband seeds.
 &HT;    In the meantime, the trade war continues. Monsanto has appealed
Judge Souza Prudente's ruling and expects to sell Roundup Ready
seeds and Roundup herbicide for the 1999/2000 planting season,
which begins this fall. ``We are working through the appropriate
channels to ensure that the process moves forward,'' Monsanto's
Watson says.
 &HT;    Agriculture Secretary Hoffman is fighting it, launching a media
blitz on radio and television warning soybean farmers that the
state will confiscate transgenic seeds. He has also set up
inspection offices and checkpoints in every municipality and four
state laboratories to detect and eliminate any transgenic residuals
from suspect crops. ``We will wipe out transgenic soybeans by early
next year,'' Hoffman predicts.
 &HT;    Falcao thinks that's wishful thinking. ``If the authorities
insist on banning it,'' he says, ``they will have to build a Berlin
Wall around our borders.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO _ Humberto falcao, cultivador de soya en el
estado de Rio Grande do Sul, siempre busca formas de mejorar la
cosecha. Cuando se entero que la firma estadounidense Monsanto
Corp. produce semillas alteradas geneticamente, resistentes a los
insectos, virus y hongos, decidio probarlas.
 &HT;    Pero no podra hacerlo por ahora. En junio pasado, un juez
federal brasileno dejo en vilo los planes de Monsanto de
comercializar las semillas en Brasil hasta que el gobierno federal
regule y defina las normas de seguridad biologica. ``Creo que la
rapidez irresponsable con que se quieren adoptar los avances de la
ingenieria genetica se debe a la codicia de la globalizacion
economica,'' escribio el juez Antonio Souza Prudente al dictar su
fallo.
 &HT;    La decision puso en ascuas a los cultivadores como Falcao, quien
piensa que las numerosas pruebas demuestran que las semillas
transgenicas son seguras para el medio ambiente y para los
consumidores. ``En una democracia, debemos tener el derecho de
escoger una nueva tecnologia,'' dice Falcao, vicepresidente de la
Asociacion de los Productores de Semillas de Rio Grande do Sul.
 &HT;    Y en este caso se trata de una tecnologia util. Falcao y muchos
otros agricultores afirman que los granos de soya modificados
aumentan el rendimiento de las cosechas y la capacidad de
competencia de los cultivadores en el mercado mundial. Lo que es
mas importante, dicen que con esa tecnologia ahorrarian hasta US$70
por hectarea, ya que como las semillas Roundup Ready de Monsanto
son resistentes a las plagas no hay que usar plaguicidas fuertes
que posiblemente danen el entorno.
 &HT;    Pero los criticos dicen que las semillas de Monsanto podrian
acelerar la evolucion de insectos resistentes y ``superhierbas''
resistentes a la fumigacion.
 &HT;    Tambien se piensa que hacen falta mas estudios para medir los
efectos a largo plazo sobre la salud de las personas que coman
alimentos transgenicos. En el Reino Unido, esos productos han
recibido el apodo de ``la comida de Frankenstein.'' En mayo pasado,
una comision de la Union Europea aplazo una decision sobre el maiz
geneticamente alterado de Monsanto cuando en estudios de
laboratorio de la Universidad de Cornell el polen del maiz mato a
casi la mitad de las larvas y las monarca que lo comieron, y
atrofio al resto.
 &HT;    Monsanto, con sede en St. Louis, tiene un gran interes en
Brasil. Monsanto Brasil es la principal fuente de ingresos de la
empresa fuera de Estados Unidos, con utilidades de US$650 millones
en 1998. La compania planea construir una planta de US$550 millones
en el estado de Bahia para suministrar Roundup, el herbicida de mas
venta a nivel mundial. ``Brasil es un mercado importante para
nosotros y un importante productor internacional de soya,'' dice
Lisa Watson, portavoz de Monsanto en Washington.
 &HT;    James Wilbur, que le sigue la pista a Monsanto para Salomon
Smith Barney en Nueva York, calcula que vender las licencias de las
semillas de soya transgenicas a los agricultores brasilenos
aportaria US$1.000 millones al ano a la multinacional si, como se
espera, capta rapidamente el 50 por ciento del mercado de la soya.
 &HT;    Pero eso solo seria el principio. Cuando se de luz verde a las
semillas de soya, Monsanto piensa introducir en Brasil 10 cultivos
modificados mas, entre ellos maiz, algodon y otras variedades de
soya.
 &HT;    Hoy solo tres paises (Estados Unidos, Canada y Argentina)
cultivan soya transgenica con propositos comerciales. Alrededor del
45 por ciento de la soya producida en EU pasa por un proceso de
ingenieria genetica. Brasil, el mayor productor de soya despues de
EU, es el unico gran cultivador que no usa Roundup Ready, que
genera un quinto de las ventas anuales de Monsanto, de US$8.600
millones. En 1998 los productores brasilenos de soya cosecharon
31,5 millones de toneladas metricas y exportaron US$4.700 millones
en soya y subproductos segun el Ministerio de Industria y Comercio.
 &HT;    El plan de Monsanto de vender semillas alteradas geneticamente
se ha convertido en una polemica cuestion comercial en Brasil en
momento que las ventas mundiales de cultivos transgenicos para
productos como hojuelas de papa, palomitas de maiz, salsa de tomate
y salsa de soya se han disparado de US$4.000 millones en 1997 a
US$19.000 millones, indica Wilbur, de Salomon.
 &HT;    El ano pasado, los tribunales federales de Brasil intervinieron
dos veces despues que Monsanto recibio la aprobacion de Brasilia
para vender soya transgenica, y dos gobernadores de estados
agricolas han prometido que permitiran la comercializacion de
cultivos transgenicos.
 &HT;    En meses recientes, Olivio Dutra, gobernador de Rio Grande do
Sul, detuvo la produccion de semillas transgenicas en 79 centros
experimentales, alegando que no se habia estudiado debidamente el
impacto en el ambiente. Rio Grande do Sul es el tercer estado
brasileno en produccion de soya; en 1998 produjo 4,2 millones de
toneladas metricas. En Mato Grosso, el segundo estado productor de
soya, con 7 millones de toneladas metricas anuales, el congresista
Gilney Viana ha pedido una investigacion de los productos
transgenicos. Al lado, en Mato Grosso do Sul, donde hay 42
sembradios experimentales de maiz, el gobernador Jose Orcinio dos
Santos ha pedido una moratoria de cinco anos a las semillas con
alteraciones geneticas.
 &HT;    La prensa tambien ha cuestionado el derecho de Monsanto de
patentar sus semillas. Bajo el titular ``Bomba genetica,'' un
reciente editorial del diario carioca Jornal do Brasil critico a
Monsanto por obligar a los agricultores norteamericanos a firmar
convenios de patente que prohiben guardar semillas de una cosecha
para la siguiente. ``Los granos de soya transgenicos serian un
desastre para la economia porque vincularian el sector mas
importante de nuestras exportaciones agricolas a uno o dos
abastecedores que tienen un monopolio mundial sobre las semillas,''
decia el editorial. Incluso varios productores de soya han
cuestionado la venta de cultivos transgenicos a Europa, que es el
mayor comprador de aceite de soya de Brasil, y han pedido que la
soya se produzca por metodos convencionales.
 &HT;    El secretario de Agricultura de Rio Grande do Sul, Jose Hermeto
Hoffman, argumenta que la prohibicion de los cultivos transgenicos
tiene sentido economico porque los europeos estan dispuestos a
pagar mas por la soya convencional. En los ultimos meses, ha
recibido a varias delegaciones de las mayores cadenas de
supermercados y productores de alimentos de Europa, entre ellas
Carrefour, de Francia, y Tesco, Marks &AMP; Spencer y United Biscuit,
del Reino Unido. Todos le han dicho que estan dispuestos a pagar
una prima mayor por la soya no alterada.
 &HT;    ``Brasil puede convertirse en el mayor productor mundial de soya
convencional,'' dice Hoffman. ``Eso nos daria un mercado cautivo.''
Pero los agricultores como Falcao dudan que los europeos paguen
tanto por la soya convencional. Falcao dice que los agricultores
brasilenos tienen tanto interes en usar semillas transgenicas que
las compran en Argentina, donde las semillas son legales. Dice que
los agricultores ya han sembrado unas 260.000 hectareas, el 30 por
ciento de los cultivos del estado, con semillas de contrabando.
 &HT;    Entretanto, la guerra comercial prosigue. Monsanto ha apelado el
fallo del juez Souza Prudente y espera vender semillas Roundup
Ready y herbicida Roundup para la cosecha de 1999-2000, que
comienza este otono boreal. ``Estamos trabajando en los canales
apropiados para que el proceso avance,'' dice Watson, de Monsanto.
 &HT;    El secretario de Agricultura Hoffman se mantiene en sus trece.
Ha lanzado una campana en la radio y la television para advertir a
los productores de soya que el estado confiscara todo tipo de
semillas transgenicas.
 &HT;    Las autoridades tambien ha establecido oficinas y puestos de
inspeccion en cada municipalidad y cuatro laboratorios estatales
para detectar y eliminar todo residuo transgenico de las cosechas.
``La soya transgenica estara erradicada para principios del ano
proximo,'' pronostica.
 &HT;    Falcao opina que Hoffman se equivoca. ``Si las autoridades
insisten en prohibirla,'' dice, ``tendran que levantar un muro de
Berlin en nuestras fronteras.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For 50 years, ever since the Chinese Communist Party
came to power, a portrait of Mao has loomed over Tiananmen Square
in the heart of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To the countless millions who have passed under Mao's gaze, the
portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged, sturdy as
a piece of Communist architecture, no matter how drastically China
itself was being transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, so much about Chinese officialdom was kept
secret that even the circumstances surrounding the nation's most
prominent painting were considered off-limits to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a harmless step away from the zip-lipped past, Wang
Qizhi can openly admit that he painted Mao's portrait for 27 years.
Damage from sunlight and smog requires the Tiananmen portrait to be
replaced twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Chinese in the early years of the People's
Republic, Wang labored behind the scenes like an industrious ant,
following orders, suppressing all urge to show any individuality
and keeping his mouth shut about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was performing an important task for the good of the
country,'' said Wang, a slender, white-haired retiree of 72.
``There was no question about what I thought personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wang had pangs of pride when he rode through Tiananmen
Square on his bicycle and glanced up to see his painting at the
crown of the majestic Gate of Heavenly Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few of his acquaintances knew what he did, because anything
to do with Mao or his image was so politically sensitive that he
was ordered not to talk about his job. So Wang insists that his
personal achievement was always subsumed by a sense of the
burdensome importance of his daily task.
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary of Communist rule approaches on Oct. 1
and many marvel at the vast changes _ for better and worse _ that
China has experienced in a tumultuous half-century, people like
Wang express appreciation for something that has not changed, but
offers a least a thread of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese, Mao's portrait is an important political symbol
that reflects the strength and independence that China gained in
1949, even if it also embodies the nationalist pride that allowed
China to fall into a leftist frenzy in subsequent decades with
terrible damage to the nation's economic, social and political
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Mao may have so single-mindedly pursued his vision of an
egalitarian state _ and personal political power _ that he did not
seem to care how many millions died or were displaced in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even today, many more Chinese seem to admire Mao than to
hate him. A remarkably large number are nostalgic for what they
remember as the idealism and collective fervor of his era, despite
the poverty they endured at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has no equivocation; he is a diehard Mao fan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let us say a bad word about Mao in the house,'' said
Wang's son, Wang Yan, who is a painter himself. ``We have to go
outside if we want to curse Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   The son does indeed curse Mao outside, seeing the political
trauma of that era, which ended with Mao's death in 1976, as
unnecessarily damaging many of China's finest traditions, like
painting, the family avocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint in the traditional Chinese style, like my father and
my grandfather,'' he said. ``In Mao's era, traditional painting was
criticized and banned. How can that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many painters, writers and academics were attacked by the far
left during the 1960s, when radical politics engulfed Beijing. But
Wang Qizhi was protected by the authorities because there was
suddenly so much demand for his work, since Mao's portrait was
plastered all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Every major workplace in Beijing wanted its own original, and
they had to be painted by Wang or the one other man officially
approved to produce portraits of the Great Helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things were really busy, he would paint the bottom half
and I would paint the top,'' Wang said. ``We put a scaffolding
across the middle. The wart on Mao's chin marked the halfway
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, after Wang had already been painting Mao portraits for
15 years, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that
the portrait be changed, apparently under pressure from radical Red
Guards who objected that the partial side view of Mao showed only
one of his ears, suggesting that he was listening to only one
political faction.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it may sound funny that members of an intensely
intolerant group insisted that their leader be portrayed as
even-eared. But the portrait that was adopted that year remains the
version that has hung in Tiananmen Square for more than 30 years
and is still there today.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was deeply upset in 1989, though he was retired by
then, when three men in the Tiananmen protest movement splashed
paint on Mao's portrait, a move denounced by most student
protesters at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defacing the portrait is a crime,'' Wang said gravely. ``They
should have received the harshest punishment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the record, the three men _ a bus company employee, a
journalist and a schoolteacher, all from Mao's home province of
Hunan _ were sentenced to prison terms of 16 years, 20 years and
life, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be overlooked, Wang pointed out that the task of
painting a 20-foot-high portrait is not easy. The painter must
constantly be stepping back far enough to take a look, and with
such a huge portrait, Wang had to step back 100 feet. So he was
constantly climbing and descending a scaffolding, for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as China itself takes a step back to look at itself
after 50 years, it may be hard to get a clear perspective or focus
on a nation in the middle of wrenching change from a Communist
system to a new, ill-defined one. As confusing as the outlook may
be, Wang points out that material life is far more comfortable,
just as painting the Mao portrait is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's easy,'' Wang said. ``They have this big automatic
contraption that moves up and down. Not in my day. We had it much
harder.''

professionals seeking online resources.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which is in its early stages, eventually will let
users build storefronts on the Net, develop corporate portals, rent
software and get articles and content on various subjects. It also
will provide Web hosting and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business users will have a one-stop shop with regard to
content, services and applications that fit the needs of the
business professional,'' said Eric van Miltenburg, director of
business development for the AtWork division of ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like ExciteAtHome are racing to build business-centric
portals that can generate revenue from advertising, subscriptions
and sales of services, like building e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome and other Net companies are trying to compete with
Netscape's Netcenter, which claims 3.5 million registered
small-business users.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Yahoo and Lycos announced plans to launch
business portals, and last week, Microsoft said it was jumping into
the fray. Microsoft is rolling out bCentral and eventually plans to
offer Microsoft's Office software applications, as well as Internet
access, Web hosting and other services through the site.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miltenburg said the portal will be available for all
Internet users, not just AtWork customers. He said Work.com will
compete with Netcenter, bCentral and others by offering a broad
range of business applications.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shares of ExciteAtHome rose 13 percent on speculation
that the high-speed Internet access provider and its biggest
shareholder _ AT&AMP;T Corp. _ will agree to a transaction with America
Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome shares climbed $5.06, to $43.44. Investors have
speculated that ExciteAtHome will be acquired or involved in
partnerships so that Internet companies can gain access to its
system, which delivers the Internet through cable-TV lines at
speeds 100 times faster than standard telephone modems.
ExciteAtHome President George Bell said last month that the company
has been in talks with America Online, Yahoo, Microsoft Corp., Walt
Disney Co. and Infoseek Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect (AOL) to announce a broadband initiative in
the near term, mostly likely in conjunction with AtHome and AT&AMP;T,''
said John Segrich, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Corp., in a
research report. ``We believe that a deal between AT&AMP;T and America
Online is highly likely since it would allow AT&AMP;T to monetize its
broadband assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Segrich said he believes that AT&AMP;T, the No.2 cable TV operator
in the United States, and America Online will divide ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a deal between AT&AMP;T and AOL is extremely likely,''
Segrich said in an interview. ``The vehicle is ExciteAtHome. AOL
gets the content side and AT&AMP;T keeps the access part.''

 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     Your Choice _ Dell or Gateway 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I am replacing my old 486 with a new Pentium III system. I have
narrowed my choices down to Dell and Gateway. I have read magazine
reviews and asked friends for their opinions, and now I am more
confused than ever. I get stuff like: ``Dell is expensive'';
``Gateway service sucks`'; ``Dell this, Gateway that.'' I'm leaning
toward Gateway, but I'd like to get your take on that company's
computers, especially on their performance, and how they compare to
Dell's.
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Gateway is one of the largest PC-makers in the world and the
second-largest direct seller behind Dell. But where Dell has
focused primarily on the business market, Gateway makes a concerted
effort to sell computers to consumers, and it has generated lots of
public awareness through its TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? There's almost no difference technically between
a Gateway computer and a comparable Dell. That's because neither
company actually makes the PCs. They take parts like hard drives
and chips from other companies, put them in boxes and slap their
nameplates on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dell and Gateway offer good service and technical support,
although Dell generally gets higher marks in surveys done by trade
magazines. In the final analysis, however, you probably should make
your choice based on who offers the best deal.  &LR; sh  &LR; Keyboards for
Kids
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My question is, with the flurry of computer software targeted at
children under the age of 3, why is no hardware made for them?
Specifically, kid-size keyboards. Do you know of a company that
makes them? I'd like to get one for my soon-to-be 3-year-old
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If you're looking for keyboards with big, colorful keys, two you
might consider are My First Keyboard from KidTech, which costs
$59.95, and Big Keys Plus from Greystone Digital, which goes for
about $135.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't tried either one, so I can't give a recommendation.
For more information, including photos of the keyboards, go to
www.kidtech.com and www.bigkeys.com. To tell the truth, I feel a
little bit uneasy about the whole idea of a 3-year-old using a
computer. I suppose it's the wave of the future, but it seems to me
that toddlers would be better off playing in the park and learning
about the world around them, rather than trying to figure out a
machine that probably will be obsolete by the time they're
teenagers. If readers have any thoughts on this issue, please send
them.

The Cookie Jar
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to delete cookie files from my hard drive? I
notice a folder where cookie files are placed. Are there any
ramifications if I do that? I realize that I'll probably just pick
up more next time I visit a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to the Cookies folder inside the Windows
folder on your hard drive. This is where you'll find all the
cookies you've collected while surfing the Web using Microsoft
Internet Explorer. Netscape puts its cookies in a file called
Cookies.txt.

   Just to bring Internet novices up to speed, cookies are small

 Few Companies Divvying Up the Inkjet-Printer Pie  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Compared with the PC marketplace, the inkjet-printer market is
remarkably concentrated. According to figures provided by analyst
Paula Bursley of Dataquest, just six companies accounted for about
98.6 percent of sales of sub-$150 inkjet printers in the United
States in the first half of this year.
<P>
   Among those six companies, according to Bursley, Hewlett-Packard
accounts for 35 percent of the total, and that doesn't even include
Apollo, a separate group HP set up this year to cater to the $50
printer market.
</P>
<P>
   Canon has a 30 percent share, but it's been losing ground at the
low end to Lexmark, which now accounts for 18.5 percent with its
own products, plus another 4.3 percent through Compaq. Epson, which
has only a couple of models under the $150 limit and none below
$100, has an 8.9 percent share, while Xerox brings up the rear with
just under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among these companies, Canon and Lexmark dominate the under-$100
category, though both also offer higher-priced models. HP (aside
from its new Apollo venture) and Epson have shied away from the
very low end, where profit margins _ if any _ are minuscule.
Instead, they've focused heavily on higher-performance,
higher-quality models that sell for $150 to $300, as well as
business-oriented models that carry even higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a large discrepancy in average selling prices.
According to figures cited by Pradeep Jotwani, senior vice
president of marketing for HP's Inkjet Imaging Solutions business,
the average price for HP inkjets is about $280, and Epson's is
similar, while the equivalent figures for Lexmark and Canon are
below $200.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relative concentration of the inkjet industry,
prices have declined dramatically in recent years. Jotwani put the
rate at 16 to 18 percent per year for each of the past three years,
and he said there's no letup in sight.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1996, according to Dataquest's Bursley, sub-$150
units accounted for less than three-quarters of 1 percent of total
U.S. inkjet sales. In the first half of 1999, they represented
about 40 percent of all units sold, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With prices this low, it's no surprise that the inkjet market is
beginning to see the printer as equivalent to the ``free PC''
movement: Under a recent deal between Lexmark and Juno, a New York
Internet service provider, customers who sign up with Juno for a
year are eligible for rebates of up to $200 on Lexmark printers _
enough to cover the full cost of the company's best-selling models.

 _ SF CHRON   Impressive New Printers Offer a Bewildering Variety of Affordable 
 Models 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If you've purchased a PC lately, you probably know the routine:
<P>
   A printer is bundled with the computer, or the ads tout printers
with ultra-low prices. But as soon as you've picked your PC, the
clerk begins to ``upsell'' you, explaining why the cheap printer
isn't really a bargain and how you really need to spend an extra
$100 or more on a better model.
</P>
<P>
   But once you start to consider the alternatives, things quickly
get complicated. If the clerk has his patter down, you'll be
bombarded with numbers and acronyms, plus terms and technologies
you never heard of _ Micro Piezo, PhotoREt, IEEE 1284 and plenty
more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, today's printers generally deliver excellent-quality
output at astonishingly low prices compared with just a few years
ago. But picking the model that's best for you can be almost as
confusing as choosing a PC.
</P>
<P>
   So before you embark on the process, it pays to arm yourself
with some basic knowledge about the printer market, plus some tips
on sensible shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of all printers made today, and upward of 90
percent of those sold for home use, are inkjet models. Dot-matrix
technology, the standard for low-cost printers through the 1980s,
is now limited almost entirely to devices that print multipage
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Inkjet devices form words and images by squirting tiny droplets
of ink at the paper. Usually, this is done by heating the ink to
the boiling point, until it bursts through a tiny nozzle. One major
printermaker, Epson, relies on a pistonlike mechanism to force the
ink onto the page.
</P>
<P>
   And to print as fast as modern inkjets do _ anywhere from 3 to
12 pages per minute for draft-mode text _ they have to do their
squirting in a hurry: Hewlett-Packard's latest model, for example,
produces about 7.3 million droplets per second.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all inkjet printers made today are capable of color
output. Most have two separate cartridges, one for black ink and a
separate one for cyan, magenta and yellow inks. (Sometimes each
color gets its own cartridge.) The black ink is used for text,
while all four colors may be used in printing graphics. The
advantage of a separate black cartridge is that most people use
much more black than any other color; if there's a separate black
cartridge, you can replace that when it runs dry without wasting
unused color ink.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of a printer's output is a function of many
variables. One rough indicator is ``resolution'' _ the number of
dots per inch. The cheapest inkjets made today have base
resolutions of 360 dpi, and most deliver at least 600 dpi. Those
with the highest resolution, such as Epson's Color Stylus 660, can
produce up to 1,440 dpi. That's overkill for text, but the extra
resolution does help Epson earn top ratings at printing digital
images.
</P>
<P>
   Not all dots are created equal, though _ some are a lot neater
than others. Part of the problem is that squirting a liquid tends
to produce splatter and ``bleeding'' around the edges of the dot,
which translates into rough edges around letters.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to see this phenomenon directly unless you
use a magnifying glass. But even with the naked eye, you probably
will notice the resulting difference in overall quality between
better and worse inkjets. And only the very best inkjet output is
as crisp as what office laser printers produce.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, inkjet printermakers nowadays do a pretty
good job of managing the splatter problem, and only the fussiest of
readers will quarrel with the quality of text printed on most of
today's models, at least when it's done in high-quality mode.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their standard text-and-graphics models, some
manufacturers offer models optimized for printing images: Alongside
its best-selling DeskJet line, for example, Hewlett-Packard has a
separate series called PhotoSmart (such as the $399 PhotoSmart
P1000), while Epson complements its general-purpose Stylus Color
series with models called Stylus Photo (such as the $249 Stylus
Photo 750).
</P>
<P>
   In past years, these photo-optimized models delivered image
quality that the standard models couldn't match. Today, thanks to
steady improvements in image quality from the mainstream models,
the difference is no longer so dramatic. In fact, HP now uses the
same print engine in its new PhotoSmart models and in its
top-of-the-line, general-purpose model; the difference is not in
output quality, but in extra features in the PhotoSmart series to
simplify connections with digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of spectrum, for those who don't need color
printing, it might be worth considering a laser printer (or an
equivalent technology called LED printing). Laser printers
generally are faster and quieter than inkjets; consumables are less
expensive per page. Best of all, the text they produce looks great
and it's less susceptible to smudging and fading.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, laser printers haven't sold well in the home
market, for one obvious reason: They've been much more expensive
than inkjets. But that gap has narrowed in recent years, at least
for entry-level lasers. Oki's new 6-page-per-minute OkiPage 6w, for
example, starts at just more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option that's well worth considering if you're
setting up a home office or other small office, is what's known as
a ``multifunction'' machine _ one that combines a scanner/copier
and in some models a fax machine with a printer (either laser or
inkjet) in one unit. Hewlett-Packard markets multifunction devices
under the OfficeJet brand. Xerox, Brother, Panasonic and many
others also offer competitive models.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, these machines are more expensive than a simple
printer _ they generally start at about $300 _ but they cost less
than buying separate peripherals for each function, and of course
they take up less space. In past years, you often sacrificed
printer and scanner quality for the convenience of an all-in-one
approach, but that's not necessarily true these days.
</P>
<P>
   For most home users buying a new PC, however, the choice is
between an ultra-low-cost _ sub-$100 _ inkjet and spending an extra
$50 to $150 for a higher-priced model. What do you lose by settling
for the cheapest models, and what do you stand to gain by spending
more?
</P>
<P>
   There's one notable disadvantage to the ultra-inexpensive models
often bundled with low-cost PCs, including the Canon BJC-1000 and
-2000 and the Lexmark Z11 and 1100: These printers hold only one
cartridge at a time. Typically, they come with a three-color (cyan,
magenta and yellow) cartridge. To produce black text and graphics,
they combine those three shades.
</P>
<P>
   There are several problems with that approach: Printing text
takes much longer when the printer has to apply three colors. The
black produced by combining colors often looks grayish. The edges
of the letters are often a little rough. And your color cartridge
will run dry in a hurry if you're printing a lot of text.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you can replace the three-color cartridge with an
all-black one. That's pretty easy to do, but it typically will set
you back $20 or $30 _ which isn't chump change when you're talking
about a printer that costs only $49 or $69 to begin with. Besides,
whenever you want to include color in your documents, you'll have
to go back to the three-color cartridge _ assuming that it hasn't
dried out while you were using the black one!
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid these issues by going up a step or two in product
line: The Lexmark 3200 ($149 before $50 rebate) and Canon's
BJC-5100 ($179 before $30 rebate) and BJC-6000 ($229 before $50
rebate), as well as the HP DeskJet 612C ($129 before $30 rebate)
and the Epson Stylus Color 660 ($159 before $30 rebate) all have
dual-cartridge designs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond models like those, you can of course spend more. Epson
and HP, for example, offer several models in the $150 to $300
range, and their respective top-rated models, the Stylus Color 900
and the DeskJet 970C, both are priced at $399.
</P>
<P>
   What do those premium prices buy? Often, you'll get somewhat
superior quality from the higher-priced models, and more expensive
models have higher monthly ``duty cycles'' _ that is, they're
designed to hold up under heavier printing loads.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest differentiator, however, is speed. Epson's Stylus
Color 900, for example, can print 12 pages of text per minute in
either draft or normal mode, according to the company; HP rates the
DeskJet 970C at a similar 12 ppm in ``EconoFast'' mode and 6.5
pages per minute in normal mode.
</P>
<P>
   In confronting these purchasing choices, the key is to focus on
how you actually intend to use the printer. If you'll be printing
lots of images _ snapshots from a digital camera, for example _
give top priority to image quality.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home users, however, still print mostly
text, notes Charles LeCompte, editor of an industry newsletter
called the Hard Copy Observer. In that case, text quality should be
the critical issue.
</P>
<P>
   Most families simply don't print many pages, so duty cycles and
speed aren't critical. But if you're running a home business and
plan to crank out letters or flyers by the hundreds, it makes sense
to pay for extra performance and robustness in the form of a
higher-priced inkjet or, if you never expect to use color, a laser
printer.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Visa May Cut 140 Workers in Foster City  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Credit card giant Visa International made official yesterday a
far-reaching reorganization that will cost up to 140 jobs at the
Foster City association.
<P>
   Visa officials provided few details on the job cuts, other than
to say that the association is notifying employees who are losing
their jobs and expects to finish handing out pink slips by
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The association's board approved the plan late last week. The
Chronicle reported Visa International's plans to reorganize earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   While partly designed to cut costs, the restructuring also is
directed toward giving more power to Visa's six worldwide
affiliates. ``They're going to allow each region to decide what
services are appropriate,'' said Pete Hisey, editor of the trade
newsletter Credit Card News.
</P>
<P>
   Those affiliates, including the powerful Visa U.S.A.
organization that oversees credit and debit card programs in the
United States, may, in turn, give the banks that issue cards
greater flexibility in customizing the products they offer.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean Visa cards will no longer be cookie-cutter
products, in which the 21,000 banks worldwide that issue cards
offer nearly identical features and enhancements. Customers would
have a wider array of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for example, all Gold credit card programs worldwide
must offer customers insurance on rented cars. Under the new setup,
the regional Visa organizations may permit issuers to offer Gold
cards that drop auto rental insurance and, instead, offer any
combination of features they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more opportunity for competition and
differentiation of card products at the bank level,'' said Visa
U.S.A. President Carl Pascarella.
</P>
<P>
   Under Visa International's plan, basic services needed by
issuers around the world, such as a standard setting that ensures
Visa cards can be used globally, would remain with a central
organization dubbed ``The Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Other functions, such as transaction processing, will be housed
in a new unit called ``Shared Services.'' Banks will be able to buy
services from the unit on a fee-for-services basis instead of the
one-size-fits-all assessment currently charged. That will let some
banks dramatically reduce Visa membership costs.
</P>
<P>
   Visa International's reorganization is the product of a gradual
power shift that has witnessed giant U.S. credit card issuers, such
as Chicago's Bank One and North Carolina's Bank of America,
increase their clout in the organization to the point that they now
call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   The big banks are demanding lower fees and more ability to
tailor products, so that they can make their offerings stand out in
the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, Visa lorded over its members,'' said Hisey.
``Now, the big ones are saying, `We don't need you so much.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new system also reflects gains for Visa U.S.A. in its
long-running power struggle with its parent, Visa International. As
a result of the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., which represents more
than 50 percent of global credit card volume, will get more
authority and divert less of its revenue to the international unit.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Visa U.S.A. said marketing and product management
chief Michael Beindorff has resigned to become chief operating
officer of PlanetRx.com, a South San Francisco Internet drugstore.
Beindorff, who joined Visa after 14 years as a marketing executive
for Coca-Cola, oversaw Visa U.S.A.'s highly successful ``It's
everywhere you want to be'' ad campaign.

 _ SF CHRON   Kenneth Derr to Relinquish Reins of Chevron 
 &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In a move that could set the stage for new merger talks, Kenneth
Derr announced yesterday that he will retire at the end of December
after 11 years as chairman and chief executive of Chevron Corp.
<P>
   Vice Chairman Dave O'Reilly, long seen as Derr's chosen
successor, will ascend to the top spot of America's third-largest
oil company on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very easy transition,'' said Eugene Nowak,
an analyst with ABN AMRO in New York. ``O'Reilly has been the heir
apparent for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street gave a thumbs-up to the announcement. Despite a down
day for the Dow Jones industrial average, Chevron gained 56 cents
to close at $88.19.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the company's San Francisco
headquarters, Derr, 63, dismissed suggestions that his retirement
is related to undergoing surgery last year for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to say everything looks very, very good,'' he said
of his health. ``All the signs are positive, and the cancer had no
impact on my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Derr added that he is looking forward to spending more time with
his grandchildren and ``maybe play a little more golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Fischer, an analyst with Burnham Securities in New York,
speculated that Derr's exit was timed to demonstrate a clear sense
of direction prior to a November meeting with oil-industry experts
in the financial community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron takes such meetings seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a wave of industry consolidation, including the pending
merger of heavyweights Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., analysts will
be looking for a fresh intent on Chevron's part to explore new
strategic partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Merger talks with Texaco Inc. collapsed in June amid reports
that the two sides could not agree on who would head the combined
company. Derr was said to have insisted that 52-year-old O'Reilly
be boss, while Texaco CEO Peter Bijur, 56, wanted that decision to
be made later.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, had it come to pass, would have been worth about $40
billion, or roughly half the Exxon-Mobil marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York, saw
O'Reilly's promotion as a clean-slate opportunity for Chevron to
reopen talks with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was O'Reilly, and I wanted to start with a bang, on
January 1, I would call Peter Bijur and say `happy new year' and
`let's talk,''' Gheit said.
</P>
<P>
   ABN's Nowak agreed that a Chevron-Texaco merger remains a
possibility. ``There's a 1-in-3 chance it could be resurrected,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly gets high marks from industry observers for his
leadership and grasp of issues. He has been with Chevron since
1968, when he joined the company as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Among other assignments, O'Reilly has served as manager of
Chevron's El Segundo refinery and president of Chevron Products
Co., overseeing the subsidiary's refining and marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed vice chairman and director last November as
Derr groomed him for eventual succession.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, O'Reilly said yesterday that he intends to
concentrate on improving shareholder returns and to be ``very
focused on the business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how his management style differs from Derr's, Dublin-born
O'Reilly said, ``I tend to be impatient at times.''
</P>
<P>
   With crude oil prices now more than twice as high as a year ago,
he is unlikely to have trouble keeping his temper in check when
Chevron reports its third-quarter earnings in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company said its second-quarter income fell 39
percent from a year before to $350 million. Nearly half of the
decline was attributed to troubles at Chevron's Richmond refinery,
which was rocked by an explosion in March.
</P>
<P>
   California safety regulators hit the company earlier this month
with a $30,000 fine in connection with the blast.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said the Richmond facility has been repaired ``to a
large extent'' and that the refinery is now operating at
approximately 85 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   He said the financial fallout from the refinery's difficulties
will prove to be ``significantly less'' in the third quarter than
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced output at the Richmond plant contributed to summertime
concerns that California would run short of specially treated
gasoline meeting the state's stringent environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chevron never took advantage of a one-time-only waiver
to sell untreated fuel at its service stations, worries of a
shortage contributed to record-high pump prices during the peak
driving season.
</P>
<P>
   Under Derr, Chevron said its market value jumped fourfold to
about $60 billion and that the company was able to increase its
stock dividend for 10 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still be a pretty significant stockholder,'' Derr said.
``I'll sleep very, very well at night knowing Dave O'Reilly's in
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In other appointments, Chevron said Dick Matzke, 62, will
succeed O'Reilly as vice chairman and that Peter Robertson, 52,
will replace Matzke as head of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Amazon to Let Other Retailers Sell on Its Site  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Amazon.com, already the largest retailer on the Internet, is
angling to become a one-stop shop for every imaginable consumer
product, from priceless antiques to customized T-shirts.
<P>
   Starting today, the online giant will rent space on its highly
trafficked Web site to any merchant willing to pay a monthly fee
and fork over a percentage of sales to Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon initiative, called zShops, brings the company one
step closer to its stated vision of being the premier shopping
destination on the Net, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has always wanted to present itself as the place to go
for anyone who wants to buy anything,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst
with Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. ``With this
offering, they can start to make that statement accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors took a real shine to Amazon's concept of a virtual
megamall. Amazon's shares rocketed 23 percent, or $14.88, to close
at $80.75. Analysts said Wall Street was enamored with the fact
that Amazon, which has so far failed to turn a profit, can sell
third-party products on its site without having to incur inventory
and shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants can list as many as 3,000 items on zShop for $9.99 per
month. Amazon will also collect a transaction fee of anywhere from
1 percent to 5 percent, depending on the sale price of the product.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, merchants gain access to the nearly 12 million
consumers who visit the Amazon site each month. Jaleh Bisharat,
Amazon's vice president of marketing, said sellers can also benefit
from cross-marketing promotions. For example, if a shopper comes to
the Amazon site looking for a Mexican cookbook, that person could
conceivably be shown a Web link to a zShop salsa merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Bisharat said merchants must stock all items they list as well
as deliver all orders in a timely fashion. The zShops program is
targeted at small companies that don't have a Web presence as well
as large retailers, such as the Gap, looking for another sales
channel on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it will launch the zShops service with 500,000 items
already listed. That's well behind the 3.75 million items sold on
Yahoo's competing service called YahooShopping. Yahoo said it had
6,000 merchants on its program as of June.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was founded four years as an online seller of books. But
over the past year, the company has branched out in many new
directions, including music CDs, videos, toys, electronics and
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Amazon ultimately wants to sell everything itself,
and the zShops initiative could provide a platform for gaining
critical market research on which products do best on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But is Amazon spreading itself too thin? ``Without a doubt,
Amazon is opening itself up to new risks,'' said Alan Mak, a
analyst with Argus Research. ``In terms of customer service, what
does Amazon do if a zShop owner does not deliver on what he
promises? Or what happens to Amazon's brand name if zShops turns
into a den of firearms and pornography?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it is taking the appropriate precautions to protect
consumers from shady merchants. For example, it will guarantee
refunds of $250 to $1,000 for shipped items that do not meet with
the buyer's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some San Francisco business owners remain skeptical of Amazon's
plans. ``I may take a close look at how this works,'' said Ken
Uyehara, owner of SFO Snowboard Shop. ``But if they're letting in
any merchant to the program, how do I know this won't become
uncontrollable for the consumer and for Amazon themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mark Luhn, owner of Jeffrey's Toys, ``I don't see this as
anything more than building a billboard on yet another road.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 3 District Attorneys Widen Allegations Against Pac Bell  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Three district attorneys who filed a lawsuit against Pacific Bell
this month alleged yesterday that the phone company is continuing
to use misleading marketing tactics to sell phone services and has
targeted low-income and minority customers for costly add-on
features, like Caller ID.
<P>
   Included in new evidence filed yesterday was testimony from
three former Pac Bell customer service representatives who said the
company encouraged them to pressure customers to buy services
without giving them complete information.
</P>
<P>
   The former employees also said they were encouraged to target
minority and low-income groups for expensive custom calling
features.
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a Pacific Bell spokesman, disputed the charges,
saying the company does not mislead customers and provides accurate
information to every customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a reputable company. Our goal is to give people
accurate, balanced information, so they can decide for themselves
what to buy,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed by district attorneys from Alameda, Monterey and
San Mateo counties alleges that Pac Bell gave customers false and
deceptive information to increase its sales of products and
services such as Caller ID, three-way-calling and inside-wiring
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Pac Bell is violating the state's unfair-business
practices act and asks for at least $20 million in fines, plus
restitution for customers who were misled.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suit was announced, the district attorneys say they
have received hundreds of calls from customers, Pac Bell employees
and former employees to a voice-mail hotline established to take
calls from victims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Pac Bell tried to increase sales of Caller
ID by misleading customers about their ability to have their
numbers blocked on Caller ID systems.
</P>
<P>
   About 44 percent of Californians have requested ``complete
blocking,'' which prevents their own phone numbers from ever
appearing on other people's Caller ID boxes. This has hampered Pac
Bell's sales of Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that all phone companies offer complete
blocking for free. But earlier this year, Pac Bell hired a
telemarketing firm, Business Response Inc. of St. Louis, which
allegedly told Pac Bell customers that complete blocking no longer
existed or would soon be discontinued and that they would have to
switch to ``selective blocking,'' which requires callers to dial 67
before each call they want blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell canceled the contract with BRI in December and said
customers would no longer be told that complete blocking had been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But customers who called the hotline said they were told in July
and August that complete blocking was being eliminated. And former
employees said Pac Bell instructed them as recently as in May to
tell customers that complete blocking would no longer be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the information about complete blocking being eliminated
from some Pacific Bell literature that was made available to
service representatives,'' Maria Mosher, a former Pac Bell
employee, said in written testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Figueroa, who worked for Pac Bell until May 1999, said she
was instructed to assign selective blocking on all new orders,
without telling customers they could have complete blocking.
Figueroa said supervisors encouraged service reps to refer to
selective blocking as a ``free upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My new approach, which I found to be very effective, was to
tell the customer: I'm going to upgrade your service to selective
blocking, and it's absolutely free of charge,'' Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Britton denied that the company is telling customers that
complete blocking is no longer available. However, he said Pac Bell
does not have to tell customers they can get complete blocking, but
will provide information about it if they ask.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company ``did not authorize'' employees to use
the words ``free upgrade'' when referring to selective blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's filing also alleges that Pacific Bell directed
``high-pressure and deceptive sales pitches for expensive custom
calling services to the poor, the elderly, non-English speakers and
members of minority groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sales reps said they were encouraged to sell expensive
services to customers who had Universal Lifeline Telephone Service,
a discounted plan for low-income customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I received calls from welfare mothers who were about
to have their phone service cut off,'' Mosher said. ``I was still
obligated to make the same mandatory offers to them as anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosher said when she questioned management about this policy,
she was told, ``It was not our job to decide who could and who
could not afford to purchase our services. Our job was to offer
them to every customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorneys allege that Pac Bell also took advantage
of people who were not conversant in English, selling them
confusing and sometimes redundant services.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said a Spanish-speaking woman was sold a $180 Pac Bell
phone with a Caller ID screen built into it, plus a separate Caller
ID box _ two products that do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom Williams, another former Pac Bell rep, said he avoided
providing customers with sufficient information to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure put on service representatives to meet sales
goals and the financial reward incentives if they did created a
very `hard sales' environment that did not have the customer's best
interest at heart,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the company does not require employees to make a
sale on every call and customers are told about their options.
</P>
<P>
   He added that just because someone is low-income does not give
Pac Bell the right to decide whether they should be offered
additional services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not try to presuppose what services a customer may or
may not want,'' Britton said. ``Some of our (low-income) customers,
you'd be surprised, have a lot of custom calling features, and they
use them. Why would we determine that someone's not worthy of
getting these services?''  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   PC Computing Tries Businesslike Makeover 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Try to figure this one out: PC Computing is putting the wraps on
what most would call a banner year _ circulation grew to more than
1 million and it won a prestigious National Magazine Award _ and
yet the San Francisco monthly magazine is making almost a complete
U-turn.
<P>
   It's not a computer magazine anymore; any more;  &LR; it's being
revamped and repositioned as a business publication.
</P>
<P>
   It has hired art and creative directors from Outside magazine
and is shifting to such a business-heavy focus that Editor in Chief
Paul Somerson brags that it ``won't have a single picture of a
computer or a screen shot in the first 90 pages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not look like your father's computer publication,''
publisher Greg Mason says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not inconceivable that a name change might also be in the
works, although Somerson is mum on the subject and Mason is coy.
``It's an interesting question,'' Mason says, ``one we've
researched and continue to research.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they don't want to turn off potential readers
who would be drawn to a hot business book but couldn't care less
about PC computing. On the other hand, Mason notes, the existing
name ``has a lot of brand equity and existing loyalty.'' It sells
150,000 copies a month on the newsstand, he says _ twice as many as
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In tech media circles these days, the word PC is an emblem of a
withering industry _ companies give PCs away, while consumers are
using smaller, more portable devices. Meanwhile, all the
``dot-com'' advertising flocks to New Economy magazines like the
Industry Standard, Business 2.0, Red Herring and Upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every computer magazine is down in ad pages,'' Mason says.
``That's why we're going after this as aggressively as we are.
That's why Ziff-Davis is willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   PC Computing doesn't plan to tackle the New Economy books
head-on. ``We're not trying to be an Internet insider,'' Mason
says. ``We want to be a hands-on, practical magazine for
businesspeople business people  &LR; of all stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Its ad campaign will show PC Computing on a newsstand cluttered
with business magazines, with one big word: ``Huh?'' Below, Mason
says, it will say: ``Believe it. PC Computing is transforming
itself into a new breed of business magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of features ranking 100 different modems, it will
scrutinize the best airlines and hotels for the business traveler.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue that hits newsstands next month includes a
look at the 10 most wired companies in America, the top technology
mistakes businesses make, marketing secrets of the new economy and
how to outsource business services to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will have a monthly feature on how companies
supplement their workforce by outsourcing. It will have product
reviews and a ``cheat-sheet'' list of the best printers, digital
cameras and other products toward the back; and its last page will
be a feature titled Escape, telling rich geeks how they can buy a
ride in a Russian MiG Mig  &LR; or take a trip to the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A word we use around the magazine a lot is `edgy,''' Somerson
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a word heard at too many traditional computer
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will still rely on its multimillion-dollar testing
lab. With cameras and two-way mirrors, editors watch real live
businesspeople use computers, and see what works and what doesn't.
The lab can even calculate how long it takes a company to get a
return on its investment in a particular technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the untrained eye, we were just another computer
magazine,'' Somerson says. ``We figured, instead of incremental
tiptoes, we needed a dramatic change.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HERRING HOOPLA: &QL; 
Like most New Economy magazines, Red Herring is looking fat _ but
it wants to get fatter. While its November issue will have 180
pages of advertising, more than double last November's 88 pages,
the Herring is launching a $5 million advertising campaign that it
hopes will build both circulation and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Herring's campaign pales next to the $100 million
marketing effort from Cnet that you see everywhere, but Cnet is
going for the mass market, while the Herring remains a niche
publication.
</P>
<P>
   After all, reasons Chris Alden, the Herring's interim chief
executive, as technology expands throughout the business world, the
audience for a tech-biz pub like the Herring should expand as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a CEO in America today who's not thinking about
technology,'' he said. ``They need to become Red Herring customers,
and come to our magazine and our Web site and our conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of other publications make the same claims. And
the Herring ads are more about building the brand than lighting
anyone on fire: They feature simple black type on a white
background with a red border. No fancy graphics; no edgy hype.
``We're about helping you soberly figure out what's hype and what's
not,'' Alden said.
</P>
<P>
   One ad says, oddly enough, ``Our competition is trying to reach
the same people who are trying to reach us.'' Odd, because such ads
will run in magazines like Forbes and Fast Company _ which the
Herring views as competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Alden said the ad campaign comes at a pivotal time for Red
Herring, and he's probably right. Not only is competition stiff,
but the company has hired the executive recruitment firm
Ramsey-Beirne to seek a CEO to take the place of Alden's co-founder
Tony Perkins. Perkins remains chairman while he assumes more of a
role outside the company, raising money for presidential candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Stafford, who ran the company's online operations, left in
the spring after only several months on the job and still has not
been replaced. The Herring is also looking for an executive editor
to serve under Jason Pontin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ziff-Davis, which has a reported 10 percent stake in
the company, is for sale; it's unclear what kind of effect new Ziff
ownership could have on the Herring. And the company continues to
eye an initial public offering, although Alden said he's taking his
time in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going public to me is not a finish line,'' he said. ``The `I'
in IPO means initial.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VCs WITH ART &QL; 
Just because venture capitalists get to play with lots of money
doesn't mean they have no appreciation for the arts, as two
upcoming events prove.
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Other Brothers, a rock band made up of investment
bankers, software programmers and tech marketers, is about to
release its first CD, titled, appropriately, ``IPO.'' The release
party will be at 8 p.m. October 9 at the Great American Music Hall,
859 O'Farrell St. in San Francisco. The $10 admission gets you a
copy of the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art will open an
exhibition October 15 of ``Selections from the Pamela and Richard
Kramlich Collection of Media Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kramlich of New Enterprise Associates was one of the
guiding forces behind Silicon Graphics and Progress Software; now
he's putting on public display, for the first time, what MOMA calls
one of the world's pre-eminent collections of film, video and
photo-based artworks. The exhibit runs until Jan. 9, 2000.

 PRINTER BUYING TIPS  &HT;     BY Henry Norr

<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Think about how you'll really use your printer.  &LR; Compare printers
in terms of what you expect to do most. If you'll mostly print
words, don't worry about the pretty pictures _ focus on text
quality and speed. If you intend to print lots of pictures _ from a
digital camera, say _ don't just look at manufacturer's samples,
which invariably look great; instead, check trade magazines for
comparative reviews.

   &QL; 
 &UR; Get a black-ink cartridge.  &LR; Many sub-$100 printers use only one ink
cartridge, and the one they come with has only three color inks, no
black; they create black by combining three colors, a process
that's slow, sloppy and wasteful. Pick a printer that has at least
two cartridges _ one for black, one or more for colors _ or else
figure in the extra cost of buying an all-black cartridge for text,
plus the extra hassle of swapping it for the color cartridge
whenever you want to print colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Don't be bamboozled by the numbers.  &LR; Quoted print speeds are
usually for ``draft-mode'' (lowest-quality) text _ it takes longer
to produce higher-quality text and much longer to produce graphics,
especially at top quality. Resolution beyond 600 dpi is hardly
noticeable with text; with images, higher resolution tends to
improve output quality, but it's not the only important factor. As
for other numerical specifications, like number of nozzles and
droplet size, don't worry about them unless you're a professional
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Pay attention to the fine print on prices. &LR;  Advertised prices often
are based on rebate offers. The manufacturers bank on the fact that
many customers won't ever bother with all the paperwork. Remember
to request the rebate coupon when you buy, and send it in promptly.
Save copies of all documents. Expect to wait at least six to eight
weeks for payment. If you don't want the delay or hassle, pick your
printer based on actual up-front prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Don't forget the cost of ``consumables.''  &LR; Printer manufacturers
make most of their money not on their printers, but on the extra
ink cartridges and specialty paper you buy later. Text pages are
fairly cheap _ typically 3 to 5 cents per page _ but color output
can cost many times as much just for ink, not counting the fancy
paper required for photo-quality graphics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Consider the alternatives.  &LR; If black text is all you need and you
can afford to spend a bit extra, consider a laser printer instead
of an inkjet. If you're setting up a home office, a
``multifunction'' machine _ one that scans, copies and sometimes
faxes, in addition to printing _ can save you space and money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Don't forget the cable.  &LR; Printers typically don't include the cable
you need to connect your PC _ you have to buy it separately, and it
can cost almost as much as a cheap printer. If a printer-maker
recommends ``bidirectional'' or ``IEEE-1284'' cable, as most do
today, it's a good investment. If a printer you're considering is
available with a Universal Serial Bus interface, and your PC has
USB ports and Windows 98, using USB instead of a traditional
parallel-port connection may help you avoid a lot of hassles.

 Breaking the Bank: The untold story of how David Coulter
lost  BofA 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A grim BankAmerica Chief Executive David Coulter telephoned top
deputies as he was winging his way back to San Francisco from a
European conference. His message: BofA must kill its pending merger
with North Carolina's NationsBank.
<P>
   Coulter's desperate move 16 months ago came after NationsBank's
leader Hugh McColl insulted him in a private conversation, a clash
that left Coulter horrified and unable to sleep. Coulter believed
that the incident revealed McColl's real intent. To the North
Carolina banker, BofA was not an equal partner, but the latest in a
long line of conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter abandoned his revolt after lawyers told him he was
locked into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And so, exactly a year ago, the combination became official.
Sixteen days later, Coulter's worst fears were confirmed when
McColl fired him, blaming him for a $372 million loss in a risky
investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   This is the inside, and to a large degree, untold story of how
Coulter let BofA slip through his fingers. It provides a rare
glimpse of how the fate of a venerable San Francisco institution
was sealed by miscalculation, naivete and misguided trust.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on a year of reporting, including
confidential interviews with more than two dozen people directly or
indirectly involved with the takeover. Coulter declined to be
interviewed, while McColl made only brief references to his
relations with BofA's chief in an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dallas, Atlanta, Baltimore, St. Louis and Jacksonville,
Fla. _ cities whose banks were swallowed by NationsBank _ San
Francisco today is little more than a provincial capital, albeit a
major one, in McColl's empire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the bank has remained an active supporter of the
community and McColl has kept his promise to keep the new BofA's
corporate and international banking operations based in San
Francisco. But only three of the top 13 executives of the old BofA
are still with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The old BofA's proud tradition, which traced back to the
institution's founding in 1904 by immigrant financier A.P.
Giannini, has been ripped apart. ``California lost one of its
founding institutions, a bank that supported so many of the
businesses that started here,'' lamented a former director.
</P>
<P>
   The BofA-NationsBank saga began in late 1997 when Coulter and
Chief Financial Officer Michael O'Neill realized that their growth
plans for the San Francisco bank had hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had performed well during Coulter's two years as chief
executive officer. Profits had risen every quarter, thanks partly
to his moves to jettison low-return units, such as the bank's weak
branch networks in Hawaii, and invest in businesses that made more
money. BofA's stock price had tripled. And Coulter was promising
investors that he would double shareholder returns every four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, though, all was not well at the nation's
fourth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had already taken the easy steps to boost profits. Now
he faced some daunting trends: slow revenue growth amid stepped-up
competition; collapsing markets in Asia and Russia; and the need to
lay out billions of dollars to update computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had run out of ways to grow earnings,'' said one former
BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill concluded that they would miss their
performance targets unless they took dramatic action. They quickly
dismissed the idea of a major acquisition. Takeovers were too
expensive, likely to dampen earnings in the short term. The only
solution they saw was a merger with a bank roughly the same size as
BofA's $275 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was one other factor, BofA insiders said. The bank's
consumer and small business operations were a management nightmare
_ inefficient and technically backward, and service quality ratings
were poor. Fixing the retail unit was the key to revving up
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had hired former MasterCard CEO Eugene Lockhart the year
before to turn retail operations around. But in Coulter's view
Lockhart was not getting the job done and his abrasive style
alienated his colleagues. With no solution in sight, a merger
seemed the best way out.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said in an interview that strategic issues, not his
management style, were behind the merger.
</P>
<P>
   A merger of equals was the buzzword in banking by 1997. Even
megabanks realized that they had to grow larger through mergers to
be more cost efficient and afford the huge investments in computer
technology needed in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was a reaction to the huge premiums banks had been
paying to buy out their rivals, weakening future financial
performance. Under the merger-of-equals formula, banks paid no
premium for each other because neither side was considered the
buyer. They simply exchanged stock at close to market price and
combined their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill were not the sort of leaders who would try
to avoid a merger for tradition's sake. Coulter was a
by-the-numbers manager focused on financial results and performance
of the bank's stock. O'Neill was a hard-boiled transplant from
Chicago's Continental Bank who had arrived at BofA only four years
before and had no sentimental attachment to his new bank.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, BofA hired the investment bank Goldman Sachs to
analyze mergers with about half a dozen major American financial
institutions. In February 1998, Coulter and O'Neill got a go-ahead
from BofA directors.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill settled on two candidates: Citicorp, the
nation's second-largest bank, with far-flung global operations; and
NationsBank, the No. 3 bank, whose retail branch operations,
spreading from Maryland to New Mexico, closely resembled BofA's
network.
</P>
<P>
   BofA adopted the code name ``International Alternative'' for
Citicorp, signifying that it fit best with the San Francisco bank's
extensive foreign operations. NationsBank was dubbed ``Domestic
Alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   At a February 25 meeting in Washington, D.C., of the Business
Council, an elite business conference, Coulter approached Citicorp
CEO John Reed who said he would get back in touch.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed did not reply to Coulter after several weeks, BofA
switched its attention to Domestic Alternative. Citicorp would
eventually announce a merger with the insurance and securities
conglomerate Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time BofA considered a deal with
NationsBank. In 1995, under former CEO Richard Rosenberg, the two
banks came within a hairsbreadth of merging. The deal fell apart
when McColl, after agreeing to move the combined bank's headquarter
out of Charlotte, changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's mix of consumer, small-business and corporate
banking operations meshed well with BofA. A merger promised to
yield as much as $2 billion in annual savings from cutting
overlapping administrative functions.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, a short, fiery 63-year-old who bragged that his
management philosophy came from the Marines, was known as banking's
toughest predator. NationsBank's chief had presided over dozens of
bank combinations and not one had been a merger of equals. ``We
never think about giving up control of anything,'' he explained in
an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Using prominent New York merger lawyer Edward Herlihy as a
go-between, O'Neill arranged to talk with NationsBank chief
financial officer James Hance. The two drew up the outlines of a
deal at San Francisco's Mandarin Hotel on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill negotiated financial terms that split ownership of the
combined companies based on their respective market values, with a
slight tilt toward BofA because its stock traded at a higher
multiple to earnings than NationsBank's. The North Carolina bank's
shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined bank, while BofA
shareholders would get 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Hance agreed to divide directorships equally, a key
matter, because control of the board is the ultimate source of
power in a corporation. They also decided to create six top
management jobs, three for each side. McColl would be chairman and
CEO, and Coulter would be president and chief operating officer,
with all major business lines reporting to him. Coulter would have
the inside track for the CEO job when McColl retired.
</P>
<P>
   The two CFOs postponed a decision on what to name the bank. Only
on the matter of headquarters did O'Neill make a flat-out
concession, agreeing to base the bank in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had already decided he was willing to give on the
location of the headquarters, partly because he was furious over a
city of San Francisco lawsuit charging the bank with siphoning
money from municipal bond accounts, a case BofA settled for $187
million.
</P>
<P>
   Later, O'Neill negotiated a severance agreement to protect
Coulter in case McColl reneged on his commitment to back him for
the top job. Its value was calculated to be as much as $100 million
and included a pension of $5 million a year for the rest of
Coulter's life.
</P>
<P>
   McColl flew to San Francisco and joined Coulter and his wife,
Susan, for dinner at their Pacific Heights apartment March 31.
According to Ross Yockey's soon-to-be-published authorized
biography ``McColl: The Man with America's Money,'' the
NationsBank's chief was bristling. He felt that Susan Coulter was
inspecting him to determine whether he was worthy of merging with
her husband's bank.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the two CEOs flew to Phoenix in separate jets to
attend the Bankers Roundtable, an industry conference. They met in
McColl's cottage at the Biltmore, an elegant 1920s-style desert
resort. There, behind closed doors, Coulter let a merger of equals
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of April 2, he and McColl emerged with a
one-page memorandum that outlined a new agreement. The deal was now
an out-and-out takeover.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank would now control 13 of 24 board seats. Coulter
would give up the chief operating officer title and take a job
outside the chain of command, with little authority. And the
commitment to make him CEO when McColl retired was reduced to a
weak statement of intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave undid a deal that was basically done,'' said one person
familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, BofA corporate banking chief Michael Murray, strategic
planning chief Doyle Arnold, and the bank's lawyers and investment
bankers all warned Coulter that he was setting himself and the bank
up to be eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter shrugged off the complaints. He told his advisers that
he and McColl had worked out an understanding. He reminded his
lieutenants that McColl would be the CEO of the combined bank and
that it was important not to crowd him.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Coulter _ by all accounts a decent, profoundly
intelligent manager _ sign the bank away? Former colleagues said a
combination of naivete and a blind spot in judging character doomed
him.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that Coulter was utterly out of his league
bargaining one-on-one with McColl. NationsBank's chief was acting
the biggest role of his life, and he played it to the hilt.
Coulter, with little artifice, was striving for a meeting of the
minds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Southern Charm
</P>
<P>
   The merger was now on the fast track. A special meeting of
BofA's board was called for April 9. The night before, the
directors met at a private dinner at which they received a copy of
the McColl-Coulter memo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Coulter began the meeting, touting the advantages
of combining with NationsBank. He noted how much he had enjoyed
meeting McColl. O'Neill, by then the loyal soldier, gave a forceful
presentation on the deal's financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Several directors raised questions. Former Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. CEO Richard Clarke wondered whether there was a way to
keep the new bank's headquarters in San Francisco. Richard
Rosenberg asked whether Coulter should have gotten a stronger
commitment to succeed McColl as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Only two directors pressed the issue of control. Sandy
Robertson, chairman of BofA's Robertson Stephens investment banking
unit, asked whether any other mergers of equals had uneven
divisions of board seats. He was told that in almost all other
cases directorships had been split down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bedford, a blunt East Bay real estate developer, asked
Coulter whether he had been disarmed by McColl's good-old-boy
manner into giving away the store. Coulter assured directors that
he was comfortable with the proposed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Then McColl appeared. Robertson asked him whether he would
consider an equal board split. McColl noted that he and Coulter had
considered such an arrangement but decided they should divide seats
based on the relative size and market value of the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   Flourishing a copy of a biography of A.P. Giannini, McColl
compared his attempts to build a nationwide bank with those of
BofA's founder. He told directors he had never met anyone like
Coulter before. ``Maybe I can learn something from him and maybe he
can learn something from me,'' he said. He waxed patriotic,
declaring that the new institution would be America's greatest
bank, and its colors would be red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ``was his most charming Southern self. It was a masterful
performance,'' recalled one director.
</P>
<P>
   Directors approved the deal unanimously. Four days later, the
second-largest merger in U.S. banking history was announced at a
New York City news conference. McColl sported a San Francisco 49ers
cap, while Coulter donned a cap emblazoned with the Carolina
Panthers team emblem.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the merger announcement, NationsBank managers
began making decisions without consulting their BofA counterparts
even though O'Neill formally headed the transition team. More than
a month passed without an all-important first meeting of the
six-member managing committee of the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   As the first rounds of executive appointments came in,
NationsBank officers got most of the plum jobs, including heads of
personnel, public relations, and technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the first postdeal meeting of the BofA board's executive
committee, held in Portland, Ore., on May 21, several directors
griped about ``the characterization of the proposed merger in the
media and by some employees as an acquisition of BankAmerica by
NationsBank,'' according to the meeting's minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both McColl and Coulter were scheduled to go to the
International Monetary Conference in Vienna at the beginning of
June, an annual conclave of the CEOs of the world's largest banks.
David and Susan Coulter stopped to pick up McColl wife, Jane, who
spent much of the transatlantic flight telling stories about her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the conference hotel, Coulter called McColl's
room to invite him for a drink. Coulter was joined by his wife.
McColl came alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over drinks, McColl began a personal attack against Coulter, the
BofA CEO later told associates. The two also clashed then or
shortly after over the appointment of Gene Taylor, a senior
NationsBank official, as head of retail banking in BofA's old
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter was moving toward a momentous decision. Flying back to
the United States, he ordered corporate secretary Cheryl Sorokin to
call an emergency meeting of the board's executive committee. He
phoned O'Neill instructing him to hire a lawyer to determine
whether BofA could halt the merger.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, meanwhile, was on his way to Budapest with his wife on
the first vacation they had taken together in years. Hance called
to tell him he had to fly back to the United States to save the
deal. NationsBank's chief headed immediately to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At emergency meetings of BofA's executive committee, several
directors were ready to cancel the deal. But the attorney hired by
BofA, Chicago merger lawyer Robert Helman, told them that Coulter
had signed a binding contract. Walking out on the deal would be
prohibitively expensive and open the bank to shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helman said, `You've been talking about how wonderful the deal
is for shareholders and now you're going to take it apart because
McColl wasn't nice?'''
</P>
<P>
   As a fallback, committee members prepared a list of terms they
wanted added to the merger agreement, including a more specific
promise that Coulter would get the CEO job by a set date.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter took the demands to McColl, who was waiting _ and fuming
_ at the Mandarin. The NationsBank CEO said he needed to consult
with his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ultimately refused many of the demands, but he agreed to
make a videotape for distribution to employees pledging that
Coulter would follow him as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's aborted rebellion seemed to knock the wind out of his
sails, associates said. ``He knew people were increasingly upset.
He began to withdraw,'' said one BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   The next few months brought a series of humiliations. In August,
merger documents disclosed the terms of Coulter's golden parachute.
Angry BofA employees accused their chief of selling the bank to
enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coulter insist that he did not push the merger
for the money, a point they say is proved by his campaign to kill
the deal, which would have left him empty-handed. Nevertheless,
disclosure of the enormous sum he would receive if he quit left the
indelible impression of a man who already had one foot out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his standing, Coulter's publicists let it be known
that he was hunting for a house in Charlotte. And he made a voice
mail recording for employees declaring, ``I'm not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In a July 29 letter to directors, Coulter wrote: ``I am acutely
aware of the criticism, second-guessing, and in some cases,
hostility, you may have encountered since we announced the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of you, I am sometimes discouraged by this,'' he
added. ``But not for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, a bomb blew up in Coulter's face in the form of
the bank's stake in a risky fund managed by the New York investment
firm D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw used advanced software to pinpoint subtle differences in
the prices of similar securities, buying or selling based on
statistical models showing how such securities performed in the
past. Coulter was enamored. Despite the qualms of BofA's risk
managers, Coulter lent the firm about $1.4 billion to invest for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the investment spewed profits. But as markets
around the world crashed, BofA's Shaw stake began producing oceans
of red ink. Losses multiplied many times over because the Shaw fund
borrowed heavily to finance the BofA investments.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw was unraveling, BofA shareholders overwhelmingly
approved the bank's merger with NationsBank on September 24.
</P>
<P>
   On October 1, McColl announced at a Dallas press conference that
the combination of BofA and NationsBank was official. Coulter
watched McColl's performance on a video screen from an auditorium
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Inside BofA, it was apparent that McColl was seizing on the Shaw
affair to get rid of Coulter. The new bank released combined
third-quarter earnings on October 14. The Shaw investment
necessitated a $372 million write-off, a major factor cutting
profits by half. Charlotte-based executives made it clear they were
furious.
</P>
<P>
   McColl sent W.W. ``Hootie'' Johnson, chairman of the executive
committee of his board, to San Francisco to demand Coulter's
immediate resignation. The bank announced Coulter's departure three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   McColl has scrupulously avoided commenting on his relations with
the San Francisco executive. But in an interview last March, he
offered a hint about his reasons: ``I'm very frank, very
straightforward, very candid. I also expect people who deal with me
to be the same way. I don't expect people to renege on a deal that
they've made or change their mind after they've shaken hands. You
can't stay here if you do that.''

 _ SF CHRON   Breaking the Bank: The untold story of how David Coulter lost 
 BofA 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A grim BankAmerica Chief Executive David Coulter telephoned top
deputies as he was winging his way back to San Francisco from a
European conference. His message: BofA must kill its pending merger
with North Carolina's NationsBank.
<P>
   Coulter's desperate move 16 months ago came after NationsBank's
leader Hugh McColl insulted him in a private conversation, a clash
that left Coulter horrified and unable to sleep. Coulter believed
that the incident revealed McColl's real intent. To the North
Carolina banker, BofA was not an equal partner, but the latest in a
long line of conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter abandoned his revolt after lawyers told him he was
locked into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And so, exactly a year ago, the combination became official.
Sixteen days later, Coulter's worst fears were confirmed when
McColl fired him, blaming him for a $372 million loss in a risky
investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   This is the inside, and to a large degree, untold story of how
Coulter let BofA slip through his fingers. It provides a rare
glimpse of how the fate of a venerable San Francisco institution
was sealed by miscalculation, naivete and misguided trust.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on a year of reporting, including
confidential interviews with more than two dozen people directly or
indirectly involved with the takeover. Coulter declined to be
interviewed, while McColl made only brief references to his
relations with BofA's chief in an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dallas, Atlanta, Baltimore, St. Louis and Jacksonville,
Fla. _ cities whose banks were swallowed by NationsBank _ San
Francisco today is little more than a provincial capital, albeit a
major one, in McColl's empire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the bank has remained an active supporter of the
community and McColl has kept his promise to keep the new BofA's
corporate and international banking operations based in San
Francisco. But only three of the top 13 executives of the old BofA
are still with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The old BofA's proud tradition, which traced back to the
institution's founding in 1904 by immigrant financier A.P.
Giannini, has been ripped apart. ``California lost one of its
founding institutions, a bank that supported so many of the
businesses that started here,'' lamented a former director.
</P>
<P>
   The BofA-NationsBank saga began in late 1997 when Coulter and
Chief Financial Officer Michael O'Neill realized that their growth
plans for the San Francisco bank had hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had performed well during Coulter's two years as chief
executive officer. Profits had risen every quarter, thanks partly
to his moves to jettison low-return units, such as the bank's weak
branch networks in Hawaii, and invest in businesses that made more
money. BofA's stock price had tripled. And Coulter was promising
investors that he would double shareholder returns every four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, though, all was not well at the nation's
fourth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had already taken the easy steps to boost profits. Now
he faced some daunting trends: slow revenue growth amid stepped-up
competition; collapsing markets in Asia and Russia; and the need to
lay out billions of dollars to update computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had run out of ways to grow earnings,'' said one former
BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill concluded that they would miss their
performance targets unless they took dramatic action. They quickly
dismissed the idea of a major acquisition. Takeovers were too
expensive, likely to dampen earnings in the short term. The only
solution they saw was a merger with a bank roughly the same size as
BofA's $275 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was one other factor, BofA insiders said. The bank's
consumer and small business operations were a management nightmare
_ inefficient and technically backward, and service quality ratings
were poor. Fixing the retail unit was the key to revving up
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had hired former MasterCard CEO Eugene Lockhart the year
before to turn retail operations around. But in Coulter's view
Lockhart was not getting the job done and his abrasive style
alienated his colleagues. With no solution in sight, a merger
seemed the best way out.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said in an interview that strategic issues, not his
management style, were behind the merger.
</P>
<P>
   A merger of equals was the buzzword in banking by 1997. Even
megabanks realized that they had to grow larger through mergers to
be more cost efficient and afford the huge investments in computer
technology needed in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was a reaction to the huge premiums banks had been
paying to buy out their rivals, weakening future financial
performance. Under the merger-of-equals formula, banks paid no
premium for each other because neither side was considered the
buyer. They simply exchanged stock at close to market price and
combined their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill were not the sort of leaders who would try
to avoid a merger for tradition's sake. Coulter was a
by-the-numbers manager focused on financial results and performance
of the bank's stock. O'Neill was a hard-boiled transplant from
Chicago's Continental Bank who had arrived at BofA only four years
before and had no sentimental attachment to his new bank.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, BofA hired the investment bank Goldman Sachs to
analyze mergers with about half a dozen major American financial
institutions. In February 1998, Coulter and O'Neill got a go-ahead
from BofA directors.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter and O'Neill settled on two candidates: Citicorp, the
nation's second-largest bank, with far-flung global operations; and
NationsBank, the No. 3 bank, whose retail branch operations,
spreading from Maryland to New Mexico, closely resembled BofA's
network.
</P>
<P>
   BofA adopted the code name ``International Alternative'' for
Citicorp, signifying that it fit best with the San Francisco bank's
extensive foreign operations. NationsBank was dubbed ``Domestic
Alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   At a February 25 meeting in Washington, D.C., of the Business
Council, an elite business conference, Coulter approached Citicorp
CEO John Reed who said he would get back in touch.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed did not reply to Coulter after several weeks, BofA
switched its attention to Domestic Alternative. Citicorp would
eventually announce a merger with the insurance and securities
conglomerate Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time BofA considered a deal with
NationsBank. In 1995, under former CEO Richard Rosenberg, the two
banks came within a hairsbreadth of merging. The deal fell apart
when McColl, after agreeing to move the combined bank's headquarter
out of Charlotte, changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's mix of consumer, small-business and corporate
banking operations meshed well with BofA. A merger promised to
yield as much as $2 billion in annual savings from cutting
overlapping administrative functions.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, a short, fiery 63-year-old who bragged that his
management philosophy came from the Marines, was known as banking's
toughest predator. NationsBank's chief had presided over dozens of
bank combinations and not one had been a merger of equals. ``We
never think about giving up control of anything,'' he explained in
an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Using prominent New York merger lawyer Edward Herlihy as a
go-between, O'Neill arranged to talk with NationsBank chief
financial officer James Hance. The two drew up the outlines of a
deal at San Francisco's Mandarin Hotel on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill negotiated financial terms that split ownership of the
combined companies based on their respective market values, with a
slight tilt toward BofA because its stock traded at a higher
multiple to earnings than NationsBank's. The North Carolina bank's
shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined bank, while BofA
shareholders would get 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Hance agreed to divide directorships equally, a key
matter, because control of the board is the ultimate source of
power in a corporation. They also decided to create six top
management jobs, three for each side. McColl would be chairman and
CEO, and Coulter would be president and chief operating officer,
with all major business lines reporting to him. Coulter would have
the inside track for the CEO job when McColl retired.
</P>
<P>
   The two CFOs postponed a decision on what to name the bank. Only
on the matter of headquarters did O'Neill make a flat-out
concession, agreeing to base the bank in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had already decided he was willing to give on the
location of the headquarters, partly because he was furious over a
city of San Francisco lawsuit charging the bank with siphoning
money from municipal bond accounts, a case BofA settled for $187
million.
</P>
<P>
   Later, O'Neill negotiated a severance agreement to protect
Coulter in case McColl reneged on his commitment to back him for
the top job. Its value was calculated to be as much as $100 million
and included a pension of $5 million a year for the rest of
Coulter's life.
</P>
<P>
   McColl flew to San Francisco and joined Coulter and his wife,
Susan, for dinner at their Pacific Heights apartment March 31.
According to Ross Yockey's soon-to-be-published authorized
biography ``McColl: The Man with America's Money,'' the
NationsBank's chief was bristling. He felt that Susan Coulter was
inspecting him to determine whether he was worthy of merging with
her husband's bank.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the two CEOs flew to Phoenix in separate jets to
attend the Bankers Roundtable, an industry conference. They met in
McColl's cottage at the Biltmore, an elegant 1920s-style desert
resort. There, behind closed doors, Coulter let a merger of equals
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of April 2, he and McColl emerged with a
one-page memorandum that outlined a new agreement. The deal was now
an out-and-out takeover.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank would now control 13 of 24 board seats. Coulter
would give up the chief operating officer title and take a job
outside the chain of command, with little authority. And the
commitment to make him CEO when McColl retired was reduced to a
weak statement of intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave undid a deal that was basically done,'' said one person
familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, BofA corporate banking chief Michael Murray, strategic
planning chief Doyle Arnold, and the bank's lawyers and investment
bankers all warned Coulter that he was setting himself and the bank
up to be eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter shrugged off the complaints. He told his advisers that
he and McColl had worked out an understanding. He reminded his
lieutenants that McColl would be the CEO of the combined bank and
that it was important not to crowd him.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Coulter _ by all accounts a decent, profoundly
intelligent manager _ sign the bank away? Former colleagues said a
combination of naivete and a blind spot in judging character doomed
him.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that Coulter was utterly out of his league
bargaining one-on-one with McColl. NationsBank's chief was acting
the biggest role of his life, and he played it to the hilt.
Coulter, with little artifice, was striving for a meeting of the
minds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Southern Charm
</P>
<P>
   The merger was now on the fast track. A special meeting of
BofA's board was called for April 9. The night before, the
directors met at a private dinner at which they received a copy of
the McColl-Coulter memo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Coulter began the meeting, touting the advantages
of combining with NationsBank. He noted how much he had enjoyed
meeting McColl. O'Neill, by then the loyal soldier, gave a forceful
presentation on the deal's financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Several directors raised questions. Former Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. CEO Richard Clarke wondered whether there was a way to
keep the new bank's headquarters in San Francisco. Richard
Rosenberg asked whether Coulter should have gotten a stronger
commitment to succeed McColl as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Only two directors pressed the issue of control. Sandy
Robertson, chairman of BofA's Robertson Stephens investment banking
unit, asked whether any other mergers of equals had uneven
divisions of board seats. He was told that in almost all other
cases directorships had been split down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bedford, a blunt East Bay real estate developer, asked
Coulter whether he had been disarmed by McColl's good-old-boy
manner into giving away the store. Coulter assured directors that
he was comfortable with the proposed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Then McColl appeared. Robertson asked him whether he would
consider an equal board split. McColl noted that he and Coulter had
considered such an arrangement but decided they should divide seats
based on the relative size and market value of the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   Flourishing a copy of a biography of A.P. Giannini, McColl
compared his attempts to build a nationwide bank with those of
BofA's founder. He told directors he had never met anyone like
Coulter before. ``Maybe I can learn something from him and maybe he
can learn something from me,'' he said. He waxed patriotic,
declaring that the new institution would be America's greatest
bank, and its colors would be red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ``was his most charming Southern self. It was a masterful
performance,'' recalled one director.
</P>
<P>
   Directors approved the deal unanimously. Four days later, the
second-largest merger in U.S. banking history was announced at a
New York City news conference. McColl sported a San Francisco 49ers
cap, while Coulter donned a cap emblazoned with the Carolina
Panthers team emblem.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the merger announcement, NationsBank managers
began making decisions without consulting their BofA counterparts
even though O'Neill formally headed the transition team. More than
a month passed without an all-important first meeting of the
six-member managing committee of the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   As the first rounds of executive appointments came in,
NationsBank officers got most of the plum jobs, including heads of
personnel, public relations, and technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the first postdeal meeting of the BofA board's executive
committee, held in Portland, Ore., on May 21, several directors
griped about ``the characterization of the proposed merger in the
media and by some employees as an acquisition of BankAmerica by
NationsBank,'' according to the meeting's minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both McColl and Coulter were scheduled to go to the
International Monetary Conference in Vienna at the beginning of
June, an annual conclave of the CEOs of the world's largest banks.
David and Susan Coulter stopped to pick up McColl wife, Jane, who
spent much of the transatlantic flight telling stories about her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the conference hotel, Coulter called McColl's
room to invite him for a drink. Coulter was joined by his wife.
McColl came alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over drinks, McColl began a personal attack against Coulter, the
BofA CEO later told associates. The two also clashed then or
shortly after over the appointment of Gene Taylor, a senior
NationsBank official, as head of retail banking in BofA's old
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter was moving toward a momentous decision. Flying back to
the United States, he ordered corporate secretary Cheryl Sorokin to
call an emergency meeting of the board's executive committee. He
phoned O'Neill instructing him to hire a lawyer to determine
whether BofA could halt the merger.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, meanwhile, was on his way to Budapest with his wife on
the first vacation they had taken together in years. Hance called
to tell him he had to fly back to the United States to save the
deal. NationsBank's chief headed immediately to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At emergency meetings of BofA's executive committee, several
directors were ready to cancel the deal. But the attorney hired by
BofA, Chicago merger lawyer Robert Helman, told them that Coulter
had signed a binding contract. Walking out on the deal would be
prohibitively expensive and open the bank to shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helman said, `You've been talking about how wonderful the deal
is for shareholders and now you're going to take it apart because
McColl wasn't nice?'''
</P>
<P>
   As a fallback, committee members prepared a list of terms they
wanted added to the merger agreement, including a more specific
promise that Coulter would get the CEO job by a set date.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter took the demands to McColl, who was waiting _ and fuming
_ at the Mandarin. The NationsBank CEO said he needed to consult
with his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ultimately refused many of the demands, but he agreed to
make a videotape for distribution to employees pledging that
Coulter would follow him as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's aborted rebellion seemed to knock the wind out of his
sails, associates said. ``He knew people were increasingly upset.
He began to withdraw,'' said one BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   The next few months brought a series of humiliations. In August,
merger documents disclosed the terms of Coulter's golden parachute.
Angry BofA employees accused their chief of selling the bank to
enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coulter insist that he did not push the merger
for the money, a point they say is proved by his campaign to kill
the deal, which would have left him empty-handed. Nevertheless,
disclosure of the enormous sum he would receive if he quit left the
indelible impression of a man who already had one foot out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his standing, Coulter's publicists let it be known
that he was hunting for a house in Charlotte. And he made a voice
mail recording for employees declaring, ``I'm not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In a July 29 letter to directors, Coulter wrote: ``I am acutely
aware of the criticism, second-guessing, and in some cases,
hostility, you may have encountered since we announced the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of you, I am sometimes discouraged by this,'' he
added. ``But not for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, a bomb blew up in Coulter's face in the form of
the bank's stake in a risky fund managed by the New York investment
firm D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw used advanced software to pinpoint subtle differences in
the prices of similar securities, buying or selling based on
statistical models showing how such securities performed in the
past. Coulter was enamored. Despite the qualms of BofA's risk
managers, Coulter lent the firm about $1.4 billion to invest for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the investment spewed profits. But as markets
around the world crashed, BofA's Shaw stake began producing oceans
of red ink. Losses multiplied many times over because the Shaw fund
borrowed heavily to finance the BofA investments.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw was unraveling, BofA shareholders overwhelmingly
approved the bank's merger with NationsBank on September 24.
</P>
<P>
   On October 1, McColl announced at a Dallas press conference that
the combination of BofA and NationsBank was official. Coulter
watched McColl's performance on a video screen from an auditorium
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Inside BofA, it was apparent that McColl was seizing on the Shaw
affair to get rid of Coulter. The new bank released combined
third-quarter earnings on October 14. The Shaw investment
necessitated a $372 million write-off, a major factor cutting
profits by half. Charlotte-based executives made it clear they were
furious.
</P>
<P>
   McColl sent W.W. ``Hootie'' Johnson, chairman of the executive
committee of his board, to San Francisco to demand Coulter's
immediate resignation. The bank announced Coulter's departure three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   McColl has scrupulously avoided commenting on his relations with
the San Francisco executive. But in an interview last March, he
offered a hint about his reasons: ``I'm very frank, very
straightforward, very candid. I also expect people who deal with me
to be the same way. I don't expect people to renege on a deal that
they've made or change their mind after they've shaken hands. You
can't stay here if you do that.''

 _ SF CHRON   Breaking the Bank: The untold story of how David Coulter lost

   This was not the first time BofA considered a deal with
NationsBank. In 1995, under former CEO Richard Rosenberg, the two
banks came within a hairsbreadth of merging. The deal fell apart
when McColl, after agreeing to move the combined bank's headquarter
out of Charlotte, changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's mix of consumer, small-business and corporate
banking operations meshed well with BofA. A merger promised to
yield as much as $2 billion in annual savings from cutting
overlapping administrative functions.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, a short, fiery 63-year-old who bragged that his
management philosophy came from the Marines, was known as banking's
toughest predator. NationsBank's chief had presided over dozens of
bank combinations and not one had been a merger of equals. ``We
never think about giving up control of anything,'' he explained in
an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Using prominent New York merger lawyer Edward Herlihy as a
go-between, O'Neill arranged to talk with NationsBank chief
financial officer James Hance. The two drew up the outlines of a
deal at San Francisco's Mandarin Hotel on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill negotiated financial terms that split ownership of the
combined companies based on their respective market values, with a
slight tilt toward BofA because its stock traded at a higher
multiple to earnings than NationsBank's. The North Carolina bank's
shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined bank, while BofA
shareholders would get 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Hance agreed to divide directorships equally, a key
matter, because control of the board is the ultimate source of
power in a corporation. They also decided to create six top
management jobs, three for each side. McColl would be chairman and
CEO, and Coulter would be president and chief operating officer,
with all major business lines reporting to him. Coulter would have
the inside track for the CEO job when McColl retired.
</P>
<P>
   The two CFOs postponed a decision on what to name the bank. Only
on the matter of headquarters did O'Neill make a flat-out
concession, agreeing to base the bank in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had already decided he was willing to give on the
location of the headquarters, partly because he was furious over a
city of San Francisco lawsuit charging the bank with siphoning
money from municipal bond accounts, a case BofA settled for $187
million.
</P>
<P>
   Later, O'Neill negotiated a severance agreement to protect
Coulter in case McColl reneged on his commitment to back him for
the top job. Its value was calculated to be as much as $100 million
and included a pension of $5 million a year for the rest of
Coulter's life.
</P>
<P>
   McColl flew to San Francisco and joined Coulter and his wife,
Susan, for dinner at their Pacific Heights apartment March 31.
According to Ross Yockey's soon-to-be-published authorized
biography ``McColl: The Man with America's Money,'' the
NationsBank's chief was bristling. He felt that Susan Coulter was
inspecting him to determine whether he was worthy of merging with
her husband's bank.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the two CEOs flew to Phoenix in separate jets to
attend the Bankers Roundtable, an industry conference. They met in
McColl's cottage at the Biltmore, an elegant 1920s-style desert
resort. There, behind closed doors, Coulter let a merger of equals
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of April 2, he and McColl emerged with a
one-page memorandum that outlined a new agreement. The deal was now
an out-and-out takeover.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank would now control 13 of 24 board seats. Coulter
would give up the chief operating officer title and take a job
outside the chain of command, with little authority. And the
commitment to make him CEO when McColl retired was reduced to a
weak statement of intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave undid a deal that was basically done,'' said one person
familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, BofA corporate banking chief Michael Murray, strategic
planning chief Doyle Arnold, and the bank's lawyers and investment
bankers all warned Coulter that he was setting himself and the bank
up to be eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter shrugged off the complaints. He told his advisers that
he and McColl had worked out an understanding. He reminded his
lieutenants that McColl would be the CEO of the combined bank and
that it was important not to crowd him.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Coulter _ by all accounts a decent, profoundly
intelligent manager _ sign the bank away? Former colleagues said a
combination of naivete and a blind spot in judging character doomed
him.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that Coulter was utterly out of his league
bargaining one-on-one with McColl. NationsBank's chief was acting
the biggest role of his life, and he played it to the hilt.
Coulter, with little artifice, was striving for a meeting of the
minds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Southern Charm
</P>
<P>
   The merger was now on the fast track. A special meeting of
BofA's board was called for April 9. The night before, the
directors met at a private dinner at which they received a copy of
the McColl-Coulter memo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Coulter began the meeting, touting the advantages
of combining with NationsBank. He noted how much he had enjoyed
meeting McColl. O'Neill, by then the loyal soldier, gave a forceful
presentation on the deal's financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Several directors raised questions. Former Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. CEO Richard Clarke wondered whether there was a way to
keep the new bank's headquarters in San Francisco. Richard
Rosenberg asked whether Coulter should have gotten a stronger
commitment to succeed McColl as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Only two directors pressed the issue of control. Sandy
Robertson, chairman of BofA's Robertson Stephens investment banking
unit, asked whether any other mergers of equals had uneven
divisions of board seats. He was told that in almost all other
cases directorships had been split down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bedford, a blunt East Bay real estate developer, asked
Coulter whether he had been disarmed by McColl's good-old-boy
manner into giving away the store. Coulter assured directors that
he was comfortable with the proposed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Then McColl appeared. Robertson asked him whether he would
consider an equal board split. McColl noted that he and Coulter had
considered such an arrangement but decided they should divide seats
based on the relative size and market value of the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   Flourishing a copy of a biography of A.P. Giannini, McColl
compared his attempts to build a nationwide bank with those of
BofA's founder. He told directors he had never met anyone like
Coulter before. ``Maybe I can learn something from him and maybe he
can learn something from me,'' he said. He waxed patriotic,
declaring that the new institution would be America's greatest
bank, and its colors would be red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ``was his most charming Southern self. It was a masterful
performance,'' recalled one director.
</P>
<P>
   Directors approved the deal unanimously. Four days later, the
second-largest merger in U.S. banking history was announced at a
New York City news conference. McColl sported a San Francisco 49ers
cap, while Coulter donned a cap emblazoned with the Carolina
Panthers team emblem.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the merger announcement, NationsBank managers
began making decisions without consulting their BofA counterparts
even though O'Neill formally headed the transition team. More than
a month passed without an all-important first meeting of the
six-member managing committee of the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   As the first rounds of executive appointments came in,
NationsBank officers got most of the plum jobs, including heads of
personnel, public relations, and technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the first postdeal meeting of the BofA board's executive
committee, held in Portland, Ore., on May 21, several directors
griped about ``the characterization of the proposed merger in the
media and by some employees as an acquisition of BankAmerica by
NationsBank,'' according to the meeting's minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both McColl and Coulter were scheduled to go to the
International Monetary Conference in Vienna at the beginning of
June, an annual conclave of the CEOs of the world's largest banks.
David and Susan Coulter stopped to pick up McColl wife, Jane, who
spent much of the transatlantic flight telling stories about her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the conference hotel, Coulter called McColl's
room to invite him for a drink. Coulter was joined by his wife.
McColl came alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over drinks, McColl began a personal attack against Coulter, the
BofA CEO later told associates. The two also clashed then or
shortly after over the appointment of Gene Taylor, a senior
NationsBank official, as head of retail banking in BofA's old
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter was moving toward a momentous decision. Flying back to
the United States, he ordered corporate secretary Cheryl Sorokin to
call an emergency meeting of the board's executive committee. He
phoned O'Neill instructing him to hire a lawyer to determine
whether BofA could halt the merger.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, meanwhile, was on his way to Budapest with his wife on
the first vacation they had taken together in years. Hance called
to tell him he had to fly back to the United States to save the
deal. NationsBank's chief headed immediately to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At emergency meetings of BofA's executive committee, several
directors were ready to cancel the deal. But the attorney hired by
BofA, Chicago merger lawyer Robert Helman, told them that Coulter
had signed a binding contract. Walking out on the deal would be
prohibitively expensive and open the bank to shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helman said, `You've been talking about how wonderful the deal
is for shareholders and now you're going to take it apart because
McColl wasn't nice?'''
</P>
<P>
   As a fallback, committee members prepared a list of terms they
wanted added to the merger agreement, including a more specific
promise that Coulter would get the CEO job by a set date.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter took the demands to McColl, who was waiting _ and fuming
_ at the Mandarin. The NationsBank CEO said he needed to consult
with his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ultimately refused many of the demands, but he agreed to
make a videotape for distribution to employees pledging that
Coulter would follow him as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's aborted rebellion seemed to knock the wind out of his
sails, associates said. ``He knew people were increasingly upset.
He began to withdraw,'' said one BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   The next few months brought a series of humiliations. In August,
merger documents disclosed the terms of Coulter's golden parachute.
Angry BofA employees accused their chief of selling the bank to
enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coulter insist that he did not push the merger
for the money, a point they say is proved by his campaign to kill
the deal, which would have left him empty-handed. Nevertheless,
disclosure of the enormous sum he would receive if he quit left the
indelible impression of a man who already had one foot out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his standing, Coulter's publicists let it be known
that he was hunting for a house in Charlotte. And he made a voice
mail recording for employees declaring, ``I'm not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In a July 29 letter to directors, Coulter wrote: ``I am acutely
aware of the criticism, second-guessing, and in some cases,
hostility, you may have encountered since we announced the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of you, I am sometimes discouraged by this,'' he
added. ``But not for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, a bomb blew up in Coulter's face in the form of
the bank's stake in a risky fund managed by the New York investment
firm D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw used advanced software to pinpoint subtle differences in
the prices of similar securities, buying or selling based on
statistical models showing how such securities performed in the
past. Coulter was enamored. Despite the qualms of BofA's risk
managers, Coulter lent the firm about $1.4 billion to invest for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the investment spewed profits. But as markets
around the world crashed, BofA's Shaw stake began producing oceans
of red ink. Losses multiplied many times over because the Shaw fund
borrowed heavily to finance the BofA investments.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw was unraveling, BofA shareholders overwhelmingly
approved the bank's merger with NationsBank on September 24.
</P>
<P>
   On October 1, McColl announced at a Dallas press conference that
the combination of BofA and NationsBank was official. Coulter
watched McColl's performance on a video screen from an auditorium

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tennessee may be the defending national champion,
but this season is becoming more checkered than the end zones at
Neyland Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team captains has been arrested, four players face
allegations of academic fraud and the Vols have underachieved on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to drive coach Phillip Fulmer mad, even by the nutty
standards of Knoxville, Tenn. So Fulmer took out his frustration on
a tackling dummy during Monday's practice, demonstrating a flying
body block.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely more into the practice today,'' said Bernard
Gooden, a reserve offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   A stress release, perhaps, but that won't make any of Fulmer's
problems go away. He is trying to deal with an investigation into
the Vols' academic support staff and the Sunday-morning arrest of
preseason All-American cornerback Dwayne Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer suspended Goodrich, who went from the cover of the Vols'
homecoming program Saturday afternoon to the Sunday police blotter.
</P>
<P>
   One of six team captains, Goodrich was arrested on The Strip in
Knoxville at 3:20 a.m. on charges of disorderly conduct. According
to the police report, an intoxicated Goodrich grew loud and
threatened officers when asked to leave a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do about all this, so we can't let it
be a distraction,'' said senior left tackle Chad Clifton, another
of the Vols' team captains. ``All we can do is focus on (this
week's opponent) Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer has refused comment on the academic investigation, but
wasn't afraid to comment about the Vols' lackluster 17-16 victory
over Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past aggravation, I'm PO'd,'' Fulmer said. ``We're going
to get it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick chat: So what did Washington coach Rick Neuheisel and
Colorado coach Gary Barnett talk about in the 10 seconds they stood
together after the Huskies' 31-24 victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good game, good luck ... I was going to stay and chat _ at
least I intended to,'' Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said he was ``relieved and disgusted'' about the
weekend: ``I'm relieved that all the stuff that went into it about
Rick and me over the last six months has been put to rest.... I'm
disgusted we had so many chances to win it but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the facts: Stanford is racing toward the Rose Bowl, and if
nothing else the Cardinal seems to have luck on its side. But
that's something every conference champion seems to need at some
point.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider the Cardinal's good fortune:
</P>
<P>
   _The schedule gave them lowly Washington State after a drubbing
at Texas (69-17), enabling them to regain confidence.
</P>
<P>
   _The Cardinal faced Arizona with co-starting quarterback Keith
Smith still slowed by an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   _They played UCLA without starting quarterback Cory Paus and
starting cornerback Jason Bell. The latter injury left the Bruins
starting a redshirt freshman and a true freshman at the corners,
and quarterback Joe Borchard of Camarillo High dissected them with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   _Oregon is not on the schedule this season.
</P>
<P>
   _USC will not have quarterback Carson Palmer when the teams play
Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   _Oh, and last, but not least, the conference is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Add Stanford: Troy Walters, the Pacific-10 Offensive Player of
the Week for the second consecutive week, is putting together a
video to remember the season.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Walters had nine catches for 278 yards and three
touchdowns, including a 98-yarder that broke the school and Pac-10
record. He also broke the school recordfor most receiving yards in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was afterward, with his video camera, filming all
the post-game festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Said Walters: ``It's just a little documentary. I videotape the
locker room after the game to capture the mood. It'll just be
memories of my life here. And hopefully, a Rose Bowl appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller update: Former Hart High quarterback Kyle Boller led Cal
on two late-scoring drives in its 24-23 victory over Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool. Sometimes you're standing on the sidelines and
don't think it can happen,'' Boller said. ``But anything can happen
in college football.''
</P>
<P>
   In a groove: Steve Spurrier is on the loose again. The Florida
coach has been downright docile for the past year or so, but he was
back to being the media's best friend last weekend, ripping and
quipping.
</P>
<P>
   He bashed SEC officiating during Sunday's teleconference;
wondered aloud how badly the Gators might have beaten Tennessee if
they hadn't committed five turnovers; and fired off a one-liner at
his partner in passing, Kentucky coach Hal Mumme.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier was asked after Florida's 38-10 victory if he knew
Mumme had a street named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Valdosta?'' Spurrier asked, then added: ``Does (former
Kentucky coach) Bill Curry have a street named after him, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme was the head coach at Valdosta State before replacing
Curry at Kentucky.

   LOS ANGELES _ The returning Cal State Northridge football
players all remember what happened last year in Pocatello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who was there ... we all know what it felt like,''
said Chazz Moore, a senior cornerback. ``We were talking rings.''
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN's dreams of a Big Sky Conference championship vanished
in the closing minute, when underdog Idaho State scored a touchdown
and beat the Matadors 32-29. No championship, no playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN finally gets a chance to take out a year's frustration on
the Bengals Saturday, when it hosts ISU at 3:05 p.m. at North
Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly who we've been looking for,'' Moore said. ``If
there's one game we could be strictly focusing on, it would be
Idaho State, because of what (the Bengals) did to us last year.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is 1-2, 0-1 in the Big Sky. Idaho State is 2-2 and 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Strong words: After two consecutive losses, Jeff Kearin and the
rest of the coaching staff have been vocal in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity is up a little this week,'' he said Tuesday.
``Last week was a very, very frustrating loss. There's been all
this talk about all this greatness, me included, and when push
comes to shove, we lose a game we should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now for everybody who's been talking to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinning out: Kearin is reluctant to play fourth-string tailback
Brandon McElvaine, not because McElvaine has performed poorly but
because he wants to redshirt the promising freshman from Highland
High.
</P>
<P>
   But with starter Jaumal Bradley (tonsillitis) doubtful for Idaho
State, and No. 2 tailback Alan Taylor hobbled with a knee injury,
McElvaine might be needed. Kearin also isn't ruling out playing
time for freshmen Crayton Milton (St. Francis) and Marquis Brignac
(Taft).
</P>
<P>
   ``(McElvaine) has got a shot,'' Kearin said. ``I'm going to have
Marquis Brignac ready, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat performer: Kick returner Terrence Jones, who returned
Saturday's opening kickoff at Eastern Washington for a 86-yard
touchdown, was named the Big Sky's special-teams player of the
week. Jones has earned the honor twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones returned three kickoffs for 121 yards against the Eagles.
Before Saturday, the last time the Matadors had a kickoff returned
for a touchdown was on Nov. 9, 1991, when Paul Peters returned one
95 yards against Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Factoids: Quarterback Marcus Brady broke the CSUN record for
total offense in a game with 513 yards against Eastern Washington.
Brady threw for 484 yards and rushed for 29, topping Aaron Flowers'
mark of 496 set in '96, also against Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, a sophomore, leads the Big Sky in total offense,
averaging 334.7 yards per game. Wide receiver Aaron Arnold, who set
the school record for career receiving yards last week, leads the
conference in catches per game (8.7) and is second in receiving
yards (296).
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, again: Idaho State quarterback Kevin McCarthy, a
junior who lost his job to Shane Griggs to start the season, is
back in the lineup. Griggs tore the ACL in his right knee on
Sept.11 and is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy won't be asked to do a lot against CSUN because junior
tailback Nick Whitworth is the Big Sky's second-leading rusher,
with 625 yards and six touchdowns. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO RULE OUT GROUND WAR IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian and international agencies struggled to keep
up with the tide of Chechen refugees fleeing airstrikes by Russian
warplanes, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin refused Wednesday to rule
out a possible ground war against the rebellious southern province.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that talks with the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, were still possible but only if Chechnya's elected
leaders take a stand against the Islamic militants who have used
Chechnya as a base for armed attacks against neighboring provinces,
and are suspected of waging a terrorist campaign in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government and the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees have promised to ship food and tents to the estimated
60,000 Chechen refugees who have flocked across the border into
Ingushetia since the Russian air campaign began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, refugees are still streaming across
the border, crowding into bus and rail stations, and into a single
encampment of only about 20 tents set up near the border village of
Sleptsovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on Russian television Wednesday night, refugees said
they were fleeing in fear for their lives. Sobbing, one woman told
NTV, a commercial station, that she could not understand why
innocent civilians were being made to suffer for the crimes of
terrorists they do not support.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials Wednesday continued to report hundreds of
civilian casualties caused by the bombing, but without independent
confirmation, some Russian newspapers Wednesday said these reports
were inflated. A reporter for Radio Liberty, one of the few
independent journalists based in Grozny, the Chechen capital, was
able to confirm the death of eight civilians, including four
children, killed Monday in the bombardment of a school outside
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when Chechnya defeated federal forces after a
two-year war, the mountainous region has been increasingly isolated
by a wave of kidnappings that have deterred reporters and aid
organizations from traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   The Maskhadov government, whose authority has been weakened by
the rise of independent warlords, has disavowed any connection to
the Islamic militants who last month launched armed attacks against
Dagestan, a region that lies between Chechnya and the Caspian sea.
Russian officials say that the militants, led by Chechen fighters,
are supported by international terrorist groups that want to
destabilize Russia's volatile North Caucacus region.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Russian military has moved an estimated
50,000 troops to the region to isolate Chechnya, but several
Russian newspapers reported Wednesday that the real goal is a
ground invasion that could begin within days.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov canceled a meeting Wednesday with the Dagestani
leader, Magomedali Magomedev, when the road to the meeting place
was blocked by angry Dagestanis protesting Chechen-led aggression
on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, authorized by Moscow, had been seen as a
preliminary opening for further, more high-level talks that Putin
has said repeatedly can only take place on Moscow's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about the reports of preparations for a ground
war, Putin said every tool needed to destroy terrorists in Chechnya
will be used. He said Moscow would be willing to negotiate with
Maskhadov, but only if the Chechen leaders ``finally condemn
terrorism, clearly and firmly, and express their readiness to hand
over the criminals.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In the entrance to the offices of his growing
movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper has framed a quotation
from Pope John Paul 11: ``It is unacceptable to claim that after
the fall of communism, capitalism is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the change known to Poles as ``the revolution,''
capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising
Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile
phones are de rigeur with the smart set, western cars sit in
bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the
Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of
government scandals and a crisis on the farms that still provide
about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood have enabled Lepper
to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Lepper said,
sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend
what is theirs. ``Our industry and land are being sold off, much of
it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by
murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.''
</P>
<P>
   This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but
he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured
prominently in the largest demonstration seen here for some time,
when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the
disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid
teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees whose
jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a
measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were
protesting against a Solidarity-led government when, in 1980, it
was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice.
Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first
bloodless transition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities
of government another, and Poland, like other countries of central
Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not raise
all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is
suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. A series of
apparent misjudgments by the center-right government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20
percent, has sharpened frustrations here, bringing people into the
streets and raising eyebrows in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goings-on have combined the burlesque with what has often
looked like plain incompetence. Pensioners have been left unpaid
because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left
headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been
left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world today, you go further on credibility than
anything else,'' said Wanda Rapacynski, a prominent publisher.
``And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could
impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously
unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski was forced out this
month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the
secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under
similar suspicions, a general who was head of an elite combat unit
that has worked closely with NATO also departed.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him
the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret
NATO documents.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn led acting Interior Minister Janusz Palubicki,
whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order
agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this
point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance,
former deputy defense minister Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced
out after his role under the communists was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ``velvet''
transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in
disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize
stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing coalition of the Solidarity Election Action
and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While
there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for
justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all
collaborators with the communists rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned
backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law
in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with
Solidarity. ``No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling
into holes. The danger now is one of a witch-hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Luft, the government spokesman, denied that there was
any witch hunt, but conceded that ``the longer investigations are
delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it
was ``essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to
ensure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been
exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in
recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year,
a once highly-flying stock market has been pummelled, unemployment
is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over
layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively
removing an important export market for farm goods and other
products, and cutting off what was known as ``the unofficial
market''. This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw
and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home.
</P>
<P>
   If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a government
now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international
markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social
Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of ZUS.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which
companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners
have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly
discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged
from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called for the government's resignation because of the
ineptitude evident at ZUS,'' said Marek Borowski, a leaders of the
opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ``Mr. Buzek has lost
the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of
deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for
our social crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that word of pensioners without their
paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with
wages of $200 a month has hurt the government at a time when the
conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising
Poland's newly-rich is evident to all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said this week that he was ``aware of the mistakes'', and
that he intended to listen more ``to the needs of ordinary
people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so
easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any
relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears
limited.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Lepper, who
said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make
a living, is working on building what he called ``a
peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no
longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty
line,'' he said. ``We plan to continue our street protests and, if
necessary move to a general strike.''
</P>
<P>
   For Solidarity, the wheel appears to have come full circle.
``Finding the right balance between markets and workers, between
necessary transformations and meeting the social cost, is really
not easy,'' said Luft, the Solidarity government spokesman.

RUSSIA ASKS U.S. TO EXPAND JOINT EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD NUCLEAR
FUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SITE 49, SEVEROMORSK, Russia _ Russia has asked the U.S. Energy
Department to expand joint projects aimed at securing dangerous
materials, including nuclear fuel, that could be turned into
weapons, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday on a visit
here.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the proposal incorporated an unusual provision
that would provide the United States greater access to highly
sensitive sites to which Moscow has barred foreigners or permitted
only limited entry.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which Russian and American officials said was
approved by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, was made by Adm.
Vladimir Kuroyedov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, at a
private meeting Wednesday with Richardson and his senior staff.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed a rare tour of Site 49, where the Russian
Navy stores all the nuclear fuel for its vast Northern Fleet, near
Severomorsk, the fleet headquarters, a restricted area.
Richardson's entourage was the first senior American delegation
granted permission to visit what is one of Russia's largest, most
sensitive nuclear naval bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has just completed a 16-month $10 million
security upgrade at Site 49 and at the Murmansk Shipping Co., which
operates atomic-powered icebreakers that are powered with highly
enriched fuel rods that can also be used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Six experts from several Energy Department laboratories have
spent 18 months advising the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, the
former Soviet Union's premier research center on nuclear weapons,
on improving security at the navy's nuclear-fuel storage centers.
Most were run-down and protected by little more than barbed-wire
fences and lightly armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has been working to improve the accounting
and security of such dangerous materials in Russia since 1994. But
its activities here in the Northern Fleet area began only 18 months
ago, after a deranged 19-year-old Russian sailor had seized control
of a nuclear submarine in Murmansk and held the ship for eight
agonizing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the press office at the base, Capt. Sergei
Anoufriev, said the sailor, who had passed a psychological test,
had lied about his mental history. The sailor shot and killed five
crew members before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   That case, Russian and American officials agreed, awakened the
navy to the security threat posed by insiders, rather than foreign
foes. As a result, the Russian Navy began what American officials
called a crash program to consolidate its numerous nuclear-fuel
storage centers into a single complex.
</P>
<P>
   Site 49, with 11,000 square feet of storage, can hold up to 55
tons of highly enriched uranium. Wednesday, Navy officials showed
off double fencing with electronic sensors, bright lights,
foot-thick steel doors, closed-circuit television monitors,
emergency alarms that connect to the headquarters in Murmansk and
response forces in case of a terrorist attack. The giant center,
built into a hill and painted in camouflage, is to begin receiving
fuel next week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Richardson began a weeklong tour of Energy
Department projects at several of the most sensitive military
installations in Russia. The agency spends more than $300 million a
year on projects aimed at bolstering the safety and physical
protection of nuclear fuel and other material that could be used in
bombs. It has projects in 10 of the once-secret nuclear cities at
53 sites throughout the former Soviet Union, 30 of which are in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project,'' Richardson said at Site 49, ``came in on
budget and under the planned time.''

CANADA STARTS TO TAKE HARD LINE AGAINST ILLEGAL CHINESE
IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HARDY, British Columbia _ When the Canadian navy made a
group of undocumented Chinese migrants get off a ship here
recently, a local man brought his dogs to the dock and encouraged
them to bark at the men and women wrapped in blankets against the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   For Canadian officials, the confrontation represented one
victory in what they say is a rapidly growing effort to smuggle in
illegal immigrants. This summer alone, they confiscated four
trawlers and detained 560 undocumented Chinese citizens who wanted
to make Canada their home.
</P>
<P>
   Western Canada is only one destination in a pan-Pacific surge
this year in illegal Chinese migrants. In the last 16 months, U.S.
Coast Guard ships have intercepted 20 ships carrying undocumented
Chinese in U.S. territorial waters around Guam. In the last six
months, Australia has intercepted 21 boatloads of illegal migrants,
primarily Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now experiencing the largest smuggling operation ever
experienced in Canada,'' Rob Johnston, manager of immigration
enforcement here, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weeks, an Australian diplomat in Ottawa, said of Canada's
sudden concern: ``It's deja vu. The element of the public debate
and concern is very similar to Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australia, the United States and Canada increasingly share
intelligence about vessels believed to be carrying migrants from
southeastern China, Canada has started to take the harder line
traditional in the other two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Chinese ship was intercepted, on July 20, the
authorities in Vancouver released 74 immigrants, pending resolution
of their petitions for refugee status. Within a month, half had
disappeared, presumably for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Canada has adopted a policy of detaining all
undocumented passengers on vessels from China. Sentiment for
immediately deporting them is markedly higher in western Canada
than in provinces on the Atlantic seaboard, opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's population is 20 percent ethnic Chinese, and many of
these Chinese-Canadians fear that each new boatload batters a
carefully constructed racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver is a very tolerant society,'' said Derick Y.H.
Cheng, chairman of the Chinese Cultural Center there. ``We fear
this will make a backlash, give people the stereotype that Chinese
do not abide by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Bill Vander Zalm has jumped back
into politics, starting his campaign for Parliament by saying that
the federal government would pay attention to the immigration issue
only if all the illegal Chinese immigrants detained in the region
were shipped to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure you would get some action then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers portray the boatloads of migrants, largely
from Fujian province, as job-seekers rather than freedom-seekers.
Not long ago, Elinor Caplan, Canada's new immigration minister,
toured a Vancouver Island navy base where 225 immigrants are
detained and said at a packed news conference: ``We are
intercepting, boarding and apprehending those ships. We are then
using greater powers of detention to insure people on the boat do
not flee. The system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials are also reaching across the Pacific, asking
Chinese authorities to help.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting
in New Zealand, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien discussed the
migration problem with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``I told him
we needed collaboration because they could hopefully stop the
departure of the ships from the coast of China that are coming to
our coast,'' Chretien said later. ``He recognized that, and said he
was willing to collaborate with us.''

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ind.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.

   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 121 of the 515 deaths, the study found, a parent, sibling, or
other adult sleeping in the bed had inadvertently smothered the
child. More than three-quarters of the children who died from
``overlying'' were younger than 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, say the study's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report. Death certificates, he said, also may be
misleading: In some regions, coroners may be more likely to
attribute the death of an infant from a poor family to
``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher income
families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at Notre Dame
University, has done studies indicating that infants who sleep with
their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

NICKLAUS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would like to personally thank the people of Boston and 12
talented American golfers for giving us the most exciting Ryder Cup
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final-round TV-ratings were the highest in Cup history
and we owe it all to you.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many special moments.
</P>
<P>
   Like when a fan spat in the face of European captain Mark James'
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Like that little spike-shoed clog-dance the American players so
thoughtfully performed in the line of Jose Maria Olazabal's
potentially Cup-winning putt on the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   Or the cheering when the Europeans hit a bad shot or missed a
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Or heckling Colin Montgomerie so mercilessly that his father
couldn't stand it anymore and walked back to the clubhouse after 7
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Or steering Andrew Coltart in the wrong direction when he was
looking for his ball in the rough and suddenly ``finding'' it 30
seconds after he had to take a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to win, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, these are some of our bitterest enemies, these Brits,
Swedes and Spaniards. Wasn't it Ireland that was responsible for
stealing our nuclear-weapons secrets a while back? No, wait. That
was China. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Now the British tabloids are whining that we're a bunch of bad
sports.
</P>
<P>
   United Slobs of America they're calling us. James doesn't want
to play over here anymore. Montgomerie's having second thoughts,
too.
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch of babies, I say.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it's not like Tom Lehman bashed a folding chair over
Olazabal's head or bowled him over with a flying drop-kick just as
he drew back his putter.(Though that might have been necessary if
Justin Leonard hadn't made that long putt seconds before.)
</P>
<P>
   All the American team did was ``modify'' the line of Ollie's
putt a little, sort of the way the Department of Transportation
modifies the surface of interstates before repaving.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he would have been happier if we had set out some orange
construction cones or some detour signs.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy har har.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys I was watching the Ryder Cup with Sunday
afternoon _ a person who clearly fails to appreciate how ``edgy''
golf has become _ said that if Jack Nicklaus had been in that
situation Sunday afternoon and seen the American team turn
Olazabal's line into a cattle trail, he would have given the
Spaniard his putt, all 30-feet of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, Ollie. Pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   My team, in its exuberance, thoughtlessly breeched a fundamental
tenet of golfing etiquette. I will not allow you to suffer for it,
even if it means losing the Ryder Cup. The game is not played that
way, and the game is more important than some cheesy trophy.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that Nicklaus, the greatest and fiercest
competitor in the history of golf, would have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't know is how some U.S. fans might have reacted to
Nicklaus' demonstration of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But I bet Mark James' wife has a clue.
</P>

OPPOSITION LEADERS SEEK TO CREATE A UNIFIED FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Leaders of the divided opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia are making another,
slightly desperate effort to create a common front around the issue
of early elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only moderate turnouts at their nightly anti-Milosevic
rallies, the leaders of the Alliance for Change are reluctantly
seeking a reconciliation with Vuk Draskovic, who runs the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is being pushed to do so by Dragoslav Avramovic,
the former head of the central bank who is their choice for prime
minister in any transitional government. Avramovic said in an
interview that Milosevic could too easily ignore a divided
opposition and that the protest turnouts had been encouraging but
insufficient to bring significant pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at Avramovic's instigation, all the parties are to
attend a conference on free and fair elections. If the round table
succeeds, Draskovic said, he will throw his support to rallies to
press for early elections as the best and only effective way to
oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has been insistent that Milosevic has to resign
first, if there is be a chance for fair elections. But their
campaign shows no sign of bringing about a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has refused to join the rallies, calling them
pointless and a waste of time. He has not lent them his party's
organizational skills or helped publicize them on Studio B, the
Belgrade city television station that he controls.
</P>
<P>
   So the alliance leaders, most notably Zoran Djindjic of the
Democratic Party, are convinced that Draskovic intended to see
these rallies fail altogether, perhaps destroying Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rallies did nearly fail. They began last Tuesday.
But by Thursday night, the turnout was so low and dispirited _
fewer than 5,000 people _ that Djindjic talked bitterly about
calling off the rallies or resigning.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief aide, Cedomir Jovanovic, a former student leader,
urged him to forget the speeches and give in to the crowd's desire
for action _ to march, rather than listen. The numbers shot back up
to 20,000 and then to 30,000 or more on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are dropping again, with 5,000 on a rainy
Tuesday night. Wednesday night, the alliance announced a march on
``the forbidden hill,'' the Dedinje district where Milosevic lives.
Alliance officials said this was again a response to a perceived
desire for more action.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said that they believed that they had
saved the rallies and themselves and that they were proud that
Draskovic still had them to deal with. But the main target,
Milosevic, remains remote.
</P>
<P>
   There is some nervousness evident from the government, with the
police in riot gear carefully hidden in case of incidents and a new
crackdown on the nonpayment of taxes, indications of the increasing
economic squeeze that the government faces.
</P>
<P>
   State television remains dismissive about the opposition as NATO
agents and puppets, and counterposters have appeared to mock
alliance posters. One alliance poster shows Djindjic with his child
on his back. The new poster shows President Clinton with Djindjic
on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Important alliance leaders do not really trust Avramovic, who
had made his own approach to Draskovic, though he did tell the
Alliance about that. They apparently believe that Avramovic has his
own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic, who will be 80 in two weeks, scoffs at those
concerns. But he said the alliance was too narrow a base to carry
the day against the government, and he is trying, no matter their
concerns, to build a bigger coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The election conference will be run by Dragoljub Micunovic, the
leader of a small party and a friend of Avramovic, and all
opposition parties have agreed to attend. Micunovic said he
expected all the opposition members would ``realize that their
competitors are not in that room, but rather somewhere outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, if successful, will probably include demands for
elections on all levels; revised electoral districts; an open
press, especially television; a revised media law, and strict
supervision by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few ideological differences among the opposition
parties,'' Avramovic said. ``If the round table can agree, then for
the first time, the government will face a real united front. But
you have to have elections. Period. The question is how quickly and
under what conditions. And I hope Mr. Milosevic will see the point
and resign without a fight, for that would win him considerable
support here for not going to The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior government official and an executive who had just
seen Milosevic said he was in no mood to resign or schedule early
elections. ``He's just taken 78 days of bombing by NATO,'' the
businessman said. ``Do you really think he's going to surrender to
Zoran Djindjic?''

IN ROME, ANCIENT RUINS STALL RAMP TO `GOD'S PARKING LOT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Workers building a ramp to a vast Vatican garage for
pilgrims recently stumbled on walls of an ancient Roman villa.
</P>
<P>
   Now work has halted on the ramp to ``God's parking lot,'' as it
is known locally, while Italy decides what is more important:
preserving remnants of Rome's imperial past, or building modern
amenities to insure a smooth pilgrims' progress for as many as 30
million visitors expected in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real test, a clash between modernity and the past,''
said Oreste Rutigliano, a spokesman for Italia Nostra, a
conservation association that is lobbying to close down the ramp
and resurrect the ruins. ``To permit modernity to win out would be
a terrible symbol for the jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments draw eye-rolls from some of the engineers and
city officials who have to get Rome and its roads ready by
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rome already has plenty of Roman walls, perhaps too
many,'' said Luigi Scavizzi, an engineer with Geosonda, the
construction company that is building the access ramp. ``This may
be a famous site to some, but to me it's just a bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Those bothersome walls date from about the first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Government archaeologists who are now gingerly sifting through
the site say they have not determined who built them, but already
some Italian archaeologists are saying it may have been a villa of
Agrippina, Caligula's sister and Nero's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though not remembered for her sweetness (among other things, she
is accused of poisoning several husbands, including Claudius),
Agrippina had a cheery taste in decor; the walls still show traces
of delicate floral patterns and songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to dig in Rome without stumbling on some
ancient artifact. Two weeks ago, archaeologists at a different site
found a second-century A.D. base of a statue, covered with reliefs
of Hercules, as well as pavement and walls that were once back of
the stage of the theater of Marcellus. In that case, however, the
discovery did not compete with new construction.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the walls discovered under the Janiculum Hill
next to the Vatican last month were the first archaeological find
that required tough choices since preparations for the year 2000
began.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are close to 700 construction sites snarling
traffic in Rome, and more than half are repairs undertaken
specifically for the jubilee celebrations of the Roman Catholic
Church. Holy Years, when the faithful are exhorted to make
pilgrimages to Rome, were introduced in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII,
and now take place every 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is a city haunted by the way previous generations
recklessly bulldozed through buried Greek columns and Roman villas
to modernize the capital. After World War II, construction crews
destroyed whole Roman neighborhoods to build subways and the train
station of Termini, which was inaugurated for the 1950 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   The country's feelings of guilt were most powerfully invoked in
a scene in Fellini's ``Roma'': subway workers digging underground
crash through a wall and stare silently as giant frescoes flake and
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Rome,'' said Emanuele Gatti, a classical archaeologist
who specializes in central Rome. ``We have found a lot. We have
destroyed a lot. And underground there is still an unquantifiable
amount of treasures to be discovered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rome is undergoing an extraordinary, $950 million make-over for
the year 2000, but some of its most ambitious plans have been
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   A highway underpass beneath Castel Sant'Angelo was scrapped
after environmental groups, urban planners and archaeologists
protested that the digging would damage the foundations of the
second-century mausoleum built by the Emperor Hadrian. Other
projects have hit different snags. Earlier this month, heavy rains
drove a gaping hole in a newly completed highway tunnel built under
the Appian Way.
</P>
<P>
   The underground parking lot, which is still being built to
accommodate 115 buses and 800 cars, is on Vatican territory near
St. Peter's, a $45 million project whose cost is being evenly
divided by the Italian government and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot is the Vatican's only major jubilee expense;
pilgrims will have to pay to book spaces at big public Masses and
major Holy Year events. The Italian government and the city of Rome
are paying for street repairs and restoration of historic
buildings, including churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not even have to pay to clean up St. Peter's.
The gleaming $5.4 million restored facade, which was unveiled on
Tuesday, was executed and paid for by ENI, the Italian energy
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The ramp is on state-owned land, and its fate falls under the
jurisdiction of the Culture Ministry, which must determine the
value of the find. A special committee is expected to decide soon
whether to stop building the ramp. Italia Nostra officials argue
that since the project envisions two ramps, the Vatican and Rome
can manage with only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have managed with one, we wouldn't have spent the
money to build two,'' Scavizzi retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Mocchegiani-Carpano, an archaeologist for the
government's Rome office of archaeology, said: ``This is not the
find of the century, but we would never destroy the ruins. If they
are of less importance, they could be moved, but such decisions
will be up to the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that option could significantly delay the completion of the
ramp. Officials responsible for readying the city are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the decision that is made,'' said Maurizio
Pucci, an official with the Rome Agency for the Preparation of the
Jubilee, which is coordinating year 2000 projects. ``But we are
awaiting it with trepidation.''

buy everything from jam made by Trappist Monks to whitewater rescue
equipment is yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion
by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year, according to Forrester
Research, and most major merchants are trying to develop a selling
strategy to master the emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has one of the most visited sites on the web,
expects to help these companies and to expand well beyond books,
CDs, electronics and toys. For Amazon, whose losses have been
mounting along with its sales, one big benefit is a steady stream
of cash without the costs associated with a warehouse of products.
Merchants will pay a monthly fee of $9.99 to be listed on the site
and will distribute their own goods. If they choose to have Amazon
process their credit card purchases, they will pay an additional
4.75 percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   To become the web shopping destination of choice, Amazon will
need to persuade at least some big retailers to participate, thus
giving up a portion of Internet sales and relinquishing data on
customers _ something they may be loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Wall Street applauded the move, the
biggest in a series by the retailer to evolve from web book store
into a full-fledged shopping portal, by sending Amazon's stock up
23 percent to $80.75 in a day of heavy technology trading.
``Consumers win, retailers win, and Amazon wins big time,'' gushed
Chris Vroom, an e-commerce stock analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, summing up the investor zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said he wanted to
give his customers what they want most: endless choice. ``Sixteen
months ago, we were a place we could come to find books,'' he said.
``Tomorrow, we will be a place to find anything, with a capital
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will be experimenting with a type of business now
dominated by other Internet behemoths. On one hand, its move to
become an unlimited shopping mall is an attempt to compete with
Internet portals like America Online and Yahoo!, which offer links
with millions of web sites and have substantially more monthly
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also provide an opportunity to take away some of the
small business revenue flooding into auction sites like Ebay and
Microsoft, Excite(AT)Home and Lycos, which agreed to share their
auction listings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any willing merchant will be able to to work with Amazon
and have indirect access to it 12 million customers, but Amazon
will exclude merchants its deems ``offensive,'' including sellers
of guns, hard-core pornography, live animals and hate literature.

AMERICA ONLINE ENTERS HONG KONG WITH EYE ON MAINLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stephen Case has planted his flag in Hong Kong, but
his gaze is fixed on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Case, the founder and chairman of America Online Inc., was here
this week to introduce his company's newest Internet service, AOL
Hong Kong. The service _ a partnership with a highflying local
Internet provider, China.com Corp. _ will offer the usual menu of
AOL services, plus a dollop of home-grown features like Cantonese
pop music, Chinese cooking tips and horse-racing forums.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet analysts said AOL Hong Kong is most intriguing as a
starting point for future expansion into China. With an online
market that is projected to quadruple from 3.8 million users this
year to 16.1 million in 2003, China beckons Internet providers the
way it used to attract detergent makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is definitely a force to be reckoned with,'' said Hanson
Cheah, executive director of Asia Tech Ventures, a venture capital
firm in Hong Kong that specializes in Internet companies. ``They
can use their marketing prowess and brand name to blanket the
market. But China presents big challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Case acknowledged that Hong Kong was ``a
logical staging area for China.'' But he added: ``First things
first. We want to launch Hong Kong, and then we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Case may be wise to temper his ambitions. Beijing recently
alarmed foreign investors when a top official seemed to slam the
door on foreign investment in Internet companies. The official,
Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan, later softened his tone,
saying: ``We will open these areas sooner or later. The question
is, we have to have the proper rules in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's mixed signals have left foreigners scratching their
heads. Shares of China-related companies like China.com have taken
a drubbing. But Yahoo, the Internet portal service, recently went
ahead with plans for a venture with Founder, a Beijing electronics
company.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he planned to meet with Wu in Beijing on Thursday and
hoped to get a better understanding of the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is being debated within the Chinese government as
well,'' Case said. ``I have little doubt that when the dust
settles, the Chinese will embrace foreign investment in the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Hong Kong generally share his optimism. They note
that Wu is being pulled by competing interests: telecommunications
executives, who want to retain monopoly control of China's network,
and technology executives, who want to open the network to
stimulate equipment sales.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is also torn between wanting to harness the power of the
Internet and wanting to restrict potentially provocative
information about issues like Tibet and Taiwan. Despite all this,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has said that he wants the Internet
to become an engine of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is going to be resistance to pure, unfettered
access,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner at BDA China, an Internet
consulting firm in Beijing. ``But China knows that it needs to
develop the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   China's ambivalence may be dispelled later this year when
Beijing is expected to issue new rules governing foreign investment
in the Internet. The current ban derives from a 1993 law that
prohibits foreign companies from owning or managing telephone
networks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If China did open up its market, America Online would have a
well-connected partner in China.com. Among the company's original
investors is Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. Xinhua still
owns a 13.6 percent stake. America Online bought 10 percent of
China.com for $25 million in June and has an option to increase its
holdings to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to introduce AOL Hong Kong, Case emphasized
the strong local flavor of its programming. In addition to local
pop stars and stock quotations, the service will offer
Chinese-language news from Sing Tao, a Hong Kong newspaper, and
e-mail in Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
   China.com chief executive Peter Yip said Hong Kong was an
impressive Internet market on its own. He said the territory would
have 940,000 online users by the end of the year and 1.6 million by
2001. Currently, the market is dominated by the local phone
company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   Yip said his company and America Online hoped to turn Hong Kong
into both a regional Internet hub and a gateway to China. Lest
there be any doubt about their good intentions, he added: ``They're
opening their markets at a Chinese pace. We have to be sensitive to
the pace of reform in China.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before the 28 teams opened their training camps, the
National Hockey League executive Steve Solomon attended the revival
of ``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway. Solomon, second in command
to Commissioner Gary Bettman, spied a hockey-friendly journalist at
intermission and went into sell mode. The topic was the NHL's new
four-on-four overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting five minutes in sports!'' Solomon said. ``It
will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, but Solomon won't be around to hype it. A couple
weeks later, he announced his resignation, effective Friday, the
opening night of the NHL season. Solomon is going to Univision, the
Spanish television network, where he will head the sports division.
</P>
<P>
   While Bettman seeks Solomon's replacement, the league skates on,
with the Dallas Stars defending their first Stanley Cup and the
2000 playoffs set to end next June. Along with the new overtime
concept, the NHL has partly changed its video-review policy. No
longer will television tape nullify apparently good goals because
an attacking player had a skate in the goalie's crease. The
decision regarding goalie interference will be made only by the
referees, the way it used to be. And there will be two referees for
50 of each team's 82 regular-season games, up from 20 last season.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new team in Atlanta, in a new arena, with plenty
of tickets sold for the Thrashers. The Carolina Hurricanes have a
new arena in Raleigh, N.C., where tickets are not selling as well.
The Los Angeles Kings have a new building, too, and so does the
Colorado Avalanche. Locally, the Rangers signed six free agents and
the Devils stood pat. The Islanders are still in their old
building, with the same ownership considering a sale as the payroll
shrinks, the season-ticket base dwindles and local television
exposure remains uncertain. As for national TV, Fox is gone with
all its incomprehensible camera angles and ABC is in with fewer
regular-season games than Fox and camera work still to be
determined. More games will be seen on ESPN and ESPN2, the cable
partners of ABC and all under the Disney umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   When the puck drops Friday, with the Rangers at Edmonton, it
will be the first season in two decades without Wayne Gretzky, who
began in 1979 with the Oilers and finished in 1999 with the
Rangers. Gretzky and his No. 99 jersey will be honored in pregame
ceremonies Friday night and he will enter the Hall of Fame in
November. And this season could be the last for Hall-bound Dominik
Hasek of Buffalo, who said he plans to retire. Hasek has won the
Vezina trophy for the past three seasons as the league's best
goalie. But Bettman emphasized that the returning younger stars
include Paul Kariya of Anaheim, Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh and Eric
Lindros of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of sports in all ages is that there is always
another generation,'' Bettman said. As for rules changes, Bettman
said, ``The feedback we've gotten has been overwhelmingly
positive'' for the new overtime format. Under it, teams tied after
60 minutes will each get 1 point in the standing, as they always
have for ties. The five-minute, sudden-death overtime will be
played, however, with four skaters apiece, instead of five. If a
team scores to win in overtime, it gets a second point in the
standing for a victory while the losing team keeps its point for
the tie in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Scotty Bowman, the dean of NHL coaches, said he is not
sure how this will affect strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things you put in your mind,'' Bowman said.
``What the standings are. Your opponent. How you're playing in the
game. It will cause a lot of parity. If you tied every game, you'd
have 82 points, going for another 82. You might see some real
offense for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   This should highlight players like Brian Leetch, the Ranger
captain, who is a skilled attacker from his defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the rule, it's exciting,'' Leetch said. ``Teams will
put skill players out there. It will help the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, said that eliminating video
review for crease violations will lead to more collisions between
attackers and goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, there are serious issues. With the collective
bargaining agreement in place until 2004, some teams are resisting
the wage inflation that has raised the average salary to almost
$1.3 million. Among the stars in contract squabbles are: Aleksei
Yashin of Ottawa, Keith Primeau of Carolina, Bill Guerin of
Edmonton, Byron Dafoe of Boston and Darren McCarty of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents still seeking teams include Ulf Samuelsson, Pat
Verbeek, Dmitri Khristich and Joe Murphy. Among old faces in new
places: Theo Fleury from Calgary to Colorado to the Rangers;
Zigmund Palffy from the Islanders to Los Angeles; Niklas Sundstrom
from the Rangers to San Jose, via Tampa Bay; and Grant Fuhr from
St. Louis to Calgary. Kevin Lowe, the former Ranger and Oiler, is
coaching Edmonton. Mario Lemieux, the former Pittsburgh star, now
heads an ownership group that bought the Penguins out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the NHL has not commanded the higher profile that
seemed its destiny five years ago. After Bettman's first full
season, 1993-94, the Rangers had won the Stanley Cup and Solomon
was helping to negotiate big national television deals. Rap artists
wore team jerseys and hockey seemed hip. The cute, new, successful
expansion team was the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, founded by the Disney
Co., an encouraging straw in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   With baseball on strike that autumn, hockey had a wider space on
the big sports stage. And then Bettman, negotiating a collective
bargaining agreement, ordered a labor lockout that lasted 15 weeks.
Perhaps it was only coincidental, but hockey's momentum seemed to
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, as sensitive to criticism as he is dedicated to his
mission, is quick to counter perceptions that hockey has not
attained its expected share of the American sports audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous fragmentation out there,'' Bettman said,
referring to the sports marketplace, especially its television
component. ``The competition, in terms of distribution, is fiercer
than ever before. On a regional basis, we continue to do great. We
have a strong fan base. Our attendance has never been stronger.
We're in more places than ever before. Go back to 1990. We were in
11 U.S. markets. For next season, we will be in 21. All of these
things will take time. We've been heading in the right direction.
It's a long road. We think we're on the right track.''

SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS PARENTS SHOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH CHILDREN
UNDER 2 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS information from study in 14th graf and in new 15th graf;
CORRECTS to University of Notre Dame in 1st graf of 2nd take.) 
(ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ind.) (rk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents should never sleep in the same bed with
infants or toddlers under the age of 2, the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission warned Wednesday, because sleeping
together poses a significant risk of accidental smothering or
strangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sleep with your baby or put the baby down to sleep in an
adult bed,'' Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, counseled
parents. The agency cited a new study indicating that over an
eight-year period, 515 children under 2 _ an average of 64 a year _
died as a result of sleeping in adult beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendation evoked immediate outrage from some
pediatricians and many mothers and fathers, who argue that sharing
a bed is part of child-rearing in many cultures and that it is
beneficial, promoting breast-feeding and strengthening bonds
between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on this earth that a U.S. government official
should make pronouncements about child-care practices based on a
single study,'' said Dr. Abraham B. Bergman, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and other critics said that while parents do need to
know about safety hazards associated with adult beds, an
across-the-board warning against bed sharing is unwarranted. The
commission's recommendations, they said, smack of cultural bias and
will frighten parents unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, presented Wednesday in New York at a news
conference sponsored by the American Medical Association, is based
on data from death certificates, coroner's reports and media
accounts for the years 1990 to 1997. In 121 of the 515 deaths, the
study found, a parent, sibling, or other adult sleeping in the bed
had inadvertently smothered the child. More than three-quarters of
the children who died from ``overlying'' were younger than 3
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the other 394 deaths, children suffocated or were strangled
after they became entrapped in the bed structure, ending up, for
example, wedged between mattress and wall or between mattress and
headboard. Older-style waterbeds presented a particular hazard to
children, who could suffocate while lying face down on the bed's
surface, reported the researchers, led by Dr. Suad Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nakamura said the 64 deaths per year associated with adult
beds contrasted with an average of 50 deaths each year linked to
cribs, most of which did not meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing children younger than 2 years to sleep in adult beds
exposes them to potentially fatal hazards that are generally not
recognized by the parent or care giver,'' Dr. Nakamura and her
colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A safer option for parents who want to keep their infants close
to them at night, she said, is a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet, several
models of which are on the market. The bassinets attach to the bed,
but allow the child to sleep in a separate, protected space.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the commission's report, which will be published in
the October issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, say the study's methodology is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergman said, because no one knows exactly how many
babies sleep with their parents in adult beds, the study gives no
indication of relative risk, a weakness noted by the study's
authors in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Death certificates, he said, also may be misleading. They often
contain little information about the circumstances of the deaths _
whether the parents were using drugs or alcohol, smoked, or
suffered from depression, for instance. In some regions, coroners
may be more likely to attribute the death of an infant from a poor
family to ``overlying,'' while attributing infant deaths in higher
income families to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 of the 121 overlying deaths in the study were related to
alcohol, according to coroner reports and other data. But the
researchers conceded that the data were sometimes scant and that
other deaths might also be alcohol related.
</P>
<P>
   Bed sharing is the norm in many countries, including Japan,
anthropologists say, and is common among Hispanic, Asian and black
Americans. Co-sleeping, as the practice is often called, is also
gaining popularity among young working couples, who, absent during
the day, are loath to be separated from their children at night.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many American parents
sleep with their children, but some estimates put the figure as
high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American pediatricians have discouraged the
practice in the belief that it fostered bad sleep habits, made
children dependent and raised the risk of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, some specialists have revised their views.
Noted pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, for example, used to
advise parents not to sleep with their children. But in an
interview, he said a strong recommendation against it ``would make
people feel guilty but wouldn't change the patterns very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brazelton noted, ``they just don't have sleep issues;
in this country it's the number one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sears, a pediatrician in San Clemente, Calif. who
with his wife, Martha, has written 25 books on parenthood, endorses
the practice, saying it is ``the nighttime parenting style of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' he said about the commission's recommendation,
``is that every night, millions of responsible parents go to bed
with their babies and their babies wake up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sears also includes in his books a list of cautions for
parents who plan to sleep with their children. For example, he
warns that parents should never share the bed with children when
they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are
highly fatigued. Obese parents, he said, also need to be ``very
cautious.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. James McKenna, a biological anthropologist at the University
of Notre Dame , has done studies indicating that infants who sleep
with their mothers cry less and breast-feed ``at twice the rate for
three times the duration'' of children who sleep alone in cribs.
``Co-sleeping and breast-feeding are basically one and the same
adaptive system,'' McKenna said. ``You can't understand infant
sleep without understanding how the mother breast-feeds through the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Ms. Brown said in an interview that
the safety commission's recommendation ``is not an
anti-breast-feeding diatribe in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, she said, is simply one of safety. By using a
bassinet or putting a crib in the parents' bedroom, she added,
``the baby can hear your breathing and you can hear the baby's, you
have the bonding experience of breast feeding through the night.
But you will have a baby who is alive in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics have suggested that the commission would
be better off telling parents how to share a bed safely, instead of
discouraging the practice altogether, Ms. Brown said: ``There is no
way to do this safely. The safe sleeping environment for a baby is
in a crib that meets federal safety standards, on a firm, flat
mattress, with the baby on its back, and no soft bedding in the
crib.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Jennifer and Aaron Wright of Fremont, Calif.,
have put their daughter Alice to sleep in their king-sized sleigh
bed ever since she was born eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having our baby in our bed feels right and we don't have to
worry about her being cold or lonely,'' Jennifer Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she and her husband were unlikely to change their
sleeping arrangements as a result of the new study or the
commission's recommendations. `` I understand that they're looking
out for the safety of the babies, but I think my husband and I are
smart enough to make our own decisions.''

LOOKING AT DEATH WITH OLD AGE NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIQUIU, N.M. _ The men and women who had gathered for a
conference on aging and wisdom at Ghost Ranch, the mountain retreat
where Georgia O'Keeffe once lived and painted, were asked by their
workshop leader to imagine their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Hedy-Jo Huss, a professional caregiver from Oregon in her early
50s, told the group she wanted to be making love to the owner of
the liquor store in a certain small town in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rollins, 59, a retired Pan Am pilot from Arizona, said, ``I
want to be by a stream of running water in a hammock. All my
friends are going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Hurst, 77, a retired teacher from Los Angeles, said her
greatest hope was that when the time to die came, she did not deny
it.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about growing old and dying has long been taboo in
youth-obsessed America, but in coming years, as their numbers
skyrocket, it may begin to seem as though older Americans talk of
little else. The generation that is retired and approaching its
last years, and especially the baby boomers following them, are
examining what it means to age as no generation before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being yourself, whatever that is,'' said Loretta
Wrobel, 55, a psychotherapist with long gray hair, who had traveled
to Ghost Ranch, an hour north of Santa Fe, from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop at Ghost Ranch _ where O'Keeffe painted into her
90s _ is one of scores of events this year at which ``conscious
aging,'' a term that refers loosely to aging as an opportunity for
human growth and social contribution, is the focus.
</P>
<P>
   Where society has tended to look at old people as patients or
problems, and another popular new school of thought, ``successful
aging,'' celebrates hard-charging octogenarians on skis, conscious
aging is less about physical vitality, and more about learning to
live with these inescapable facts of life, aging and dying.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme is Deepak Chopra, whose book ``Ageless Body,
Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old'' (Crown
Publishers, 1993), suggests that meditation and yoga can keep old
age at bay. But the mainstream is made up of self-professed
realists who say that there is no denying that the body fails _ and
that there lies the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate the John Glenns, and the sexy grandmothers, but
that's trying to transform old age into middle age,'' said Rick
Moody, the former director of the Brookdale Center on Aging at
Hunter College, and author of ``The Five Stages of the Soul''
(Doubleday Anchor Books, 1997), a guide to spiritual growth in the
second half of life. ``Conscious aging is saying that the big
adventure is the inner journey, and that does not have to stop when
you can no longer ski downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Cole, a University of Texas historian who wrote a
cultural history of aging, ``The Journey of Life'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1991), says conscious aging is an effort to break
through the American tendency to think either entirely positively
about old age or entirely negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either all bad _ people get decrepit and they should be
put away in nursing homes,'' Cole said, ``or it's all good _ we all
automatically become wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to face the complex reality of growing old, Cole
and others say, is to talk about it. And at Ghost Ranch, there was
a full weekend of talk, on subjects from retirement communities to
Hindu, Buddhist and American Indian views of aging and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do with these extra years?'' asked Dr. Drew Leder,
a 44-year-old professor of Western and Eastern philosophy at Loyola
College, in his opening talk.
</P>
<P>
   Proposing that aging be used as ``a curriculum for the soul,''
Leder asked the participants to talk about their own awakening to
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Greensmith, 64, a retired teacher from Prescott, Ariz.,
talked about her role in a community theater production of ``The
Velveteen Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else in the cast was a child,'' Mrs. Greensmith said.
``I was the fairy godmother, but they called me the fairy
grandmother. I suddenly saw myself through their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the thought had not occurred to her, said Mrs. Greensmith,
who has gray hair, to the children she was undeniably old. And that
was three years ago, when she was 61.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul Rollins, the epiphany was his parents' unhappy old age.
As a young couple, and even well past middle age, he said, they had
been part of a vibrant community in North Carolina. But they did
not anticipate growing old, Rollins said, and almost overnight
their friends moved away, or died.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents died alone in a nursing home,'' he said. ``That
transformed me. I decided I wanted to age with friends, not
strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar experience motivated Geoffrey Landis, a 47-year-old
artist, to found Jubilados, the Buddhist-based group that sponsored
the conference and is planning an affordable, spiritual retirement
community in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Landis told the group that his mother, Elizabeth Landis, who had
been a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, had died, marginalized and
invisible, in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion turned to the wisdom of old people in general.
Melinda Hurst offered a cautionary view, saying, ``You're not going
to get wise just because you get old.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurst, who sits on the ethics board at Cedars Sinai Hospital
in Los Angeles, said later that she had come to the conference to
explore her deepest fears about aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of being left behind,'' she said. ``I'm afraid of
the fact that I can't figure out the damn computer. I think the gap
is very painful between people who are plugged into technology and
those of us who aren't. Things went very slowly when we were
growing up. Now, my god, you get a computer, and six months later,
they tell you to get a new one.''
</P>
<P>
   She will probably replace her Powerbook soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roszak, the author of the book about the 1960s ``The
Making of a Counterculture'' (University of California Press,
1968), talked about his latest book, ``America the Wise'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1998), and his view that baby boomers would bring about a
more compassionate society in their old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are sitting in this room today are the wave of
the future,'' said Roszak, who recently retired as a professor of
history at California State University at Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, and with all the emphasis at the conference on the
joys of later life, it is not easy growing old in America. Carol
Segrave, 57, who did the publicity for the conference, is a
consultant on conscious aging. She meditates and quotes the
68-year-old author Ram Dass on the spiritual growth that can come
with physical decline. At the same time, she is mindful of the
youth culture that reigns in Southern California, where she lives
and works. And when the subject of plastic surgery came up, Ms.
Segrave, who is from Santa Monica, did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it,'' she said. ``I'm going to start with my eyes.'' &QL;

TOYOTA'S LOW-COST ECHO IS GREETED BY SILENCE IN AUTO INDUSTRY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Despite the soaring value of the yen, Toyota Motor
Corp. introduced a subcompact car Wednesday that will be imported
from Japan and will be priced well below comparable models made by
Detroit auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, such a move would probably have outraged American
auto executives, prompting them to call for federal investigations
into whether Japanese cars were being dumped on the United States
market. But there was silence Wednesday from the industry in
Detroit, which has become increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
   The new subcompact, the Echo starts at just $9,995, the first
Toyota in five years to be priced in the United States for less
than $10,000. The Echo costs thousands less than competitors
including the Ford Escort ($11,760), Dodge Neon ($12,460) and even
Ford's newest small car offering, the Focus ($11,865).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Toyota executives say that selling the car at that price
is profitable for the company and that the low price comes from
engineering advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the low price was prompted by the last surge in
the yen's value,'' said Donald V. Esmond, group vice president and
general manager of Toyota's United States arm. ``It probably was
due to the yen four years ago, when the yen was so strong and our
cars were so high-priced.
</P>
<P>
   The yen briefly peaked at just 79.85 to the dollar in April 1995
before retreating below 100. The yen closed Wednesday at 106.98 to
the dollar, after climbing more than 15 percent over the last 10
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rally, which tends to make all imports more expensive,
has been powered by Japan's apparent emergence from its longest
recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Okuda, the chairman of the Toyota, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that the globalization of the auto industry had
made trade frictions less severe between the United States and
Japan. ``That is how we in private business, as well as in the
government, see it,'' Okuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is harder now for American executives to call for
people to ``buy American.'' The Chrysler Corp., whose former
chairman, Lee Iacocca, prominently accused Japan of dumping cars in
the United States, was acquired by a German company and is now
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many other auto makers with headquarters in foreign
countries are building huge numbers of cars and trucks in the
United States. In the 1999 model year, Toyota built in North
America 74 percent of its cars and trucks sold here, Honda built 82
percent and Nissan built 58 percent. BMW, Mitsubishi, Mazda and
Subaru also build cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the General Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. sell
cars around the world and own major auto makers in other countries.
Ford even owns 33.4 percent of Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday, investors can buy Toyota's American
depository receipts under the symbol TM on the New York Stock
Exchange. Toyota shares also began trading Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange. Okuda even rang the New York Stock Exchange's
opening bell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The current surge in the yen marks the first real potential for
trade issues to roil the waters in the auto industry since
Daimler-Benz bought and Chrysler last November.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler still employ their
longtime trade lobbyist, Stephen J. Collins, as president of the
Automotive Trade Policy Council. He continues to warn about the
threats from Japanese competition and said Wednesday, ``There's a
sense of renewed aggressivity of Japan in the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the country's trade deficit with Japan is once
again widening but conceded that part of the increase is coming
from cars imported to help quench an unexpectedly strong American
auto market _ one that United States auto makers are also
struggling to supply.
</P>
<P>
   Though such comments used to be backed up with frequent
pronouncements by the chief executives of Detroit auto makers, that
is no longer the case. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and GM officials
declined to comment Wednesday on the yen or Toyota's pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda said Toyota had set a goal of capturing 10 percent of the
American market _ compared with 8.6 percent in the first eight
months of this year _ but had set no timetable. ``The rise in the
value of the yen will not affect our future activities here,'' he
added. ``It will not affect how soon we attain that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also plans to increase its share of the European market
from 3 percent to 5 percent by 2005. Worldwide, Toyota sells about
9 percent of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda said the yen's effect on Toyota's American operations
would continue to shrink in the future as more of the company's
vehicles are assembled in the United States. But the Echo, a
subcompact with expansive headroom and crisp handling, will be
imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota expects to sell at least 50,000 of the 2000 model year
Echos in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers shaved about $2,600 off the price of the Toyota
Tercel, the car the Echo replaced. Michael J. O'Brien, a Toyota
executive, said engineers designed the Echo with fewer separate
components and with parts that were easier to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they saved $12 a car by redesigning the Echo's
air-conditioning unit in one piece instead of three. And they saved
$30 to $35 a car by bolting the power-steering pump, alternator and
air-conditioning compressor directly to the Echo's engine block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those changes added up,'' he said. ``Anytime there's a part,
there's handling requirements, and that all adds up to money.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Bobby Valentine hurried into Shea Stadium for
Wednesday night's game with the Braves, a middle-aged fan, James
McCahan of Brooklyn, handed the Mets' manager a big white envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me: `Hey, Bobby, do me a favor. I scored every game
this season and here are my scoresheets,''' Valentine was saying
during batting practice. ``He told me: `I love the team. Show the
guys these scoresheets so they'll know how good they've been all
year.' I haven't yet, but I'm going to show it to them before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything for inspiration. Anything to snap the Mets out of their
seven-game losing streak that began last week in Atlanta when John
Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux put them into a tailspin that
continued in Philadelphia and has now jeopardized the Mets' hope
for a wild-card berth in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the Mets lost again to Glavine, now 13-11, and
Wednesday night they were confronted by Maddux, who went to the
mound with a 19-8 record. In Thursday night's finale, they will be
facing Kevin Millwood, the 24-year-old right-hander with an 18-7
record and a 2.69 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about the reasons for any slump, Valentine mentioned
``injuries, fatigue, and sometimes good pitchers put you in a
slump.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that maybe those good pitchers in Atlanta
had triggered this Mets' slump, he agreed, saying: ``Yeah,
probably. That was the start of this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mets don't recuperate in time, they will be the first
team to have blown the wild card in a collapse since the wild card
was dealt into the postseason in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have blown the pennant when the pennant meant first
place either in the league or the division, notably the 1964
Philadelphia Phillies, who were 6 1-2 games up with 12 games
remaining. But the Phillies proceeded to lose 10 straight before
winning their last two in Cincinnati. Too little, too late, as the
St. Louis Cardinals rallied to win the pennant and then disposed of
the Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Mauch, then the Phillies' manager, acknowledged that he
``just wore the pitching staff out,'' alluding to having started
Jim Bunning and Chris Short on two days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillies returned on their charter flight from
Cincinnati that final Sunday of the season, some 2,000 fans were at
the Philadelphia airport to cheer and console them. As their plane
rolled up to the gate, Mauch turned to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the first one off,'' he said. ``You guys didn't
lose it. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillies' owner, Bob Carpenter, didn't hold Mauch
responsible. Mauch, who had been hired in 1961, remained the
Phillies' manager until he was dismissed during the 1968 season. He
later managed the Montreal Expos, the Minnesota Twins and the
California Angels, but he's mostly remembered as the best manager
never to guide a team to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Two other teams _ the 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers and the 1978 Boston
Red Sox _ blew big leads, but didn't really collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Between games of a doubleheader on Aug. 11, 1951, the Brooklyn
Dodgers were 13{ games ahead of the New York Giants, who would
catch them on the final weekend of the season and then win the
pennant on Bobby Thomson's home run off Ralph Branca at the Polo
Grounds in the ninth inning of their decisive third playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers had not really collapsed. They finished with a
26-22 stretch, but the Giants were a remarkable 37-7.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 Red Sox were 14 games ahead of the Yankees on July 11.
Then the Yankees, sweeping four games at Fenway Park in a September
massacre, jumped past them before the Red Sox won their final eight
games to force a one-game divisional playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been prouder of anybody in baseball,'' Don Zimmer,
then the Red Sox manager, told his players. ``Don't nobody ever
tell me this team choked.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Bucky Dent hit a home run, only his fifth that
season, off Mike Torrez into the screen above the Green Monster at
Fenway Park. The Yankees went on to win the American League pennant
in a playoff with the Kansas City Royals, then won their second
straight World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So those '78 Red Sox didn't really collapse. Neither did those
'51 Dodgers. But the '64 Phillies did. And now the Mets might be
discarding a wild card.

 &HT;    Some settled, others not as ECU resumes classes

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The attitudes of students returning to ECU
Wednesday varied like the condition of the dormitories they
returned to.
</P>
<P>
   Some students sat on residence hall porches, opening care
packages from home, excited to be back; others sat in the ECU Flood
Relief Resource Center, uncertain about things as basic as where
they would be living for the rest of the semester.
</P>
<P>
   The East Carolina University administration called school back
into session at 8 a.m. Wednesday, two weeks after Hurricane Floyd
slammed the doors shut and ran most students away from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated Tuesday that about 900 students still had no
place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Corri Zajicek was one of them, and she was not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that all the ECU students are in town is
complicating cleanup efforts,'' said Zajicek, a junior from
Winston-Salem whose Village Green apartment sustained substantial
water damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all rainwater, but it flooded the apartment,'' Zajicek
said. She and her roommate saved many of their possessions by
stacking them on bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Zajicek sat at a table in the relief center clasping several
forms _ paper keys used to unlock the doors to disaster-relief
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Cards and handwritten messages posted on a wall outside the
center carried words of support for the students victimized by
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember: You are not alone,'' urged one card. Another read,
``Have faith: Things fall apart so that things can fall together.''
</P>
<P>
   Zajicek said her apartment still had no electrical service.
Someone offered a loft for temporary lodging, but that dwelling had
not materialized Wednesday afternoon, Zajicek said.
</P>
<P>
   For her, Chancellor Richard Eakin's decision to bring the
students back was not wise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just put it after Christmas and start it over,'' she said of
the semester. ``I think he's endangering our grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Zajicek expected the adversity to take a ``big toll'' on her
grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the work we've got to do on the side to keep up, on
top of working, on top of the stress of moving and cleaning,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Eakin appealed to the ECU faculty members to be
sympathetic to their students' plight, but Zajicek said one of her
professors wasn't heeding that call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got like five projects this guy handed me today,'' she
said. ``They expect us to remember stuff from two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Her perspective sharply contrasted that of freshmen Leah Vaughn
of Apex, N.C., and Kate Herlehy of Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Herlehy hung out with Vaughn at her family's home after the
students evacuated the campus two Saturdays ago. Other than being
forced from campus, the Jones Hall residents were unfazed by Floyd
and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all glad to be back,'' Vaughn said as she explored the
lollipops and other provisions in a parcel sent by Herlehy's
parents. ``We missed everybody so much.''
</P>
<P>
   During roll call in class, Herlehy said, her professors noted
which students had been affected by the flooding, ``so they can
make sure they can get all the help to the students.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be real lenient about tests, homework and
quizzes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Herlehy and Vaughn said attendance in their classes had been
high, an observation that jibes with reports from university
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anecdotal evidence indicates there were full classes all
over campus,'' said ECU spokesman John Durham.
</P>
<P>
   That bodes well for the objective of keeping students in school
stated by Eakin and Molly Broad, president of the 16-campus
University of North Carolina system, who visited the campus and the
relief center Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 students and employees have used the services at
the relief center in Todd Dining Hall. A relief fund to aid
students, faculty and staff members affected by flooding totaled
more than $275,000 as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said she came on the first day back after the catastrophe
to view for herself the efforts by ECU to set things aright. She
also hoped to be a cheerleader for students, to make sure
floodwaters don't wash them out of the halls of academe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back is very important,'' Broad said, urging them not
to withdraw from school if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, four students have officially withdrawn from
classes in the wake of Hurricane Floyd's flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Broad commended East Carolina's administration, faculty and
staff for turning in a ``tremendous performance'' in the face of
Floyd's wrath, and afterward, when things went from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   The UNC system is ``working in many places simultaneously,''
including the U.S. Congress, to get funds to help ECU in its
journey back to normalcy, Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as students returned to the soggy campus Wednesday,
evidence that all was not normal on campus. A small wall of
sandbags ringed steps leading to the basement of Christenbury
Memorial Gymnasium; a construction gate blocked off a section of
gutter and bricks that had washed out on Wright Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Variously worded signs recalled Saturday's football game between
the ECU Pirates and the University of Miami Hurricanes _ a game
that became an allegory: ``ECU Beats Hurricanes _ Floyd and
Miami,'' read a button worn by staffers on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Hunt, one of the football players who helped defeat Miami,
returned home to find a refrigerator full of spoiled food inside
his flooded apartment in Tar River Estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of close to the front (of the apartment complex), but
it still came up there,'' he said of the swollen Tar River.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt visited the flood-relief center Wednesday afternoon and
picked up a cash gift of $100 to jump-start his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this I'm probably going to do a lot of food shopping,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunt's geography class on Wednesday, ``there were four or
five people whose places had been flooded out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his teachers had been ``pretty understanding'' of their
students' plight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concentrating on academic pursuits must be a trying
affair for those who returned to destroyed or damaged dwellings,
said Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still going to be a distraction,'' Hunt said.
``That's got to be hard, them trying to concentrate on class and
tests.''

 &HT;    Town prepares to handle the dead
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Burials in at least one of Greenville's
cemeteries have been delayed by Hurricane Floyd, but contrary to
rumors, the county morgue is not overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral homes are keeping the bodies of people who have died of
hurricane-related and other causes and can't be buried, said Dr.
M.G.F. Gilliland, a county medical examiner. The morgue at Pitt
County Memorial Hospital is nowhere near full, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, preparing for the worst, brought in a refrigerated
truck that holds about 20 bodies, in case there were more deaths
than the morgue _ with room for 16 bodies _ could handle, Gilliland
said. But the truck hasn't been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are grateful,'' she said. ``Agencies have had long
lists of missing persons, but most of them are being found at
shelters or at relatives' homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Five people in Pitt County have died from storm-related causes,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland was eager to dispel the rumor that bodies were
``piling up'' at the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad, but it's not that bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownhill Cemetery, a public cemetery, hasn't been fit for
burials for two weeks because the ground is too soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the need to get equipment in and around
existing graves and with the ground so wet, they don't want to
destroy those graves,'' said City Engineer Jim Jatko. The city has
three public cemeteries. City officials say they hope to start
digging at Brownhill by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Brothers Mortuary has delayed burying two women in
Brownhill, said secretary Cathy Venable. Neither death was
flood-related. One woman, who died at 88, has been at the funeral
home for more than 10 days, she
</P>
<P>
   said. She is embalmed so there is no need to refrigerate the
body, Venable said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families haven't complained, because they know there's
nothing anybody can do,'' she said. ``They prefer to wait than have
us put Mama down in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The families delay only the burial, not the funeral services,
Venable said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkerson and Sons Funeral Home had to delay two funerals,
but they were scheduled during the height of the hurricane, two
weeks ago.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IN SEARCH OF THE REAL REAGAN
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON On our way to a White House party, we strolled past a
sidewalk photographer hawking his wares. For $5, he offered to snap
a picture of us standing beside the two-dimensional ``president.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the State Dining Room, the president made a similar
offer. Turning to my wife, Ronald Reagan said: ``Let's have a
picture of us together with Nancy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the official photographer obliged, my wife recalled the bid
we'd received from beyond the confines of the Executive Mansion.
``Mr. President,'' she said, ``I hope people will be able to tell
if it's you or if it's a cardboard cutout.''
</P>
<P>
   If her jest carried an edge, he missed it. Inclined to quiet
chuckles, this time Reagan laughed uproariously. ``Yes,'' he said,
``that's the trouble with this town. It's hard to tell the
difference between a phony fake and a real fake.''
</P>
<P>
   That scene, from more than a decade ago, came in mind while
reading reviews of ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' Edmund
Morris's newly published and widely controversial book. As his
biographer, Morris agonized for years over his seeming inability to
define his subject.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, Morris overcame his writer's block by touring
Reagan's boyhood haunts and spawning a fictional observer.
Fittingly, the real Morris also portrays the fake Morris as a
screenwriter. For the best clues to Reagan's often engaging and
not-so-enigmatic character are to be found in his long career as a
movie star.
</P>
<P>
   An incident from the Reagan presidency illuminates his Hollywood
roots. One morning, for what's known as a ``two-on-one,'' I was
ushered into the Oval Office, along with George Skelton, then a
White House correspondent of the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton, seated in a wing chair opposite Reagan, posed the first
question. ``Well, Lou ...'' Reagan began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not, Lou, it's George,'' Skelton interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan completed his reply. But he was clearly off his game.
Some moments later, his face suddenly brightened. ``I know why I
called you 'Lou,''' he said. ``Because they told me it was going to
be Lou.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Lou'' in question was Lou Cannon, then a White House
correspondent for the Washington Post. As California political
reporters, both Cannon and Skelton had been in frequent contact
with Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, some hours before our interview, the president
was given a seating chart which had put Cannon in the facing wing
chair. After Reagan had committed the chart to memory, Skelton's
alternate visage, a last-minute switch, failed to register.
</P>
<P>
   Morris deals with Reagan's seeming passivity by reminding
readers that ``actors remember forward, not backward. Yesterday's
take is in the can; today is already rolling: tomorrow's lines must
be got by heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, on the campaign trail, a drama student asked Reagan to
what he attributed his success as a communicator. Few questions
struck Reagan's fancy. But that one did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagine,'' he replied, ``that I'm still talking just
with a few of my good old buddies, as I did long ago, in that
barber shop back in Iowa. That makes it all work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a snapshot of the real Ronald Reagan.

EDUCATORS FOCUS ON `PAIN' OF STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, N.C., Wis., Iowa)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when most of the nation's governors and dozens
of corporate leaders joined President Clinton at an education
summit meeting in Palisades, N.Y., only 14 states had standards
outlining what students should know and be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the word ``standards'' a near mantra of politicians
and educators _ by spring, 49 states will have adopted some form of
them in at least some grades and subjects _ the delicate and
politically charged task of meeting such lofty guidelines is
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, millions of students could fail, or be held back.
</P>
<P>
   To anticipate such hazards and sustain the momentum generated at
the last gathering, the same group is reconvening Thursday and
Friday at the same place, an IBM conference center on the New
York-New Jersey border.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to an opening talk from Clinton, the 117 leaders
_ including 28 governors, 21 state school superintendents and 34
executives _ are committed to figuring out what comes next:
defining the standards so that they make sense to students and
parents; setting aside new funds to retrain teachers; drafting
tests that gauge the students' new knowledge, and standing firm
when some students invariably fall short.
</P>
<P>
   How the leaders decide to proceed will ripple across the country
in the coming months and years, affecting the academic experiences,
and futures, of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   IBM chairman Louis Gerstner, and the driving force behind both
conferences, said the current gathering would focus on what he
called ``the pain,'' which he defined as the sting that teachers,
principals and students feel when they realize that they are now
being held accountable for their performance and will be
disciplined accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `Oh my God, these kids are going to fail,'
or, `They're not going to make it, so we need to lower standards
because we're going to hurt their esteem,''' Gerstner said in an
interview. ``We understand the pain. And we're going to have to
deal with it. But we're not going to deal with it by backing off.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are already indications that some states are doing
just that. In New York, some teachers and principals are saying
that although a new high school graduation test is more difficult
than previous versions, a lower passing score and lenient grading
guidelines make it easier for students to pass.
</P>
<P>
   While standards have been hailed as a means to insure that
students in rich and poor schools alike are covering the same high
ground, there is hardly unanimity among educators that establishing
such goals is the best course for American schools. Among the
movement's loudest critics is Alfie Kohn, an author whose most
recent book, ``The Schools Our Children Deserve'' (Houghton
Mifflin), laments that standards stunt the creativity and
flexibility of the classroom teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Iowa,'' Kohn said, of the only state that has
declined to write standards, deferring instead to districts and
schools. ``Because of the sensibility reflected in this conference,
whole schools across the country have been transformed into giant
test-prep centers, where not much thinking is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teachers union, said his members support the
idea that they should be ``held accountable for student learning.''
But he added that when he addresses the conference participants, he
intends to give them a bracing report from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' he wrote in a recent essay, ``the
prevailing mindset among too many politicians is something out of
`Field of Dreams': `If we set high standards, students will
magically achieve.' And they are deluding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of such criticism, Gerstner and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, who are leading the event, have put together a 100-page
briefing book of the states' experiences with standards, warts and
all. They write, for example, that many states have crammed their
standards with so many topics to memorize as to paralyze students,
and then have written tests that bear no connection to the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   They also lament that although so many states have put standards
on the books in the last three years, in no state has a majority of
either fourth- or eighth-grade students been judged to be
``proficient readers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the pain that Gerstner has described, the
briefing book refers to New York state, among others, where more
than half of all fourth graders failed a new English test given
last January, a performance that shattered the confidence of even
the most elite districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is bleak, though.
</P>
<P>
   The conference attendees, including the leaders of Du Pont,
Glaxo Wellcome and Novell, are likely to hear much about Texas,
where 76 percent of third graders passed the state's standardized
test of academic skills last year, up from 58 percent in 1994. Gov.
George W. Bush, who presided over much of that progress, will not
be in attendance, citing presidential campaign commitments.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. James Hunt will be there, though, and he
intends to discuss his own success story: a rise in test scores
that he has attributed, at least in part, to incentives that raise
teachers' salaries by as much as $1,500 for their schools' good
work, and threatens their dismissal if their students lag.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner has said he hopes that the participants will depart
Friday by issuing a statement of consensus on the direction the
states should head next. Given that the composition of the group is
bipartisan, and the egos strong, it is unclear how much they will
be able to say, especially with divisive issues like publicly
financed vouchers at the top of the agenda of many governors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the predecessor of the 1996 summit meeting, a similar
event convened by President George Bush in 1989, ended on a rousing
note, with commitments to make American children first in the world
in math and science by 2000. It is a goal that, according to
standardized tests, is nowhere within reach.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK In a new line of attack in the city's vehement
opposition to a controversial art exhibition, senior City Hall
officials Wednesday accused the Brooklyn Museum of Art of
conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value of the
artwork in the show, all of which is privately owned by British
advertising executive Charles Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials vowed to file a lawsuit in state
Supreme Court seeking to seize control of the museum by contending
that it had violated its lease with the city in part by misusing a
public institution to promote a private collection.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would not try to block the exhibition from
opening on Saturday and were instead preparing for a tough legal
battle. On Tuesday, the museum filed a lawsuit in federal court
accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to cut off the museum's city financing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Joseph J.
Lhota, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine and the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, accused the museum of ``hucksterism'' and
of perpetrating a ``scam'' by conspiring with Christie's auction
house, which is a sponsor of the exhibition, to enrich Saatchi by
inflating the value of his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota accused Christie's of planning to profit from controversy
surrounding the show. ``I guarantee you,'' he said, ``immediately
following this exhibition, Christie's will have an auction wherein
the artwork that is being proposed to be shown at the Brooklyn
Museum will be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's swiftly rejected allegations that it had conspired
with Saatchi and the museum to profit from the show. ``We are aware
of these bewildering accusations,'' the auction house said in a
statement. ``They have absolutely no substance, are not true.
Christie's has a long history of sponsorships of exhibitions in the
United States and internationally. Nothing in this exhibition is
for sale, nor is their any expectation for any of the works from
the exhibition to be sold by Christie's.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Christie's quickly rejected the allegations as a
bizarre attempt by the administration to quash the museum show,
which Giuliani has called ``disgusting'' and offensive to Catholics
because it includes a painting of the Virgin Mary surrounded by
elephant dung and pornographic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani away on a three-day political trip to the West
Coast, officials at City Hall were clearly seeking to retake the
offensive in the museum dispute. The administration had been on the
defensive since late Tuesday, when the museum abandoned its efforts
to resolve the dispute through negotiations with City Hall and
announced that the show would go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that every day, the city comes up with a new
pretextual claim,'' said Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer
who is representing the museum in its federal suit against the
city. ``Now, they have come up with another argument. Each and
every one of them is nothing more or less than further pretext in
an effort to punish the museum for the exercise of its First
Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, through a spokesman, issued a statement calling the
city's accusations ``preposterous and misleading.'' It said, ``The
mayor's latest charge simply reflects the depths to which he will
go to undermine the First Amendment.'' The spokesman, Fred
Schroeder, said Christie's financial contribution to the show
represented a small fraction of its total cost.
</P>
<P>
   In making the allegations of conspiracy, city officials
capitalized on news reports that noted the dual role of Christie's,
which is a promoter and financial supporter of the exhibition as
well as a purveyor of artwork belonging to Saatchi, who is a major
collector and an important client. Christie's also supported an
installation of the exhibition at the Royal Academy in London.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts of interest, some museums, like the Museum of
Modern Art, do not exhibit private collections unless they have
been promised to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a scam and taxpayers' dollars should not be used to
support that,'' Hess, the corporation counsel, said at Wednesday's
news conference. ``Taxpayers' dollars should be used for educating
children, for building roads, for supporting the homeless, not for
pushing up the value of a private art collection.'' He added,
``We'll bring all of this out in court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The controversy reached as far as Capitol Hill Wednesday, when
the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution sponsored by a
conservative senator, Bob Smith from New Hampshire, who recently
left the Republican Party. The resolution calls for an end to
federal financing for the Brooklyn Museum unless the exhibit is
immediately canceled. The measure, which passed on a voice vote,
has no bearing on federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, speaking against the
resolution, said the issue should be decided by the courts, not the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd Abrams, who is perhaps the most significant First
Amendment lawyer of our age, is taking this case to a federal
District Court, urging that a First Amendment issue is involved and
that the proposed measures of the city of New York are in violation
of the First Amendment and cannot be allowed to stand,'' he said.
``In that circumstance, I should think that any member of this body
ought to defer to the courts before which this issue has now been
placed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the museum Wednesday, workers were racing to finish
preparations for the exhibition, about 90 pieces of contemporary
art from a crop of young British artists. Silk-screen artists were
completing labels for the pieces as electricians put the final
touches on the lighting and senior museum officials were
considering adding more security officers and surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was out of their concern over possible attempts to
vandalize some of the artwork, as happened when the exhibition was
first shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what is possible,'' Arnold Lehman, director
of the museum, said. ``Our phones are ringing off the hook, and
everyone is saying, `We'll be there, we'll be there.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We intend to make this orderly.''
</P>
<P>
   A citizens' group from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, has already
announced plans to demonstrate against the exhibit on Saturday. The
American Civil Liberties Union said it would stage a demonstration
in support of the show on Friday, when the museum's 25,000 members
will be given a chance for an advance viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do our very best to make sure people have every
opportunity to either show their support or protest,'' Lehman said,
adding his thanks to the local police precinct for its cooperation.

MUSEUM FIGHT PITS FREE EXPRESSION AGAINST CONTROL OF PUBLIC
SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Museum of Art says its battle with the
city is about free expression. The city says it is a
landlord-tenant fight over taste and the proper role of museums:
``I think it is a disgusting show,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle moves into the courts, legal strategies are
clearly shaping those pronouncements. The museum's legal position
is that artistic expression is protected by the First Amendment, it
asserted in the federal lawsuit it filed Tuesday. The city says
taxpayers are not required to underwrite offensive exhibits,
particularly for what it says are commercial aims. It is expected
to make that claim in a suit in state court soon.
</P>
<P>
   Both positions are to some extent correct under the law, said
legal experts on Wednesday. But the legal territory where the two
propositions meet is murky, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a black hole of First Amendment law,'' said David A.
Strauss, a professor of constitutional law at the University of
Chicago Law School. ``No one really knows how to think about it,
including the Supreme Court justices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand,'' Strauss continued, ``government officials can't
have carte blanche in deciding what to fund and what not to fund.
But on the other hand, it is clear the government is entitled to
make some decisions on what it will fund and what it won't fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Several First Amendment experts said the law seemed to favor the
museum, because of legal principles that protect the expression of
even unpopular ideas and forbid official punishment of unpopular
expression. Anti-religious sentiments, like those Giuliani said
were present in some of the artworks in the museum's exhibit, have
been protected by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   There are court decisions in the museum's favor. In a 1991 case
in Miami that was similar to the Brooklyn Museum battle, U.S.
District Court Judge James Lawrence King agreed with a Cuban arts
museum that the city government violated the First Amendment when
it refused to renew a lease after the museum had been criticized
for showing pro-Castro artists.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said Wednesday that government clearly has
some right to control how taxpayer money is spent on cultural
events. The U.S. Supreme Court has sidestepped defining how the
First Amendment limits that power when the issue is cutting off
money for unpopular exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has ducked a straight-on resolution in every
case involving funding,'' said Richard H. Fallon Jr., a professor
of constitutional law at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three rulings from the Supreme Court on related
issues since 1991. The most recent, a 1998 Supreme Court ruling
involving the National Endowment for the Arts, for example,
approved a federal ``decency test'' for federal arts funding.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the decency standard was acceptable partly
because it was only advisory. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's
majority opinion suggested that the law would violate the First
Amendment if the so-called decency test was imposed to limit
unpopular viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One problem in clarifying what legal principles apply to battles
over financing is that much of First Amendment law has developed in
cases involving government efforts to punish people criminally for
statements or artworks. The rulings in such cases have been clear
that the First Amendment prohibits punishment of artistic
statements, even those that offend many people.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly because of those rulings, several lawyers said
Wednesday, that the museum's lawyer, Floyd Abrams, has focused his
public comments on the contention that Giuliani is trying to punish
the museum for mounting the exhibit. If the courts agreed that
coercion or punishment was involved in the Brooklyn fight, they
would be more likely to rule that the mayor violated protections
for the free expression of viewpoints, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear, lawyers said, that government officials
have some authority to control how public money is spent. Some
legal experts said Wednesday that the city might properly decide in
advance, for example, that it would pay for one type of art _
opera, say _ but not another, like ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, such as where a municipality owns an
exhibit space, it might have especially broad authority over
esthetic judgments. The city leases the Eastern Parkway building to
the Brooklyn Museum and provides it with funding. That, lawyers
agreed, would not give it as much legal power over the content of
exhibits as the city might have in a government-owed museum.
</P>
<P>
   But, they said, the city would have some rights as a landlord
and financing agency. Whatever those rights might be, the lawyers
said, none would supersede the free expression guarantees of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. Constitution, it is an open question how much the
city might be able to impose taste limitations in advance for
exhibits it helps underwrite, said Amy Adler, a New York University
law professor. It could be, she said, that the city might even be
able to impose rules aimed at barring museums financed by the city
from showing offensive art.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the fact that Giuliani reacted in fury after the
exhibit was in place would make it difficult for the city to
prevail with the claim that it was merely imposing standards
limiting the use of city funds for certain types of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   She said the mayor's remarks could be used to suggest that he
was trying to limit the expression of what he decided were
unacceptable artistic viewpoints. The courts, she said, would be
skeptical of such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be an easier case for the mayor,'' Professor Adler
said, ``if he had sat down with the museum people and said, `I've
been thinking about your mission, and I think your mission should
include not offending people.' But that is not what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment expert at the University of
Richmond, said that when it subsidizes a museum, a city, in effect,
creates a forum for private expression that gains some First
Amendment protections. As a result, he said, an effort to try to
bar funding that was based on disagreement with an artwork's
message _ like a supposedly anti-religious message _ could be held
to be a violation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In separate interviews Wednesday, lawyers for the city and the
museum worked to define the dispute in the way that would help each
of them frame the case.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, the First Amendment specialist who is representing the
museum, focused on decisions that have barred officials from
imposing punishment for unpopular expression.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Giuliani's apparent grounds for attacking the
museum were the kinds of things the First Amendment was intended to
forbid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city,'' Abrams said, ``may take into account in its
prospective funding decisions matters of taste and, to some extent,
content, but not religious content and not whether it is, quote,
`sick' or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   City Corporation Counsel Michael Hess focused on what he said
were the museum's lease and contract agreements with the city. But
he acknowledged that both sides were looking at the cases through
different legal lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the court will focus on,'' Hess said. ``Our
job is to answer whatever First Amendment questions the judge will
have, but also to show that we have rights as a landlord.''

EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLEARS EXXON-MOBIL MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Commission on Wednesday gave approval to Exxon
Corp.'s planned takeover of Mobil Corp., which would create the
world's largest publicly held oil company, on the condition that
they shed assets in Europe to preserve competition.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the companies, which still need the approval
of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, had agreed to the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Key among the conditions was that Mobil divest itself of its 30
percent interest in a joint venture with BP Amoco to refine and
market gasoline and other products in Europe. BP Amoco had said
that it was in talks with Mobil about the future of that alliance.
John Hervey, an oil analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
the book value of those assets was about $1.7 billion, which he
said would be a reasonable purchase price for BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil agreed in early December 1998 to merge in a
stock transaction then valued at $80 billion. It would create a
giant worldwide oil company with revenues of about $147 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This did not surprise anybody'' Hervey said.``It had been
widely anticipated that they would have to disengage from the BP
joint venture.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the European Commission, the executive arm of
the European Union, said: ``As initially notified, the operation
would have created or strengthened dominant positions on eight
markets. Exxon and Mobil have made a series of undertakings to
eliminate those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are still in negotiations with the enforcement
staff of the FTC. In the United States, talks have also focused on
the refining and marketing of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has demanded that the two companies spin off about 1,500
service stations in the Middle Atlantic and Northeast regions as
well as a major refinery in California.
</P>
<P>
   California uses a cleaner-burning gasoline, and the number of
refineries that can produce it are limited. This has led to price
spikes for gasoline when a refinery has a problem. Thus the FTC
staff contends that the control of the refineries should not be
further concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has been
following the negotiations at the FTC, said in an interview earlier
this week that there had been progress.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Exxon had realized ``that there has to be some
significant divestitures for the states and the federal government
to approve the merger.'' Exxon chairman Lee Raymond said the
European approval was ``a major step toward the completion of the
merger.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the companies were continuing their discussions
with the FTC and the attorneys general of the affected states.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the European approval, Exxon and Mobil also agreed to
these conditions: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil will sell its 28 percent interest in the German joint
venture marketing company Aral, which operates a large chain of
gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon and Mobil will sell a portion of their lubricant
manufacturing operations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil will sell some pipeline capacity that serves Gatwick
Airport near London.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon will sell assets connected with its worldwide commercial
airline lubricant business.
</P>
<P>
   There were also changes that would affect natural gas marketing
in Europe including divestiture of Mobil's Dutch gas trading
company Megas and Exxon's 25 percent interest in Thyssengas, a gas
distribution company in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the European Commission also approved BP Amoco's
acquisition of ARCO for $32.7 billion. That approval was contingent
on BP's sale of its interests in British natural gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon shares rose 6.25 cents, to $74.75, while Mobil rose 12.5
cents, to $98. BP Amoco's American depository receipts rose 93.75
cents, to $107.1875, and ARCO gained $1.0625, to $86.1875. &QL;

FIRM SELLS JEWISH-THEME STUFFED ANIMALS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Last winter while buying Beanie Babies for his
children's Hanukkah gifts, Steven Hoffman felt some regret the
animal-shape bags of beans didn't contain some religious
significance for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman forgot about the Beanie Babies until a family dinner a
few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone at dinner used the word fetch,'' Hoffman said, ``and I
said, `Kvetch the golden retriever.'''
</P>
<P>
   If only every dinner could be so lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Because from that one idea, Hoffman and his friend, Michael
Silver, have created a company that has sold thousands of
Judaic-themed beanbag animals within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Kvetch the Golden Retriever isn't among them. But Macca-Beanies
LLC is selling Gefilte the Fish, Cantor the Horse, Jacub the Bear,
Mooses the Moose, Muttzah the Dog, Purrim the Cat, Shofar the Ram
and Torah the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, 37, said the toys were designed to help introduce
children to elements of their Jewish heritage. Each Macca-Beanie
includes poems on the hang tags, along with the word ``Oy.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the inscription written by Hoffman's wife, Lauri,
for Torah the Bull reads, ``I hold my stories rolled up tight, in
the ark, under the eternal light.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooses the Moose reads, ``I led my people through the sand, all
the way to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman added, ``Eight toys, one for each night of Hanukkah,
allows people to present a different Jewish theme each night of the
holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how his company came up with the names of each stuffed
beanie, Hoffman said it was ``a family affair where everyone put
together their thoughts to come up with the names.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, 36, arranged for production of the toys at overseas
factories. Once the production details were finalized, the
collectibles were manufactured in China and shipped back to the
United States for sale at delis, stores and synagogues throughout
Los Angeles and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   Macca-Beanies retail for $5.99 to $7.99. Hoffman said he and
Silver expect to exceed $300,000 in sales in the last quarter of
the year, with the majority of sales coming around Hanukkah, which
starts Dec. 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lorin Stein, manager of Fromin's Restaurant, said sales have
been ``pretty good'' since the Macca-Beanies went on sale about a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold a lot of Shofar the Ram during Rosh Hashana (the
Jewish New Year),'' said Stein, whose father opened the Encino
landmark 37 years ago. ``I think we will sell a lot of them over
Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the company has produced about 80,000 Macca-Beanies,
enough to cover the start-up costs and reach the financial
break-even point. ``I would be happy where we are now, but I could
sell millions of them,'' said Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Gorman, an editorial assistant with Mary Beth's Bean Bag
World, a Chicago-based online magazine devoted to the bean bag toy
industry, predicted Macca-Beanies will sell well within a limited
market, but she doesn't think they will spark widespread interest
from collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to introduce a Macca-Beanie key chain Oct. 15
that would retail for $2.99. A 2-foot-tall version of the
Macca-Beanie is still in development.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to Kvetch the Golden Retriever? It will be in
next year's batch, along with Kibbitz the Parrot and six others.

 (Editors: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rey Ordonez sauntered over to the New York Mets' bat
rack about two hours before Wednesday night's game, puffing cigar
smoke around the lumber, a sort of makeshift blessing for a team
very much in need of a little divine intervention from the baseball
gods.
</P>
<P>
   Someone buy this man another cigar. The Mets, with a burst of
offense so furious that it seemed to explode all the tension stored
up for a week, pummeled the Atlanta Braves, 9-2, and stayed very
much in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   They are 1 1-2 games behind the Astros and Reds, who are tied
for the lead in the National League Central after Houston beat
Cincinnati, 4-1, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a night, the Mets put aside a dark, surreal week
that included two team meetings, three lineup switches and one
manager saying he should perhaps be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had made baseball look terribly difficult during their
seven-game skid _ they hit .211 in that span and were 6 for 53 with
runners in scoring position _ and this seemed like an almost
impossible circumstance to salvage a season. They were facing
future Hall of Famer Greg Maddux, who had beaten the Mets three
times this season and compiled a 0.86 earned run average in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Valentine, in grasping for something positive to say
before the game, noted that the Mets, with Al Leiter pitching, had
halted Roger Clemens' 20-game winning streak to end the Mets'
eight-game losing streak in June and start the Mets' remarkable
second-half run. With Leiter pitching again, Valentine pointed out
that Maddux was going for his 20th victory of the season.
Coincidence? Whatever. Finally, the Mets sifted through the rubble
of their losing streak and uncovered a nugget of gold.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the form of a seven-run fourth-inning rally off
Maddux that was as shocking as the Mets' losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets trailing, 2-1 _ they had taken a 1-0 lead, their
first edge since leading the Phillies Sept. 24 _ Darryl Hamilton
slapped a first pitch single to right. Roger Cedeno followed with a
single to shallow left. Ordonez, his bat behaving appropriately
under the hex, smacked an infield hit to shortstop Jose Hernandez
that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Leiter, whose bloop dropped in front of a diving
Andruw Jones in short center. That tied the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson was next. On the second pitch, Henderson hit a
hard roller that went under the glove of a diving Brian Hunter at
first. It went into short right and scored two runs to give the
Mets a 4-2 lead. Edgardo Alfonzo, who was 4 for 26 during the
losing streak, went to a 1-2 count, looking frustrated. But then he
singled in the gap between third and short to load the bases again.
</P>
<P>
   That brought John Olerud up. He, too, had suffered, going 7 for
29 in the seven losses. He took strike one from Maddux. Valentine
had said repeatedly during the slump that just one great hit, one
great play could turn thewhole thing around. If the Mets manage to
extricate themselves from the quicksand, they may point to Olerud's
at-bat as the pivotal moment. He lofted the ball high into the sky
and, in the seconds it took the grand slam to reach the right field
bullpen, the Mets leaped to the top step of the dugout. The Mets
led, 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   The drought was over. Nothing after that mattered, except in
what it told about the Mets' fortunes. Mike Piazza's single was the
eighth straight hit of the inning, and Maddux was gone after just
three innings, having given up eight runs _ seven earned _ on 11
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, the struggling ace, gave up just two runs on five hits.
The Mets made two sterling defensive plays in the fourth, one when
Ordonez fielded a bad hop for a groundout and the other on the next
play, when Maddux popped up in foul territory and Piazza slid to
make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza landed face first in the dirt, but bounced up with the
ball in his glove. He was messy-looking, but he had made a critical
save _ a pretty clear metaphor for the Mets when the smoke had
finally cleared.

 &HT;    Arab demands on Disney exhibit called `blackmail'
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Disney's unwitting entry into the quagmire of
Middle Eastern politics began with a warning from Israel, likening
a threatened Arab boycott of the Magic Kingdom to political
blackmail Wednesday evening at a gathering that included about 300
Jews from Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political blackmail is just another word for terrorism,'' said
Israel's U.S. ambassador, Zalman Shoval, before the opening of an
Israeli exhibit that has raised international hackles because
according to reports, it originally referred to Jerusalem as the
eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,400-square-foot Israeli Pavilion is one of 25 countries
represented in the 15-monthlong exhibit at the Millennium Village.
The exhibit opens to the publicFriday. About 700 Jews from across
the country took a private tour Wednesday night at the request of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion includes a virtual ride through the history of
Jerusalem and showcases the county's high-tech, energy and
agricultural industries. In an eight-minute movie that is the
exhibit's main attraction, Jerusalem is called ``the heart of the
Jewish people'' and ``the capital of the millennium.'' But there
was no reference to Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which is sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims, was
captured by the Israelis in 1967 from Jordan. Palestinians claim
the city is the future capital of their independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel _ which partially financed the pavilion to the tune of
$1.8 million _ said it was always its understanding that Jerusalem
would be described as the nation's capital. Both the Arab League
and Israel claimed victory after the compromise Disney executives
brokered last weekend. Still, Shoval was stern in his condemnation
of the Arab demands.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly Jewish audience came to Orlando at the request of
several embassies who asked Jewish leaders to arrange the trips as
a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to send the message that we Jews stand as one when it
comes to Israel,'' said Angela Lampert, the Chair of the Community
Relations Council of the Palm Beach Jewish Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the boycott threat at Disney and a dispute
last month over a Burger King near Jerusalem on disputed territory,
the growing power and sophistication of Arab lobbying groups is
starting to become evident.
</P>
<P>
   Two icons of U.S. capitalism have suffered public relations
nightmares and raised the profile of Arab concerns over land
disputes in and around Jerusalem just as final status negotiations
are beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a revolution in the Arab-American political
establishment over the last few years,'' said Walid Phares, a
professor who teaches about ethnic and religious conflicts at
Florida Atlantic University's department of political science.
''There are more organizations, they are more grass-roots an they
are are becoming more sophisticated in their language and their
political culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American and Muslim-American leaders have learned lessons
from the lobbying efforts of other ethnic communities in the United
States, such as the Jewish and Armenian communities, and their
organizational efforts have been fueled by the speed of
communication through the Internet. At the forefront of this second
generation of pro-Palestinian movement is a 5-month-old
Washington-based organization called American Muslims for
Jerusalem. The group claims a membership of 50,000 and at one point
during the Burger King stand-off sent out 30,000 e-mails a day to
members to use as talking points.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Turaani, the organization's 33-year-old executive
director, said the group is trying to balance what he called the
asymmetry of power between the Jewish and the Muslim lobbies in
America by leveraging the 3 million Arab-Americans and 6 million
U.S. Muslim's voices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really formed around the idea of telling our side of
the story _ the story of this holy city has not been told,''
Turaani said. ''We realize that a lot of decisions are made here in
the United States and here in Washington, D.C., that happen to be
unfair to the Christian and Muslim population and are to a large
extent influenced by the power of a pro-Israeli lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Turaani said he expected to bring about 100 protesters to EPCOT
on Friday to leaflet the exhibit and that his organization as well
as several other Arab-American and Muslim-American organizations
were going forward with a boycott. Their voices likely will be
heard. A public relations spokesperson for Disney said between 600
and 800 media outlets were expected at the opening ceremony. Also
in attendance were about 300 Jews from the Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going there to celebrate the opening of a wonderful
pavilion,'' said Ted Lampkin, community relations director for the
Jewish Federation for Palm Beach County. ``We felt it was important
for the American Jewish community to support Israel and support the

FANNIE MAE EASES CREDIT REQUIREMENTS ON LOANS IT PURCHASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that could help increase home ownership
rates among minorities and low-income consumers, Fannie Mae Corp.
is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase
from banks and other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24
banks in 15 markets will encourage those banks to extend home
mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough
to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they
hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages,
has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration
to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and
felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth
in profits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies
have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to
so-called subprime borrowers. These borrowers whose incomes, credit
ratings and savings are not good enough to qualify for conventional
loans, can only get loans from finance companies that charge much
higher interest rates _ anywhere from three to four percentage
points higher than conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fannie Mae has expanded home ownership for millions of
families in the 1990s by reducing down payment requirements,'' said
Fannie Mae chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines. ``Yet
there remain too many borrowers whose credit is just a notch below
what our underwriting has required who have been relegated to
paying significantly higher mortgage rates in the so-called
subprime market.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographic information on these borrowers is sketchy. But at
least one study indicates that 18 percent of the loans in the
subprime market went to black borrowers, compared with 5 percent of
loans in the conventional loan market.
</P>
<P>
   In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending,
Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose
any difficulties during flush economic times. But the
government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an
economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of
the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the perspective of many people, including me, this is
another thrift industry growing up around us,'' said Peter Wallison
a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ``If they
fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way
it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Fannie Mae's pilot program, consumers who qualify can
secure a mortgage with an interest rate one percentage point above
that of a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage of less than
$240,000 _ a rate that currently averages about 7.76 per cent. If
the borrower makes his or her monthly payments on time for two
years, the one percentage point premium is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages,
does not lend money directly to consumers. Instead, it purchases
loans that banks make on what is called the secondary market. By
expanding the type of loans that it will buy, Fannie Mae is hoping
to spur banks to make more loans to people with less-than-stellar
credit ratings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fannie Mae officials stress that the new mortgages will be
extended to all potential borrowers who can qualify for a mortgage.
But they add that the move is intended in part to increase the
number of minority and low income home owners who tend to have
worse credit ratings than non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Home ownership has, in fact, exploded among minorities during
the economic boom of the 1990s. The number of mortgages extended to
Hispanic applicants jumped by 87.2 per cent from 1993 to 1998,
according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
During that same period the number of African Americans who got
mortgages to buy a home increased by 71.9 per cent and the number
of Asian Americans by 46.3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the number of non-Hispanic whites who received
loans for homes increased by 31.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these gains, home ownership rates for minorities
continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites, in part because blacks
and Hispanics in particular tend to have on average worse credit
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
proposed that by the year 2001, 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and
Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low and
moderate-income borrowers. Last year, 44 percent of the loans
Fannie Mae purchased were from these groups.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy also comes at the same time that HUD is
investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the automated
underwriting systems used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to
determine the credit-worthiness of credit applicants.  &QL;

ANALYSTS DOUBT THAT DEUTSCHE TELEKOM COULD BEAT MCI OFFER FOR
SPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 by TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Sprint Corp. and rival MCI WorldCom ponder a possible merger,
talks between the Westwood company and its French and German
partners in the Global One international venture have been shoved
to the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, local sources hesitate to discount the possibility that
Deutsche Telekom _ seen locally as a preferred partner because such
a deal probably would have less effect on area employment _ could
resurface with a superior offer for Sprint, or block an MCI
WorldCom deal.
</P>
<P>
   Market observers say it is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Investment analysts border on breathless in their enthusiasm for
an MCI//Sprint deal. They think there is little chance that
Deutsche Telekom could offer Sprint's shareholders better financial
returns than MCI WorldCom, the prime consideration of Sprint's
management team in any transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Strumingher, an analyst for PaineWebber, said a combined
Sprint and MCI would immediately benefit from increased scale,
improved distribution, sizable cost savings and the elimination of
a prime competitor.
</P>
<P>
   He pegged the first-year cost savings from a merger at $1.5
billion as the new company put Sprint's long-distance traffic over
MCI's network, eliminated a brand and its associated marketing
expenses and cut corporate overhead by eliminating redundant legal,
finance and other corporate positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal would play to one of MCI WorldCom's great strengths _
cost cutting,'' Strumingher wrote in a research note this week.
``What sometimes goes unsung is how stingy these guys are with
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Strumingher thinks a Sprint merger would be an explosive
catalyst to MCI WorldCom's stock price, which he projects at $105
to $110 within 12 months. MCI WorldCom closed Wednesday at 72 5//8,
down 1 9//16.
</P>
<P>
   That projection may be overly optimistic. But it resembles the
model that investment bankers and Sprint's management team, led by
a former investment banker, might use to analyze a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Strumingher assumes that Sprint shareholders would get 0.95
shares of MCI WorldCom in exchange for each of their shares. If the
new company's shares reached $100 in the first year after the
acquisition, Sprint shareholders would be looking at more than a 70
percent increase based on Sprint's closing price of 55 1//2, up
3//4 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS, the company's wireless venture, closed at 77 3//16,
up 3 11//16.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, on the other hand, would have little opportunity to
generate cost savings or improved distribution and are generally
seen as having less disciplined management than Sprint's.
</P>
<P>
   That might be good news for Sprint's local employees and
fretting civic leaders, but it is unlikely to result in big gains
to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Germans made a bid for Sprint, they'd have to give me
one heck of a premium to want to have them for a partner rather
than WorldCom,'' said Tony Ferrugia, an analyst at A.G. Edwards.
``If the Germans did make an offer to shareholders that was so
good, I don't think I'd want to be a longer-term shareholder.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's stock has performed well this year, but
analysts say it might not fare well if the company offered a big
premium for Sprint. Conversely, the company could realize a
substantial return if it were to sell its stake in Sprint, money it
could use to help fund another acquisition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want a position in the U.S., they would have to start
looking at other network carriers like Qwest,'' Ferrugia said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the German and the French companies would be hit hard by a
merger between MCI WorldCom and Sprint, but particularly Deutsche
Telekom, which is under pressure to deliver on its longstanding
commitment to become a more global player in the telecommunications
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strategic perspective, it would be an egregious loss
for Deutsche Telekom to lose their relationship with Sprint,'' said
James Downie, an analyst with ABN Amro in London.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, which owns most of Deutsche Telekom, also
is looking to sell its 65 percent stake in the company. The
government hopes to liquidate its position a soon as next July,
which could complicate any acquisition plans.
</P>
<P>
   A German bid for Sprint would also face complications stemming
from the company's troubled relationship with France Telecom. That
decadelong strategic partnership soured when the German company
failed to inform the French of its bid for Telecom Italia _ a bid
that ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is suing the German company for violation of
partnership agreements. The same agreements would govern any move
on Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us has the right to increase our stake in Sprint
without informing the other'' or getting its approval, said Estelle
Rozine, a spokesman for France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives at Deutsche Telekom were more cagey about the
status of their agreements and the possibility that Deutsche
Telekom would be permitted to make an offer under those
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for negotiation,'' said Stephan Broszio, a spokesman
for Deutsche Telekom. ``All options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the partners refused to comment on the status of
negotiations to resolve differences at Global One. They do say that
they will have some news by the end of the year, and it will
probably involve a change in ownership structure.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Sprint still is not commenting on its discussions with
MCI. Regulators forbid companies to deny merger talks if they are
indeed proceeding, but they can refuse to comment _ indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail from Sprint employees Wednesday crackled with concern
about the merger discussions. Information was in short supply
internally because management had yet to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Manhattan law offices of Cravath, Swaine &AMP;
Moore, where MCI WorldCom and Sprint negotiators reportedly have
been meeting this week, also were n't in a talkative mood
Wednesday. They declined, through a security guard, to speak with a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey is scheduled to appear
at a dedication ceremony Friday at the company's new $920 million
campus in Overland Park.

DEBATE OVER FOOD EMBARGOES DELAYS ACTION ON FARM-AID BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 by KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A dispute over whether the United States should
stop using food embargoes to punish foreign countries has split
senators down unusual political lines and blocked $8.7 billion in
aid to distressed farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Sam Brownback of Kansas have
joined many Republicans and some Democrats in pushing for an end to
food and medicine sanctions. They said the embargoes closed
lucrative markets for farm products.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago the Senate voted 70-28 to amend the agriculture
appropriations bill to lift sanctions against Cuba, Iraq, Iran,
North Korea, Syria and the Sudan. The amendment, sponsored mainly
by Ashcroft, also would require the president to get congressional
approval of any future sanctions against those or other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of a House-Senate conference committee said America
should not do business with repressive or terrorist nations,
especially Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House and the Senate have tried for
several days to get the conference committee to remove the Ashcroft
amendment. An impasse continued Wednesday, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership is making a tragic error, not just on its own
behalf but on the part of the agricultural community,'' Ashcroft
said in an interview. Lifting sanctions ``isn't just good farm
policy, it's good foreign policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said that some of the countries in question would use
some of their money to buy food and medicine instead of weapons and
that the United States would be seen as compassionate in allowing
starving nations to import farm products.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft joined Brownback and two Democratic senators at a news
conference Wednesday to lament efforts to remove the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when we're already suffering from low agricultural
prices, to add this burden is truly adding insult to injury,''
Brownback said. ``Unilateral trade sanctions...are effective in
punishing our farmers, but they are not effective in forwarding our
interests in other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Richard Durbin
of Illinois and Republican Chuck Hagel of Nebraska joined Brownback
and Ashcroft at the news conference. All represent major farm
states.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, however, urged conference committee
members to pass the bill without the amendment and get farmers
needed aid by Thanksgiving. The $8.7 billion is largely to
compensate farmers for low prices, meager foreign demand for goods
and losses due to drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing before us is to expedite that
emergency money,'' Roberts said. Roberts favored the Ashcroft
amendment to lift the sanctions but said he did not think it should
be insisted upon if it held up the larger bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, backs Ashcroft, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Farm Bureau, in step with the American Farm Bureau,
strongly favors lifting the sanctions as long as the United States
is not in military conflict with the countries in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there was a time when we needed to make sure we have
every opportunity available for farmers to sell what they produce,
it's now,'' Missouri Farm Bureau President Charles Kruse said.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse recently visited Cuba and said he found a strong desire to
do business with the United States instead of making distant and
more expensive purchases from Australia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that really impressed me is that they genuinely like
Americans,'' Kruse said of the Cubans. ``They absolutely want to
buy our agricultural products.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Farm Bureau is urging rejection of the bill, saying
it does not provide farmers enough markets for their products and
did not provide enough overall assistance.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill first went to the conference committee, it called
for more than $7.4 billion in relief. An additional $1.2 billion
was added by Republican leaders for drought relief as an incentive
to remove the amendment to end sanctions and to remove another
amendment that deals with establishing dairy price compacts among
states.

CHANGE OF FORTUNE MEANS END OF SLUMP FOR METS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evidence that the New York Mets' fortunes have
changed abounded at Shea Stadium Wednesday night. Balls that in the
previous week's worth of games would have been caught fell just out
of the reach of Atlanta fielders. Balls hit by the Braves that
would have eluded the Mets' fielders found their way into Mets'
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling sign was something that didn't happen. What
didn't happen didn't happen before 9:15 p.m. That was when Rickey
Henderson caught Chipper Jones' fly ball for the third out of the
Braves' half of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't that Jones didn't get yet another damaging hit
against the Mets in general and Al Leiter in particular (see
three-run home run, fifth inning, last Thursday night). It was that
Henderson's catch made the game official.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't happen was it didn't rain. If the Mets had battered
Greg Maddux, or any pitcher, for eight consecutive hits and seven
runs in the fourth inning in the previous week, the rain that had
been forecast for sometime Wednesday night would have descended on
Shea Stadium with the force of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would never have completed their fifth inning. The
biggest and most meaningful inning of the Mets' season would have
been washed away in the torrential downpour. The game would not
have counted. It would have been played again Thursday as part of a
doubleheader. The Mets would still be gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they're still not really breathing easily. Their 9-2
victory Wednesday night that ended their losing streak at seven
games did not alter the Mets' 1 1-2 game deficit in the National
League wild-card race. They still stand that much behind Houston
and Cincinnati with only four games to play. They still can't
afford to lose another game unless they have information that the
Astros and the Reds are going to lose two or three of the remaining
three games each team has.
</P>
<P>
   But the life they showed Wednesday night was a necessary
development in this end stage of the playoff race. A loss Wednesday
night, and the Mets could have sung ``the party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as baseball has been played, no one has been able to
figure out how a collection of .300 hitters stops hitting at the
same time anymore than anyone has figured out why a team, any team,
can collect eight consecutive hits against a pitcher the caliber of
Maddux, the pitcher of the '90s playing for the team of the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   In their previous three tries against Maddux this season, all
losses, the Mets managed to score only three runs (two earned) and
stroke 11 hits in 21 innings. They had faced him seven times
without success since beating him three years ago this month. He
had compiled a 6-0 record with a 2.15 earned run average in those
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   More dire for the Mets, their squad of seven .300 hitters had
batted a combined .211 in the seven-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of sense a lot of them are pressing,'' said Don Baylor,
the Braves' hitting coach, when his view of the Mets was solicited.
``They're not relaxed. They're swinging at pitches they never did
swing at.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a turnaround for a bunch of players who, Baylor added, in
winning 92 games leading up to their lost week, ``were one of the
most feared teams in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no outs to be had,'' he said. ``They were scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets started losing, and the hitters began pressing.
``You really can't explain why it happens,'' Baylor said. ``It's
the same guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``Sometimes when you doubt yourself as a hitter,
it spreads. The next guy says I'm slumping, too, and the next guy,
and it becomes a team slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing induces strange reactions. ``I think you try to get a
hit even before the ball's pitched,'' Robin Ventura said. ``You
want to get a rally going and knock it in all at the same time. You
can't do that. We have to realize that Mike isn't going to hit a
five-run homer. He can't. Everybody has to just get a hit instead
of trying to knock in every run all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   This, Edgardo Alfonzo said, ``is no time to think about hitting
two home runs in one swing. It's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one hit two home runs in one swing against Maddux. John
Olerud hit one, and it produced four runs. He hit it after Leiter,
suddenly a hitting pitcher, blooped a ball into short center field
that fell just out of the reach of a diving Andruw Jones, the best
defensive outfielder in the game.
</P>
<P>
   And after Henderson hit a hard grounder between first and second
that Brian Hunter, the first baseman, dived for and got his glove
on but couldn't hold it. And after Alfonzo hit a grounder just out
of the reach of shortstop Jose Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's bases-loaded single, the fourth in a row against
Maddux, drove in the first run. Henderson's bases-loaded single,
No. 5, knocked in the second and third runs. Alfonzo's single, No.
6, reloaded the bases. Olerud's home run into the Mets' bullpen in
right field, delivered four more runs. Mike Piazza then lined a
single to left for consecutive hit No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't rain.

NEW GROUP ENTERS BID FOR FLAMINGO HILTON PURCHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 by RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A former top Station Casino executive is part
of a group that hopes to beat out Station in buying the Flamingo
Hilton Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make sure everybody understands the
alternatives,'' said Joseph J. Canfora, president of Empress
Entertainment Inc., which operates riverboat casinos in Illinois
and Indiana. ``We have officially informed Hilton that we are
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Station Casinos Inc. recently offered $22.5 million for the
Flamingo after a proposed sale of the operation to Trump Hotels &AMP;
Casino Resorts Inc. fell through. Station's bid was accepted by the
Flamingo's owner, pending regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   If Station is allowed to take over the Flamingo, Canfora said,
the company would dominate the Kansas City market with nearly 60
percent of the total gambling capacity. ``It's called a monopoly,''
he said. ``Competition is good for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Canfora said his group included several Empress executives and
investors, including Chief Executive Peter A. Ferro Jr.; William M.
Grace, principal owner of the St. Jo Frontier Casino and The
Woodlands; and several local investors, among them ethnic
minorities who would hold about 10 percent of the ownership shares.
Canfora said he could not yet disclose those names.
</P>
<P>
   Station executives here and in Las Vegas were caught off-guard
by Canfora's move. In a brief statement, Station said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Station Casinos Inc. is proud of its contributions to the
gaming industry in the state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a contract to purchase and are committed to the
acquisition of the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City. We are
moving forward with that process, subject to Gaming Commission
approvals. We plan on closing this transaction prior to the end of
the year.''

   Geoff Davis, a spokesman for Hilton Hotels Corp., the Flamingo's
owner, could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canfora, Station's former Midwest president, built and opened
the company's $300 million Kansas City casino in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired two months later and claimed in a lawsuit that he
was made ``a scapegoat'' for construction cost overruns and the
casino's weak financial performance in its first months.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit was settled under a confidentiality agreement that
prohibits either side from disclosing terms.
</P>
<P>
   Canfora insisted Wednesday that his Flamingo deal was ``not
personal. This is business. I'm here because I know this
market....I was looking at this deal long before Station announced
(its offer).''
</P>
<P>
   Canfora said the group intended to lobby the Kansas City Port
Authority and the Gaming Commission to reject the sale to Station
as anti-competitive. If successful, he said, the group is prepared
to offer Hilton more than Station's $22.5 million bid.
</P>
<P>
   If Station's offer for the Flamingo is approved, the company
would control five of Missouri's 15 active casino licenses and
three of the six operating riverboats in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   And, Canfora noted, if Harrah's Entertainment Inc. completes its
announced purchase of Player's International Inc., Harrah's would
control six Missouri riverboat licenses, plus the defunct Sam's
Town Casino in Kansas City that it bought last year and closed.
</P>
<P>
   Left unopposed, ``Station and Harrah's would own Missouri'' with
11 of the state's 15 licenses, said Canfora.
</P>
<P>
   The Canfora group's fair-competition argument may not find an
audience at the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we don't want to hop into,'' Chairman Bill
Johnson said Wednesday. ``The board would not want to get involved
with any preference over who the successful suitor would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, Gaming Commission executive director, has already
expressed concern about the shrinking competition issue in Missouri
and said he expected the commission to discuss it with Station
executives. Fisher could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canfora said his group also would argue before regulators that
Station had failed to live up to its promises in Missouri,
including a long-stalled land redevelopment project in St. Charles,
and unmet agreements with Kansas City to include more ethnic
minorities as vendors, employees and partners in the local
ownership mix.
</P>
<P>
   An unaudited draft of the Port Authority's latest monitoring
report for the first half of 1999 shows Station and the Flamingo
have failed to achieve some minority business goals.
</P>
<P>
   - The city requires the casinos to purchase 35 percent of all
goods and services from minority- and women-owned vendors. In the
first six months of this year, Station reported 6.5 percent
compliance and the Flamingo 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Both casinos met or exceeded the city's 35 percent quota for
minority and female employees.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, John V. Finamore, Station's Midwest
president, said vendor goals had posed a challenge since 1997 for a
variety of reasons, including restrictive wholesale liquor laws,
unique purchasing needs such as slot machines and playing cards,
and the necessity for vendors to pass background checks and be
licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to shirk our goals,'' said Finamore. ``It is
difficult to find vendors who can pass the background check and are
competitively priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Black Chamber of Commerce recently announced its
opposition to Station's purchase of the Flamingo based on its
vendor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said the company had met with minority vendors in the
past and had a meeting set Friday with the chamber to explain its
position.
