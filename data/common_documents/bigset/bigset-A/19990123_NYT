CITY BACKS EASED VERSION OF STREE VENDING BAN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven months ater the Giuliani administration backed
away from a plan to ban street vending in large parts of Manhattan,
a city panel approved a compromise measure on Thursday that still
bans food carts and other vendors, but from far fewer blocks than
its original plan did.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, as part of his quality of life campaign, Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani called for limits on street vendors, saying
they congested the city's sidewalks. On May 24, the Street Vendor
Review Panel, made up of three administration officials appointed
by the mayor, voted to ban food vendors from 300 blocks in
Manhattan and other street vendors from 261 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, after howls of protest and threats of lawsuits,
Giuliani retreated from his original proposal. Administration
officials said at the time the mayor would not give up his efforts
to limit street vending but made clear they were looking for a
compromise solution.
</P>
<P>
   Current law does not allow the review panel to restrict the
number of vendors on each block, but that issue is one that the
city council is expected to debate in hearings next month.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations passed Thursday would prohibit food vending
on 100 blocks, mostly in midtown and downtown Manhattan. It would
restrict other vendors, who sell everything from books to incense,
on 49 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions vary from block to block, but, generally, in
the financial district, vendors must stay off restricted blocks
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday. In midtown, vendors
must generally avoid the restricted blocks every day from 7 a.m. to
7 p.m. Food vendors have also been barred from two blocks in Queens
and five blocks in downtown Brooklyn along Fulton Street.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors said that the restrictions would only increase
congestion by crowding vendors onto other streets.
</P>
<P>
   The new ban will go into effect 30 days after the list of blocks
is published in The City Record, the city's daily journal of public
transactions. Curt Ritter, a spokesman for Giuliani, said he
expected the list to be published by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rossi, vice president of the Big Apple Food Vendors
Association, said the new plan allows more vending downtown, but
maintains most of the original plan's restrictions in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't cut us much slack,'' he said. ``You are pushing
vendors into a smaller area. You are just concentrating the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The business districts want one push cart per intersection, the
vendors want to allow four and oppose block by block bans, Rossi
said. Pablo Ruiz, 38, has sold $2 tacos and $1.75 burritos at the
corner of Eighth Avenue and 38th Street for four years, but the new
restrictions would ban food vendors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man,'' Ruiz said when told of the new restrictions. Ruiz
said he caters to Mexican and other Hispanic immigrants who work in
nearby factories, and would lose all his customers if he was forced
to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spot is for Mexican people,'' he said. ``This is where my
people are.''

UNLV WAGERS THAT ROBINSON CAN BUILD WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG SPOON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely a month into his new job as head football coach at
Nevada-Las Vegas, John Robinson learned first-hand how the folks in
Las Vegas define the term ``rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials, who previously allocated $18 million for the
renovation of Sam Boyd Stadium, gathered with Robinson and local
media last week to say goodbye to the old press box. But instead of
simply dismantling it, they blew it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we do things in Vegas,'' said UNLV publicist
Mark Wallington, referring to the city's practice of imploding
outdated hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who admitted to watching ``a few small charges'' go
off, said the story probably was exaggerated. UNLV administrators
are gambling that their hopes for Robinson are not.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 63, was hired Dec. 3 to take over a team that has lost
16 consecutive games. Fired a year earlier after an unimpressive
second stint at USC, Robinson was dabbling in broadcasting and
enjoying time with his wife Linda when the Rebels came calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some other agendas and I wasn't sure what I was going to
do,'' Robinson said in a phone interview. ``They came asking me
about it and they were pretty aggressive. The school president
(Carol C. Harter) pretty much convinced me they wanted to make some
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of changes, Robinson isn't exactly sure. Win some
games, no doubt. The specifics? That's what they're paying him for
_ $350,000 a year for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been genuinely impressed by coach Robinson's enthusiasm
about the task at hand,'' said UNLV athletic director Charles
Cavagnaro. It is now up to Robinson to convert that enthusiasm into
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what changes they want to make,'' Robinson
said. ``Basically, they said, `You give us the vision and we'll
follow it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous for us to make lofty predictions, but UNLV
football will be on the move. We are going to be second to none and
we're going to recruit the best players possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Robinson and USC fans learned the past few years, it is
not enough simply to bring in a name coach who has won before.
Robinson, 104-35-4 lifetime as a college coach, led the Trojans to
a 9-2-1 record and a Rose Bowl victory in his third year back in
1995. But 6-6 and 6-5 seasons and two years without a bowl
appearance led to his dismissal following the 1997 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV has little in the way of returning impact players. Running
back James Wofford, who rushed for 816 yards and five touchdowns,
is back. So is leading receiver Len Ware and standout defensive
back Randy Black. But the only quarterback returning is sophomore
Chris Hayward, who attempted only 37 passes as a third-stringer
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson must take this group and blend it with newcomers well
enough to make improvements in a new conference. UNLV will play
next season in the Mountain West Conference, which includes Air
Force, Utah and BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the weak link in the conference, but we're not going to
stay there,'' Robinson promised.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in school history, UNLV has funded the
maximum 85 football scholarships allowed by the NCAA. Robinson had
19 scholarships available and has received 10 oral commitments so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are two quarterbacks who might see playing time
quickly. They are Jason Vaughn (6-foot-4, 205 pounds), a transfer
from Middle Georgia Junior College who will participate in spring
drills, and Ryan Hanson (6-2, 210), who passed for 3,082 yards and
31 touchdowns at Los Alamitos High.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has also received a commitment from one of Nevada's top
prep prospects, quarterback and defensive back Lawrence Turner of
Cheyenne High. All-state JC offensive lineman Greg Hulett (6-3,
290) of Los Angeles Valley College recently committed, as did wide
receiver Nate Turner (6-2, 205) of Compton College.
</P>
<P>
   He is setting his sights high with a few more holes to fill
before the Feb. 3 signing date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recruited here, but they recruited at a low level,''
Robinson said about previous recruiting efforts. ``I don't want to
talk negative about the old group (of coaches), but they kind of
recruited the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare us to Arizona State when they recruit against
USC and UCLA. They end up with guys you thought had no reason to go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson won't discuss details of the bitter end at USC, but he
admits a fresh beginning was better for all in the long run. At
UNLV, as he did when he first returned to USC, he has the dream and
he believes he has the backing from administrators. The proof,
however, will be in the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think coach Robinson would have come to join us if he
didn't believe the commitment was there at the top,'' Harter said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will the commitment on the football field be
enough to make a difference?

CALDOR, A DISCOUNTER MIRED IN BANKRUPTCY, TO CLOSE ITS STORES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Conn., Mich.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWALK, Conn. _ Caldor Corp., the discount retail chain that
filed for bankruptcy more than three years ago and has since
struggled to stay afloat, announced Friday that it would liquidate
its holdings and close all of its 145 stores in nine East Coast
states.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, company officials said in a statement, stems from
its inability to negotiate a reorganization plan with a group of
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Caldor's chairman, Warren D. Feldberg, said that the company had
explored a number of options, including court-ordered mediation
with its creditors, since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was left with no alternative but an orderly
wind-down and liquidation,'' Feldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that Caldor would begin
going-out-of-business and that the closing of the stores should be
complete by mid-May. Besides selling its inventory, company
officials said they intended to sell off Caldor's real estate
holdings. The company leases all but three of its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Feldberg also said that many of the company's 20,000 employees
would be retained during the liquidation process, but it did not
say how many, or what sort of severance program would be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is working on a package for severance and extended
medical care but it is too early to discuss any specifics,'' said
Wendi Kopsick, a Caldor spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kopsick said that the staff at the corporate headquarters
here was being reduced immediately to a core group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were layoffs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1951 and has
$2.5 billion in sales. At the corporate headquarters here, workers
carrying cardboard boxes filed out of the building after learning
of the liquidation at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph C. Carbone, 62, of Southampton, N.Y., said he and other
employees were notified of the closing at a meeting in the
Bridgehampton, N.Y., store. ``It's a little sad, but we're hoping
someone else takes it over,'' said Carbone, who has worked for nine
years in the auto and hardware sections. He added, ``There's a
certain amount of sadness but no tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which was delisted last year by the New York Stock
Exchange, announced two weeks ago that it was no longer placing
orders or accepting deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been recent reports that Caldor was trying to
sell 64 of its stores to other retailers, including Kohl's, a chain
of department stores mainly located in the Middle West; Dayton
Hudson Corp., which owns the Target discount chain, or Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Kohl's and Dayton Hudson were not returned; no one
answered the telephone at Kmart headquarters in Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of interest in the sites, but it is too
early to discuss specifics,'' Ms. Kopsick said.

SUSAN STRASBERG, 60, ACTRESS LAUDED IN `ANNE FRANK,' DIES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN:  Calif.,  Scotland, Botswana, Spain, Greece)   By MEL GUSSOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with
her luminous portrayal of the title role of ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' and _ with highs and lows professional and private _ went
on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home
in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors
Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her
childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater,
people who were, she said, ``supremely talented, alive, sensitive,
eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was
unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an
off-Broadway play and had acted in two films, ``The Cobweb'' and
``Picnic,'' that had not been released. She had never studied
acting with her father.
</P>
<P>
   With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited
theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first
major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson
characterized her as ``a slender, enchanting young lady with a
heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her
performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the
interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own
and with her director, Garson Kanin. ``When we saw Susie in action
we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Strasberg said at
the time. ``I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never
had any formal training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement
heralded her as ``a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a
model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ``Maya,'' and
followed that with several roles on television, including ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.
</P>
<P>
   She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer
Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was
postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was
in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ``Picnic.''
Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play
``The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.
</P>
<P>
   The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning
the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award
and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified
Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater
marquee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean
Anouilh's ``Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors
Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ``Shadow of a Gunman'' and then
she toured with Franchot Tone in ``Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963
she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's
production of ``The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two
films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was
soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ``Stage Struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Within several years, her career had crested and her private
life was in turmoil. In the early 1960s she was using a wide
variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was
titled ``Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her
marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter,
Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg
blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking
the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A reason she wrote her book, she said, was that her career was
stalled: ``It become totally untenable to me that after acting for
25 years _ I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank _ there I
was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.''
Her films include ``Kapo,'' ``The Trip,'' ``Manitou,'' ``Delta
Force'' and ``Prime Suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied
with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being
overly supervisory about her daughter's work.
</P>
<P>
   She was also close to some of her father's students, especially
Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ``Bittersweet'' and in her
1992 book, ``Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms.
Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and
New York, and by two half-brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her
Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After
that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her
parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Tone
offered a toast: ``Little Susan, you have been launched on a long
and glittering career.''

NERDISTANS: A PLACE TO PLEASE TECHIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Ill. Texas. Pa. N.C., Conn., N.J.)   Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow with the Pepperdine Institute for
Public Policy. (DW) 
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ After just three years, the founders of the hot
high-technology start-up were bumping against a familiar problem.
They knew they had maxed out the potential of the backwater burg
where they had founded the company. To keep attracting the number
and caliber of skilled employees they needed, they had to move the
company to where the action was.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was time for Broadcom to forsake sleepy little Los
Angeles and make its mark in the high-technology metropolis of
Irvine, an hour's drive south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were reaching a critical mass; we had to go somewhere
that's suited to building a big high-tech company,'' explained
Henry T. Nicholas, who with Henry Samueli started Broadcom, a
communications chip and cable modem maker, in 1992 when the two men
were professors at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, Broadcom's chief executive, says he misses the city's
night life and cultural ambiance. But, recalling how hard it was to
recruit people to move to Los Angeles, he felt he had little
choice. ``It's hard to relocate techies to L.A.,'' he said. ``It's
the congestion, expensive housing _ and there's a certain stigma to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine, on the other hand, is what you might call a nerdistan: a
suburban enclave of subdivisions, shopping centers and business
parks where scientists, engineers and technicians feel comfortable
living and working. For technology companies, it is everything a
traditional urban center should be but isn't: a strategic location
where the relevant partners, competitors, money and knowhow are all
close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Most nerdistans have appeared on leafy peripheries of
metropolitan areas, close to major airports, universities and
science-based industries but far from inner-city problems and
annoyances. High concentrations of technology workers and companies
have flocked together in suburbs of Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los
Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, in the Research Triangle area
of North Carolina, and in Silicon Valley, the original and still
champion nerdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Irvine, most nerdistans are less bedroom communities than
what the Purdue University historian Jon C. Teaford calls
post-suburbia _ economically and culturally self-sufficient areas
that ring traditional core cities but are largely insulated from
them.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern is clear in sprawling Los Angeles County, which
leads the nation in the number of high-technology jobs but ranks
15th in technology workers as a share of the work force, according
to a study by researchers at WEFA, an economic research
organization; neighboring Orange County, where Irvine is, ranks
seventh. A map of Los Angeles County's technology companies finds a
vast majority in peripheral areas miles from the center of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, despite media buzz about Silicon Alley, most
technology jobs in the New York City area are in the suburbs, not
in Manhattan. The periphery's share of the region's
computer-related jobs grew to more than 80 percent in 1996 from 68
percent in 1982, according to a study at the University of Miami.
Sections of Fairfield County, Conn., and northwestern New Jersey
rank among the top 15 places in the country for most technology
workers per capita; New York City ranks 80th, according to WEFA.
</P>
<P>
   Nerdistans can also be defined by what they generally do not
have, said John Kasarda of the University of North Carolina. There
are no ports or railroad yards, but technology work does not
require them. There are no venerable art museums or symphony
orchestras, but technology workers generally do not miss such
amenities. There are usually no homeless people or derelict
buildings in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get rid of the problems of the city by charging for the
exits,'' said Kasarda, who has studied the movement of
high-technology companies in the Raleigh-Durham area and elsewhere.
``For these people, the city is superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get started, nerdistans snowball. Richard Holcomb,
president of the Raleigh-based Haht Software, said the presence of
a herd of big technology companies like Data General, IBM and
Burroughs-Wellcome provides a pool of seasoned workers for
start-ups to tap. ``You can get a great job, and if this one
doesn't work out, you can just go down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the technology sector's generally high pay, nerdistans are
evolving into centers of wealth, with demographics to match. In
Irvine, which is also home to a University of California campus,
almost two-fifths of households earn more than $75,000 a year, and
more than half the adult population is college-educated, compared
with one-fifth for the country as a whole. Not quite as ``white
bread'' as its reputation, Irvine has a population of 122,000 that
is 70 percent Caucasian and 22 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Not all nerdistans are alike, though. Older, unplanned centers
like Silicon Valley and southwestern Connecticut are becoming
victims of their own success, plagued by congestion, housing
shortages and struggling public schools. Newer planned communities
like Irvine and the Research Triangle seem to be coping better,
Kasarda said. That translates into a competitive advantage in
recruiting scientists and engineers, especially those with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very planned place,'' said Nancy Venable, a technology
support engineer and divorced mother of a teen-age girl who moved
last year from Charlotte, N.C., to take a job at Wonderware, a
factory automation company based in Irvine. ``You don't have to
join an association to get to a pool, and everything has been
placed close to where you live. The schools are good. It's safe,
it's clean, it's easy to get around, and it's new. Engineers love
new tools.''

<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, they have a shot at the third-ranked
Cardinal if they get a semblance of what Todd MacCulloch gave them
Thursday night in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome,'' guard Donald Watts said. ``He made a few
moves that kind of surprised me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd wasn't going to let us lose. If we get everybody on the
court playing with that kind of focus, we can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch had a line for the ages against Cal, a team good
enough to have beaten North Carolina: 13 of 14 from the field and 5
of 5 from the foul line for 31 points; 17 rebounds, three blocks,
three steals, two assists, two fouls and no turnovers in 37
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be a stretch to say that MacCulloch made himself
some money against Cal. He was playing against an athletic, if
unpolished, center in 7-foot Francisco Elson.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight stays trained on him Saturday. For the fifth time
in his UW career, MacCulloch faces Stanford's 7-2 Tim Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd like to be known as the best center in the
Pac-10,'' MacCulloch conceded. ``With the centers in this league,
if people consider that of me, that's a great honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it will not be as easy as it seemed against Cal for
MacCulloch, who said afterwards he felt he could do anything.
Playing against Stanford's brawlers is a little like getting into a
car accident; it can take a major toll on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the anticipated pounding from Stanford's front line,
MacCulloch said, ``I don't see why they wouldn't try to. And I've
got to try to push them out of their comfort area.''
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't necessarily what UW coach Bob Bender wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes a wrestling match inside, he can step away from
the basket,'' Bender said. ``Taking him away from the basket is
going to give us some opportunities to take it to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   What benefited Washington in the second half at Cal was the move
of MacCulloch out of the low post, opening up some lanes for Husky
perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   If MacCulloch gets trapped into a shoving match down low and the
Husky ball movement is stagnant on the perimeter, Stanford (16-2,
6-0) might win by about its average margin in Pac-10 games: 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tremendous,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of curiosity to the MacCulloch-Young
rivalry. Both are fifth-year seniors, MacCulloch having redshirted
as a freshman for development and Young having sat out the 1995-96
season with back problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four games head-to-head, there has never been one in
which each performed well. Both players have had two good games,
one at home and one on the road, and two sub-par ones.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch, however, has emerged as the dominant player this
year, third in the Pac-10 in scoring (18.7) and first in rebounding
(11.1) and blocks (1.69). Young, a lesser light on a better team,
averages 9.3 points and 6.4 rebounds while playing seven minutes a
game less.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Seattle when the Huskies faced Stanford for the
first time in conference play, the Cardinal was 18-0 and won on
Kris Weems' 3-pointer at the buzzer. Now, Stanford is on a streak
of 12 straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal is a third of the way to becoming the first team in
the 21-year history of the Pac-10 to go unbeaten in league play.
And performances like the 94-45 annihilation of Washington State
Thursday night are fanning speculation that it might happen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies can't foil Stanford's dreamy scenario, at least
they know it won't have been a lost weekend.

WASHINGTON NEEDS NO STOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Excuse the Washington Huskies if they wake up Saturday
morning with their energy level already percolating.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal have recently dominated the Pac-10 rivalry that
resumes Saturday at 5 p.m. at Edmundson Pavilion, where the Huskies
have been unbeatable in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   They are 4-0 at home this season and none of the games has been
decided by fewer than 10 points. The Huskies beat Washington State
and Arizona State by 32 points, defeated Arizona 73-63 and whomped
California by 22 points Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   So much for appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer might have been reading the
Huskies' minds earlier this week when she said, ``Opponents are
licking their chops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's premier program during VanDerveer's 13-year career
on The Farm _ the Cardinal is a remarkable 174-30 in conference
play during that span _ Stanford already has lost more conference
games this season (two) than in any season since 1993-94, when it
was 15-3. Stanford is 8-9 overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of team,'' VanDerveer said. ``We just
had five great players leave at the same time, and that created a
huge void in experience. But at the same time, it is real exciting
to see such great production from the freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Donaphin, a 6-foot-2 first-year forward from New York,
barely missed her third Pac-10 double-double Thursday night against
Washington State when she scored 16 points and had nine rebounds.
Freshman guard Lindsey Yamasaki leads the team with a 14.4 scoring
average, including 32 in a loss to Santa Clara in December.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite having just one senior, forward/guard Regan Fruen,
the Cardinal is tied for third in the Pac-10 with a 4-2 record. The
more experienced Huskies are alone in second at 5-1, one game
behind No. 10-ranked UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   To stay close to the Bruins and ahead of the Cardinal, the
Huskies must end a streak of nine consecutive losses to Stanford,
which leads the overall series 19-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominance in the past doesn't matter,'' VanDerveer said. ``It
just gives other teams more motivation to play against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's last win against Stanford was Jan. 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That was before current Husky seniors Jamie Redd, Amber Hall,
Malinda Lynch and Molly Hills entered college. Saturday is their
final chance to beat the Cardinal at home.
</P>
<P>
   Redd needs 12 points to pass Rhonda Smith and move into first
place on the Huskies' all-time scoring list. Hall, who scored 18
points and had 11 rebounds in the win over Cal, has eight
double-doubles this season and leads the Pac-10 in rebounding,
averaging 10.2 a game. She led the league the past two seasons.

SONICS HOPE OWENS CAN SHED `LAID-BACK' LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is what they are saying about Billy Owens now _
he will be an adequate backup for Detlef Schrempf, providing points
and rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it has come to for Billy Owens _ a 29-year-old in
the prime of his career whose destination was stardom, not Seattle,
a former All-America and No. 3 overall draft pick reduced to role
player.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with that in Owens' mind. He figures to
help the Sonics with his rebounding and versatility. It's just that
everyone expected a quantum vertical leap from Owens and,
comparatively speaking, the 6-foot-9 forward has barely gotten his
feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a three-year contract worth more than $6 million,
Owens participated in his first practice as a Sonic Friday night
and looked sharp. He went up and under Dale Ellis for a layin. He
grabbed a defensive rebound, led the fast break and passed to Gary
Payton for a three. He pulled down an offensive rebound and laid it
in. There will be nights when he dazzles, others when he struggles.
</P>
<P>
   How did Owens go from headlines on the front page to small type
in the boxscore? It might have been caused by his effort and
intensity, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   That's the rap on Owens, however unfair. From all accounts he is
a good guy and good player. It's just that with a little more
gumption, he could have been more on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Owens is delighted to be here, relishing his next
opportunity, conceding that his relaxed approach to the game might
have been detrimental early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have got high expectations and put the label on you as
an All-Star,'' he said. ``I admit, my first three years, I was
laid-back and I took (time) off in the summertime.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not look like it, but he cares about what's happening on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody runs around like Reggie Miller,'' Owens said. ``You've
got different types of basketball players. I might be quiet, but
I'm not trying to be quiet this year. A lot of people say I take it
easy. I want to shut a lot of people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will flourish here with a winner, surrounded by a
team that might better use his talents. Maybe he will recapture the
collegiate brilliance he enjoyed at Syracuse that at one time
prompted comparisons to Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Owens joined the Orangemen as one of Jim Boeheim's most heralded
recruits. The young man had just led Carlisle High School to its
fourth straight Pennsylvania state championship with Owens scoring
53 points in the title game. He was named the U.S. High School
Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   At Syracuse, the rise continued with more All-America honors and
selection as 1991 Big East Conference player of the year his junior
season after averaging 23.3 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists and
2.4 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his ball-handling and all-around ability, Villanova
coach Rollie Massimino called him ``a Magic Johnson who can
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Owens shined. Even his coach noticed a great player
who was not assertive enough in spite of statistics that said
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't take over,'' Boeheim said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   During Owens' first visit to Seattle, he played for the U.S.
national team at the Goodwill Games in 1990. He was the leading
scorer (21.4) for the silver-medalists and yet, coaches who watched
the team play and work out wondered about Owens' effort.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, who was then coaching the Golden State Warriors,
said: ``He has terrific skills and he's an intelligent player. If
there is a negative, he can move his intensity level up. I don't
think he plays as hard as he can all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Del Harris, then coaching the Milwaukee Bucks: ``He's a
highly talented player, but he's the kind of player I have trouble
with personally. The game comes so easily for him, he doesn't look
like he's trying. As good as he is, I feel there's another level he
could play at if he pushes himself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not sea level, but not the summit either. Owens
is somewhere inbetween, and it's hard to determine whether he's
ascending, descending or perched on some rock outcropping in the
middle of his climb. Everyone, it seems, keeps waiting for
elevation in his game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were hopeful, not once but twice. They selected Owens
with the third pick in the '91 draft but sent him to Golden State
on the eve of the '91-92 season for three players, one of whom was
Mitch Richmond, a many-time All-Star. No one would take Owens for
Richmond straight up now.
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie season, Owens was on the Warriors team that the
Sonics stunned in the first round during George Karl's first season
in Seattle. He averaged 14.3 points and became the first
undergraduate to unanimously be named to the first-team NBA
All-Rookie squad since Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon made it
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After being traded to Miami in 1994, Owens was maligned by coach
Pat Riley, who wants workaholics to put in 25-hour days. Tim
Hardaway, his former teammate at Golden State, also was not a fan
of Owens. Hardaway believed that Owens was squandering his ability
by not working hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento got him back in a four-player deal in '96, and Owens'
reputation clung to him like his jersey. No. 30 was perceived to
not be totally dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the positive spin on the downward developments.
Although inconsistent last year, Owens received fluctuating minutes
from coach Eddie Jordan. Owens played out of position for much of
the season at power forward, also affecting his production.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' scoring average has dropped the past five seasons and
shooting percentage the past four. But he has worked on his
perimeter shot and has improved his 3-point accuracy the past three
seasons. He has bulked up in the offseason, hitting the weights in
preparation for hitting the boards.
</P>
<P>
   You will come to know him as Billy O, another transplanted
Sacramento King who brings vital attributes to Seattle along with
Olden Polynice. He won't have O.P.'s exuberance but then, neither
did Derrick McKey or Sam Perkins, both of whom factored highly in
Sonics' playoff runs in the past.

JUDGE RULES MAGAZINE MUST PAY DUSTIN HOFFMAN FOR ALTERED PHOTO

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a ruling that could change how celebrity images
are used, a judge has ordered Los Angeles magazine to pay Dustin
Hoffman $1.5 million because he was ``violated by technology'' when
the magazine digitally altered a photo from his movie ``Tootsie.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer was used to gussy the actor up in a dress and heels.
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian also said in Friday's ruling
that in its presentation of Hoffman and other stars in the
pictorial, the magazine acted maliciously, a remark that sets up
the possibility for an even bigger punitive damages award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photos were manipulated and cannibalized to such an extent
that the celebrities were commercially exploited and were robbed of
their dignity, professionalism and talent,'' Tevrizian wrote in a
20-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set a hearing for Thursday to determine how much the
magazine owes in punitive damages. A spokesman for Capital Cities
ABC, the magazine's Washington, D.C.-based parent company, said the
verdict will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Rex Heinke, who has defended the media in many other
First Amendment cases, pointed out that the technology used in the
Hoffman case ``wasn't even feasible a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinke said the ruling wouldn't make it easier for celebrities
to sue over editorial articles based on parody. But he doubted that
the $1.5 million verdict would go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a substantial number that is going to get the
attention of people in the media and advertising world,'' Heinke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman sued in April 1997, just a few weeks after the ``Grand
Illusions'' fashion layout appeared.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand for two days during trial last week,
Hoffman claimed that the magazine trivialized his character from
the hit movie by making readers believe he had re-created the role
for an advertising supplement.
</P>
<P>
   In several hours of emotional testimony, Hoffman suggested that
other actors who saw the layout might assume his career was
spiraling downward after 30 years of A-list movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fish in the ocean. The sharks don't bother you
unless they think you are wounded,'' Hoffman said Tuesday. ``That
to me signified a wounded career.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevrizian agreed, explaining in his ruling that $1.5 million is
``fair market value'' for an endorsement from an actor of Hoffman's
stature. The judge, who called Hoffman ``truly one of our country's
living treasures,'' scolded the magazine for its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles (magazine) fabricated an image of Dustin Hoffman
using computer digitalization techniques, and then published that
image knowing it was false,'' Tevrizian wrote. ``To be blunt, the
celebrities were violated by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney-owned Capital Cities ABC released a short statement,
reiterating its lawyers' trial argument that the layout was meant
to be a humorous article, not an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the result and plan to appeal,'' the
statement said. ``Editorial use of the material in question is
protected by the First Amendment, and we strongly believe our use
was appropriate and protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The layout was filled with altered photographs of living and
dead stars, including Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman, all in modern fashions with the designers' names listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's picture included his head and the background shot of
an American flag from a 1982 ``Tootsie'' poster, seamlessly merged
with the body of another man dressed in 1997 fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The caption read: ``Dustin Hoffman isn't a drag in a
butter-colored silk gown by Richard Tyler and Ralph Lauren heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman claimed he hadn't been paid for a domestic commercial
since he made $3,000 for a Volkswagen ad in 1966 _ a year before
his starring turn in ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's lawyer, Charles Shephard, said the First Amendment
didn't protect the magazine because editors knew the information
was false, and didn't use it to promote any news angle.
</P>
<P>
   Shephard pointed out that at least one of the items that the
actor was ``wearing'' belonged to a major advertiser for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at this and not think that these designers were
being promoted,'' Shephard said. &QL;

   Explains Susan Freeman, a partner in the firm's finance and
bankruptcy group: ``In a real case, the charges wouldn't have
survived a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   I gathered some of the brightest trial litigation minds at Lewis
and Roca to scrutinize the impeachment trial. The law &UR; firm's
conference room is abuzz as they answer such questions as ``Is good
law being practiced?'' ``How is the case being presented?'' ``Is
America witnessing stellar legal arguments?'' and ``Will the
president win the case?''
</P>
<P>
   My findings? The trial is a sham. Legal proceedings such as this
one simply don't exist in the American justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Let these attorneys explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   No one has determined whether President Clinton committed an
offense worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a lot more respect for the senators if they had
answered that question,'' says Robert H. McKirgan, practice manager
in charge of the firm's commercial litigation group. ``Basically,
they're holding a trial without determining whether an offense has
been committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``real'' jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real case, the jurors are neutral,'' quips Dawn M.
Bergin, a member of the firm's civil/business litigation group.
``Not a bunch of senators who have stake in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 3:
</P>
<P>
   There were no opening statements to lay out the facts that will
be presented during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, what we're hearing is closing arguments,'' says
Shelia Carmody, a partner in the firm's tort group.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, there are more basic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, they say, cases like the one against
President Clinton are uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see many perjury cases. They are very, very rare,''
McKirgan says.
</P>
<P>
   There are other legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Would a federal prosecutor press criminal perjury charges
against a person from a private civil case?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're way too busy for that,'' Norris says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, would the charges have survived a grand jury?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not with the attorney who grilled the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a very poor job cross-examining the president,'' says
Irish, who teaches such techniques at the National Institute for
Trial Advocacy. ``He would have gotten a D in my class.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been proud moments. The attorneys cite the
performance of White House counsel Cheryl Mills and the inspiring
performance by retired Sen. Dale Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a lot of it, however,'' Norris says. ``For
the most part, it has been very painful to watch the kind of
lawyering that has been practiced in this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys then begin a conversation about the damage the
presidential trial could have on the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system is grounded in the truth. If you don't have
the truth, the whole system is jeopardized,'' says Carmody. She
observes that no one, not even Clinton, should get away with lying
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Norris asks, ``Will this feed into the growing cynicism of the
justice system and how justice is administered?''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman presents a presidential concern: ``Are we creating a
system, like a parliament, in which the president serves at the
pleasure of the senators?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, President Clinton's trial will have one
benefit:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kenneth Starr examination? We should show it to our
associates and tell them, `This is how not to conduct a
cross-examination,' '' McKirgan says.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, seems to be able to tell me whether President
Clinton will win the case. It's not a real court of law, after &UR; all,
they explain again. Just politics. &QL;

   But the six high-powered trial attorneys at Lewis and Roca call
President Clinton's trial as they see it: ``A big joke.''

   ``It's not a real trial, not under the American legal system,''

Condensed diet product unlikely to be too tasty
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Considering the proliferation of bad teams and, hence, the
preponderance of awful games over the past several NBA seasons,
it's arguable this barnstorming schedule the strife-torn league is
shoving down the customers' throats will provide a level of play
that's no less satisfying than the expansion-era status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, even under the best of circumstances, Nuggets vs.
Mavericks traditionally has been a poor investment of time as well
as money.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps, knock on wood, the lack of practice hours might
rein in the coaches' convoluting instincts a bit. They deserve a
significant share of the blame for robbing their sport of its
natural grace, what with the overdone isolation tactics and
stifling defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Pro hoops is supposed to be about running and jumping, not
standing around or participating in a scrum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 50 games in 90 days the Rockets will play _ compared
to 82 over 171 this past season _ seems like an awful lot of
running and jumping in a compacted period. Factor in the normal
transit grind and jet lag plus the likely weather crisis or two and
we are going to witness some excruciatingly blah, brain-dead,
leg-weary performances before the playoffs mercifully roll around.
</P>
<P>
   Then at least, the second-season adrenalin rush will carry the
lads the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who flies regularly on business knows the toll it
extracts. Imagine the beating these guys are going to endure
dragging their oversized torsos on and off airplanes day after day
after day. When Charles Barkley terms the scheduling of three games
in three nights ``stupid,'' he's not just being the Chuckster and
mouthing off. It is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But unavoidable, because David Stern's magic number was 50
games. If ever there figures to be a survival-of-the-fittest,
last-team-standing season, this will be the one. Other than Hakeem
Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, trainer Keith Jones might be the most
crucial member of the Rockets' family.
</P>
<P>
   Boy is he going to be busy when the Rockets hit their
five-games, six-nights, five-cities ordeal in mid-February. Buy
stock in muscle balm, people.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich looks ready, though. He appears to have
lost about 25 pounds since last season. Maybe he assumes he'll have
to suit up at some point when the bodies start dropping around him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, of course, lost three full practices during the
interminable wait for the ink to dry on Pippen's complicated
sign-and-trade contract, but that ultimately insignificant delay in
getting under way might prove fortuitous for the long haul. The
Rockets, you see, will be more ``rested'' when the
marathon-turned-sprint of a season starts Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Before the aforementioned long march from Houston to Minnesota
to Florida via New Jersey, the Rockets receive a four-day respite
after playing five times in seven days at the outset. Thereafter,
they have mere back-to-back days off on only five occasions, and
not until April 27-28 are they fully travel-free for both.
</P>
<P>
   Once the abbreviated training camp ends, Tomjanovich could wind
up with no more than a dozen regular workouts over the duration of
the entire season. If practice does indeed make perfect, you won't
be seeing much perfect _ and I doubt Leslie Alexander will be
offering any money-back guarantees for what's likely to be, on more
occasions than not, a horribly ragged product.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rockets surely will be one of the top teams. Imagine
how dreadful the dregs will be. We could end up seeing even more of
a gross imbalance between the contenders and the fodder than we've
come to expect. Ironically, Chicago could be the worst of the
worst, too. One dire prediction has the disassem-Bulls winning 10
fewer games than the next most godawful team.
</P>
<P>
   With Chicago in a free-fall mode, the East will be a horrific
bore. Imagine how unattractive the overcrowded schedules of those
teams will be. A lucky fan might see Milwaukee, Toronto and Boston
on consecutive nights, and spend $1,500 or more for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Through Stern, the NBA speaks high-mindedly of the need for at
least 50 dates to preserve the season's ``legitimacy,'' but what
the cramming is really all about is salvaging revenues. To preserve
the same games-to-days ratio as last year's schedule would have
limited the season to a maximum of 43, a further financial
sacrifice the owners weren't about to endure.
</P>
<P>
   You kidding? Enough season-ticket cash has been painfully
rebated. So, Houston, you'll get to pay to see the Clippers twice,
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   If quality were the real priority, the season would have been
shortened to no more than 40 games. The colleges somehow manage to
identify a legitimate national champion with fewer, don't they?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as skewed as this NBA season is, a worthy _ albeit
bushed _ successor to the Bulls will emerge in late June. The
debate is whether a noble end will justify the sloppy,
helter-skelter means. Your answer probably depends on how many
dollars you have tied up in your seats, and which city you call
home.

FOX'S REGIONAL ATTITUDE KEEPS TCU WELL-EXPOSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere across the great state of Texas, or perhaps Oklahoma,
Louisiana, Arkansas or New Mexico, some young hoop phenom might
tune in to Fox Sports Southwest tonight to watch the TCU Horned
Frogs play the Nevada-Las Vegas at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the kind of athlete who might carry a Top 25 program
to the Sweet 16 or, someday, maybe even a Final Four. And, having
seen the merits of TCU, Fort Worth and Frogs basketball on the
small screen, he might decide to visit the campus, even sign a
letter of intent to attend the school.
</P>
<P>
   Or so TCU basketball coach Billy Tubbs no doubt hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game against UNLV and Monday's at Tulsa are two more
opportunities for Tubbs and TCU to sell the program to potential
recruits via television, in this case Fox Sports Southwest. The
games are also a great way to reach out and touch far-flung alumni
and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sports Southwest regional package features five TCU
games this season, a nice local complement to the Frogs' occasional
national exposure on ESPN and ESPN2. Previously, TCU appeared on
Fox in games against Texas Tech and Gonzaga. The SMU-TCU game Feb.
6 is also scheduled for air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about exposure more than anything else,'' said Brian
Estridge, director of broadcasting at TCU. ``With TV, it's a `show
it and they will come' philosophy. It's good for our recruiting. It
makes us seem big time.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU is sharing Fox Sports Southwest's regional basketball
package with SMU, Tulsa and Rice. The Frogs get the most games
televised this season _ five _ thanks to their record last season,
which was the best among the group.
</P>
<P>
   The four schools fit nicely into Fox's regional sports
broadcasting effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all within our viewing area,'' explained Jon Heidtke,
vice president and general manager of Fox Sports Southwest.
``People tend to think of us as a Dallas-Fort Worth-area network,
but we're sensitive to all the regional product in our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV package is in its second season, and indications are that
it's a business and marketing success that's likely to be
continued. Heidtke said Fox likes the fact that the schools are
aggressive marketing partners, promoting the games on campus and to
their fans everywhere, making for grateful advertisers and
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, which covers the production costs of its games and receives
advertising revenue from the broadcasts, said the package is
basically a break-even one, financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good deal for us,'' Estridge said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not economics that make games like tonight's and
Monday's valuable to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get on TV, it kind of lights everybody up,'' Estridge
said. ``The players like it and Billy likes it. He loves to use the
term `exposures.' He wants us to get as many exposures as possible.
That way, they can tell recruits that they'll be on TV this many
times.''
HBO SHOW SCORES AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   HBO is first and foremost a movie channel, but its forays into
sports are first-rate, especially its ongoing series ``Real Sports
With Bryant Gumbel.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest installment, which airs at 9 p.m. Monday locally and
repeats throughout the week, is one of the most provocative. The
lead segment focuses on the growing problem of offshore sports
wagering via the Internet. Although the subject has been covered
elsewhere, Real Sports goes the extra mile _ literally _ traveling
to the Caribbean where bookmakers operate. Especially noteworthy is
the discovery of a company that claims to be licensed to operate in
Aruba but is actually run out of Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a segment on assistant coaches in the NFL that
looks at the grueling hours and constant job insecurity faced by
this group of men chasing the dream of becoming a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a show that lives up to its Emmy Award status. \Ntagtop:

Alexander is what an owner should be
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronice
</P>
<P>
   Team owners are like a box of chocolates, or so we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is sugar-coated. Everything is labeled with snappy
words. But once we sink our teeth into what they're really all
about, we realize they are just nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Adams. John McMullen. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
</P>
<P>
   We laughed at their antics and doubted their motives. We spent
years buying the stuff they tried to sell us, but then we knew
better. We heard all their billowy rebuttals to criticism, but we
finally had enough and showed them the highway.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen went on to own a hockey team called the Yankee Devils,
or something appropriate like that. Adams went on to show the fine
people of Petticoat Junction just what he is all about _ .500 or
below.
</P>
<P>
   When Leslie Alexander flew into town in this atmosphere of doubt
and deceit _ shortly after McMullen's departure and in the middle
of Adams' holding us hostage for a new stadium _ we had to figure
his carry-on luggage was a carpetbag.
</P>
<P>
   We had to doubt. We had to figure he would deceive, just like
the nutty box of chocolates we knew before. And we weren't the only
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander strode into town in 1993 without a smidgen of NBA
experience, telling everyone within earshot that he would be a
``very, very, very hands-on'' owner. And there was a collective
``uh-oh'' bouncing off the walls of the Rockets' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes rolled. Then a few heads did. A series of strange
front-office hires followed, and we figured here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander acted different and talked different, with a New York
accent _ ``ya know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Nuts, we said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich, probably the best thing the Rockets franchise
ever knew, quietly thought the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   We considered Rudy T one of us and trusted his instincts. He was
a sleeves-rolled man who put in long days and unwound with a cold
beer. Like the bumper sticker says: Rudy T wasn't born a Texan, but
he got here as fast as he could.
</P>
<P>
   When Tomjanovich privately doubted Alexander, we did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think Rudy wondered,'' Alexander said. ``He didn't
know what to expect from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there was a prevailing opinion that Alexander would:
</P>
<P>
   A) Move the Rockets to another city, presumably in Florida,
which he called home.
</P>
<P>
   B) Run the franchise into the ground by hacking the budget,
trimming the payroll and clipping more corners than a bad barber.
</P>
<P>
   C) Play general manager and make bad move after bad move.
</P>
<P>
   But now we know. Les is more.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trade for Scottie Pippen is one of the five biggest
deals the Rockets have ever made, along with those that brought
Moses Malone, Ralph Sampson, Clyde Drexler and Charles Barkley.
Three of the five came under Alexander's watch, and all of them
were considered stunners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we know. With Pippen arriving, possibly carrying the next
Rockets championship in his hands, we know Alexander should take a
bow for becoming what this town has wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   He is an owner who works like we work, dreams like we dream, and
expects what we expect. He got here as fast as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich and Alexander have built a unique but profound
relationship, even as their personalities and styles contrast.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of it all is a trust that Tomjanovich will coach
his backside off. Alexander will cover Rudy T's back with smart
moves and first-class surroundings, such as the upgraded team
plane, the improved practice facility and a checkbook that opens
wide at all the opportune times.
</P>
<P>
   Like this one. Pippen chose Houston because this is where he
wanted to be, as much because of Alexander as Tomjanovich. Barkley
turned down more money from Seattle for the same reasons. Hakeem
Olajuwon considers Alexander the best thing that ever happened to
this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   From the days of picking up the phone and calling agents as he
once did bond traders, trying to control everything, Alexander has
handed the line to executive VP Carroll Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   He has allowed the mistake-prone righthand man, John Thomas, to
move on and replaced him with the impressive George Postolos. He
has surrounded and rewarded handsomely a close circle of confidants
like Robert Barr, once the strength coach but now a vice president
and a huge asset in the Pippen deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you win championships,'' Alexander said. ``If you
save a few bucks here and there, it could cost you in the long

</P>
<P>
   He has transcended the box of chocolates we once knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for John McMullen, maybe people would have liked
me a little more at the start of this,'' Alexander says. ``Ya know
what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   After Drexler, Barkley and now Pippen, yes, we know.

HORSE-RACING INDUSTRY SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, the health of horse racing was like that
of a patient with a terminal illness. Last year, however, the sport
began showing signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   A national advertising campaign started. Fan interest perked up.
Sales prices of thoroughbreds skyrocketed. Many tracks whose
grandstands had been emptying recorded gains in attendance and
betting.
</P>
<P>
   The patient remains in critical condition. But at least phony
optimism has been replaced by a legitimate reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, it was a good year for an industry that needed
one,'' National Thoroughbred Racing Association chief executive
officer Tim Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing-oriented NTRA, which last year spent $22 million
of mostly industry-generated money in an attempt to increase
racing's public awareness, deserves much of the credit for halting
the sport's free fall. Its hard-edged ``Go Baby Go'' ad campaign
struck a chord with the MTV-ish audience for whom it was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors also went into racing's comeback, explained Smith,
who tries to remain politically correct by downplaying the
first-year impact of the NTRA.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Real Quiet's highly publicized near miss of a Triple
Crown sweep, one year after stablemate Silver Charm barely missed.
Also, the national economy was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real events are always as important or more important than
marketing,'' Smith said. ``But we didn't hurt. We played some
role.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA intends to spend about $30 million this year, and its
co-op advertising program with racetracks is slated for a 50
percent increase, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest focuses of this racing year will be the
launch of the Television Games Network, tentatively scheduled for
July.
</P>
<P>
   The network plans to offer live national and international
racing 24 hours a day on local cable systems. TVG's parent company,
United Video, is controlled by Telecommunications Inc. (TCI), a
cable giant that has more than 25 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   At-home wagering on horse races is not legal in Texas _ tracks
may seek that soon _ but Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie general
manager Corey Johnsen said he is likely to encourage area cable
systems to carry the channel because of the increased exposure it
will provide for racing.
</P>
<P>
   Even in markets where existing horseplayers will have the option
to stay home and bet on televised races, Smith said he believes the
network will create enough new fans to boost on-track attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA also has teamed with Fox Sports to create an 11-race
series for older handicap horses.
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA Champions on Fox series begins Jan. 30 with the Donn
Handicap at Miami-area Gulfstream Park. Each race will be
televised, either nationally on Fox Sports or on a Fox regional
sports channel. The series concludes with the Aug. 29 Pacific
Classic at Del Mar near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Having a superstar horse to compete in these races doesn't hurt,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away and Awesome Again, the leading candidates for 1998
horse of the year, have been retired. But barring injury, Silver
Charm could fill that role this year. Other big-name horses still
competing include Real Quiet, Victory Gallop and Free House.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert will be shooting for his third consecutive
Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes victories. His leading early
prospect is Exploit, unbeaten in four starts. The 3-year-old colt
belongs to Bob and Beverly Lewis of California, who also own Silver
Charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown begins May 1 with the Kentucky Derby, followed
by the May 15 Preakness and June 5 Belmont Stakes. The eight
Breeders' Cup races will be Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's thoroughbred season
is April 15-July 25. Tentative dates for the track's fall quarter
horse meet are Oct. 1-Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Houston Race Park in Houston is conducting live racing for
thoroughbreds until April 11, and has a July 2-Sept. 12 quarter
horse meet. Retama Park near San Antonio, the state's other Class 1
track, will run a mixed thoroughbred and quarter horse meet from
April 23-June 27 plus a July 30-Oct. 24 thoroughbred-only season.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Texas Racing Commission is expected to rule on an
application by Squaw Creek Downs in Willow Park _ formerly Trinity
Meadows _ to resume Class 2 live racing and simulcasting at the
site.

TCU PAYS WELL TO MAINTAIN ATHLETIC SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a Billy Tubbs fan, you are, de facto, a member of the
Billy Tubbs congregation.
</P>
<P>
   You take the good with the bad. You cheer and cackle when Tubbs'
TCU basketball team piles up 153 points. You wince and look the
other way when the other coach charges that Tubbs was running it
up.
</P>
<P>
   You laugh at his funny lines. You shrug away his wise-guy ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Tubbs fan, you look only at the winning and the
filled seats at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum. You think Tubbs is Will
Rogers, even when you hear a fifth-place, John Calipari Starter Kit
like tonight's Bill Bayno whine that Tubbs is something else.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is filled with Billy Tubbs fans these days. And as of this
week, the price just got a lot higher.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tubbs arrived on campus one stunning night five seasons
ago, the Frogs have won 96 games and lost 50. They are 62-9 when
playing at home. Under Tubbs, TCU basketball has spent 14 weeks
ranked in The Associated Press Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was the football coach who, after going 6-5 in the
regular season, was called in this week and given a new seven-year
contract that could be worth up to $900,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even getting into that situation,'' said Tubbs, for
once without much to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good contract at TCU, which I think carries over into
the next millennium. And I just need to take care of my own
business right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he would rather keep his mind occupied with tonight's
visit by Bayno and conference rival Nevada-Las Vegas. The Frogs are
15-3 and ranked 21st, but Tubbs says he knows his team could and
should be playing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a high priority thing on my list,'' Tubbs said,
when asked about football coach Dennis Franchione's new contract.
``Since I've been here, TCU has been very fair to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, it wasn't a financial thing. It wasn't that
I got an immense raise. The reason I came was that I wanted to be
here, and that TCU showed me that it was ready to make a commitment
to basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``commitment,'' as it turns out, was worth about $450,000,
Tubbs' reported annual financial package, once you add up his
salary, camps and shoe deal.
</P>
<P>
   To put that ``commitment'' to Tubbs into perspective, consider
this: His predecessor, Moe Iba, started at TCU in 1987 for a salary
of about $60,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   When Tubbs, who appeared to have worn out his welcome at
Oklahoma after 14 seasons, was first approached by TCU
representatives, he half-dismissed them, saying, ``I don't think
you can afford me.''
</P>
<P>
   Try us, the TCU people said.
</P>
<P>
   And here the Frogs are, five years later, ranked 21st in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic assumption is that you get what you pay for. Tubbs'
hiring raised eyebrows around the country. His reputation _ both as
a rascal and a Final Four coach _ has thrust the TCU program into
the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Without Tubbs, there is likely no Lee Nailon, TCU's All-American
and leading scorer. Without Tubbs, there is likely no huge crowd at
Daniel-Meyer tonight and No. 21 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stuff will take care of itself, as long as we stay
committed to basketball,'' Tubbs said. ``More than, `What can you
do for me?,' my concern is, `What can you do to help me get where I
want to go in basketball?'
</P>
<P>
   ``If they paid me nothing and I knew I could win a national
championship, I'd take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there he goes, running it up again.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, Tubbs knows the score. He knows that even though
there is a new athletic director in town, the same people who made
that ``commitment'' to him five years ago are still in place. Tubbs
knows that they know that his presence is important, as TCU
positions itself for whatever the new millennium in college
athletics will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Between the soon-to-get-a-raise Tubbs and Franchione, the $7
million coach, TCU is sending platinum smoke signals to any NCAA
wheelers and dealers who may be scanning the horizon. Those brief
but dark days of wondering whether TCU would have a healthy
Division I home appear over.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs is a rascal, but a winning one. And if you buy into what
TCU is trying to do, you know that it comes with a price tag _ the
rascals and the Sun Bowl victories alike.
</P>
<P>
   Try us, the TCU people said. Commitment has never come cheap.

FORMER NORTH TEXAS COACH HIRED BY RAVENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former North Texas football coach Matt Simon was hired as the
Baltimore Ravens' new running backs coach yesterday, one of four
assistants brought in by new head coach Brian Billick.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who spent four seasons as the Eagles' head coach, was
replaced last February by Darrell Dickey after compiling an 18-26-1
record. This past season, he served as an intern for the Denver
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, Simon said he had talked with
Billick, formerly the Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator,
about some of Billick's options. Billick's name was brought up in
rumors about several vacant head coaching positions before he
accepted the Baltimore job. Once he signed with the Ravens, he
brought in Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some other opportunities _ some in the NFL and a couple
in colleges,'' Simon said. ``But my focus was toward the NFL. I
felt like the opportunity to work for Brian Billick would be
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Milt Jackson (wide receivers), Steve Shafer (defensive backs)
and Mike Smith (defensive assistant) were also hired by Billick
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's relationship with Billick began in the Pac-10, when
Simon was an assistant at the University of Washington and Billick
was on the staff at Stanford University. After leaving Washington,
Simon was offensive coordinator at the University of New Mexico
before coming to UNT in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 45, was still under contract at UNT after being
reassigned within the athletic department last year. He said his
new job would dissolve his relationship with UNT.
</P>
<P>
   Simon reports to Baltimore in February, right after the Super
Bowl, to begin off-season planning and development of the Ravens'
offense.

MAVS OPTIMISTIC WITH TRENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After the events of yesterday, the Mavericks might feel
comfortable calling themselves a legitimate playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   But Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson laughed and said
he wasn't ready to make such a bold prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has reason to laugh after what transpired over the past
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the Mavericks beefed up their inside game with the
signing of free-agent center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams to a
three-year, $5.775 million contract, they added some more muscle to
their plate yesterday when they agreed to a one-year, $1 million
deal yesterday with free-agent power forward Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will have a news conference today at the Tom
Landry Center to introduce Trent to the Fort Worth-Dallas media.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Trent averaged 11.7 points and 6.3 rebounds and shot
47.7 percent from the field while playing for the Portland Trail
Blazers and Toronto Raptors. Portland traded the 6-foot-8,
250-pounder to Toronto on Feb. 13, and Nelson was overjoyed that he
was still available at such a bargain basement price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a gift from the gods,'' Nelson said. ``Must have been
my good living that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Trent, Nelson said, officially ends the team's
pursuit of free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to sign Ced, but Trent came along, and we just jumped
all over it,'' Nelson said. ``Basically we said goodbye to Ced and
good luck, and I hope he gets what he's looking for, and we're
going on, just like we did with Kurt \RThomas\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent comes to the Mavericks with a checkered past and a lot of
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, 1997, Trent's pregnant girlfriend, Roxanne Holt, told
Portland, Ore., police that Trent hit her in the face and kicked
her in the ribs during a domestic dispute at his home where she was
living at the time. Police charged Trent with misdemeanor assault,
and he pleaded guilty to harassment _ a lesser misdemeanor charge _
and was put on one-year probation and ordered to attend anger
management sessions.
</P>
<P>
   While Trent was on probation, he showed up at Theron Hall's job
at a Portland youth mentoring program and community center and
punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground and choked him.
That led to a five-day stay in jail for violating his parole.
</P>
<P>
   Trent and Mavericks forward Samaki Walker are longtime
acquaintances. They're both from Columbus, Ohio. They played
against each other in high school and worked out together this past
off-season for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked out head-to-head, got some good workouts in and went
out to eat and talk afterwards,'' Walker said. ``His power game and
his explosiveness is incredible. There's not too many people who
are going to move him around.
</P>
<P>
   Walker believes he can help keep Trent out of trouble, adding
that the 24-year-old four-year veteran has been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gary has to be around some people who has some good
influences on him,'' Walker said. ``I've known Gary for years, and
he's truly a good guy and I think he'll fit in pretty good here.''
THE NBA IS BACK
</P>
<P>
   Who says the NBA in dead? It's alive and well in Dallas, if last
night's scrimmage is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks drew a surprising crowd of 9,200 at Reunion Arena
for their free scrimmage. That figure surpasses the 8,833 fans who
attended the Jan. 6, 1998 ``regular-season'' game at Reunion Arena
between the Mavericks and Denver Nuggets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, sought an
emergency court order Friday to compel Monica Lewinsky to submit to
interviews over the weekend by House prosecutors in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought the order at the request of Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, after Ms. Lewinsky rejected a request
to meet with the House prosecutors, or managers, last week. Her
lawyers are contending that her immunity agreement with Starr does
not extend to congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who held a closed hearing in
U.S. District Court Friday afternoon, was still considering the
request late Friday evening, said Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge grants the order, Ms. Lewinsky would face intense
questioning over the weekend. The House prosecutors believe that
her answers could be pivotal as the Senate decides early next week
whether to question witnesses or decide Clinton's fate without
witnesses, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting down to the point where we need to know who
we're going to call and why we're going to call them,'' McNulty
said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the week drew to a close and the White House defense team
finished its presentation, the House managers faced increasing odds
against calling witnesses. The situation grew more questionable
Friday as prominent senators, like Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called for
a quick end to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces two articles of impeachment, voted by the House of
Representatives a month ago, that accuse him of perjury and
obstruction of justice. The articles say he lied about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and engaged in illegal maneuvers to
have friends and aides cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Starr reached an agreement last July giving her
immunity from prosecution, provided that she answer questions
truthfully. She was interviewed extensively by grand jurors and
Starr's prosecutors, and her testimony about her relationship with
the president was the foundation for much of Starr's case against
him. The House managers also leaned heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony to try to show that Clinton lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem that she has already been asked every
conceivable question by Starr's prosecutors, and that nothing new
could be gleaned from her recollections, the House prosecutors want
to question her nonetheless. Hyde, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, went to Starr because, as the official who
reached the immunity agreement with Ms. Lewinsky, he is its chief
enforcer, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity agreement calls upon Ms. Lewinsky to testify
truthfully before grand juries, trial juries ``and in any other
executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' As
for debriefings, the agreement specifies that they will be
conducted by Starr's office and before ``attorneys, law enforcement
agents and representatives of any other institutions'' as his
office requires.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Starr's office on Thursday, Plato Cacheris
and Jacob A. Stein, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, said it would be
inappropriate for their client to be ``placed in the position of a
partisan,'' meeting with Republicans but not Democrats in the
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   They said their client would appear before the Senate if
subpoenaed. But despite the sweeping language of the immunity
agreement, they said they were not convinced by Starr's assurances
that he could guarantee her immunity before the Senate if she
testified there. ``It is our understanding that only the Senate by
majority vote can do that,'' they wrote. ``We would appreciate your
supplying your legal authority for your position.''
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers not connected with the case contended in an article
Saturday on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that Starr's
agreement with Ms. Lewinsky does not grant her congressional
immunity, despite its wording. The lawyers, Charles Norman Shaffer
and Gerald Solomon, said the Senate would have to seek a federal
court order granting such immunity. Shaffer represented John W.
Dean during the Watergate hearings.)
</P>
<P>
   Neither Starr nor Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers could be reached Friday
night. Her lawyers also contended that her obligation to submit to
questioning would be void if the independent counsel were acting as
an agent for another entity.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Starr said Ms. Lewinsky could insist that his
office supervise debriefings by the House managers. But he rejected
any suggestion that his office would be acting as an agent for
them.
</P>
<P>
   His office, he said, ``has its own, continuing duty to provide
the House with information relating to impeachment.'' In any event,
he said, the immunity agreement allows the independent counsel's
office to subject her to questioning not only on its own behalf but
on behalf of ``representatives of any other institutions as the
O.I.C. may require.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty, the managers' spokesmen, also insisted that Ms.
Lewinsky ought to fear nothing from House questioners _ assuming
she tells the truth _ because her immunity agreement covers
anything she might say. In his motion before Judge Johnson, Starr
explained his need for an emergency order: ``The Senate's schedule
requires the House to submit its motion to call witnesses as early
as Monday, and the House has stressed its need to debrief Ms.
Lewinsky this weekend.'' Ms. Lewinsky was planning to travel from
Los Angeles to Washington on Saturday in case she must face
questioning, an associate said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors' sense of urgency becomes clear when
the impeachment timetable is analyzed. If, as expected, there is a
motion in the Senate early next week to dismiss the case against
the president, the House prosecutors want to be able to argue
against it based on whatever new nuggets they can wrest from Ms.
Lewinsky's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if the motion to dismiss the case is defeated _ as
head-counters think it would be, given the Republicans' 55-45
advantage in the Senate _ Republicans would want to use those
nuggets to support their arguments that witnesses should be called.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Starr's motion, at Hyde's request, before Johnson was
almost literally an 11th-hour attempt. Should the judge not grant
the motion, Republicans would lose their last big opportunity to
gauge what Ms. Lewinsky might say on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   One official close to the proceedings insisted there was still
information that Ms. Lewinsky could provide, contradictions she
might resolve. As an example, he noted her recollection that the
president's personal secretary came to her apartment at 2 p.m. on
Dec. 28, 1997, to retrieve gifts the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cellular-phone logs show the secretary, Betty Currie, called
Ms. Lewinsky at 3:30. Perhaps, the official suggested, Ms. Lewinsky
would recall, after her memory was jogged, that Ms. Currie came by
closer to 4 p.m., a two-hour difference that could be crucial in
showing motive and intent.

PLAYING AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR WAITING GAME  
 SUNS EAGER TO GET GUGLIOTTA DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After meeting with Tom Gugliotta and his agent, Richard Howell,
late Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday morning, the
Suns were left once again to wait for a top free-agent prospect to
make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta and Howell left town on Friday with an offer from the
Suns and might meet today with officials of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, for whom he was a Western Conference All-Star last
season. Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said he hopes to get a
decision from Gugliotta today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on their way home and will speak to family members,
discuss alternatives and hopefully in the near-term future, we'll
have some idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those alternatives are few, but they still could cost the Suns
Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota can give the 6-foot-10 power forward a seven-year
contract valued at about $86.5 million. The Suns are allowed to
offer a six-year deal with a maximum value of about $67 million,
but their salary-cap situation probably will prevent them from
reaching the maximum number.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is that Gugliotta would sign with
Minnesota for the $86.5 million deal and then be traded to another
club _ the leading candidate being the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hearing back from them is Tommy wants to go play
for the Lakers,'' Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Minnesota owner Glen Taylor confirmed for reporters that
the Timberwolves will meet with Gugliotta and Howell today, and he
anticipates the sign-and-trade scenario being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Timberwolves turn it down, Gugliotta likely will sign
with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's something else they want,'' Taylor said when he
was asked about the offer the club already has on the table. He
said the sign-and-trade has been requested before.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things they've talked about _ every day,''
he said. ``It has to be a deal that helps the Timberwolves. If they
had to run him through here (in a deal), we're not going to stand
in their way. But it has to be a great deal for the Timberwolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the Lakers have offered packages that include
forwards Elden Campbell and Sam Jacobson and guard Eddie Jones, but
there are base-year-compensation issues that could complicate any
deals for Gugliotta, whose cap number will change from about $5.5
million to $9 million if he re-signs with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Timberwolves have rejected sign-and-trade proposals,
but if the club believes it ultimately will lose Gugliotta without
compensation, that position could change _ and the Suns still would
be without the big man they hope to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor sounded skeptical about the chances of the Timberwolves
keeping Gugliotta, but he said the bridge has not been burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting close,'' Taylor said. ``He hasn't (burned the
bridge) with me, but what's important is his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota attempted to sign Philadelphia free-agent forward Joe
Smith to a $1.75 million salary-cap exception, and the club
announced that Smith has come to terms _ but he did not sign the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is waiting to see if Gugliotta is signed to stay in
Minnesota. If so, he probably won't sign the deal. He could even
wind up in Phoenix. However, reportedly there has been friction
between Gugliotta and Timberwolves point guard Stephon Marbury
which could influence Gugliotta's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought is, Joe will be here and Tommy won't be here,''
Taylor said. ``But if you asked a couple of days ago, I was 99
percent sure Tommy would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta arrived at America West Arena just before 11 p.m.
Thursday night _ about the time Antonio McDyess was agreeing to
terms with the Denver Nuggets. Ainge told reporters after the
club's limited morning workout that he didn't leave for home until
about 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting on his decision,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns lose Gugliotta, they could turn to Smith or re-sign
their own free agent, Clifford Robinson, and still have salary-cap
room to sign another high-profile free agent such as Miami guard
Brent Barry, who was unsigned as of Friday night. The Suns lost two
of their options on Friday when Vlade Divac signed with Sacramento
and Golden State power forward Jason Caffey re-signed with the
Warriors. &QL;

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION CHIEF TO RESIGN AT END OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
WASHINGTON _ I. Michael Heyman, the former chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley who led the Smithsonian
Institution through a five-year period of both controversy and
success, has decided to retire at the end of the year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I look forward to returning home to California ... and
re-establishing my ties with the University of California and the
San Francisco Bay Area, '' Heyman wrote in a statement obtained by
The Chronicle. Heyman will announce his intention to resign to the
Smithsonian's board of regents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave the Smithsonian in a formal sense,'' he wrote. ``It
will always be a part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman was named secretary of the Smithsonian in 1994, becoming
the first nonscientist to hold the post. He frequently noted that
overseeing the Smithsonian, a massive complex of 16 museums,
research facilities and the National Zoo, was much like governing
the UC Berkeley campus.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the 69-year-old former law professor said he is
leaving Washington for California for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being pulled, I don't feel pushed out of here,'' Heyman
said from his office in the Smithsonian's red castlelike
headquarters on the Capitol Mall. ``I'm getting pulled by age, by
desire to ratchet it down and by my desire to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stop being responsible to the success of a big,
complex organization,'' added Heyman, who was chancellor at UC
Berkeley from 1980 to 1990. ``I don't want to bow out of the world.
I'd like to spend three-day weekends at Stinson Beach, rather than
a day and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman is credited with reorganizing the Smithsonian's
bureaucracy, dealing with its shortcomings in diversity, boosting
fund raising and overseeing a 150th anniversary exhibition that
toured the country and was seen by more than 3 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But his tenure may be best remembered for a controversy that
erupted during his first weeks in the job over an exhibit at the
National Air and Space Museum about the Enola Gay, the plane that
dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which had been prepared before Heyman was
secretary, raised ethical questions about the decision to drop the
bomb and showed the devastating effects of the attack on the
Japanese. Even before it opened, the exhibit touched off protests
from veterans groups, who complained bitterly that the 50th
anniversary of the end of the war in Japan should not be
commemorated by presenting something so sympathetic to the former
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman found himself embroiled in controversy and ultimately
decided to scrap the exhibit and replace it with a modest display
of the plane, which in turn drew fire from critics who said he had
given in to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of Enola Gay, we spent a lot of time ... trying to
figure out how you deal with controversy and controversial
exhibitions,'' Heyman said. ``We fashioned a process where there's
got to be some real discussion at the museum level ... as to what
exhibitions are going to be shown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a public institution, we ought to try to present subjects
broadly, rather than platforms for individual political
viewpoints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, the former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice
Earl Warren also took steps to increase private donations to the
Smithsonian, which relies on federal dollars for about 70 percent
of its $450 million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took over, eyebrows were raised when corporations
began sponsoring exhibits. A minor furor erupted when Orkin, a
company known for making insecticides, financed an insect zoo at
the Natural History Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everybody around here has gotten used to the fact
that we have to seek a lot of funding,'' Heyman said. ``And some of
that is going to come from the corporate community.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman said later this year the Smithsonian will embark on an
ambitious quest for private donations _ the first ``capital
campaign since an aborted attempt in 1920'' _ in an effort to raise
$600 million to $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money is needed primarily to provide more space, as well as
for repairs and restorations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the Bay Area, Heyman said he hopes to teach a
class at the Boalt Hall School of Law in Berkeley and get involved
in pro bono work such as resuming his involvement in regional
planning.
</P>
<P>
   After six years in Washington, Heyman frowned on the pervasive
``quest for prominence ... for advancement'' that marks Washington
but said his distaste for such behavior did not factor into his
decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really miss California,'' he said.

MCDYESS DRAMA FULL OF INTRIGUE  
 EX-TEAMMATES KEPT `FAR AWAY' DURING DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess finally appeared before the microphones Friday
in Denver, but somehow it seemed more like the resolution of a
hostage situation than a basketball player's contract signing.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours before, a phone call from a distraught
McDyess had sent three former Phoenix Suns teammates in a mad dash
to Denver to help him sort through his situation.
</P>
<P>
   But despite chartering an aircraft and jawing with security
guards at McNichols Sports Arena, Rex Chapman, Jason Kidd and
George McCloud were prevented from speaking to their former
teammate, who was kept sequestered for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, McDyess agreed to a six-year, $67 million contract
to play for the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old power forward, apparently having second thoughts
about his decision to spurn the Suns and play for the Nuggets,
started the process in motion by calling Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get into the details of the conversation,'' Chapman
said, ``but he was very upset. Antonio had some serious doubts
about his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the ordeal, Chapman asked
McDyess if he wanted some of his former Phoenix teammates to come
to Denver to discuss the situation before he made his decision.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, who already had put off a news conference and delayed
his contract signing, asked them to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, Kidd and McCloud _ the three remaining Suns teammates
who were closest to McDyess _ boarded a chartered flight for
Denver. Sources said the flight was chartered by the Suns, but
General Manager Bryan Colangelo would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   When the Suns arrived, a Colorado Avalanche hockey game was
under way, and it was sold out. The players were not allowed in the
building, and security threatened to have their limousine towed
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go there to whisk him away from Denver,'' Chapman
said. ``We wouldn't have stopped him if he wanted to get on the
plane with us and come back. But we were really concerned about his
well-being. He was very, very upset about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got word (Thursday), Jason and myself, that he wanted to
talk, and from there we ended up in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets General Manager Dan Issel called in his own troops,
summoning point guard Nick Van Exel, Coach Mike D'Antoni and
assistant coach John Lucas from training camp in Colorado Springs
about 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   He also enlisted the help of Colorado Avalanche goalie Patrick
Roy and the hockey club's general manager, Pierre Lacroix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight fire with fire,'' Issel said at the McDyess
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   However, Issel didn't take exception to the Suns' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what this kid means,'' he said. ``If the shoe was on
the other foot, I probably would have done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Phoenix players tried to reach McDyess by a cellular
telephone. One of McDyess' agents, Tony Dutt, agreed to set up a
meeting. Dutt, according to sources, told the three to meet McDyess
at an Embassy Suites Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But he never brought McDyess to them. With the three Suns
players on the way to the hotel, McDyess was ushered out of the
arena. Chapman said the three players never were able to make
contact with McDyess himself while in the Mile High City. Van Exel
admitted the hotel meeting was a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to keep them as far away as possible,'' said Van
Exel, who described McDyess as upbeat, not upset, during the
evening. ``That's what we had to do. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   A snowstorm kept the Suns in Denver overnight, and they returned
Friday not even knowing for sure what McDyess had decided to do.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he at first discounted a report that McDyess was
reconsidering, then heard from a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rex was already talking to a rather emotional Antonio McDyess
on the phone,'' Colangelo said. ``I placed a call to one of his
agents, James Bryant, and about 45 minutes later I received a call
from Tony Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened the conversation by asking whether we were still
interested if Antonio was still interested. I told him that the
bridge to Phoenix had not been burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, Colangelo received three calls, two from
friends of McDyess and a third from Bryant, informing him that
McDyess would sign with the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions throughout the recruiting process of
McDyess, one of the most attractive free agent players available
this season. Dutt also represents Van Exel, who is seeking a new
contract with Denver. And he is associated with Lucas, who was
hired as an assistant coach by the Nuggets. The Denver club also
traded for another Dutt client, Keon Clark, and signed a former
high school teammate of McDyess as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said the three players didn't go to Denver to try to
change McDyess' decision, they just wanted to make sure it was he
that was making the decision and that he was happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special person away from basketball,'' Chapman said.
``Whether or not he wears a Nuggets uniform or a Suns uniform makes
no difference to me at all. The most important thing to me was to
find out if he was happy. He really struggled with this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who have never played pro sports will say,
`Wow, what a problem to have. Do you take $86 million versus $67
million,' or whatever it is. That's not what this is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about his friends, his contacts, his relationships
with people he's closest to. He had some real doubts about his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a sensitive guy, and I don't think he should be condemned
for making the decision he made.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess insisted Friday he made up his own mind when he was
asked how he would respond to those who question why he would
choose the Nuggets, who won 11 games last season, over the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision,'' he said. ``I had to do what was best for
Antonio, not for whoever is out there asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing was not being pressured, just go out and make my own
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns gave up two players, two first-round draft picks and
two second-round draft picks to Denver to get McDyess in a 1997
trade. Coincidentally, the Suns' first home game, Feb. 7, is
against the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely sad to see him leave,'' Suns forward Danny
Manning said. ``When we do step on the court against Dice, we want
to let him know he left a pretty good team.'' &QL;

KEEPING A NARROW FOCUS  
 FOR SCHOENFELD, ROAD TO TITLE IS FREE OF CLUTTER

   TAMPA _ ``Carpe diem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schoenfeld doesn't appear to have any visible tattoos
permanently etched into his skin, but if he ever decided to get
one, that's what the inscription should read. And it should be in
big, bold letters _ right across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpe diem.''
</P>
<P>
   Seize the day. Seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's Schoenfeld, the well-spoken, highly motivated and
incredibly focused head coach of the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the veteran NHL bench boss what's on his mind as he prepares
to make his first visit to the All-Star Game as an assistant coach
for the North American squad in Sunday's 49th annual game here at
the Ice Palace, and you won't find what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm going to spend the next couple days
thinking about our next opponent on Tuesday, the Buffalo Sabres,''
Schoenfeld said. ``Don't get me wrong, I'll try to have a little
fun while I'm at the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I pretty much have always been a game-to-game coach and a
day-to-day person. I expect to win the next hockey game. That's
all. That's where I focus my energy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the fiery head coach lives his life away from the
ice, too. Private when it comes to his personal life and his
family, guarded to a point when asked about hockey-unrelated
issues, Schoenfeld won't allow himself to become distracted when
he's off the clock and on ``his'' time.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even when hockey is the focal point of the
conversation, Schoenfeld won't clutter his mind _ or his daily
agenda _ with matters that are of no interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   So, Coach, have you spoken yet with Ken Hitchcock, the Dallas
Stars' head coach, whom you'll be working with behind the bench on
Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I'm sure we will talk and attend a function or two
together before the game,'' Schoenfeld said Wednesday. ``But I've
got to tell you, that seems so far away right now, I'm not even
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK then. What did you think of the Pavel Bure trade?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any thoughts about Pavel Bure,'' he said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Schoenfeld about this three-day break away from his team,
and he almost starts to gnash his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   One gets the feeling that as much as he'll try to enjoy the
All-Star experience this weekend, he'd much rather be back at the
Coyotes' practice facility in Scottsdale. If the league and the
players' association would allow it, he'd be driving his team, a
franchise-best 24-11-7 at the break, through three straight days of
practice, fine-tuning its neutral-zone trap, putting overtime work
into the struggling power play and reviewing game tapes over and
over, looking for something he or one of his assistants might have
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is in Tampa, cut off from his team. However, four of his
players are here with him: forwards Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy
Roenick, who will skate for the North Americans, and defenseman
Teppo Numminen and goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who will be
representing the World team made up of European-born players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schoenfeld's probably not going to have too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try not to,'' said Schoenfeld, who with even moderate
success in the playoffs likely will receive a three-year contract
extension before his current deal runs out next year. ``We go back
to work against Buffalo and then I'll be thinking about
Philadelphia, the Islanders and Nashville. I've got it all there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish the break was a little bit longer so we could
get some more of our injured guys back. But three days might help
us. It might save us in one game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Schoenfeld. Always thinking. Always looking to seize some
sort of upper hand over the competition, but always taking it one
team at a time, one day at a time. That's why he never got too
confident when the Coyotes stormed out of the gates and took the
NHL by storm, tearing out to a 14-2-2 start, which included an
undefeated November (10-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``From this point on, the points are much harder to come by,''
he said. ``People are scratching and clawing to get into the
playoffs or to move up in the standings or vying for first in the
division. . . . I don't want to say these two points are more
important than two points in October, but it seems that way. Teams
are becoming more desperate, and you'll find come February, it gets
worse, and it gets worse again in March and worse in April and
worse in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything escalates. No one can afford to look at an opponent
lightly. People are going to be prepared to play us. We have to be
prepared to play them. And if you're not, you're not going to win
the hockey game. We weren't prepared, emotionally, for Nashville (a
week ago), and we lost that game. There isn't that big a difference
between our team and any other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the Dallas Stars. We're not. We don't have the
depth. We don't have the level of skill at all the positions. . . .
We're as good as our workload, and when are workload isn't there,
we don't beat anybody. Our players have to realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``carpe diem.'' Seize the day. And seize the
moment. Knowing Schoenfeld, he won't let them forget. &QL;

BEARS LEFT AT ALTAR 
 MCGINNIS UNHAPPY WITH CONTRACT TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bears have been McDissed.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials scheduled a news conference Friday afternoon to
announce Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis as their new
head coach, but it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Negotations between McGinnis and the Bears broke off and
McGinnis walked out of the team's offices in Lake Forest, Ill.,
without the job.
</P>
<P>
   Bears officials were hopeful that McGinnis would speak again
with team President Mike McCaskey, but the two sides hadn't
resolved their differences as of late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to McGinnis said the team was willing to
guarantee only two years of his contract, which was believed to be
a four-year deal. The Bears wouldn't say why there was a breakdown
in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The source said McGinnis also was upset with the amount of money
he would be able to use for assistant coaches' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskey was concerned about guaranteeing McGinnis' entire
contract because the team already owed former coach Dave Wanndstedt
$2.5 million. Wannstedt was fired last month and hired as defensive
coordinator of the Dolphins, but that didn't eliminate the Bears'
financial obligation to him.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem between the two sides, according to sources
close to the Bears, was that the team announced the hiring before
McGinnis was able to inform members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Another source said McGinnis heard about the news conference to
announce his hiring on the radio while he was driving to the Bears'
Halas Hall for what he thought was a negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the recorded greeting on what was Wannstedt's
office phone said, ``You have reached the voice mail of Chicago
Bears head coach Dave McGinnis'' before McGinnis had come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bears officials were so certain they had reached an agreement
with McGinnis to become their 12th head coach that they announced
on Friday morning they had hired him and that he would be
introduced at a noon (Arizona time) news conference. But then _ in
a manner reminiscent of the Nuggets' handling of Antonio McDyess'
contract situation the day before _ media members were told the
news conference would be delayed until 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m., no news conference was held. Ted Phillips, vice
president of operations for the Bears, then told the Chicago media
that there had been a delay.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' big announcement was becoming a public-relations
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   `There are a number of issues that still have to be resolved,
and we don't really have a timetable right now for when it will be
resolved,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips refused to give specifics. ``I'm not at liberty to
discuss those,'' he said. ``There's just several issues that have
to be discussed. That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the rest of the afternoon, the Bears kept insisting
that things ``were being worked out.'' But at 2:30 p.m., Bears
spokesman Bryan Harlan confirmed that McGinnis had left the
building.
</P>
<P>
   If McGinnis doesn't take the Bears job, he is expected to return
to his duties with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   If McGinnis does leave, Tobin is expected to consider
replacements inside and outside the staff. Secondary coach Larry
Marmie and defensive line coach Joe Greene likely would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Another coach who would have been interviewed was former
Cardinals assistant Jim Johnson, who replaced Tobin as defensive
coordinator at Indianapolis. But Johnson, who spent last year as
linebacker coach of Seattle, took the defensive coordinator's job
at Philadelphia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, 47, was the fifth and final candidate to interview for
the Bears' job when he met with McCaskey on Thursday. Instead of
leaving Chicago and returning to the Valley, he stayed there and
agreed to a deal with McCaskey late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He informed Cardinals officials Friday morning that he was going
to take the Bears' job.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, a longtime friend and associate of
McGinnis, even released a statement about McGinnis' apparent hiring
by the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy for Dave,'' Tobin said. ``This is what you
work for throughout your professional coaching career . . . I think
he'll do a good job and lead the Bears to success for many years to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players already had prepared for McGinnis' departure.
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Jamir Miller said that McGinnis always was
``positive'' and ``always kept us motivated, no matter how bleak
the situation appeared . . . I'm very, very happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Ronald McKinnon said ``Dave has been like a
father figure to all of us on defense. He took care of us, kept our
spirits high, and he made sure we were ready to play. He joked
around with us and had fun, but when it was time to play, he got
down to business.''

OLYMPIC SCANDAL WIDENS: PAYMENTS LINKED TO SUMMER GAMES IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS grafs 3, 9 to correct time to Saturday from Friday night;

succumb to scandal.)  
 (ATTN: Utah, Australia)  (See also OLY-SALTLAKECITY) 
(fe) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic scandal expanded to a new front on Friday when
documents were made public showing that the Australian Olympic
Committee offered tens of thousands of dollars to two African
members of the International Olympic Committee the night before the
decisive vote on the site for the 2000 Summer Games. Sydney,
Australia, was awarded the games after it defeated Beijing by two
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released on Friday contain two letters from John
Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee and the
head of Sydney's bid to be named host of the 2000 Games, offering
payments of $5,000 a year for seven years each to national sports
programs run by Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis
Nyangweso of Uganda. The letters were delivered Sept. 23, 1993 in
Monte Carlo, Monaco, hours before Sydney edged Beijing, 45-43, in
voting among members of the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said Saturday that the payments had in fact
been made for the years 1994 through 1998 and that they had insured
that the payments went to the sports programs and not the two
officials. Because voting on awarding the games is secret, it is
impossible to say for certain if the two Africans ultimately backed
Sydney. Attempts to reach Mukora and Nyangweso Friday night were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the I.O.C. said the group was investigating the
actions of the Australian Olympic Committee and that the affair
would be taken up at a Sunday meeting of the 11-member executive
board of the international committee in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any proof or documents will be looked into,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of possible misconduct by the Australian Olympic
Committee is only the latest blow for the international body, an
organization that has already concluded that officials with the
Salt Lake City effort to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games had given
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and other benefits to
I.O.C. members in an effort to gain favor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya resigned Friday in
the wake of investigations into the Salt Lake City bid. His son,
Suher, has said that he received tuition assistance to two Utah
universities, as well as $700 a month in living expenses from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials. Suher Attarabulsi once even listed his
home address as the office of the Salt Lake Olympic committee. The
resignation was the second this week by a committee member. On
Tuesday, Pirjo Haggman of Finland resigned after it was reported
that her former husband had worked for the Salt Lake bid committee
and that years earlier the couple's rent had been paid while he was
working on behalf of a Toronto bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 other committee members face suspension or
expulsion in connection with the Salt Lake scandal when the
executive board meets this weekend to hear a report of wrongdoing
in Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Sydney on Saturday, Coates said the
Australian Olympic Committee had negotiated deals in the summer of
1993 with a handful of African and other countries to provide
sports scholarships and other assistance. He said he decided to
commit to precise cash payments the night before the vote because
he felt demoralized about Sydney's chances and that they were
``slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, the night this was all happening, I was very
dejected,'' Coates said. ``I was not going to die wondering why we
didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates defended both the initial arrangements to provide
assistance and the promises of specific dollar amounts.``This was
leveraging our bid,'' Coates said. ``But that was within the
I.O.C.'s guidelines and is within the I.O.C.'s guidelines until
they rule otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one senior U.S. Olympic official, the latest
revelations could lead to additional calls for Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the powerful president of the I.O.C., either to take
drastic action aimed at reform or to perhaps resign. Accused
members who do not resign this weekend will be suspended, Samaranch
has said, and will face expulsion by a vote of the entire I.O.C.
membership in March.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said Samaranch was wounded and might soon face what he
called a ``palace revolt.'' He said his survival would probably
depend on whether a thorough housecleaning is carried out in the
wake of the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume a lot don't resign,'' Schultz said of the members
implicated in wrongdoing. ``If there is unanimity to vote these
people out and make changes, I think he will end up in a strong
position. If they can't do that, not only Samaranch but the whole
I.O.C. is in trouble. That will look bad all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz became the first high-ranking Olympic official to speak
publicly of the precariousness of Samaranch's hold on the Olympic
leadership after 18 years as president. The 78-year-old Spanish
marquis has said that he will serve out his current term, which
ends in 2001. The U.S. Olympic Committee has strongly expressed its
support for Samaranch, and Anita DeFrantz, an international vice
president from Los Angeles, has also said that she firmly believes
he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an interview with The Associated Press in
Switzerland, Samaranch appeared committed to remaining in his job.
``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the I.O.C. more than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the I.O.C.
has its headquarters, the senior International Olympic Committee
official from Australia said that the news was so disturbing that
it could raise calls for the games to be removed from Sydney. The
official, Kevan Gosper, said he did not previously know of the
offers to the Africans but described them to the Associated Press
as being ``beyond good will'' and called for all Sydney documents
to be made public and for a full-scale investigation of the city's
bid process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Thomas, a spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee,
said the idea of taking the Games from Sydney was not realistic.
``We are 20 months away,'' he said. ``How else could they put on
the games?''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said in an interview that he believed, at this point,
that the 2000 Summer Games would not be removed to another city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think so,'' Schultz said. ``I would hope not. It
will be a spectacular site for the games. They've invested so much
money in new facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it would be impossible to move the 2000 games at such a
late date, ``I suppose nothing is impossible. But you'd have to go
someplace where they've got their venues in place, like Seoul.''
The South Korean capital was host the 1988 Summer Games and is
preparing to be a co-host, with Japan, of the 2002 World Cup in
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials, when asked to speculate on who might succeed
Samaranch in the event he does not survive the mushrooming scandal,
have an informal short list of candidates. They include Francois
Carrard, the committee's executive director; Richard Pound of
Montreal, an I.O.C. vice president who stated his support for
Samaranch on Thursday; DeFrantz; Jacques Rogge of Belgium; Mario
Vasquez Rana of Mexico, and Kim Un Yong of South Korea. &QL;

WAITING FOR HIS CHANCE  
 NEWMAN FITTING IN AS OREGON ASSISTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Don Newman doesn't need any of those books
telling men how if they just learn to open up and share their
feelings, all the social ills of the world will disappear and women
won't even mind the toilet seat being left up. Occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would probably choke on the description, Newman is
the prototype of what some portray as the ideal,
end-of-the-millennium male _ tough and tender, strong yet caring,
giving and willing to unzip his heart and unleash a torrent of
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Women from Venus? Men from Mars? Newman's address is right here
on planet Earth at the University of Oregon, specifically, where he
works as an assistant basketball coach to Ernie Kent and where
today he will try to help the Ducks beat Arizona State and many of
the same players that he helped to 18 wins last season as their
interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ coaches, especially _ might hide what churns inside
behind a wall of false indifference, but not Newman. Never has,
never will. He freely admits he has been awaiting this day with
great anticipation and not a small amount of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably couldn't help but be that way,'' he said. ``I still
follow these guys all the time, and I've seen them a lot. I saw
them in Maui, and I've followed them through the Pac-10. One part
of you is extremely proud for those guys, seeing how they're
playing and progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman didn't see the Sun Devils lose by 30 at Oregon State on
Thursday; he was occupied with the Ducks' two-point loss to
Arizona. But he has charted the growth of seniors Bobby Lazor and
Mike Batiste and junior Eddie House, plus freshmen Kenny Crandall
and Chad Prewitt, whom he recruited, like a doting father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a warm and satisfying feeling,'' he said. ``I felt like
last year, we really acquired a big-time belief in ourselves and
the program, and that's carrying them through. I'm sure (new coach)
Rob Evans is excited about having three veterans on the floor, and
young guys who can take the program forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans wasn't particularly excited after the Sun Devils' worst
loss of the season, but he has the job he always wanted and knows
better days are ahead. It's the job Newman wanted, too, even
though, as an emergency replacement for Bill Frieder, he was told
by Athletic Director Kevin White it would be for one year and one
year only.
</P>
<P>
   White made two runs at Utah Coach Rick Majerus and talked to
other coaches before getting Evans, who built the program at
Mississippi while coaching White's son.
</P>
<P>
   Newman and assistant Lanny Van Eman took ASU to the doorstep of
the NCAA Tournament despite finishing with seven recruited
scholarship players, and Newman was convinced he deserved a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Newman still harbors some of the disappointment at not being
hired, but not the bitterness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts every time I think about it,'' he said. ``No question
I could get the job done, and I proved that. But I did get it
behind me. But I'll never forget the experience and the feeling
when I had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who checked into some head-coaching positions at other
schools, seems to have settled comfortably into his new job even
though ``I've gone from a leadership role to more of a support
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, meanwhile, sounded ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great,'' Kent said. ``I needed someone who could not
only recruit, I needed the right role model, a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great working relationship and a great friendship.
How could you not like and get along with Don Newman? He has such a
great heart. He can go into any environment and make anyone feel
totally welcome and at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman admitted there was a brief period of adjustment, but Kent
delegates authority to all of his assistants and encourages their
input. But Newman, 41, has a one-year contract and makes no secret
about wanting to be a head coach again. Then again, he doesn't make
a secret about much of anything. Kent understands and will let
Newman look around after the season. If nothing materializes, Kent
said Newman is welcome back.
</P>
<P>
   As for today's reunion, Newman anticipates a big yank at his
heartstrings. He will talk to Batiste and Lazor, House and Prewitt
and Crandall before the game, and it might not be the easiest thing
he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the relationship ever really stops with
players,'' he said. ``The closeness we had, the things players grow
from, I like to think my time with them was extremely positive and
hopefully, they learned some things as men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about relationships. All about getting on the same
page, about letting everyone know we're in this together. It was a
heavy dose of brotherhood, or parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, too, have been looking forward to this, although
their thoughts are more occupied with reversing the Oregon State
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be cool to see him,'' said House, who against
the Beavers went without a three-point basket (0 for 7) for just
the second time all season. ``He not only was our coach, he's a
close friend.'' &QL;

UA TO FACE PENN STATE IN PIGSKIN CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona started near the bottom last year. The Wildcats will
start near the top next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats will test their national-championship credentials
at Penn State on Aug. 28 in the Pigskin Classic, which will kick
off the 1999 college football season.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from last season's opener at winless Hawaii,
where the untested and unknown Wildcats launched a 12-1 season that
ended with Holiday Bowl victory over traditional power Nebraska and
a No. 4 ranking in the final 1999 polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-lose situation,'' said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, who
was rewarded with a new five-year contract after last season, the
best in school history. ``It's an opportunity for us to find out
who we are right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also will give us a lot of motivation during the spring and
summer. We've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The game figures to match two teams with national championship
aspirations. Both are a good bet to be ranked among the top 10, if
not the top five, in preseason ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions, 9-3 and No. 17 in 1998's final poll, are
expected to have to have 36 of its top 44 players back from last
season. The Wildcats will lose six key starters to either
graduation or the pros. Junior offensive lineman Yusuf Scott
recently decided to make himself eligible for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona accepted the ABC-televised game, its 12th on the 1999
schedule, after Colorado backed out Thursday afternoon. The
Buffaloes apparently withdrew in part because the athletic
department remains unsettled in the wake of a coaching shuffle.
Gary Barnett was hired from Northwestern to succeed Rick Neuheisel,
who left for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for Arizona football,'' said Wildcats Athletic
Director Jim Livengood, who described the game as preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason or regular season, the game will count in the
strength-of-schedule factor for the Bowl Championship Series
formula. Tomey said strength of schedule was not a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win all your games, you're going to get there (the
national title) anyway,'' said Tomey, whose 1998 Wildcats were one
loss to UCLA from making a claim on the national crown.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livengood said it could prove to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking ahead or suggesting anything about next year,
but, sure, it's a possibility,'' he said. ``But even without that,
there are all kinds of positives. The national exposure helps
big-time. And I think it's been proven that _ win, lose or draw _
that first game doesn't necessarily hurt you later in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will mark the first meeting between the schools. It
also will be the opener in a 34th season for Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno. &QL;

HARPER LEAPS INTO LEADER ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Lakers hired themselves
a newcomer to play the part of team leader, designated wise man and
occasional enforcer. But Derek Harper didn't need to waste time
introducing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He took the floor Thursday night at UC Santa Barbara's Robertson
Gym and immediately began barking encouragement and instruction to
his young teammates, who dutifully listened with all the respect
due a 15-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that's just automatic respect,'' 20-year-old Kobe
Bryant said of Harper. ``I have automatic respect for him because
of all the hard work he's put in with the Knicks and Mavericks....
I'm gonna listen, I'm gonna pick his brain, whatever he has to say.
I think it's good to have a guy like Derek here.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely why executive Jerry West hired the 37-year-old guard.
Harper's been to the finals with the Knicks and everywhere else in
turns with Dallas and Orlando. He came to the Lakers, whose oldest
returning player was enigmatic Elden Campbell (30), knowing his
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's to be the oldest player on the team,'' Harper
quipped. ``But that comes with stability, leadership, to defend
some of the bigger point guards in the Western Conference and
hopefully to help this team win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has doubted the Lakers' talent the past two seasons, but
as they've watched their postseasons end with disastrous series
defeats to the veteran Utah Jazz, the weaknesses have been clear.
Sure, the Lakers could use more reliable perimeter shooting and a
hard-nosed, rebounding power forward, but just as much, they've
needed an experienced leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Harper said. ``Because the talent's in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't wait to let anyone get comfortable with him before
taking control.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys know me, everybody here knows me. They know what
I'm about and where I'm from, so I'm not going to wait until the
season's over to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher remains the starting point guard, but Harper will
provide defense off the bench and constant tutoring. Any doubts
about his durability faded with his physical exam _ team doctors
said he's one of the three best-conditioned players in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Harper was in demand this offseason, listening to offers from
Miami, New York and Indiana, among others. All offered the same $1
million salary, but the Lakers had something the other contenders
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the big fella (Shaquille O'Neal). I looked at Shaq
being the dominant piece,'' he said. ``I just liked the opportunity
this team has to win it all. I think this team is ready to make a
move past everybody in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my mind made up (to play for the Lakers). I was sort of
waiting for a call from Jerry (West) to be perfectly honest with
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In demand: It appears fan bitterness over the lockout has been
overestimated. The Lakers had 16,000 free tickets for their open
scrimmage Wednesday at the Forum, and they were snatched up in
about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After season tickets, the Lakers had only 3,500 seats left for
next Friday's exhibition vs. the Clippers but, expecting a mad rush
at the box office, chose to donate the seats to youth groups in
Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   A huge turnout is also expected for Monday's 5 p.m. open
scrimmage at UCSB's Thunderdome. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to all Lakers home games go on sale Sunday at the Forum
box office and all TicketMaster outlets.

EX-BYU BACK DOESN'T PICK NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano got a
phone call late Wednesday that left him flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duke Hall, the uncle of former BYU running back Ronney
Jenkins, saying the junior enrolled at Big Sky rival Northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm miffed,'' Ponciano said. ``The communication with that, to
say the least, was extremely poor because you could never talk to
the kid. They never, ever said once they were going to go visit
NAU.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins visited with several CSUN coaches Monday, though
Ponciano was out of town. ``When he comes up and says, `So this is
where you play, huh?,' you kind of figure he may not be our type of
guy,'' Ponciano said. ``When he came back from the visit to NAU,
which they never said he was going on, and it's always so vague,
then what's the real thing going on here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really worked out nicely. He's going to be proud to
play in (NAU's) facility, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins couldn't be reached at NAU. Hall said he never heard
Jenkins bash CSUN's football facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said it wasn't a certainty Jenkins would have been
academically eligible at CSUN. However, NAU coach Jerome Souers
said Jenkins will participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who ran for 1,307 yards and 12 touchdowns for the
Cougars last season, withdrew from BYU after violating the school's
honor code for what were termed ``sexual transgressions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jenkins enrolled at CSUN it could have created a logjam in
the backfield. Jaumal Bradley returns for his senior season and
Washington State transfer DeJuan Gilmore is also enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gahr WR commits: Jamaal Perry, a 5-foot-10, 159-pound receiver
out of Gahr High in Cerritos, gave an oral commitment to attend
CSUN in the fall. He did so during an unofficial visit to CSUN on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in California, I liked the campus and I liked
the coaches,'' said Perry, who also played defensive back at Gahr.
``The coaches said I have a choice, but I think I'll go line up in
the slot and play receiver. I like catching the ball and running
with it better....''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who also returned kicks, had nine touchdown catches for a
Gahr team that finished 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Another new face on CSUN's campus this spring will be Kennedy
High product Karalus Doyle, who also played at Valley College. He
went to Florida A&AMP;M after Valley College but left school after a
few days and didn't play football. He'll be a walk-on for the
Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He possesses a great deal of speed and he's got size,'' said
Valley coach Gary Barlow. ``He was offered a scholarship to a I-AA
program in Florida A&AMP;M and they made the playoff, so that tell you
the level he can play. I think going away to Florida and seeing
what it takes to succeed at that level will really help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, former Arizona State offensive lineman Craig Sweasy is
expected to enroll at CSUN, but lax academics will keep the
Atascadero High graduate on the sideline for a year. If he meets
academic requirements for the 2000 season, he would have one year
of eligibility remaining. Blue Chip Illustrated selected him as an
All-Region performer at Atascadero.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches cannot comment on recruits until they receive a national
letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Colunga to transfer: Ponciano said defensive lineman Mike
Colunga will transfer out of the program because of academic
problems since enrolling at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Colunga, who spent two seasons at San Bernardino Valley College,
had an injury-riddled season and played in only three games,
registering seven tackles and 1{ sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I'd help him with anything I could,'' Ponciano
said. ``He's looking at some Division II schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said three freshmen, all of whom were red-shirting,
would transfer after poor academic showings. They are linebacker
Alvin Steen and safeties Chris Karibee and Alex Blanco.

ENQVIST SENDS NO. 3-SEEDED RAFTER PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to delete last 4 grafs of original and add MATCHPOINTS

 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ It is too late for Patrick Rafter to
whisper in the tournament director Paul McNamee's ear about
changing the Australian Open this year. Too late to suggest nicely
_ this is Rafter, after all _ that the hardcourt surface be made
quicker and the balls lighter so that Rafter's serve-and-volley
style can play as well at home as it does in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it was Thomas Enqvist's turn to remind the third-seeded
Rafter, and the nation that admires him, of his limitations. Along
the way, the straight-talking and flat-hitting Swede reminded the
tennis world that he is playing as well as anyone this January.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has won the U.S. Open the past two years, but in eight
appearances in Melbourne he has never advanced past the fourth
round. His legs are still powerful, his reflexes still quick and
his hair still a little too long and unkempt for the taste of some
older Australians, yet his game is not quite the same at Melbourne
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the conditions suited him really well, and I think he
played too big and strong for me,'' Rafter said after Enqvist
dismantled him, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. His loss means that Pete
Sampras, who chose to skip this tournament to rest, will remain
No.1 when this Grand Slam event ends.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was hardly a reaffirming day for the pecking
order. Marc Rosset, a mountain of a man from Switzerland, put an
end to Britain's hopes by defeating sixth-seeded Tim Henman in
straight sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 7-5. In the night session, in a
match played indoors after the retractable roof on Center Court was
closed because of rain, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa upset
ninth-seeded Richard Krajicek, 6-7 (1-7), 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the 16 men's seeded players remain and, for the
first time in Australian Open history, all four top-seeded players
are out at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of top 10 players out there that aren't in the
top 10,'' Rafter said. ``The men's game is very close.
Unfortunately, it's not like women's tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   In years past that observation might have rung true, but Friday
provided plenty of evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   First came Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo's perplexingly lopsided
6-3, 6-0 upset of third-seeded Jana Novotna, the reigning Wimbledon
champion. Then came Chanda Rubin's 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-4 victory over
15th-seeded Natasha Zvereva. Last came Emilie Loit's 7-5, 6-1
defeat of ninth-seeded Conchita Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attitudes are changing,'' said the 20-year-old
Loit, who admitted she had to stop trembling at 5-0 before closing
out the match. ``I think there is a psychological difference now,
and the more examples there are of players in the top 100 beating
players in the top 10, the more it will keep happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a disastrous tournament for the Spanish. Of the 22
Spaniards who came here, including Alex Corretja and the reigning
French Open champions Carlos Moya and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, only
Sanchez Lorenzo remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for myself, but I'm a little sad for my
friends,'' said Sanchez Lorenzo, a baseliner ranked 65th who lost
in the first round of every Grand Slam event last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just still in a state of shock,'' said Novotna, who could
not remember when she had last lost a set at love, ``really not
knowing what went wrong, and it was just a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's once-promising career has been derailed since mid-1996
by a broken bone in her right hand, subsequent surgery to remove
part of the bone and six months of rehabilitation. Defeating
Zvereva should help her regain the form that made her a
semifinalist here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just out here working hard for as long as I can,'' the
30th-ranked Rubin said. ``I feel like I can do as well as I did and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin was trading ground strokes with Zvereva, Rosset was
firing huge forehands and first serves at Henman. Rosset's next
opponent, Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, is well within the
long reach of the 6-foot-7-inch Swiss. Enqvist's next opponent is
Australia's other main attraction, Mark Philippoussis, who rumbled
past Jan Kroslak of Slovakia, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France's SANDRINE TESTUD, the 14th-seeded player, beat SERENA
WILLIAMS, 6-2, 2-6, 9-7, on Saturday. . . . ANNA KOURNIKOVA won
again despite double-digit double faults, securing a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3
victory over Germany's ANDREA GLASS. Kournikova tapped in her first
serve at an average speed of 77 miles an hour and her second serve
at 69 mph, yet could not avoid 14 double faults. Kournikova, the
12th-seeded player, next plays No. 7 MARY PIERCE, a 6-2, 6-2 winner
over Italy's RITA GRANDE. . . . ANDRE AGASSI swept aside JIRI NOVAK
of the Czech Republic, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, and will play a fellow
American, &UR;  &LR; VINCE SPADEA, in the fourth round. JIM COURIER, a
two-time champion here, injured a groin muscle and had to quit
while trailing by 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 3-0 against No. 10 YEVGENY
KAFELNIKOV of Russia. Kafelnikov next plays in the Round of 16
against ANDREI PAVEL of Romania, who struggled to knock off the
American newcomer PAUL GOLDSTEIN, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3. ...
Spadea scored a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 triumph over MARTIN DAMM of the Czech

SUNS TRY TO STAY POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Day 2 of the post-NBA lockout era, the Suns were looking for
a reason _ any reason _ for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   A roster with enough players for a starting lineup _ any lineup
_ was a start.
</P>
<P>
   A great beginning it wasn't. Nevertheless, the Suns signed five
players Friday to bring their roster to seven. It's not exactly the
Magnificent Seven, but it is one step from Thursday, when the Suns
didn't have enough manpower to open training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Between two workouts Friday at America West Arena, their roster
more than doubled. Before the second session, the Suns signed
veteran center Joe Kleine, rookie Toby Bailey, third-year center
Horacio Llamas, second-year swingman Marko Milic and second-year
guard James Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Kleine had been expected. He signed for one
year at $1 million, which is the minimum for a veteran of at least
10 years. Kleine, a Suns center from 1993 through 1997, returns to
Phoenix after spending last season with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is a great guy in the locker room,'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said. ``He's a real vocal guy, and I think we need that. We
have a lot real quiet leaders on our team. They're not vocal. But
Joe is. He's got great experience and played with a lot of very
great teams. His clubhouse leadership will be one of his greatest
assets this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a second-round draft pick from UCLA, Llamas, Milic and
Collins signed a variety of minimum contracts allowed under the new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a 6-foot-4 shooting guard from Florida State, appeared
in 23 games last season for the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' roster figures to grow by at least one more player
today. Veteran swingman George McCloud, a sometime Suns starter
last season, is expected to sign and be in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he played just about every role,'' Ainge said of
McCloud, who was with Jason Kidd and Rex Chapman Thursday night in
Denver as Antonio McDyess agonized over whether to sign with the
Nuggets or return to Phoenix. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Danny Manning, on his progress from last season's serious knee
injury: ``I'll be ready to play. I've been going out every day.
This is no different. I just go out everyday and see how I feel.
I'm not putting any limitations on myself. I'll play it by ear, day
by day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting: Center Luc Longley was still waiting for the
NBA's official stamp of approval on his deal. The Suns acquired him
from Chicago for Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells and a
conditional first-round draft pick. Longley said the league still
was waiting for a signature from Bulls General Manager Jerry
Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on: John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, a Suns backup center and
McDyess' biggest friend last season, signed a three-year, $5.775
million contract Thursday with the Dallas Mavericks. Six teams were
reported to have interest in the 36-year-old Williams, a 12-year
veteran. He supplants A.C. Green, another former Sun, as the
Mavericks' elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Expected additions: Former Puerto Rico Olympian Jose Ortiz and
Milwaukee veteran Jamie Feick are expected in camp today. Feick
appeared in 45 games and averaged 2.3 points for the Bucks last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge was trying very hard to be a happy camper: ``This whole
scenario is one of the strangest experiences I've ever been
involved with. Hopefully, it's something we'll look back and laugh
at. It's getting weirder and weirder all the time. I hope I still
have a sense of humor.'' &QL;

LAKERS' FOX STAYS HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ First the lockout, then quibbling NBA
lawyers, then the traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway. Somehow,
Rick Fox's road back to the Los Angeles Lakers seemed filled with
more obstacles than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Fox never wanted to part company with the Lakers after last
season, but everything, it seemed, conspired to keep him from
returning. Right up until Thursday night, when the congested PCH
kept him from attending the team's first training-camp workout at
UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox was on the court Friday morning, rejoining the team he
insists he never planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   There were, again, the other suitors _ including Atlanta, New
York and Seattle _ some dangling more than the $1.75 million the
Lakers could give. Fox listened and that's about all he did.
</P>
<P>
   Once league lawyers set down the final details of a new labor
deal and the lockout was officially over late Wednesday night, Fox
sat down with Lakers executive Jerry West and made arrangements to
resume his Lakers career. A one-year contract for now, hopefully a
multiyear to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate the appreciation other teams have for me
as a player, but this is home now for me and I'll stay here,'' Fox
said. ``I have unfinished business, not just here but in this
league in general. I have so many goals to accomplish and this is
the best place to get them done.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about championships, a goal the Lakers fell short
of last season, leaving Fox tearful and frustrated, even uncertain
whether he'd return. Those doubts faded quickly with the time off.
</P>
<P>
   The long offseason let Fox spend quality and quantity time with
his son, Kyle, in Boston, further his acting career in two movies,
``Resurrection'' and ``The Collectors,'' and meet a new girlfriend,
singer Vanessa Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A Thanksgiving and Christmas with family, for the first time in
15 years, was ``a great experience,'' he said. But Fox is glad the
long vacation is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the rest,'' Fox admitted, ``but it ate at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as being swept in the conference finals tore at him. Fox
could have made another title run somewhere else but asked if he
ever seriously considered leaving said, ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some (teams) really push hard, and they're teams I would
have played for, if I didn't have this affection for this team and
the goals of going forward with this team. I couldn't turn my back
on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So for the second straight offseason, Fox singlehandedly gave
meaning to the trite and usually untrue phrase ``it's not about the
money.'' For Fox, who turned down a $20 million deal to sign here
in 1997, it isn't. He's proven that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I went through last year made it easier to go through
this year,'' Fox said. ``You turn down offers again, much more
lucrative. But it's staying true to what you believe in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know the experience I got out of last year after turning
(the $20 million) down, I was a much more fulfilled basketball
player, much happier about the team I was on and the opportunity to
play for a championship. And it's my honest belief you're rewarded
when you go out and give a good day's effort.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the usual expectation from Fox, the Lakers' starting
small forward last season. He was the only one to play all 82
regular-season games and started all 13 playoff games despite
having to duct-tape himself together for the final six weeks after
suffering a variety of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris has a variety of options at small forward,
where Robert Horry and Kobe Bryant also figure to spend time. But
he's grateful to have Fox for another run at the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick brings a good all-around game with a lot of toughness.
He's one of the best combinations of nice people who are tough of
any of the athletes I've known,'' Harris said. ``And we like that
about him.''

BASKETBALL JUNKIE MAKES GOOD ON HIS CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona schools are visiting the Oregon schools in the
Pac-10 this week, which makes it a good time to check in with
Valley native Joel Sobotka, the first-year head coach at Portland
State and, at 28, the youngest coach in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it isn't a good time, we're going to do it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So how's it going, Joel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. The Vikings are 12-4 overall, 5-1 and tied for
second in the Big Sky Conference behind Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased,'' Sobotka said. ``The guys are doing a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   More interesting than Portland State's season, however, is how
Sobotka got here. A basketball junkie predating his Horizon High
School days, Sobotka was an Arizona State basketball manager for
Bill Frieder as recently as 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A '93 ASU grad, Sobotka's official title was video coordinator,
``but I ended up doing all the stuff nobody wanted to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty incredible when you think about it,'' he said.
``It's all happened pretty fast, but I had a chance to work under
some good people, and I've had a real passion for it. Circumstances
all led to me getting the job, but if I wasn't prepared and ready,
I wouldn't have gotten the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Using contacts such as former ASU assistants George McQuarn, Jim
Phillips and the late Lynn Archibald, Sobotka got to coach at camps
and clinics. He knew former Tempe Corona del Sol High School coach
Sammy Duane and Ritchie McKay, who attended Mesa Westwood High
School and Mesa Community College and who would end up as head
coach at Portland State when the school restored its Division I
program in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sobotka impressed everyone with his knowledge and enthusiasm. He
got a job as an assistant at Eastern Oregon State (junior) College
before returning to ASU for a year to work for Frieder. Then he
joined McKay at Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   After McKay took the head coaching job at Wyoming in August, it
appeared Portland State would hire Rick Adelman, a big name who
used to coach the NBA Portland TrailBlazers. But at the last
minute, the Sacramento Kings hired Adelman and Sobotka got the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't been able to sit back and enjoy it,'' said
Sobotka, who inherited four starters and has made the most of it.
``I haven't had the chance to think, `Wow, this is overwhelming.'
Every day is a great opportunity. It's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobotka still is an avid Sun Devils fan, and he still stays in
touch with former players Ike Austin, James Bacon and Wun Versher.
But Stevin ``Hedake'' Smith he can do without. Sobotka was pained
by the point-shaving scandal that led to Frieder's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard seeing it become a national story,'' he said. ``It
was really discouraging to see the program get tainted like
that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Scary Stanford &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scary, and impressive, thing about Stanford is it can do so
many things to beat you. Take Thursday night, when the supposedly
quickness-challenged Cardinal used its running game to negate a
surprising zone thrown at them by a pretty quick Washington State
team. Stanford outscored the Cougars, 64-29, in the second half and
won, 94-45, for its 12th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stagnant in the first half,'' said guard Arthur Lee,
who had 12 points, one of five players to score in double figures
for the Cardinal. ``A zone will make you do that. . . . When we
pushed them out of their zone with the transition game, that was
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve point guard Mike McDonald returned after being sidelined
for a foot injury, and that helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boggles my mind to read some of the stories saying Stanford
is better without him,'' Cougars Coach Kevin Eastman said. ``They
are better with him, no question.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tarnished Bears &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's with California? After beating North Carolina on Dec. 29,
and appearing to emerge as a threat to Stanford, the Golden Bears
are 2-4, including home losses to Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: Guards Geno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgore did not
start against Washington on Thursday because car trouble caused
them to be late for the pre-game shootaround. Kilgore earlier in
the year was suspended for two games for missing a team bus, and
Carlisle did not start, for the first time, last week against
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Coach Ben Braun addressed his team for 30 minutes after the
Washington loss, emphasizing the importance of today's game against
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to establish an indentity for ourselves,'' Braun
said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gag order &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Athletic Director Bob Goin has the solution to deal
with some of the negative publicity surrounding his successful but
morally ambiguous basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the graduation rate? Ensure there are no more rules
violations, the likes of which got an assistant coach fired? Keep
players out of trouble off the court?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Goin is urging Coach Bob Huggins to restrict the number of
interviews he gives.
</P>
<P>
   Goin said, ``We've got to do a better job of screening because
of situations like this, the ESPN thing,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ESPN thing'' was a feature on Huggins and the players
title ``Bad News Bearcats.'' An associate sports information
director called it a ``hack job.''
</P>
<P>
   In a printed release, Goin said, ``Bob Huggins . . . has the
right to be interviewed by whatever media outlet he wants to.
However, I have requested that Bob reduce the number of interviews
he does because I want our basketball team to be able to focus on
the remainder of the basketball season.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big improvement &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Newman was 20-114 as head coach at Sacramento State before
becoming an assistant to Bill Frieder and later the interim head
coach at Arizona State. But that record looks pretty good compared
with that of his successor. Under Tom Abatemarco, the Hornets are
0-15 this year, 1-40 since the start of last season and have lost
32 straight dating to December 1997. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FAIR PLAY FOR OSTERSUND   
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to add the word `programs' ' No other changes.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   The early round of housecleaning the International Olympic
Committee will undertake this weekend should sweep the shakedown
artists from the governing body of the Olympic movement. But far
more needs to be done to clean up after the bribery scandal
engulfing the organization's choice of Salt Lake City for the next
Winter Olympics. The committee will need to devise an ethically
tight process for choosing future sites, and should reconsider its
award of the Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Word that a top Australian Olympic official offered $35,000
apiece to two IOC members' programs the night before Sydney won the
2000 summer games by a two-vote margin over Beijing should add a
sense of urgency to the IOC meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege of being the host of the Olympic Games should
never be sold to the highest bidder in a silent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's housecleaning will be cold comfort to the Swedish
town of Ostersund and its dreams of being host to the 2002 Winter
Olympics. Unlike some of the protagonists in Salt Lake City's
successful campaign for the 2002 games, the folks of Ostersund say
they abided by the rules. They spurned offers to buy delegate votes
with lavish gifts, money, cars and other bribery. Embracing this
kind of influence-peddling, including scholarships and jobs, helped
Salt Lake ingratiate itself with some delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Cities that have conducted bribe-free campaigns to win the
Summer or Winter Games should have been able to compete on a level
playing field, not one tilted by money and other forms of
corruption. The decision by the IOC's internal investigative panel,
headed by the Montreal lawyer Richard Pound, to broaden its inquiry
beyond Salt Lake to include the host-city competitions for the
Games held between 1996, the year the Summer Games were in Atlanta,
and 2006 is a wise one.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of Pound's panel of inquiry should allow the IOC to
determine which host-city competitions were fatally tainted by
bribes-for-votes. In cases where cities advanced to the finals or
won the right to be a host city because of influence-peddling, the
IOC will need to reopen the competition for those Games. Site
selection for both the 2000 and 2002 Games should begin anew.
</P>
<P>
   Those with oversight responsibilities for amateur and
professional sports now devote a good deal of their time to trying
to banish unscrupulous athletes who take performance-enhancing
drugs. The IOC cannot expect to command the respect and confidence
of nations if it enforces one ethical standard for athletes but
tolerates an anything-goes milieu for competitions to be the host
city.

CSUN SITE COMMITTEE LOST SIGHT OF GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even before the first of nine meetings, many area
residents called Cal State Northridge's site committee a sham,
stacked with proponents for an on-campus stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They were right. The committee was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was for another reason. The committee didn't do what
it set out to do, which was to recommend a site for a new football
stadium to university president Blenda Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 12-member panel, of which nine were present
Thursday, kept the issue clouded.
</P>
<P>
   They voted to recommend three proposals in a final report to
Wilson: an 8,000-seat stadium on the North Campus, about 75 yards
south of the existing football field; a renovation of Pierce
College as an off-campus site; and to include a residents'
recommendation, which would put a stadium anywhere but on campus.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN cut four sports (baseball, men's volleyball, men's
soccer and men's swimming) in 1997, Wilson was accused of not
getting enough input before making her final decision. This time,
Wilson set up a committee so all sides would be represented.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was supposed to come up with one site, but under
pressure from the residents decided it would be better not to make
any definitive statement.
</P>
<P>
   That's a disservice and a disgrace. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee recommended the proposed North Campus site,
lawsuits would have followed, the surrounding community would have
been enraged, but at least a decision would have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation project at Pierce College? If this was the sole
recommendation it would have caused a revolt among the athletic
department, especially in the football quadrant. But, again, it
would have been a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get a half-a-year's-worth of wasted time, no
decision, and we arrive at the same spot we were a year ago when it
was announced football needed another location to play for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some decisions were made.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the committee decided some people favor an
on-campus facility and some favor an off-campus site. Of course,
that much was known six months ago. There was also opposition from
the neighboring residents in regards to an on-campus site, which,
again, was known.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meetings should have been used to listen to all
sides, come up with one plan, then try to solve all of the problems
with one site.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an indictment of committee chairman David Honda
because he was left with no alternative. He didn't vote. He gives
direction, maintains order, but once a motion is made, and then
someone seconds it, there's little else he can do.
</P>
<P>
   This is an indictment of the other committee members _ three of
whom were absent Thursday, though CSUN men's basketball coach Bobby
Braswell had a legitimate reason since his Matadors had a game.
</P>
<P>
   What's bothersome is this committee didn't have the backbone to
be definitive on the most crucial issue regarding the university
and the community.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to be the scapegoat for everyone who disagreed
with it, and made it clear that Wilson will be exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   All along Wilson was going to have the final say. All along one
side was going to be enraged with her decision.
</P>
<P>
   The site committee members were supposed to recommend a site,
but ran away from doing their job because they didn't want to be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   So when Wilson makes the final decision, either the residents
will be upset, or the proponents of an on-campus stadium will be
upset.
</P>
<P>
   However, the thing people should be angered over is the failure
of the committee.

WRIGHT TIME FOR PAY RAISE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Clipper who last week
promised to `hold down the fort' until top draft pick Michael
Olowokandi's return from Europe, now says he's prepared to abandon
his low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to go,'' third-year power forward Lorenzen Wright
said Friday after his agent, Robert Fayne, put the Clippers on
pay-me-or-trade-me alert.
</P>
<P>
   Wright _ who averaged nine points and 8.8 rebounds in the second
year of his three-year deal _ wants a six-year contract extension
adding up to Fayne's interpretation of fair-market value.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Clippers source, that number would begin with the
maximum stake of $9 million per season, under terms of the new
collective bargaining agreement, and total $60 million over the six
years. The Clippers aren't wild about those numbers or the
chronology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time,'' Elgin Baylor, the team's vice
president of basketball operations, said. ``It's the second day of
training camp. I don't think it's the appropriate time to get into
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The player and his agent think this should be the Wright time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all of the fans,'' said Wright, whose post-lockout
timing might not inspire much sympathy, ``but my family comes
first. In order to take care of my family, I have to have a
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' league-structured commitment to the 6-foot-11
Wright is worth less than $2 million this season, and a spoken
desire to re-sign him _ for their interpretation of market value _
after his current contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   The third pick in the 1984 draft, Michael Jordan, never asked to
renegotiate what quickly became a less-than-market-value contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Lorenzen,'' said Baylor, speaking for a franchise that
has until March 13 to offer an extension. ``We'd like to keep him
here. We feel he's an integral part of this team. At this point in
time, we have no intention of trading him.''

STEROTYPE FAILS TO CAPTURE BIKER  
 CLEAN-CUT LUSK DOES IT HIS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He doesn't have bleached hair, wouldn't know a tattoo parlor
from a paint shop and doesn't have a single pair of baggy pants
hanging in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Ezra Lusk, your non-typical American Motorcyclist
Association Supercross Series riding stick-in-the-mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, I have a certain image that I try to live up
to, and I think it's to be a clean-cut, hard-working and determined
rider,'' Lusk said. ``I think it's a good image, one that
represents myself and represents Team Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how other people dress. There's nothing wrong it.
It's just not me.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're expecting Lusk to arrive at Bank One Ballpark
tonight fitted with a shiny nose ring, the chances are greater that
Dennis Rodman will divorce Carmen Electra and marry Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ezra is a blue-collar guy,'' supercross spokesman Pat Schutte
said. ``He's not really outspoken and kind of likes to be low key.
But . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But on the racetrack, wow.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lusk doesn't ride with the flash and pizazz of a Jeremy
McGrath (who does?), he is one of the sport's most technically
efficient riders.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Lusk knows how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite riding for much of last season with a fractured left
hand and a separated right shoulder, Lusk still had a career-high
four wins and a runner-up finish to McGrath, a five-time champion,
in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   Lusk is off to an even better start this season, winning the
season opener at Anaheim two weeks ago and following it up with
another win last week at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Lusk won last year's Valley race, when it was held at Sun Devil
Stadium in front of a crowd in excess of 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar turnout is expected at BOB, which has impressed riders
seeing the facility for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Yamaha rider Jimmy Button, who attended
Greenway High School and now lives in Tuscany Hills, Calif. ``My
parents still live here and have (Diamondbacks) season tickets.
They told me it was something special. Now I believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Campbell, a rider from Apache Junction, also was getting his
first inside look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've passed it before, but I didn't know what it was like
inside,'' Campbell said. ``It's great. I think the course is going
to be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Button believes the layout has the potential to entice better
racing than Sun Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arizona State University) was a tight course,'' Button said.
``I could be wrong, but I think (BOB's course) is more open and
makes for better passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lusk has to worry about making a lot of passes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had to rally past two riders in the closing stages
at San Diego, one of the keys to Lusk's early success has been
quick starts, meaning he hasn't had to fight through congested
traffic to get up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honda's given me a good bike, but other than that, I haven't
done anything different with my starts,'' said Lusk, who leads
Honda teammates Mike LaRocco and Mickael Pichon in the standings.
``If anything, I'm taking it a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I felt like I pushed the edge a whole bunch, and
that probably had a little bit to do with the reason I didn't stay
healthy. I told myself I wasn't going to do that this year, and
I've pretty much had two great races.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, I'll have to start pushing the edge, but not as
much as the other riders because they're having to chase me instead
of my having to chase them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone expects to be chasing Lusk and McGrath for
the title. Even Lusk admits McGrath, the defending champion and
winner of five of the past six titles, is the rider he most has to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeremy will be the toughest guy,'' Lusk said. ``I know
there's a couple of other guys that will be pushing us, too, but I
don't expect them to all be up there every weekend like Jeremy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy is still the guy you have to beat.'' &QL;

BOAT HAS CATCHING UP TO DO  
 SEEKS TO REDEEM SUBPAR '98 SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly hoarse from repeatedly thanking A.J. Foyt for unlocking
the Indy Racing League door three years ago, Billy Boat wants to
thank the legendary car owner one more time.
</P>
<P>
   With a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Teammate) Kenny (Brack) won it last season,'' said Boat, who
won at Texas Motor Speedway last season. ``I think I can do the
same. But for us to be championship contenders, we need to be
finishing more races.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest downfall of our program last year. We
just flat didn't finish enough races. That's the part I was most
disappointed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a broken left femur and a fractured pelvis, injuries Boat
suffered in a June crash at New Hampshire International Speedway,
didn't bother Boat as much as the failed finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that happened last year was after I came
back from being (injured), I felt like I was way behind and I was
always trying to play catch-up,'' said Boat, who lives in Glendale.
``So, at times, I probably pushed the car too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely crashed too much. A lot of it was because
(someone else was at fault). Some of it wasn't. But the way I look
at, this is a new year and everybody is starting from a clean sheet
of paper. We're back at ground zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Liftoff is Sunday in the IRL season opener at Walt Disney World
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the start of qualifying, something Boat was terrific
at in 1998, when he captured a series-high six poles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as Boat already has defined, was finishing what he
had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any trouble going fast,'' Boat said. ``Our
trouble was finishing races. (Foyt) and I had a conversation during
the off-season, but it's not like there's any pressure on me. A.J.
let's you drive at your own pace. It's not like I have to prove
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line in racing is you want to take the
checkered flag. If you're not doing that, you have a lot of room
for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you want to be in contention for the championship, the
way to do that is through consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat could name several racetracks he'd rather begin that quest
at than the tricky 1-mile tri-oval in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the setting, some drivers have referred to the
course as ``Mickey Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat won't go that far, but he does admit to not yet quite
figuring out the quickest route from Point A to Point B.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest racetrack to race on or set your car
up,'' Boat said. ``It's almost impossible to run side by side in
the corners, unlike Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick to making your car go fast at Disney is making your
car turn in Turn 1, where it has a tendency to push the front end
(toward the outer wall), but also make it comfortable in Turn 2. If
your car is too loose in Turn 2, you feel like you're always trying
to save your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your car is too good in Turn 1, that means you're probably
going to be too loose in Turn 2. So you have to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat isn't the only driver familiar to Walt Disney's
difficulties. Brack also has been victimized, finishing 13th in
last year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last season's dismal start, Brack rebounded, winning
three straight races at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not have known too much about me last year, but I
think they know I can drive,'' said Brack, a native of Sweden.
``And I know it will be hard to win another title, but I don't
think it will be harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team. We all get along great. I like where I'm
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Brack means it. After last season's championship
run, he said he received several driving offers from non-IRL teams,
turning thumbs down to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably had three real good offers, but I can't tell you
which (series),'' Brack said. ``I'll leave that private. But they
were with race-winning teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Foyt returning intact can only mean trouble to everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, there's a lot of good teams out there,'' Boat
said. ``You can never count out (Team Menard). They lost Tony
Stewart (to NASCAR Winston Cup racing), and there may be a little
bit of a learning curve (with new driver Greg Ray) to get back to
where they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Ray) is a good driver, and that team has good
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt also has provided Boat and Brack with good equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Brack proved it last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Boat says, it's his turn. &QL;

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Avondale Westview High School's Andrae Thurman started with
Arizona in mind. Desert Vista's Bobby Wade began with Arizona State
in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the best of friends and competitors since fifth
grade kept an open mind about both programs when deliberating their
football futures. Wade,`` The Arizona Republic'' player of the
year, ended up seeing what Thurman felt from the get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Verifying what Wade told ``The Republic'' earlier this week, he
and Thurman made oral commitments to Arizona official by calling a
news conference Friday at Desert Vista.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Tomey?'' Thurman asked after Wade dialed Arizona Coach
Dick Tomey on a cellular phone. ``How's it going? Me and Bobby
would like to tell you that we're coming to U of A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. Tomey is getting two of the most coveted state
recruits. Both said ASU was a runner-up, ahead of Colorado and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, 5 feet 10, 180 pounds, set a Class 5A single-season record
with 41 touchdowns off 1,614 rushing yards and 720 receiving yards.
He scored the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter of three
state playoff games on the Thunder's march to the 5A title.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, 6 feet 1, 170 pounds, came off a 13-interception junior
season to star on offense as a senior, where he turned 52 catches
into 913 yards and 11 touchdowns. Thurman was UA's only prep
receiver recruit and Wade said he was promised a shot at tailback
even though several suitors liked him at defensive back, where he
had 12 interceptions and led his team in solo tackles as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I always wanted to go to school with (Thurman),''
said Wade, who was hosted by Ortege Jenkins on his campus visit
last weekend. ``It just so happened everything was perfect at U of
A.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really had a belief in me to at least give me a chance to
play tailback. (Other schools) weren't giving me a chance to play
where my heart is. If I work hard enough and get my size up, I can
be a great collegiate back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Thurman played freshman football together at Westview
before Wade transferred to the Ahwatukee Foothills area school.
They became such good friends that they got Wade's father, Robert,
and Thurman's mother, Trisha, dating.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Thurman can sign national letters of intent on Feb. 3. &QL;

catharsis in Washington, it may be Hollywood's turn to provide the

</P>
<P>
   HEILBRONER-ECONOMISTS (Undated) _ Ask economists in the baby
boom generation why they became economists, and any number will
give some credit to Robert L. Heilbroner. So it is somewhat
surprising to find Heilbroner increasingly critical of the
economists he helped inspire. They have missed the point, he says.
By Louis Uchitelle. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-J (Undated) _ In unscrambling the puzzle of the books
attributed to Moses, scholars have identified four narratives by
letters _ J, E, P, D. Now, after a dozen years of research, Richard
Elliott Friedman, a professor of Hebrew and comparative literature

argued that the J narrative comprises a ``hidden book'' that is
nearly 3,000 years old and that runs from Genesis to the First Book
of Kings. By Gustav Niebuhr. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   ON-THE-ROAD (Undated) _ Consider them latter-day nomads. Or
maybe, come to think of it, more like venerable turtles, who carry
their homes on their backs. They are the hundreds of thousands of
elderly and retired people who take to life on the road, spending
all or much of the year wandering around North America in assorted
trailers, converted buses, campers and motor homes. By Tom Chaffin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS (Moved in ``s'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SCANDAL (Undated) _ Another member of the International
Olympic Committee, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya, resigned,
and the trail of Olympic corruption extended to Sydney's securing
of the 2000 Summer Games. A top Australian Olympic official has
acknowledged offering $35,000 apiece to two IOC members from Africa
the night before Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes to secure the
Games, according to a report on Saturday in The Sydney Morning
Herald. By Jere Longman.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-KNICKS (Purchase, N.Y.) _ The Knicks held their second
official workout, and their first with Sprewell. By Selena Roberts.

   The New York Times News Service will send the following Money

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KELLOGG-CEREAL (Battle Creek, Mich.) _ Lately, the Kellogg
company's attempts to revive its stagnant breakfast business have
been about as successful as trying to freshen soggy cereal with
more milk. Now, key investors are out of patience, senior-level
executives have left in frustration and some shareholders wonder if
the best bet may well be to sell the storied but beleaguered
business. The board, meanwhile, is mired in conflicts, and the
company still operates in the shadow of the quirks of its
idiosyncratic founder. By Dana Canedy and Reed Abelson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   With Graphic and Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CARMAKERS-SALES (Tulsa, Okla.) _ The carmakers are out to
overhaul how they sell cars, and how Americans buy them. Ford is
going farthest, buying up dealerships in mid-size cities, entering
into joint ventures with leading dealers and thereby gaining
control over the car-buying experience. Here is the view from Tulsa
and Oklahoma City, which of all places is the cutting edge. By
Keith Bradsher. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

address and, again, before a roaring crowd in Buffalo, N.Y.,
President Clinton last week floated the idea of Universal Savings
Accounts, a new type of subsidized savings for low- and

use 11 percent of the projected budget surplus to match money the
workers would save on their own in the USAs. By Leslie Wayne.
(Moved).

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed like a good idea to U.S. Customs Service
officials, no doubt. When Customs inspectors became suspicious that
someone was trying to smuggle drugs or other contraband into the
country, they would offer a choice: a conventional strip-search or
an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   For innocent travelers, an X-ray would be less degrading than a
strip-search by a stranger in uniform. And for Customs inspectors,
it would be easier to discover drugs, cash or other illicit goods
hidden beneath travelers' clothing or even inside their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But, as sometimes happens with good ideas, the reality did not
match the hope. The Customs Service began offering foreign visitors
and returning Americans the X-ray option last October at two major
airports, John F. Kennedy in New York City and Miami International
in Florida. In the first three months of the experiment, nine
people at Kennedy and eight in Miami were offered the choice of an
X-ray. No one accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Customs Service are not sure why their offer
was rejected so resoundingly, but they have some theories. Drug
couriers who are carrying narcotics internally, usually by
swallowing condoms containing heroin, would surely want to avoid
detection through an X-ray. Innocent tourists might have chosen the
humiliation of a strip-search because they feared the health
consequences of an unnecessary X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the factor of sheer inconvenience: The X-ray
machines were not in the airports' arrivals buildings, but in their
medical centers. Travelers who opt for an X-ray would have to be
driven, in handcuffs, from the Customs Service's inspection areas
to the medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day test of X-rays was scheduled to end in mid-January,
but officials have decided to press on. They say they are
determined to find a way to examine tourists and returning
Americans without the tension and unpleasantness of a strip-search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the option going,'' said Raymond Kelly,
commissioner of the Customs Service and a former New York City
police commissioner. ``I want the concept to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Kelly said, it was relatively easy to spot drug
smugglers arriving at airports. But because of the traffickers'
greater sophistication, inspectors find themselves guessing wrong
and searching a growing proportion of innocent travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is mitigate as much as possible the
unpleasantness of a full-blown strip-search,'' Kelly said. ``This
is an unpleasant experience for the inspectors and for the people
who are being examined.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kelly and his agency are now gearing up for round two of the
X-ray experiment. Contractors have installed new body scan machines
in Miami and at Kennedy that produce images of anything between a
traveler's clothing and skin. This scan exposes people to far less
radiation than a traditional X-ray, which penetrates body organs.
It will also be much more convenient than X-rays have proved to be.
The new machines are being tested next to the Customs Service's
inspection areas, near the arrival gates. They are likely to be in
use in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 million people pass through customs at airports,
seaports and border crossings each year, and the overwhelming
majority receive only a cursory look at their documents and
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 people were strip-searched by inspectors last year,
Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some civil liberties lawyers are raising questions
about the idea of taking X-rays of people entering the country _ on
grounds both aesthetic and legal. They noted that the sight of an
X-ray or a body-scan machine upon entering the United States was
not quite as welcoming or poetic as the greeting the Statue of
Liberty offered to generations of visitors: ``Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he is concerned that the use of X-rays ``will
result in the government obtaining more information about people
that they do not have any interest in knowing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, whose office has received no complaints about the X-ray
option, said he would want to know whether the federal agency
intended to keep copies of X-rays or body scans of innocent
travelers and whether these images would be retained in a database.
He also questioned the possible health consequences of taking an
X-ray that was not needed for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the inspectors would destroy the X-rays. ``We're not
interested in collecting medical evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel said his office would monitor the Customs Service's
innovations. He said he was concerned that, because an X-ray or
body scan seems less intrusive than a strip-search, it might one
day become routine, in the process ``transforming entrance into the
United States into a general search.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a commentary on how we're changing,'' Siegel
said. ``Drugs are a serious issue, but from our perspective, it
would be better if there were at least a public discussion about
these things.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ Around the world the crises pile up, and the
collage of headlines does not make a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, babies die of cold on hillsides where mothers have
fled to save their lives. In Sierra Leone, madmen posing as a rebel
army cut off the hands of teen-aged boys and trap families in their
homes to torch them. Angolans shoot down relief planes. A defiant
Saddam Hussein watches the United Nations drift helplessly without
a policy. Haiti spirals back into chaos. And the chief judge of an
international tribunal is stopped cold at Serbia's border when she
tries to investigate crimes against humanity in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge here?
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of the century, the newer, saner world order
confidently anticipated when communism collapsed a decade ago is
nowhere to be seen. International organizations from the United
Nations and NATO to an embattled West African peacekeeping
organization seem powerless. A stream of important people go humbly
to the feet of tyrants _ Saddam, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Slobodan
Milosevic, Hun Sen _ to beg for a modicum of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   True, brutality in the last decade has led to some creative
diplomacy, beginning in 1991 with the invention of an arms
inspection system designed to disarm Iraq without bloodshed. But
that system is now on the shelf, along with a host of other ideas.
Remember ``humanitarian intervention'' in Somalia? ``Safe havens''
in Bosnia?
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the United Nations, the United States,
never much of a fan of collective international action, appears to
have retreated even more from an active role in designing
cooperative strategies, as opposed to essentially unilateral ones,
just when Washington's consistent leadership is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism at the United Nations that while there may be
many critics of the United States around, there is also a
dependency on Washington to sort things out, to come up with fresh
ideas in an age when old ideologies, beliefs and rules have been
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a degree of intellectual and diplomatic laziness has
set in in Washington now that it is not so much the sole remaining
superpower but the supreme power,'' said David Malone, a Canadian
diplomat who recently became president of the International Peace
Academy, an independent organization that works with the United
Nations in studying conflicts and how to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Like many scholars who focus on U.S. relations with the United
Nations, and several former secretaries of state who recently spoke
in a private discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations, Malone
says that allowing the coalition that confronted Iraq in 1991 ``to
fall apart in a rather neglectful way'' has weakened the Security
Council. The council is now paralyzed on most issues, not only for
that reason but also because nations like France and Russia have
rediscovered their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point more directly to what they see as Washington's

international community be willing to take forceful action,'' he
said. ``We have come to fear very much the threat and use of force,
even in the most noble causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is magnified by the characters of the combatants and
of the causes. A great many of today's conflicts are civil wars,
and 100 years of conventions written to make war civilized are
useless pieces of paper in these fights. Ordinary people are the
targets and the fodder of rogue militias. Nine times more civilians
than combatants die. Battles are fought over no apparent
principles, only greed and power.

five years.

   In this ugly new order, brutalizers act with impunity and prove
daily that a peaceful, humane world is not going to be built with
good-governance programs. Force, or a credible threat of force, may

Baghdad last February that diplomacy backed by military force was
his recipe for success. Does this sound a little like that old Cold

   UNITED NATIONS _ Around the world the crises pile up, and the
collage of headlines does not make a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, babies die of cold on hillsides where mothers have
fled to save their lives. In Sierra Leone, madmen posing as a rebel
army cut off the hands of teen-aged boys and trap families in their
homes to torch them. Angolans shoot down relief planes. A defiant
Saddam Hussein watches the United Nations drift helplessly without
a policy. Haiti spirals back into chaos. And the chief judge of an
international tribunal is stopped cold at Serbia's border when she
tries to investigate crimes against humanity in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge here?
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of the century, the newer, saner world order
confidently anticipated when communism collapsed a decade ago is
nowhere to be seen. International organizations from the United
Nations and NATO to an embattled West African peacekeeping
organization seem powerless. A stream of important people go humbly
to the feet of tyrants _ Saddam, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Slobodan
Milosevic, Hun Sen _ to beg for a modicum of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   True, brutality in the last decade has led to some creative
diplomacy, beginning in 1991 with the invention of an arms
inspection system designed to disarm Iraq without bloodshed. But
that system is now on the shelf, along with a host of other ideas.
Remember ``humanitarian intervention'' in Somalia? ``Safe havens''
in Bosnia?
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the United Nations, the United States,
never much of a fan of collective international action, appears to
have retreated even more from an active role in designing
cooperative strategies, as opposed to essentially unilateral ones,
just when Washington's consistent leadership is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism at the United Nations that while there may be
many critics of the United States around, there is also a
dependency on Washington to sort things out, to come up with fresh
ideas in an age when old ideologies, beliefs and rules have been
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a degree of intellectual and diplomatic laziness has
set in in Washington now that it is not so much the sole remaining
superpower but the supreme power,'' said David Malone, a Canadian
diplomat who recently became president of the International Peace
Academy, an independent organization that works with the United
Nations in studying conflicts and how to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Like many scholars who focus on U.S. relations with the United
Nations, and several former secretaries of state who recently spoke
in a private discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations, Malone
says that allowing the coalition that confronted Iraq in 1991 ``to
fall apart in a rather neglectful way'' has weakened the Security
Council. The council is now paralyzed on most issues, not only for
that reason but also because nations like France and Russia have
rediscovered their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point more directly to what they see as Washington's
failure to work more closely with Russia over the years in drafting
policies on trouble spots where Moscow has some clout and
experience _ Iraq and the former Yugoslavia prime among them.
Russia has also had to put to one side its own requests for more
United Nations involvement in the struggling countries of the
former Soviet Union while Washington got attention for Haiti or
Cuba or other issues important to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said, however, that caution and withdrawal also mark
other nations' policies. ``In the absence of a willingness to take
certain risks, we will see a situation in which conflicts are
allowed to deteriorate and, in effect, rot until a point where they
are extraordinarily difficult to address, and only then will the
international community be willing to take forceful action,'' he
said. ``We have come to fear very much the threat and use of force,
even in the most noble causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is magnified by the characters of the combatants and
of the causes. A great many of today's conflicts are civil wars,
and 100 years of conventions written to make war civilized are

   ``I call it the copycat syndrome,'' said Dame Margaret Anstee,
who was the secretary general's special envoy in Angola in the
early 1990s. She said that in 1992, when the rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi ``chose bullets over ballots,'' he had been watching the
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ``getting away with murder and
the U.N. was not able to deal with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced,'' she said, ``that Savimbi was sitting in the
bush getting the message: The U.N. is a toothless tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing something about how or what dictators think or
recognizing problems-in-the-making in any number of countries has
not helped in learning how to solve or prevent the problems. And
the longer disasters go on, the harder life is for people trying to
stop them. Peacekeepers and aid workers alike are often criticized
as being part of the problem when their camps and life-saving
services inadvertently provide aid and sometimes cover for one side
in a civil war; aid to Hutu refugees in 1994 in what was then Zaire
offers an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In internal conflicts, often _ if not always _ helping
civilian populations that live in territory controlled by the
adversary is almost automatically seen as assisting the enemy,''
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general in
charge of emergency relief. ``This is a fundamental change in
contemporary warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer a conflict lasts, the more difficult it becomes for
humanitarian agencies and indeed for peacekeeping operations to
preserve their impartiality and to be seen to be operating in an
impartial manner,'' he said. ``I know no answer to that problem,
except that conflicts should not be allowed to last as long as they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   With relief workers under attack along with civilian populations
_ and the United States and other nations refusing requests to
provide protection for refugee populations, as in Zaire from 1994
to 1997 _ the aid agencies face a catastrophic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have access, seldom do we have the means of providing
these groups with something that is more important than assistance,
which is protection,'' de Mello said. ``Therefore the specter of
the well-fed dead _ those we feed but are unable to protect and
eventually are killed _ is something that we have been grappling
with for many years now.''
</P>
<P>
   The new world order is an environment without ideologies, which
however flawed may have at least provided symbols and ennobling
motivations in past conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are much smaller now,'' said Arthur Helton, an
international lawyer who directs migration projects at the Open
Society Institute. ``The circumstances are far more driven by self
interest or the perception of self interest.'' Conflicts, he added,
now ride on causes that are ``regional, subregional, even to the
point of clans _ the atomization of societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Small ideas. Big egos. War in Africa. Butchery in the Balkans.
Not to mention a resilient American optimism that blots out
problems lurking over the hill. Could this be reminiscent of the
start of the 20th century as much as a definition of its end?

   HOLLYWOOD _ On an evening this March, the ailing, 89-year-old
Elia Kazan, one of America's greatest film and theatrical
directors, is scheduled to receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st
annual Academy Awards. It will not only crown Kazan's career but,
in many ways, spell the end of the tormented legacy of the
Hollywood blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was unanimously selected Jan. 7 by the 39-member board of
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has given
honorary Oscars in the past to such icons as Buster Keaton,
Satyajit Ray, Greta Garbo, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa. What
was surprising about this latest decision, which came after an
impassioned speech by Karl Malden, a long-time Kazan colleague, was
that there was no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Kazan has symbolized the darkest moment of the
blacklist, when friend informed on friend before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, which was zealously looking for
communist influence in Hollywood. On April 10, 1952, Kazan, a top
Broadway director with an important film career, informed on eight
old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him, had once
belonged to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee J. Cobb, Burl Ives, Jerome Robbins and other
prominent entertainment figures also named names, none had quite
the success or fame of Kazan. Nor were they as criticized as he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was about time to honor him,'' said Malden,
who met Kazan in 1937 when both worked at the Group Theater, and
later starred in ``On the Waterfront'' and other films by Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there'd be a slugfest,'' he added. ``They all voted
to give him the award.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, angry dissent among some blacklisted
screenwriters over giving an Oscar to Kazan at the March 21
ceremony. But what seems most surprising about the overall response
to the Academy's announcement is how muted it has been. The
emotions and fury that stamped the blacklist days and lingered for
decades finally seem to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazan's case, his advanced years may be a reason for the
change _ many of his adversaries are dead _ and his extraordinary
record is impossible to ignore. He was the nation's most
significant postwar theatrical director, and his film classics also
include ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Viva Zapata!'' and ``East
of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   New debate about the Cold War and a recent spate of books have
also muted opinions about Kazan. New scholarship has persuaded many
people that icons of the left like Alger Hiss and Julius Rosenberg
were probably Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   Although adamant that injustice was done in convicting Hiss and
Rosenberg, the writer and editor Victor Navasky acknowledged some
ambivalence about the Kazan award.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's a human thing,'' said Navasky, publisher of
The Nation and author of ``Naming Names'' (Viking, 1980), a book
about the Hollywood blacklist. ``He's not physically well and he
made this great cinematic contribution. Second is, with the passage
of time, some of the passions have cooled and things are being put
in a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said,
and the release of archives that tempered many historians' harsh
view of American anti-communism, a new trend. ``There's something
in the air that's a reaction against the historical revisionism of
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, which said that America was a
contributor to the Cold War, too,'' Navasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Navasky and historian Allen Weinstein, who interpret
anti-communism very differently, separately mentioned Dalton
Trumbo, a prominent blacklisted writer, and said that Trumbo summed
up their feelings about the Kazan case. ( Weinstein's current book,
``The Haunted Wood,'' with Alexander Vassiliev, details Soviet
espionage in this country until the early days of the Cold War.)
</P>
<P>
   Trumbo told the Screenwriters Guild's Laurel Awards dinner in
1970 that the blacklist was marked by ``bad faith and good, honesty
and dishonesty, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.''
He cautioned the audience not to ``search for villains and heroes
or saints or devils because there were none: there were only
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Schrecker, a history professor at Yeshiva University and
author of ``Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little,
Brown, 1998), which is hostile to anti-communism, said she could
see why Hollywood could honor Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I certainly don't approve of what Kazan did during
the McCarthy period,'' Professor Schrecker said, ``one can maybe
learn a lesson from Bill Clinton and compartmentalize, and separate
Kazan, the informer, and Kazan, the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kazan's case complicated, though, seems to be his
personality. After testifying, Kazan took out an ad in The New York
Times justifying his action _ several blacklisted writers still
talk about the ad _ and he remains steadfast in his convictions. In
his ad, the director denounced communism as a ``dangerous and alien
conspiracy,'' and said that ``liberals must speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1988 memoirs, Kazan said he acted honorably in naming
names and would do so again. He said American communists and their
supporters did not speak out against Stalin's atrocities. ``I
remember those things and I'm glad I was on the other side,'' he
said. Kazan was one of many, including the scholars Edmund Wilson
and Irving Howe, who believed that the Communist Party had a
ruinous effect on film, theater and the wider culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's defenders say it's absurd to say that he personally
destroyed careers because he named names that the committee already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hard feelings have not completely disappeared. Walter
Bernstein, author of the memoir, ``Inside Out'' (Knopf 1996), about
his years as a blacklisted screenwriter, said of Kazan: ``The
committee had all the names. They didn't need the names. They
needed  &UR; your &LR;  name. They needed Kazan's name. They needed him. He
made a choice. He did a bad thing. He hurt other people in the
profession. He went over to the side of people who were bigots and
racists and gave them his name and his eminence, which was
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, another prominent blacklisted writer, spoke
with outrage:``Has he ever said, `Gee, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I was wrong.' Others have said it. He didn't. If he
said, `I did a bad thing and I'm sorry I did it,' no one would care
anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   But these men are in the minority these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes and wounds heal, things lose their passion,'' said
Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of the Film Studies department at
Wesleyan University, which is curator of Kazan's papers. ``People
look at the mess we have now _ the imperfection in sports heroes,
the imperfection in politicians. Who is anyone to judge how they
would have behaved back then?''

in a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said,
and the release of archives that tempered many historians' harsh
view of American anti-communism, a new trend. ``There's something
in the air that's a reaction against the historical revisionism of
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, which said that America was a
contributor to the Cold War, too,'' Navasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Navasky and historian Allen Weinstein, who interpret
anti-communism very differently, separately mentioned Dalton
Trumbo, a prominent blacklisted writer, and said that Trumbo summed
up their feelings about the Kazan case. ( Weinstein's current book,
``The Haunted Wood,'' with Alexander Vassiliev, details Soviet
espionage in this country until the early days of the Cold War.)
</P>
<P>
   Trumbo told the Screenwriters Guild's Laurel Awards dinner in
1970 that the blacklist was marked by ``bad faith and good, honesty
and dishonesty, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.''
He cautioned the audience not to ``search for villains and heroes
or saints or devils because there were none: there were only
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Schrecker, a history professor at Yeshiva University and
author of ``Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little,
Brown, 1998), which is hostile to anti-communism, said she could
see why Hollywood could honor Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I certainly don't approve of what Kazan did during
the McCarthy period,'' Professor Schrecker said, ``one can maybe
learn a lesson from Bill Clinton and compartmentalize, and separate
Kazan, the informer, and Kazan, the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kazan's case complicated, though, seems to be his
personality. After testifying, Kazan took out an ad in The New York
Times justifying his action _ several blacklisted writers still
talk about the ad _ and he remains steadfast in his convictions. In
his ad, the director denounced communism as a ``dangerous and alien
conspiracy,'' and said that ``liberals must speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1988 memoirs, Kazan said he acted honorably in naming
names and would do so again. He said American communists and their
supporters did not speak out against Stalin's atrocities. ``I
remember those things and I'm glad I was on the other side,'' he
said. Kazan was one of many, including the scholars Edmund Wilson
and Irving Howe, who believed that the Communist Party had a
ruinous effect on film, theater and the wider culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's defenders say it's absurd to say that he personally
destroyed careers because he named names that the committee already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hard feelings have not completely disappeared. Walter
Bernstein, author of the memoir, ``Inside Out'' (Knopf 1996), about
his years as a blacklisted screenwriter, said of Kazan: ``The
committee had all the names. They didn't need the names. They
needed  &UR; your &LR;  name. They needed Kazan's name. They needed him. He
made a choice. He did a bad thing. He hurt other people in the
profession. He went over to the side of people who were bigots and
racists and gave them his name and his eminence, which was
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, another prominent blacklisted writer, spoke
with outrage:``Has he ever said, `Gee, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I was wrong.' Others have said it. He didn't. If he
said, `I did a bad thing and I'm sorry I did it,' no one would care
anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   But these men are in the minority these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes and wounds heal, things lose their passion,'' said
Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of the Film Studies department at
Wesleyan University, which is curator of Kazan's papers. ``People
look at the mess we have now _ the imperfection in sports heroes,
the imperfection in politicians. Who is anyone to judge how they
would have behaved back then?''

   CHINA-FEMALE-SUICIDE (Lutou, China) _ Female suicide is the
puzzling plague of rural China, making the country's rate the
highest in the world; the overall suicide rate is also one of the
highest. In the last few years, a small group of government
officials, researchers, health workers and women's advocates in
China have gingerly started to research and confront what is still
so often regarded as a sensitive and embarrassing problem. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal. With photo, map and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POPE (Mexico City) _ John Paul II urged the Bishops of
North and South America gathered here to take better care of the
poor. But sounding a new and somewhat uncharacteristic note, the
Pope also instructed them to minister to the rich. By Alessandra
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPICS-SCANDAL (LAUSANNE, Switzerland) - Behind police
barricades, accused members of the International Olympic Committee
on Saturday pleaded their cases in attempt to avoid expulsion for
misconduct in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. By Jere Longman.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-ASSASSINATION (Johannesburg) _ A high-level official of
a South African multiracial political party, the United Democratic
Movement, was assassinated Saturday, riddled with bullets as he
left a grocery store near his home. With the campaign for South
Africa's second national elections just gearing up, the killing of
the official, Sifiso Nkabinde, once again raises questions about
whether political violence will return as the vote approaches. By
Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-PENSIONERS (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ Millions of retired
government workers across Brazil are watching the financial crisis
that is enveloping Latin America's largest economy tear the first
breaches in the social contract that has shaped their lives. What
else, they wonder, will be open to question in the new scheme of
things? ``You work really hard, and what is it for? Just to worry
at the end of your life?'' said Djalma da Silva Rodrigues, who
worked for the Federal Revenue department for 38 years. By Diana
Jean Schemo. With photo and map.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PRIMAKOV (Moscow) _ His boss is back in the hospital, his
budget for 1999 is dismissed as unrealistic, the economy is sure to
get worse and the International Monetary Fund is still playing hard
to get. For Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia, now four
months in office, the new year has yet to bring good news. By
Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   SKOREA-RECOVERY (Seoul, South Korea) _ A bit more than a year
after South Korea had to accept a humiliating bailout from the
International Monetary Fund, it is showing signs of crawling back
from the abyss. Unemployment rates are still rising, and the
economic misery is widespread, but there is a growing conviction
that South Korea has already bottomed out and may now help lead the
way for Asia out of the economic crisis. By Cheryl WuDunn. With

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-INTERROGATIONS (Jerusalem) _ For the first time, Israel's
Supreme Court is weighing the legality of methods of interrogations
used by the Shin Bet security service against hundreds of
Palestinian suspects every year. The spectacle of nine judges
considering these methods, which have been called torture by the
United Nations, Amnesty International and other human rights
groups, was extraordinary, and is unparalleled in other countries.
By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-KURD-LEADER (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Many Turks recently have
been playing a variation of a popular parlor game: Where's Apo? The
Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, widely known as Apo, is
Turkey's most wanted fugitive. He left Italy eight days ago after a
stay of more than six weeks, but nobody seems to know where he
went. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN (Cairo) _ King Hussein of Jordan is preparing to
name one of his sons as his heir, Jordanian officials said today,
culminating a dizzying week in which the King returned from six
months of cancer treatment abroad and then dismissed his brother as
Crown Prince. By Douglas Jehl.

<P>
   Y2K-MEDICINE (Salt Lake City) _ As a nurse turned computer
systems manager, Laureen West is one of a crowd of consultants able
to describe how year-2000 computer malfunctions could interrupt the
distribution of medicines. But as a brain tumor patient who needs
daily doses of synthetic-thyroid and other drugs to stay alive, the
43-year-old Mrs. West has no rivals when it comes to convincing
listeners that it matters. By Barnaby J. Feder. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICS-CURRICULUM (Undated) _ For generations of high school
students, the sequence of science has been a given: 9th-grade
biology, 10th-grade chemistry and, for the minority who make it
that far, 11th-grade physics. But that sequence, established a
century ago when science was a simpler matter, is now being
questioned, with a growing number of scientists and educators
arguing that physics ought to come first. By Tamar Lewin. With

<P>
   NATURALIST-EAGLES (Rockport, Wash.) For the 229 bald eagles that
Libby Mills counted last Wednesday, the eight-mile stretch of the
Skagit River between here and Marblemount is the four-star,
all-you-can-eat sushi bar of Washington's waterways. By Tina
Kelley. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ A federal judge Saturday ordered
Monica S. Lewinsky to submit to an interview with the independent
counsel on behalf of House prosecutors, drawing a bitter White
House attack on their effort to force Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation.
The decision by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, issued moments before
senators resumed a second day of questioning in President Clinton's
impeachment trial, ignited a furious question-and-answer session on
the Senate floor. By Eric Scmitt.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-JONES-LAWYERS (Washington) _ Some of the most serious
damage to Bill Clinton's presidency came not from his high-profile
political enemies but from a small secret clique of lawyers in
their 30s who share a deep antipathy toward the president,
according to nearly two dozen interviews and recently filed court
documents. By Don Van Natta Jr. and Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ With the trial of President
Clinton moving into an unscripted period of critical votes, an
increasingly restless Senate is searching anxiously for a way to
bring the impeachment proceedings to a swift conclusion. But the
parties Saturday appeared sharply divided over how to do this. By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-FITZGERALD (Washington) _ Sen. Peter G. Fitzgerald,
R-Ill., had expected to spend his first weeks in Congress finding
an apartment, hiring a staff and drafting the bills he had promised
to voters during the campaign. Instead, he celebrated his arrival
here by digging up his Dartmouth College American history textbook
to brush up on those 18th and 19th century presidents whose names
are echoing around the marble halls of his new workplace. By Adam
Nagourney. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-BIBLE-BELT (Pendleton, S.C.) _ In this stretch of the
Bible Belt where highways are punctuated with billboards about
``Heaven. Hell. The Choice Is Yours,'' it has been one hellish bad
week. What hurts most is the impeachment trial in Washington. But
almost as hurtful are Clinton's soaring approval ratings. ``Either
the pollsters are asking the wrong questions or this country is so
wrong morally that we are going down the tubes,'' complained Johnny
Landreth Jr., as he ate a fried-chicken lunch beneath the ``No
Swearing'' sign at Bill's Cafe on Highway 76. By Blaine Harden.

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LINCOLN (Washington) _ Sen. Blanche Lincoln seems
anxious to show she is not in the tank for her fellow Democrat and
Arkansan, President Clinton; over and over, in an interview in her
office last week, she volunteered that she was trying to make good
on her oath of impartiality. By Melinda Henneberger. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-CALIFORNIA (Washington) _ California has always been
critical in the presidential equation. But by moving up its primary
to join New York and eight other states on March 7 in 2000,
California's primary holds life-threatening powers over
underfinanced campaigns that are still forming. While that might
suggest an urgent need to organize and tap financial sources, Vice
President Al Gore appears to be the only aspirant from either party
who has amassed a powerful array of support at this early juncture
of the 2000 campaign. And the advantage appears compelling. By
Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ALBRIGHT-RUSSIA (Washington) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright embarks Sunday on a trip to a weakened but obstinate
Russia, with little expectation on either side that much
improvement will be made in a relationship plagued by disagreement
on everything from Russia's economic collapse to air strikes
against Iraq. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SECURITY-STOCKS (Washington) _ A proposal by President
Clinton to invest some portion of Social Security reserves in
stocks ignited a brushfire of criticism last week. But lawyers,
administrators and scholars point out that stock investments by
governments and their agencies are neither new nor rare. And those
investments have not, they say, created the widespread problems
critics predict. By Diana B. Henriques. With graphic.

   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ Maureen Dowd on what the scene in the
White House might be like if the Senate drops the impeachment
charges against the president: ``Now we know what the definition of
`is' is,'' Clinton roared with a grin. ``I is off the hook.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening arguments have been heard; the Senate has
asked its questions. President Clinton's impeachment trial is now
twisting toward its most unpredictable phase: the decision on
whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes this week to take depositions, the first
step toward public testimony, command performances are expected
from at least three people, Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary, and Vernon Jordan, his friend. The
House members who are prosecuting the case would also like to hear
from some White House staff members, like chief of staff John
Podesta and senior aide Sidney Blumenthal. And they want the Senate
to invite the president to testify, though his appearance is
thought to be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The White House doesn't want witnesses at all. But the
president's lawyers have hinted that if Ms. Lewinsky is summoned,
they may wish to call some witnesses themselves, Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's former friend, Lucianne Goldberg, the New York book
agent and Tripp confidante, and maybe even Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who has been investigating Clinton for nearly
five years.
</P>
<P>
   With all of these potential witnesses having been questioned
already by Starr's office, there is little likelihood that either
side will elicit new evidence from them. The president's lawyers
complained repeatedly last week that Ms. Lewinsky had already been
questioned 22 times and was unlikely to clarify events on a 23rd
try.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when the impeachment case is boiled down, there is
relatively little conflicting testimony in the record. President
Clinton denied in a deposition last year that he had ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky, but later admitted that they had had
an improper liaison that stopped short of sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in detailed descriptions to the grand jury of 11
sexual encounters with the president, also said there was no sexual
intercourse, but contradicted Clinton on some details of their
meetings. And Ms. Lewinsky said their sexual affair began in late
1995, while Clinton described a friendship that began in early
1996. Mrs. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to retrieve
gifts the president gave her. Ms. Lewinsky testified that it was
Mrs. Currie who initiated the gift retrieval. But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1973 Senate hearings on Watergate, White House
counsel John Dean turned on President Richard M. Nixon and provided
devastating testimony detailing his involvement in a criminal
cover-up. But none of the witnesses likely to be called now _ with
the exception of Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg _ want to harm
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Lewinsky, who is cooperating with Starr, went out of
her way to tell the grand jury that no one asked her to lie and no
one offered her a job in exchange for her silence, the most serious
obstruction-of-justice charges pending against the president. Her
testimony is more damaging on the perjury charge, but the House
prosecutors have said they don't want to get into sex-saturated
public testimony about who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors seem anxious to call witnesses, and the
president's side may respond with its own if it fails to get the
case dismissed. In interviews, four lawyers who have followed the
proceedings assessed the advantages and dangers for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   E. Lawrence Barcella, a Democrat and a former prosecutor, and
Bradford A. Berenson, an admirer of Starr and a white-collar
defense lawyer, agreed that calling witnesses is a bad idea for the
prosecution because most of the likely witnesses will help the
president. ``There's only one reason to call these witnesses,''
Barcella said, ``and that is a general desire to make the president
look smarmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher
who is sympathetic to the House prosecutors, endorsed the calling
of witnesses. ``It seems to me that concluding without witnesses
would stop short of a true resolution,'' he said, ``since both
sides have hinged their cases on the credibility of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor and Clinton
defender, said that if there must be witnesses, he would like to
see Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg called, so that the tangled origins
of the Lewinsky investigation can be clarified for the historical
record. ``Light needs to be cast on the hijacking of the Jones case
and criminalizing of it by Ken Starr,'' he said, referring to the
sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the president by Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   All four lawyers said that if witnesses were called, the most
likely and important were Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Currie and Jordan. And
each could be a minefield for one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who would certainly be the star witness, could
help the president more than hurt him, particularly if she
reiterated her grand jury testimony that Clinton had neither told
her to lie nor tried to get her a job in return for lying about
their relationship. But the prosecutors could try to use her
testimony to bolster the perjury case by leading her through the
president's description of the details of their affair, and asking
her if each was true. The point, of course, would be to get her to
say they were false.``That could be powerful in the well of the
Senate,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   They could also press Ms. Lewinsky on the affidavit she
submitted in the Jones case in an effort to show that she knew it
was false and that Clinton encouraged her to file it. Although the
president may never have directly told Ms. Lewinsky to lie, she
might make it clearer that Clinton encouraged her to deny their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Betty Currie
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie would be second in importance only to Ms. Lewinsky.
Mrs. Currie could help the president's case by reiterating that he
did not instruct her to retrieve gifts, one of the allegations the
prosecutors have emphasized. On this pivotal fact, it could come
down to Mrs. Currie's word against Ms. Lewinsky's, and Mrs. Currie
would probably come across as more credible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie could also help the president on the charge that he
tried to influence her testimony by asking her a series of leading
questions. The president's lawyers could repeat the questions the
president asked Mrs. Currie, and then ask her whether she felt
pressured by him in any way. If she repeated her grand jury
testimony, her answers would be, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors could grill Mrs. Currie on her
testimony that Ms. Lewinsky called her about the gifts, and they
could press her on whether she was certain the president had not
discussed the gifts with her. ``You would try to unwind what was
happening,'' Boutrous said, ``find out why she thought she was
retrieving the gifts and why she put them under her bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has testified that his job assistance to Ms. Lewinsky was
routine, and has adamantly denied any quid pro quo for her
testimony in the Jones lawsuit, so it is unlikely that he would
help the prosecution case, unless the famously unflappable lawyer
seemed nervous or wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors could try to rattle him by asking once
again whether his job help was intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet.
``Then you have to look the witness in the eye,'' Boutrous said.
``The senators might see Vernon Jordan struggling with a difficult
question,'' he said, and find his answer unbelievable.

Mrs. Currie who initiated the gift retrieval. But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1973 Senate hearings on Watergate, White House
counsel John Dean turned on President Richard M. Nixon and provided
devastating testimony detailing his involvement in a criminal
cover-up. But none of the witnesses likely to be called now _ with
the exception of Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg _ want to harm
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Lewinsky, who is cooperating with Starr, went out of
her way to tell the grand jury that no one asked her to lie and no
one offered her a job in exchange for her silence, the most serious
obstruction-of-justice charges pending against the president. Her
testimony is more damaging on the perjury charge, but the House
prosecutors have said they don't want to get into sex-saturated
public testimony about who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors seem anxious to call witnesses, and the
president's side may respond with its own if it fails to get the
case dismissed. In interviews, four lawyers who have followed the
proceedings assessed the advantages and dangers for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   E. Lawrence Barcella, a Democrat and a former prosecutor, and
Bradford A. Berenson, an admirer of Starr and a white-collar
defense lawyer, agreed that calling witnesses is a bad idea for the
prosecution because most of the likely witnesses will help the
president. ``There's only one reason to call these witnesses,''
Barcella said, ``and that is a general desire to make the president
look smarmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher
who is sympathetic to the House prosecutors, endorsed the calling
of witnesses. ``It seems to me that concluding without witnesses
would stop short of a true resolution,'' he said, ``since both
sides have hinged their cases on the credibility of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor and Clinton
defender, said that if there must be witnesses, he would like to
see Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg called, so that the tangled origins
of the Lewinsky investigation can be clarified for the historical
record. ``Light needs to be cast on the hijacking of the Jones case
and criminalizing of it by Ken Starr,'' he said, referring to the
sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the president by Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   All four lawyers said that if witnesses were called, the most
likely and important were Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Currie and Jordan. And
each could be a minefield for one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who would certainly be the star witness, could
help the president more than hurt him, particularly if she
reiterated her grand jury testimony that Clinton had neither told
her to lie nor tried to get her a job in return for lying about
their relationship. But the prosecutors could try to use her
testimony to bolster the perjury case by leading her through the
president's description of the details of their affair, and asking
her if each was true. The point, of course, would be to get her to
say they were false.``That could be powerful in the well of the
Senate,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   They could also press Ms. Lewinsky on the affidavit she
submitted in the Jones case in an effort to show that she knew it
was false and that Clinton encouraged her to file it. Although the
president may never have directly told Ms. Lewinsky to lie, she
might make it clearer that Clinton encouraged her to deny their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Betty Currie
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie would be second in importance only to Ms. Lewinsky.
Mrs. Currie could help the president's case by reiterating that he
did not instruct her to retrieve gifts, one of the allegations the
prosecutors have emphasized. On this pivotal fact, it could come
down to Mrs. Currie's word against Ms. Lewinsky's, and Mrs. Currie
would probably come across as more credible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie could also help the president on the charge that he
tried to influence her testimony by asking her a series of leading
questions. The president's lawyers could repeat the questions the
president asked Mrs. Currie, and then ask her whether she felt
pressured by him in any way. If she repeated her grand jury
testimony, her answers would be, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors could grill Mrs. Currie on her
testimony that Ms. Lewinsky called her about the gifts, and they
could press her on whether she was certain the president had not
discussed the gifts with her. ``You would try to unwind what was
happening,'' Boutrous said, ``find out why she thought she was
retrieving the gifts and why she put them under her bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has testified that his job assistance to Ms. Lewinsky was
routine, and has adamantly denied any quid pro quo for her
testimony in the Jones lawsuit, so it is unlikely that he would
help the prosecution case, unless the famously unflappable lawyer
seemed nervous or wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors could try to rattle him by asking once
again whether his job help was intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet.
``Then you have to look the witness in the eye,'' Boutrous said.
``The senators might see Vernon Jordan struggling with a difficult
question,'' he said, and find his answer unbelievable.

   The term ``witch hunt,'' much heard during the past year, is
usually resurrected during cultural wars. With all the current
hyperbole _ ``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White
House counsel Charles Ruff to describe the charges against
President Clinton in his impeachment trial _ it might be useful to
reflect on the days when a witch hunt was really a hunt for
witches.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition in 1233 to root out
witches, heretics and other agents of Satan, who were believed to
be spreading rapidly throughout Europe to destroy the clerical and
political orders. Thousands were denounced and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, Pope Innocent VIII commissioned a
comprehensive field guide for witch hunters that would remain in
use for two more centuries: ``The Malleus Maleficarum,'' written in
1484 by prominent inquisitors in heresy-riddled Germany. Here are
some excerpts. (The captions have been added by The New York
Times.)

</P>
<P>
   Beware of Smooth-Talking Devils
</P>
<P>
   Although they have a thousand ways of doing harm, and have tried
. . . in every way to subvert and perturb the human race, yet their
power remains confined to the privy parts and the navel. . . .
((Devils)) often lust lecherously after women, and copulate with
them. ((Also, some men are beholden to devils)) who by their magic
charms . . . turn the passions of women to lusts of every kind, and
these criminals are to be thrown to the wild beasts. And the laws
allow that any witness whatsoever is to be admitted as evidence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Devil-Dating Witches
</P>
<P>
   Concerning witches who copulate with devils. . . . What else is
woman but a foe to friendship, an unescapable punishment, a
necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a
domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted
with fair colors! . . . They have slippery tongues, and are unable
to conceal from their fellow-women those things which by the evil
arts they know.
</P>
<P>
   The Lorena Bobbitt Precedent
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is to be thought of witches who . . . sometimes
collect male organs in great numbers, as many as 20 or 30 members,
and put them in a bird's nest, or shut them up in a box . . . as
has been seen by many and is a matter of common report? . . . For a
certain man tells that, when he had lost his member, he approached
a known witch to ask her to restore it to him. She told the
afflicted man to climb a certain tree, and that he might take which
he liked out of a nest in which there were several members. And
when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: You must not take
that one, adding, because it belonged to a parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   Satan as Unindicted Co-Conspirator
</P>
<P>
   When a woman dips a twig in water and sprinkles the water in the
air to make it rain, although she does not herself cause the rain .
. . yet, because she has entered into a pact with the devil who
causes the rain, she herself nevertheless deservedly bears the
blame, because she is an infidel and does the devil's work,
surrendering herself to his service.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Weather: El Nino or Satan?
</P>
<P>
   In the diocese of Constance ((near)) Salzburg, a violent
hailstorm destroyed all the fruit, crops and vineyards. . . . This
was brought to the notice of the Inquisition ((which determined))
that it was caused by witchcraft. . . . We particularly examined
two women ((who)) were taken and shut up separately in different
prisons. . . . Well-provided with that evil gift of silence which
is the constant bane of judges, although it was in the torture
chamber, ((one of the women)) finally laid bare all the crimes she
had committed.
</P>
<P>
   Witches' Aides and Others
</P>
<P>
   We excommunicate all followers, protectors, defenders and
patrons of ((accused witches)). . . . When any such has been so
sentenced and has scorned to recant his heresy . . . he shall be
considered an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest That Tired Old Woman
</P>
<P>
   When a cow's supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft
((some righteous women)) hang a pail of milk over the fire, and
uttering certain superstitious words, beat the pail with a stick.
And though it is the pail that these women beat, yet the devil
carries all these blows to the back of the witch, and in this way
both the witch and the devil are made weary.
</P>
<P>
   And Your Little Cow, Toto
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a cow has been injured [and the authorities) wish
to discover who has bewitched it, they drive it out into the fields
with a man's trousers, or some other unclean thing, upon its head
or back. . . . They beat the cow with a stick and drive it away.
Then the cow runs straight into the house of the witch.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With the discovery of great energy reserves
in countries around the Caspian Sea, a vast new region has
catapulted onto the world stage. It not only offers oil companies
the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a place to
test their strength.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is waging a strong campaign to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. So are Russia, Iran and other powers in
the region. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of what will be a massive oil boom,''
said Stanley Escudero, the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. ``It
means that Azerbaijan and this whole region are about to emerge as
major players in the world energy game, and also as a vitally
important area for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the United States supports cooperation in the
Caspian, saying it wants every country except Iran to prosper. Some
U.S. diplomats in the region, however, sense that they are involved
in a modern version of the 19th-century Great Game, in which
Britain and Russia competed for dominance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we prove we're still the big boy on the block,''
said one diplomat. ``China, Europe, Iran, Russia and all the others
want to see if they can take us down. All of our so-called friends
and all of our so-called enemies want control of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game is being played out in an intense competition for
oil and gas pipeline routes. The nations that win will be able to
help shape events in the region for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is lobbying intensely for an oil
pipeline route from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the
Mediterranean. This would tie Azerbaijan and Georgia to the West
and be a boon to Turkey, a key NATO ally. U.S. officials are
applying every form of encouragement and pressure they can muster
to persuade oil companies to choose it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are skeptical. They say the U.S.-backed line is
far too expensive to build without a subsidy of $1 billion or more.
By their calculations, a line across Georgia to the Black Sea would
cost less than half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since oil companies will pay for whatever pipeline is built,
they are in the catbird seat, and governments in the Caspian area
are fervently wooing them. ``In a reversal of history,'' said
Chevron Overseas Petroleum president Richard Matzke, ``the industry
today is showing its potential to drive geopolitical events, rather
than be driven by them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, some members of Congress warn that the
United States must be wary of anti-American forces in the Caspian.
They want the Clinton administration to work with the American oil
companies to establish a stronger U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
   These legislators support bills like the Silk Road Strategy Act
proposed by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; it would finance programs
in the region ranging from support for independent newspapers to
``transfer of excess defense articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that the United States should not help Caspian
countries as long as they reject democracy, especially if a hidden
agenda is to smooth the way for big business. Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., has suggested that the Silk Road Act be renamed ``the oil
and gas interests bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders are highly suspicious of U.S. ambitions in the
Caspian, which they view as a naked power grab. Russia has
controlled the region for more than a century and is angry at what
it sees as an aggressive U.S. campaign to wrest it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot help seeing the uproar stirred up in some Western
countries over the energy resources of the Caspian,'' Russian
President Boris Yeltsin told a newspaper interviewer last year.
``Some seek to exclude Russia from the game and undermine its
interests. The so-called `pipeline war' in the region is part of
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Small amounts of Caspian oil are now being shipped through a
Soviet-era pipeline that runs north from Baku, the Azerbaijani
capital, to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea.
Russia proposes that the main export pipeline be built along this
route, rather than across Turkey as the United States wants.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline across Russia would help keep Caspian nations under
Moscow's thumb. But leaders of new nations in the region are
determined to break free of Russian influence. To do that, they
must have an export route that Russia does not control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the head of my family,'' reasoned Ahmed Zeynalov,
an Azerbaijani oil executive. ``Would you put your neighbor in the
position of being able to control your family?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this political problem, there are practical ones.
The Russian route runs through Chechnya, hardly known for its
stability. And even if Caspian oil can be brought across Russia to
the Black Sea, no one is certain how it would be sent on from
there.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, suddenly discovering its environmental conscience, says
it cannot bear more tanker traffic through the already crowded
Bosporus to the Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish officials say,
the only solution is to build a pipeline across their country.
</P>
<P>
   But Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine are offering an alternative:
send the oil across the Black Sea to our ports and from there to
Western Europe. This option gives oil companies another card to
play when they ask Turkey for billion-dollar subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, many American oil executives believe the best
export route for Caspian oil is through Iran. They cannot choose
that route now because sanctions imposed by Congress forbid large
investments in Iran. But they refuse to write off the idea,
preferring to stall in the hope that the sanctions will collapse.

   ``Sanctions are a drag on our business position,'' said Cecil
Davidson, operations manager in Turkmenistan for Halliburton
International Inc., a supplier of oil and gas equipment. ``The
competition gains strength because of it. They can operate in Iran
and we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for American energy companies are pressing for an end
to the sanctions, and some prominent figures in the foreign policy
establishment support them. In a speech this month, former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance urged new overtures to Iran. Graham
Fuller, a Rand Corp. analyst and former CIA official, recently
called for ``a process of reconciliation'' based on ``a remarkable
number of common interests,'' including Caspian energy.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have begun courting Western oil and gas
companies. ``The route through Iran is the most economical, and the
companies know this,'' said Alireza Bikdeli, Iran's ambassador in
Azerbaijan. ``They know this region very well, perhaps better than
the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   Caspian nations do not share the United States' desire to
isolate Iran. They must live as Iran's neighbors, and would rather
cooperate than feud. ``We'll take into consideration that the
United States opposes routes through Iran,'' said Recepbay Arazov,
the oil and gas minister in Turkmenistan, ``but we're not scared
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives looking for a way to bring their crude out of
Azerbaijan have only three or four main alternatives. But huge
amounts of oil and gas will also be coming from two countries on
the eastern shore of the Caspian, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
Competition there involves a much wider group of players.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan has huge reserves of natural gas, but its only
export pipeline runs through Russia. Because Russia is itself a gas
producer, it refuses to accept competing gas at fair prices. After
a bitter argument in 1997, Turkmenistan turned off its spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Now Turkmenistan has gone more than a year without earning a
cent from its gas reserves, and it has nothing else to sell. The
government is living on bank loans, mostly from Germany. So
President Saparmurat Niyazov is negotiating with Royal/Dutch Shell
to build a $4 billion pipeline across Iran to gas-starved Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can't wait,'' said Omer Ertur, the chief United
Nations representative in Turkmenistan. ``He's in a financial
crisis. He's up to his neck in debt and he's paying for a series of
colossal projects. If there's no pipeline, there's going to be
instability here.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the new Caspian nations, Kazakhstan, is also
hoping to escape from Russia's shadow. Kazakh leaders have approved
the construction of an oil pipeline across Russia to the Black Sea,
but they also want a non-Russian option. They are pushing for a
line under the Caspian to Azerbaijan, from which their oil could be
shipped westward to Georgia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course Russia will not agree with this project, and will
try to block it,'' said Ermukahmet Ertsybaev, director of the
Kazakhstan Institute of Strategic Studies. ``It would have a huge
political impact. We have been isolated from the world system, and
this would be our link to Europe. It would make our independence
real, and also the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also pursuing the idea of
building pipelines eastward to China. These lines would be long and
expensive, but Chinese leaders remain intrigued by them. They know
that a pipeline would pull Central Asia into their sphere of
influence, and guarantee energy sources for continued expansion of
their economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the outside powers seeking influence in the Caspian
region are using armies to strengthen their positions. Russia
maintains bases in Georgia and Armenia. The United States has
established a much smaller but nonetheless palpable military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army has held maneuvers in the region, brought local
officers to America for training, and donated patrol boats and
other military equipment to friendly regimes. In May the Army and
units of the National Guard will stage an international disaster
relief exercise, using computers, in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan has
signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States, and
others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Iran view these steps as part of a hostile plan to
establish U.S. hegemony over the Caspian. Some American experts,
however, believe there is enough wealth in the region for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go well, it would be a tremendous boost to all of
the surrounding powers, which are many and formidable,'' said S.
Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the best thing that could happen to Russia,
because it would lay to rest their imperial hangover,'' he said.
``It would give Iran its traditional role as a trading state.
Turkey would find a position for itself among peoples with whom it
has a historical connection. China would have a new strategic
connection to the West. Pakistan and India would have chances to
integrate themselves into an emerging region, rather than consume
themselves with mutual hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't go well, there will be a geopolitical vacuum,
which is everywhere dangerous. They invite intrusions, and this is
a highly nuclear neighborhood.''

   JERUSALEM _ If the rifts in Israeli society could be frozen in
images, the images would be the violent incidents that represent
the fear of what could happen here more routinely if the political
order disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   For immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the image is that
of Jan Shafsovich, a 22-year-old Israeli soldier stabbed to death
in November in a cafe in Ashkelon for speaking Russian.
</P>
<P>
   For secular Jerusalemites, it is Yitzhak Daniel Levi, an
elderly, wheelchair-bound man whose arms were broken by Hasidic
thugs in December for watching television on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, it is Asaf Miara, the
Israeli sergeant dragged from a car in November and pummeled by
Palestinians for driving through Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   These images, so fresh, are stuck in the public mind here just
as the fragmentation of Israeli society finds new echoes in the
Israeli political system in a way that many feel is dangerous for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the four volatile months leading to new elections in May,
the challenge for the system will be to rise above a dysfunctional
body politic; the new Israeli Parliament must be representative
enough to be democratic, and not so representative that it is
dysfunctional itself.
</P>
<P>
   But with the old parties, Labor and Likud, facing identity
crises and new parties forming every day, that is a serious
challenge. The new multi-party system is not only chaotic, making
it difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition.
It is also a political expression of something more deep-seated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has been reduced to a series of enclaves, as if its
very flesh has been hacked apart,'' David Ohana, a historian, wrote
in his recent book ``The Last Israelis.'' ``Each group speaks in
its code, cordons off its own territory, takes its pound of flesh,
and ``apres moi, le deluge.''
</P>
<P>
   Through its 50 years of life, Israel has been a nation very
demanding of its people. In the army, on kibbutzes and at the tax
collector's office, Israelis have had to give their blood, their
sweat and their cash. The nation was built on a politics of
sacrifice that relied on a cohesive vision, a mission: the
restoration and survival of the Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But with the prosperity and maturation of the country, and with
every new wave of immigration, that ideological fervor has
diminished. Many immigrants from North Africa and from the former
Soviet Union came because they were fleeing oppression or poverty,
and religious Jews flocked here to live in the Holy Land. All told,
they were refugees, economic migrants and spiritual migrants, not
missionaries for the Jewish homeland as the Zionist pioneers
envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many second- and third-generation Israelis lost the
sense of embattlement that ruled their parents lives. Zionism,
while still important, became less central; the conflict with the
Palestinians grew wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis began to live as much in their own local, ethnic,
religious and professional communities as in their nation. The
ethnic diversity alone of the population of 6 million is surprising
to outsiders: 20 percent are Sabras, or Israeli-born Jews; 20
percent were born in the former Soviet Union; 20 percent are Arabs;
25 percent are Jews from North Africa and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   With greater diversity, there were greater divisions _
religious-secular, Ashkenazi-Sephardic, new immigrant-old
immigrant, Arab-Jewish, Christian Arab-Muslim Arab _ and the
political system began to express them.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 political parties in the current Knesset, and there
may be 19 in the next one, all skilled at the art of leveraging
their specific interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the politics of allocation, not of sacrifice,''
said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist and fellow of the Israel
Democracy Institute. ``Every group is fighting not for the
collective whole but for its share of the national pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Parliament, because of the deep rifts between factions, a
good deal of the battle ends up being showmanship on behalf of an
idea, a people or a way of life, too. While the number of bills
introduced has increased more than a thousandfold in recent years,
the percentage that make it into law is lower than ever _ 8 percent
or 10 percent, Ezrahi said.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts see this development as dire. They think
Israel can ill afford to indulge in political theater when huge
issues _ a constitution, borders under a peace agreement, the
separation of religion and state _ remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates for prime minister against the
incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, are obsessed with the
fragmentation of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Labor Party leader Ehud Barak is prescriptively
named ``One Israel.'' Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a popular former general
who is trying to capture the center with a new party, paints an
ugly social portrait of a place where ``people are humiliated every
day because of their origin and attacked because of their beliefs
and way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of Shahak's first campaign ventures, into a marketplace
in Tel Aviv that is a right-wing, working-class Sephardic bastion,
he was pelted with chickens and a death threat: ``The next bullet's
for you,'' he was told. Apologies followed, but there was no
mistaking the animosity that courses through the political veins of
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak was mercilessly mocked when, in his debut political
speech, he called for a new, more civil and compassionate level of
social discourse. Journalists and other politicians jeered as if he
was prescribing a national etiquette program, or asking an entire
nation to get its elbows off the table.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that Shahak, with his simple, dire view, was
getting at something deeper than others discuss, even if all of
them talk in similar terms about possible solutions, whether
electoral reform or a unity government.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic see this moment as a crossroads, a stage that may
force structural changes in Israel's young democracy or a major
political reshuffling to accommodate the new diversity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the worrywarts, who are plentiful, fear that internal
conflict  &UR; is &LR;  the new Israel, and that no political Band-Aid can
cure the deeper wounds.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev signed
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, it has been a
cornerstone of arms control. Its fundamental premise, which held
throughout the Cold War, was that limiting missile defenses limited
offensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cornerstone has crumbled a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced last week that the threat of a missile
strike from a rogue state like North Korea, Iraq or Iran justified
building a limited national missile defense system _ something
explicitly prohibited by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting the United States was not abandoning the
treaty's basic aims, the Clinton administration said it wanted to
start negotiations with the Russians to amend the treaty in ways
that would reflect the emergence of troubling new threats in a
troubling new world.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen even suggested the new threats
had become so great that the United States would reserve its right
to withdraw from the treaty unilaterally if the Russians refused to
consider amendments. While the White House later insisted his
remarks were interpreted too harshly, it was clear that the rules
that have governed arms control for a quarter century had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the orthodoxy that has driven our policy in the Cold
War needs to be rethought in a world that is much more complex,
that has many and varied threats and that in many ways is much less
stable than the cold war standoff that created the orthodoxy,''
said James Rubin, the State Department's spokesman, who has an
extensive background in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Iraq or North Korea or the reality of nuclear
explosions in India and Pakistan, we need to hone our
nonproliferation tools to reflect the world we live in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty strictly limited the number,
type and placement of missiles that the United States or the Soviet
Union could deploy to shoot down incoming nuclear missiles. In the
strange logic of nuclear warfare, officials believed that creating
national missile defenses would upset the strategic balance by
encouraging the other side to build more offensive weapons to
overwhelm the defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who announced that the Pentagon now plans to spend $10.5
billion over the next six years developing a missile defense, said
that logic still held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there is no ABM treaty, then certainly
Russia or other countries would feel free to develop as many
offensive weapons as they wanted, which would then set in motion a
comparable dynamic to offset that with more missiles here,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others said they believed the treaty had enough
flexibility to allow for the sort of limited national missile
defense now being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   A limited defense, they said, need not upset the strategic
balance of power with the Russians since the threats it aims to
counter lie elsewhere _ a notion very close to heresy for arms
controllers of the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Ronald Reagan's vision of a ``Star Wars''
program to build a shield to protect the entire country from
thousands of incoming nuclear missiles, the Pentagon's newest plan
calls for a more modest endeavor. The new defense would use
space-based sensors, early-warning radars and missiles based in
North Dakota or Alaska to shoot down no more than a handful of
missiles from rogue states or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being reassured, the Russians reacted sharply to the
administration's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proceed from the assumption that it must not happen,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, joined in criticizing the United States, declaring
that a missile defense ``would only undermine security and
stimulate the proliferation of missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still enormous fiscal and technological obstacles to a
national missile defense. Foremost among them: the Pentagon still
has not proved it can construct a system that will work. And
Clinton has not yet decided to deploy a system.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the thinking about arms control has evolved as the
world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an
independent research center, said the administration was justified
in considering a limited national missile defense, though deeper
cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals were also needed.
``Common sense suggests we need limited defenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, an advocacy group in Washington, said he
had profound doubts about the Pentagon's plans, but believed that
arms control treaties should not be impervious to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in a period where we should be willing to
rethink our treaties,'' he said. ``I don't think there is anything
wrong with the United States saying, if the conditions warrant it,
we should consider changing it. It should be a living document.''

The decision by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, issued moments before
senators resumed a second day of questioning in President Clinton's
impeachment trial, ignited a furious question-and-answer session on

Clinton to invest some portion of Social Security reserves in

investments have not, they say, created the widespread problems
critics predict. By Diana B. Henriques. With graphic.

biology, 10th-grade chemistry and, for the minority who make it

QUIETLY, TEAM OF LAWYERS WHO DISLIKED CLINTON KEPT JONES' CASE
ALIVE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., Md., Texas, Ark., Conn., Va.)  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JILL ABRAMSON 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This time last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton
described, in a now-famous appearance on the NBC News program
``Today,'' how a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' was trying to
destroy her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, some of the most serious damage to Bill
Clinton's presidency came not from his high-profile political
enemies but from a small secret clique of lawyers in their 30s who
share a deep antipathy toward the president, according to nearly
two dozen interviews and recently filed court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers were deeply involved for nearly five years in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. They then helped push the
case into the criminal arena and into the office of the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader was Jerome M. Marcus, a 39-year-old associate
at the Philadelphia law firm of Berger &AMP; Montague, whose partners
are major contributors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Jones never met him or knew he had worked on her
behalf, Marcus was involved in virtually every important decision
and document in her lawsuit, according to billing records and
interviews with other lawyers who worked on the case. As much as
anyone else, he helped keep Ms. Jones' case alive in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus recruited others to assist his efforts, including several
friends from the University of Chicago Law School. One of those
approached, Paul Rosenzweig, briefly considered doing work for Ms.
Jones in 1994, according to billing records and interviews, but
decided not to. In November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office,
where he and Marcus had several telephone conversations about the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosenzweig who fielded a ``heads-up'' phone call from
Marcus on Jan. 8, 1998, that first tipped off Starr's office about
Monica S. Lewinsky and Linda R. Tripp. The tip was not mentioned in
the 445-page Starr report, even though it revived a moribund
Whitewater investigation that otherwise it now seems would not have
produced an impeachment referral to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus did make his views known publicly last month when he
wrote an impassioned commentary in The Washington Times urging the
impeachment of Clinton. ``The cancer is deadly,'' Marcus wrote.
``It, and its cause, must be removed.'' The newspaper identified
himself in the newspaper simply as ``a lawyer in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting Ms. Jones' lawsuit and helping Mrs. Tripp find her
way to Starr, Marcus found other allies, including another Chicago
law classmate, Richard W. Porter. Porter had worked as an aide to
former Vice President Dan Quayle and on the Bush-Quayle campaign,
where he did opposition research; he was a partner of Starr's at
the law firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Conway III, a New York lawyer educated at Yale, shared
Marcus' low view of Clinton. When the Jones case led to Ms.
Lewinsky, Marcus and Conway searched for a new lawyer for Mrs.
Tripp and encouraged her to take her explosive allegations to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are only now coming into focus, as a few of their
associates have begun to discuss their activities and their names
appear repeatedly in the final legal bills submitted by the
original Jones legal team. Marcus, Porter and Conway did not
respond to numerous phone and written requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the Senate this week, the president's
lawyers said that there was collusion between Starr's office, Mrs.
Tripp and the lawyers for Ms. Jones in the weeks leading up to the
president's deposition last January. If witnesses are called in the
Senate impeachment trial, the president's lawyers may explore the
issue further, several Clinton legal advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, denied there was
collusion between the independent counsel's office and the Jones
team, including Marcus. ``There was absolutely no conspiracy
between the Jones lawyers and our office,'' Bakaly said. ``Judge
Starr has testified to the circumstances as to how this matter came
to our attention, and the actions that we took thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his grand jury testimony in August that his
political enemies ``just thought they would take a wrecking ball to
me and see if they could do some damage.'' That wrecking ball was
wielded by Marcus and his colleagues, who managed to drive Paula
Jones' allegation of sexual misconduct into the courtroom and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, Porter and Rosenzweig were classmates at the University
of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1986. Conway met the others
through the Jones case. Some of the lawyers were also involved with
the Federalist Society, a legal group that includes conservative
and libertarian luminaries like Starr, Robert H. Bork and Richard
Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, the most overtly political member of the group, was also
an associate of Peter W. Smith, 62, a Chicago financier who was
once the chairman of College Young Republicans and a major donor to
Gopac, a conservative political group affiliated with former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Beginning in 1992, Smith spent more than
$80,000 to finance anti-Clinton research in an effort to persuade
the mainstream press to cover Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, according to the journalist David Brock, Smith helped
introduce him to the Arkansas state troopers who accused Clinton of
using them to procure women when he was governor of Arkansas. Brock
wrote an article based on the troopers' account of Clinton's sexual
escapades that was published in the January 1994 issue of The
American Spectator, a conservative magazine. According to Brock,
Smith wanted to establish a fund for the troopers, in case they
suffered retribution. Brock said he opposed payments because they
would undermine the troopers' credibility.
</P>
<P>
   To allay his concerns, Brock said, Smith urged him to speak to
Porter, who was then working at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, the Chicago law
firm that employed Starr in its Washington office. Brock said he
had hoped his talk with Porter would put an end to any planned
payments to the troopers, but Smith did pay them and their lawyers
$22,600. In 1992, Smith also paid Brock $5,000 to research another
bit of Arkansas sex lore regarding Clinton, a rumor that has since
proved to be baseless. Brock did not pursue an article.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's trooper article in The American Spectator mentioned a
woman identified only as ``Paula,'' and in May 1994, Ms. Jones
filed her lawsuit against Clinton. Ms. Jones' lawyers of record
were from the Washington area, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph
Cammarata, whom Marcus had helped recruit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Davis and Cammarata billing records show that from their
earliest involvement in the case, they were consulting with Marcus
and Porter. Conway also helped draft briefs, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were heavily involved,'' Cammarata said, ``but they
insisted that they not be identified, but that was fine with me. We
were just two guys involved in the middle of a world war, and we
had no guns. We needed all the help we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more important to the Jones case than Marcus. Besides
helping to write several important briefs, Marcus spoke numerous
times at the most critical moments in the case with Cammarata and
Davis, offering legal advice that Cammarata said was ``vital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the billing records, Porter also offered ``legal
strategy'' and once wrote a memo on ``investigative leads'' that
might embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter was a cheerleader,'' Cammarata said. ``He used to call
up and say, `Maybe we can find you some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's legal advisers said he noticed a marked
difference in quality between the routine legal pleadings filed by
the Cammarata and Davis team, and the highly polished, scholarly
briefs written by the shadow legal team headed by Marcus and
Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, meanwhile, was so successful at keeping the extent of
his role a secret that even Cammarata only found out recently that
Marcus helped recruit him, through a mutual acquaintance, to work
on the case. Marcus, Cammarata said, ``just told me recently that
he had a lot of trouble finding anyone to represent Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Marcus also briefly considered assisting the
Jones lawyers. In June 1994, Rosenzweig, a lawyer at a small law
firm in Washington, with experience working in the Justice
Department, ``expressed interest'' in doing legal work, but he did
none, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway wanted his role kept hidden as well, because his New York
law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, included influential
Democrats like Bernard W. Nussbaum, a former White House counsel.
Conway's name does not appear on any billing records.
</P>
<P>
   Although the billing records show communication between Porter
and the Jones lawyers from 1994 to 1997, he denied in a written
statement last fall doing legal work for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Because Porter is a partner at the firm where Starr worked until
he took a leave of absence last August, any role played by Porter
in the Jones case could have posed a conflict of interest for Starr
once he became independent counsel. Starr has said he did not
discuss the Jones case with Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has acknowledged contacts with Davis, specifically six
telephone discussions the two had in 1994, before Starr became
independent counsel. In fact, Starr has been criticized the phone
conversations to Attorney General Janet Reno, when he was seeking
to expand his investigation to the Lewinsky matter. Starr has said
it did not occur to him to mention the conversations because he did
not do work on the Jones case and simply offered his publicly
stated position on a point of constitutional law that presidents
are not immune from civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jones lawyers argued before the Supreme Court in May
1996, paving the way to the fateful 9-0 decision that the president
was not immune from civil lawsuits, Conway went to Washington for a
practice argument. He joined Davis, Cammarata, Bork and Theodore
Olson, a Washington lawyer and friend of Starr, at the Army-Navy
Club here.
</P>
<P>
   When Cammarata and Davis quit as Ms. Jones' lawyers after she
failed to reach a settlement with Clinton's lawyers in 1997, Marcus
and his colleagues established ties to her new lawyers at the
Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke and the
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., which helped pay her
legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rosenzweig went to work as a prosecutor in
Starr's office. From November to January, Rosenzweig spoke several
times by telephone with Marcus and discussed the Jones case, a
lawyer with knowledge of the conversations said. But Bakaly,
Starr's spokesman, said that Rosenzweig did not tell any of his
colleagues about what he learned about developments in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Mrs. Tripp was cooperating with the Jones lawyers.
She was also taping her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, which her
friend, Lucianne Goldberg, a Manhattan literary agent, had
incorrectly assured her was legal. In December, Mrs. Tripp became
frantic that she might be prosecuted because such taping is illegal
in Maryland, where Mrs. Tripp lives. Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg
thought of a possible solution: perhaps she could receive immunity
from prosecution from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg called Smith, the Chicago financier, and Porter for
advice on how Mrs. Tripp might approach Starr. In a teleconference
during the first week of January 1998, Ms. Goldberg talked to
Porter and Marcus. Meanwhile, Marcus sought new lawyers for Mrs.
Tripp. Conway suggested an old friend, James Moody, a Washington
lawyer and fellow Federalist Society member, whom Mrs. Tripp
retained.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was Starr's former law partner, Porter did not want
to be the first one to call the independent counsel's office on
behalf of Mrs. Tripp. So it Marcus made the call to Rosenzweig.

   For years, self-help books have been preaching these basic rules
for job interviews. Getting in the door is a good start, of course.
It's your chance to separate yourself from that stack of
applications, to impress the prospective boss with all your
personal charm. The goal isn't just getting in the door, though.
It's leaving with a job.
</P>
<P>
   But some sad sacks never get the word. A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants
about a year ago. The results are a primer on what not to do on a
job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Commemorative Brands, a
manufacturer of high-school and college class rings, by the New
York research firm Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas. Here is a
sampling of comments from the interviewers:
</P>

</P>

   _ ``During the entire interview, the applicant wore a baseball
cap. . . . A few days later, another college graduate showed up for
a management trainee position wearing overalls and sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I asked the candidate to give a good example of the
organizational skills she was boasting about, she said she was
proud of her ability to pack her suitcase `real neat' for her
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wanted to know if employee perks included a swimming pool,
paid lunches at the company cafeteria or a free computer to use at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did he go to college? His ill-conceived answer: `To
party and socialize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He couldn't answer any of my questions because he had just
had major dental work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I gave him my business card at the beginning of the
interview, he immediately crumpled it and tossed it in the
wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I received a resume and a note that said the recent high
school graduate wanted to earn $25 an hour _ `and not a nickel
less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He had arranged for a pizza to be delivered to my office
during a lunch-hour interview. I asked him not to eat it until
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Said she had just graduated cum laude, but had no idea what
cum laude meant. However, she was proud of her grade point average.
It was 2.1.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Insisted on telling me that he wasn't afraid of hard work.
But insisted on adding that he was afraid of horses and didn't like
jazz, modern art or seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The candidate never looked directly at me once during the
entire interview. Just stared at the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An otherwise qualified candidate took herself out of the
running when she opened her mouth. She had her tongue pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She actually showed up for an interview during the summer
wearing a bathing suit. Said she didn't think I'd mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He sat down opposite me, made himself comfortable and
proceeded to put his foot up on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The interview had gone well, until he told me that he and
his friends wore my company's clothing whenever they could. At
which point, I had to tell him that we manufactured office
products, not sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Applied for a customer service position although, as he
confided, he really wasn't a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I mentioned that we had gone to the same college, he
stood up and began to belt out the school football fight song.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Without asking if I minded, he casually lit a cigar and then
tossed the match onto my carpet _ and couldn't understand why I was
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``On the phone I had asked the candidate to bring his resume
and a couple of references. He arrived with the resume _ and two
people.''

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ There are no wedding pictures here. No
babies. No birthdays. No graduations. No romantic moments.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary life ceased by fiat, by terror, during the four years
the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia, causing the deaths of more than a
million people and dressing those who lived in black.
</P>
<P>
   Its absence echoes in the photographic record of the Khmer
Rouge: Apart from certain bureaucratic records and formal
occasions, almost no one was taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   When the radical communist movement _ purer than Stalin, more
ascetic than Mao _ seized the country in 1975, it eliminated
culture and modern life: no cities, no money, no education, no art.
Even family life was abolished in favor of communal, often fatally
exhausting, labor.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras were among the artifacts of technology and development
that disappeared. Ownership could be a death sentence as evidence
of an educated past. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers recorded officially approved subjects for those four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The leading photographer of the Khmer Rouge time appears to have
been a young man named Nhem Ein, who was sent to China to learn the
craft and was then assigned to the staff of Tuol Sleng prison,
where some 14,000 people were tortured and sent to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a stunning body of work: 7,000 or more portraits
intended as a bureaucratic record of prisoners entering Tuol Sleng.
All the subjects died; only the portraits survived.
</P>
<P>
   In his free time he also turned his camera in other directions:
a dinner party at the home of the prison's warden, a pile of bodies
on the floor, a holiday snapshot in front of a local monument, a
work brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pictures come from two troves, both of which may be
the product of Nhem Ein's work. One is Tuol Sleng itself, where in
the years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge two decades ago
researchers discovered thousands of negatives and contact prints
stuffed into rusting drawers. The other, now owned by an
independent newspaper, the Phnom Penh Post, appears to have been a
government archive. It shows _ very much in the style of communist
nations of the time _ the formal gatherings, the airport greetings
and the posed brigades of workers or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from daily life, another subject is notably missing from
the Khmer Rouge photography: portraits of the all-powerful leader,
Pol Pot. Unlike Stalin and Mao, he shunned the spotlight, hiding
his identity, changing residences and avoiding photographers.
</P>
<P>
   No weddings, no babies, no birthdays, not even leaders. The only
thorough photographic record kept in the Khmer Rouge years _ and
now its emblematic image _ was Nhem Ein's archive of portraits of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of death and a time of secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets were the main thing,'' said Pol Pot's biographer,
David P. Chandler. ``That was something he enjoyed.''

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD TO UNDERGO JOINT THERAPY IN HOW TO GET ALONG
</HEADLINE>
 (Daily News   Staff Writer Rick Orlov contributed to this story.)

BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tired of the squabbling that can, at times, make
them sound like an unhappy family, Los Angeles Board of Education
members are about to undergo group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in March, the men and women who comprise the
seven-member panel will receive training on how to cooperate better
during their sometimes testy marathon meetings. They will also
learn how to set long-term goals for the district and work more
effectively with the district's superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the constant criticism of how dysfunctional we
look,'' said board President Victoria Castro. ``Everyone's finally
agreed we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the $30,000 program will start just before
elections could replace four members of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Such personal invective and bickering on the board, several
observers said, fuels the impression that members lack the
direction and unity needed to lead. Indeed, the Los Angeles Unified
School District is struggling with low test scores, and from
efforts from the outside and within to mount massive campaigns of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not helping the kids or the schools,'' said David Marsh,
professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of
Southern California. ``Many schools in the district feel the
central office is just floating from one priority to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who is fielding his own candidates for
school board, declined to comment on the panel's self-recognized
need for counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is supporting different candidates because the
school system is broken and may be dysfunctional, but it has
nothing to do with the members,'' said Riordan's Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said he hopes that the workshops
teach board members to work together on the district's overall
goals while leaving implementation to him and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in training that teaches them how to be
nicer to each other,'' he said. ``I'm interested in training that
will clearly define their roles, responsibilities and limits as
policy makers, not implementers.''
</P>
<P>
   The monthly training sessions, stretched over a year, come as
political maneuvering in advance of April's board elections have
strained relations on the panel. Some board members are supporting
their colleagues' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions over whether to reopen contract talks with the
district's employees has also caused friction, several board
members said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The tensions burst into the open during a meeting earlier this
month when member David Tokofsky called a staff report corrupt,
prompting colleague Jeff Horton to respond with a scatological
insult. The comment so startled Castro that she began searching her
desk for her gavel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a disagreement that got heated and passed,''
Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why this happens,'' said Valerie Fields, who has
long pushed to have the board receive training. ``It's not just
those two. Other board members get into it. And it's just not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   So for four to six hours each month, board members and Zacarias
will meet with experts from the California School Board Association
to learn how to put aside differences and craft common goals.
</P>
<P>
   Kate McConkey-Coussens, who will help lead the workshops, said
the idea is to make school board members realize they are
``trustees,'' people entrusted with the future of the district and
the children it teaches. The term, she said, implies a level of
professionalism in being able to accept dissenting points of view
without letting the debate turn personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trustees know how to manage conflict, rather than let it
escalate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey-Coussens said she was encouraged that all board members
agreed to contact the association for help. Some of the literally
hundreds of boards the association trains in a given year are split
over the idea, making her job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This governing team, just by voting to do this, has
demonstrated they want to manage and reduce conflict, and we have
ways to help them do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The workshops, which will be open to the public to comply with
state law, may include role-playing, as well as efforts to craft a
mission statement for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time, I've been aware that the board and the
superintendent had not defined a unified set of goals,'' Horton
said. ``Everyone wants student achievement to go up, but we need a
road map for how to get there.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The problems experienced on the board are hardly unique to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said similar tensions can be found on school boards
throughout California. Some of their most important duties _
determining the size of their budget and setting educational policy
_ have been at least partially usurped by the state. Board members
must now argue over such things as teacher raises without having
the control over finances that they once had, he said.

LOS ANGELES:   a great couple.'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Older people _ women especially _ often have a hard time finding
an opposite-sex companion.
</P>
<P>
   At age 65, there are about 150 women for every 100 men,
according to Butler of the International Longevity Center. And
because women live longer, and men seek younger women, ``it's a
double-whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have to be aggressive when they want to find
someone,'' he said, and mentioned ``the casserole brigade'' _ the
onslaught of women who bring food to comfort and socialize with
recently widowed older men they know.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Loren G. Lispon, chief of the University of Southern
California's division of geriatric medicine, said he's ``seen
situations in retirement housing where some of the older men are
hounded to death, almost, by women.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main obstacles to relationships among seniors is the
memory of a dead spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard psychologically _ are you being disloyal to your
mate? You have to overcome that,'' Lispon said. And sometimes the
guilt or suspicion about a relationship comes from children who ask
``Is she after his money, is he after her money, what is this all
about? _ When it's probably much more innocent, about companionship
and affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothman and Alexander were not looking for a companion when they
came to the Jewish Home's Eisenberg Village campus.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman had cared for his wife, Sally, for years after
Alzheimer's disease made him a stranger to her. When she died March
16, 1997, he moved from their house in Sherman Oaks to the seniors
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent me here. Otherwise I'd have been all alone in the
world, in a seven-room house with a bunch of fruit trees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrived, ``I was very lonely, depressed. I never met
anybody here that interested me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to my room and sit in my rocker all day long,''
gazing at a picture of Sally he kept above the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to look at it and I'd start crying,'' he said. ``I
stayed in my room crying practically every day. I couldn't eat, I
lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   After three months of that, he spotted Florence Alexander in the
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he remembers the date: June 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Already widowed once at age 37, Alexander lost her second
husband, Norman, about 10 years ago. It was her first day at
Eisenberg Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat down,'' she said. ``Our eyes met and he moved over,
and we've been friends and lovers ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first met, it was just a friendly situation,'' Rothman
said. ``Then we got closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   And when did they fall in love?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize it,'' Rothman said. ``It just grows and
grows. It's just something that happens over time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very fortunate to have found each other,'' she
said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Once seniors do hook up, they face other challenges to
courtship and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis and other infirmities common to old age can can cause
difficulties, not to mention erectile impotency or lubrication
problems. But the Aging Council survey showed that 63 percent of
sexually active seniors were able to perform consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when they do occur, such obstacles to intercourse don't
necessarily deter intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Birren, director of the Anna and Harry Borun Center for
Gerontological Studies at the University of California, Los
Angeles, said some married couples get closer as they age, even if
they're less sexually active. They may spend more time together,
talk more and engage in other activities more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are much closer as a couple, but the physical aspect of
sex has dropped off,'' he said. ``Some of these people are more
content with their later life, but it no longer has to involve sex.
Young people may have physical sex, but it may not be intimate
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In your youth, it's sex that draws you,'' Rothman said. ``At
this stage of the game, it's a different kind of love entirely.
It's not just looking for sex. You look more for companionship. It
brings you closer together and you become like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lispon, of USC, said an older person starting a relationship
after 10 years alone ``acts no differently than a teenybopper in
her first relationship. Our bodies may be decaying, but our spirit
remains the same.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about what attracted them to each other, Rothman and
Alexander mention reasons ranging from their loneliness after
losing their spouses to the undefinable ``chemical attraction''
they said they felt when they first laid eyes on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's nice looking. He dresses beautifully. He's very
affectionate. I love when he hugs me and when he kisses me,''
Alexander said. ``I'm 86 years old, and I love being cuddled and
held and kissed. Who doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is so ... Sam,'' she said, turning to stroke his hand and
gaze at him like a schoolgirl. ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks! That goes double for me.'' &QL;

COUPLE SHOWS THERE'S NO AGE LIMIT ON ROMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whenever they're together, their hands
instinctively, unconsciously reach for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Their eyes flash when they talk about the spark at their first
meeting, 19 months ago. And they've been inseparable ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what this giddy couple will be like in another year or
so _ say, when he's 90 and she's 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sleep together. I love the idea of him holding me in his
arms, and loving me,'' Florence Alexander said of her gentleman
friend, Sam Rothman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed each other,'' he added. ``I thank God for sending me
a companion.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met after they lost their spouses and each moved into
the Jewish Home for the Aging in the L.A. suburb of Reseda. The
center is the largest residential care facility for the elderly in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman and Alexander are proof that puppy love isn't just for
pups, contrary to the assumptions of people half their age. Or a
quarter their age. And older Americans are showing that passionate
glances aren't dimmed by fading eyesight, and minor aches and pains
are no obstacle to romantic embraces.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the National Council on the Aging revealed
that nearly half of all Americans 60 or older have sex at least
once a month, and the figure is 80percent among those with partners
_ whether married or involved in another relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as though we don't think our parents ever had sex,''
said Dr. Robert Butler of the International Longevity Center in New
York. ``In the minds of so many people, old age and sickness go
together, which is unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, published in September, showed that 30percent of
seniors with partners said sex is as physically satisfying as it
was in their 40s, while 31percent said it's even more satisfying
now.
</P>
<P>
   And 39percent of all seniors said they want sex more often than
they're getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how old you are, or where you are in your life, you
need companionship,'' said Valica Boudry, a spokeswoman at the home
for seniors. ``The sort of stance we take on it is if people have
interest in it, as long as they're cognitively alert and aren't
being taken advantage of, it isn't any of our business. They're
adults. They're adults and this is their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they maintain their own rooms and respect each other's
space, Rothman and Alexander share every meal, spend evenings
watching movies and often take trips together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to Las Vegas, I tell them I need a room for me and
my girlfriend,'' Rothman said. So they get a standard room, with
two double beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use (both) beds,'' Alexander cut in.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple also stressed they have no interest in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would marriage do for us that we don't have now,'' except
cut into Social Security benefits? Rothman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed emotionally,'' Alexander said. ``Can a piece
of paper make it any different how you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, at this stage of the game ... Wait, can you get
pregnant?'' Rothman asked, shooting a glance at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman, a former newspaper typesetter, now must wear a hearing
aid after 60 years of working around deafening printing presses
from Miami to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors must shout to make themselves understood. But when
Alexander speaks to him in a normal tone, every word gets through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he sees me somewhere, he always comes over _ no matter
who is around _ and kisses me right on the mouth. I love it,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful I have a fine woman like that,'' Rothman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, baby,'' she said, gazing at her octogenarian beau,
impeccably dressed in his French blue shirt, pale gray suit, and
complementary tie and suspenders. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Born in Warsaw, Poland, Rothman came to the United States at
age 13 and moved to Detroit. The only family he has left are
Alexander's children and in-laws, who have adopted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so lucky to have found a companion, a lover, a family,''
said Rothman, who gives a prayer of thanks for Alexander every
night before bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disease in this world is loneliness,'' he said.
``If you're lucky enough to meet someone _ to talk to, to watch
television with _ God bless you.''
</P>
<P>

   Raul Salinas Found Guilty Of Assassination  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a verdict that signaled the end of impunity for the mighty in
Mexico, a federal judge convicted Raul Salinas de Gortari, the
brother of former President Carlos Salinas, of masterminding the
1994 political assassination of a prominent politician. The judge,
Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, also sentenced Salinas to 50 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks all the precedents,'' said Sergio Aguayo Quezada,
a historian. Raul Salinas is a symbol, the brother of one of the
strongest presidents Mexico has ever had. The judge's decision
gives an enormous boost to the independence of the justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge's decision left the public uneasy, because it
was based largely on circumstantial evidence in a case tainted by
torture and evidence-tampering by prosecutors. The defense will
appeal.

   The disappearance of Ms. Fahey, whose body was never recovered,

   Differences in Cancer Rates

   The National Institutes of Health should study various ethnic

   &UR; Scheduled for the dress page &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORLD-ORDER-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The new world order
that was confidently predicted when communism collapsed a decade
ago is nowhere to be seen. Around the world, crises pile up, and
the resulting headlines are not pretty. International organizations
from the United Nations to NATO seem powerless. Streams of
important people go humbly to the feet of Saddam, Gadhafi,
Milosevic and Hun Sen to beg for a modicum of good behavior. What
happened? By Barbara Crossette. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-BLACKLIST-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Elia Kazan, one of
America's greatest film and theatrical directors, is scheduled to
receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st annual Academy Awards in
March. It will not only serve as the most prestigious honor of
Kazan's career but, in many ways, spell the end of the tormented
legacy of the 1950s Hollywood blacklist. By Bernard Weinraub. (`a'

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It seems likely that
witnesses will be called at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
In interviews with The New York Times, four lawyers who have
followed the proceedings assess the advantages and dangers for both
sides. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   WITCH-HUNT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With all the current hyperbole _
``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White House
counsel Charles Ruff to describe the impeachment charges against
President Clinton _ it might be useful to reflect on the days back
in the 13th through 16th centuries when a witch hunt was really a
hunt for witches.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORTS-XRAYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed like a good idea:
Customs Service officials at airports in New York and Miami began
offering suspect travelers the choice between the traditional but
humiliating strip search or a modern, hi-tech X-ray search. To
officials' surprise, many are opting for the good old strip search.
By Alan Finder.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-INTERVIEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants.
The results are a primer on what not to do on a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `i' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ With Labor and Likud facing
deep identity crises and new parties constantly forming, Israel is
producing a new multi-party system that is chaotic and will make it
difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition. But
the trend is a political expression of something more deepseated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-COMPETITION-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The discovery of great
energy reserves around the Caspian Sea not only offers oil
companies the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a
place to test their strength. The U.S., Russia, Iran and other
countries are waging strong campaigns to win decisive influence in
the Caspian. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics. By Steven Kinzer. WITH
PHOTO AND MAP.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Ever since Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev signed it in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty has been one of the cornerstones of arms control. Its
fundamental premise, which held throughout the Cold War, was that
limiting missile defenses limited offensive missiles. Now, the
cornerstone has crumbled a bit. A look at the new theory of missile
defense. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PHOTOS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ When the Khmer Rouge
seized power in 1975, cameras were among the artifacts of
technology that were banned. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers were allowed to operate. One of them, Nhem Ein, left
behind a stunning body of work: some 7,000 portraits of horror. By
Seth Mydans.

for Sunday, Jan. 24 have moved.

   &UR; Scheduled for the dress page &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORLD-ORDER-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The new world order
that was confidently predicted when communism collapsed a decade
ago is nowhere to be seen. Around the world, crises pile up, and
the resulting headlines are not pretty. International organizations
from the United Nations to NATO seem powerless. Streams of
important people go humbly to the feet of Saddam, Gadhafi,
Milosevic and Hun Sen to beg for a modicum of good behavior. What
happened? By Barbara Crossette. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-BLACKLIST-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Elia Kazan, one of
America's greatest film and theatrical directors, is scheduled to
receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st annual Academy Awards in
March. It will not only serve as the most prestigious honor of
Kazan's career but, in many ways, spell the end of the tormented
legacy of the 1950s Hollywood blacklist. By Bernard Weinraub. (`a'

<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It seems likely that
witnesses will be called at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
In interviews with The New York Times, four lawyers who have
followed the proceedings assess the advantages and dangers for both
sides. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   WITCH-HUNT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With all the current hyperbole _
``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White House
counsel Charles Ruff to describe the impeachment charges against
President Clinton _ it might be useful to reflect on the days back
in the 13th through 16th centuries when a witch hunt was really a
hunt for witches.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORTS-XRAYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed like a good idea:
Customs Service officials at airports in New York and Miami began
offering suspect travelers the choice between the traditional but
humiliating strip search or a modern, hi-tech X-ray search. To
officials' surprise, many are opting for the good old strip search.
By Alan Finder.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-INTERVIEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants.
The results are a primer on what not to do on a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `i' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ With Labor and Likud facing
deep identity crises and new parties constantly forming, Israel is
producing a new multi-party system that is chaotic and will make it
difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition. But
the trend is a political expression of something more deepseated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-COMPETITION-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The discovery of great
energy reserves around the Caspian Sea not only offers oil
companies the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a
place to test their strength. The U.S., Russia, Iran and other
countries are waging strong campaigns to win decisive influence in
the Caspian. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics. By Steven Kinzer. WITH
PHOTO AND MAP.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Ever since Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev signed it in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty has been one of the cornerstones of arms control. Its
fundamental premise, which held throughout the Cold War, was that
limiting missile defenses limited offensive missiles. Now, the
cornerstone has crumbled a bit. A look at the new theory of missile
defense. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PHOTOS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ When the Khmer Rouge
seized power in 1975, cameras were among the artifacts of
technology that were banned. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers were allowed to operate. One of them, Nhem Ein, left
behind a stunning body of work: some 7,000 portraits of horror. By
Seth Mydans.

<P>
   LUTOU, China _ Wang Xuexia remembers vividly the cool May night
when the minibus raced past fields of rice and corn and dropped her
high school classmate at the emergency room, disheveled and
semiconscious, exuding the sickly sweet odor of pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   Though fresh out of nursing school, Ms. Wang knew the drill:
pump the stomach, then give oxygen, a shot of Atropine and,
intravenously, an antidote to the lethal poison. Such patients were
so common at the hospital in Lutou that the diagnosis was never in
question: another desperate rural woman attempting suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just three nights later, Ms. Wang was at it again, this
time working to save an elementary school friend. But in this case,
by the time the tractor pulled up to the four-story white concrete
hospital, the woman's heart had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept working on her since I wished she could chat with me
again while she pulled up weeds,'' said Ms. Wang, 25, an earnest
woman with huge eyes and a long braid trailing down her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `My sister, why didn't you treasure your life?'''
said Ms. Wang, who now works for the local government, where she
helped begin a campaign against suicide. `` `Your death has left
behind a kid without a mother and a husband without a wife who will
bear untold sufferings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Female suicide is the puzzling plague of rural China, making the
country's rate the highest in the world; the overall suicide rate
is also one of the highest. Some 56 percent of the world's female
suicides _ about 500 a day _ occur in China, according to a study
based on Chinese vital statistics by the World Bank, Harvard
University and the World Health Organization. Most victims are
young rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have said that the Western estimates, derived
from crude suicide statistics that China first released in the
early 1990s, are probably too high. But in the last few years, a
small group of government officials, researchers, health workers
and women's advocates in China have gingerly started to research
and confront what is still so often regarded as a sensitive and
embarrassing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Their research has led to various theories about the cause of
the suicides: the low status of women in China; the rapid shift to
a market economy; the easy rural availability of pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still few answers for an outbreak defying the
traditional wisdom that suicide is largely a problem of urban men.
In China there are three times as many suicides in the countryside
as in the cities. It is the only country where more women than men
die as a result of suicide each year _ twice as many in the age
group under 45.
</P>
<P>
   In Lutou, a dusty town of 36,000 in a remote, rural corner of
Hubei Province, Ms. Wang's own study revealed that the emergency
room treated 48 attempted suicides from January 1996 to June 1997;
43 were women 20 to 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such statistics, a few smaller magazines and
newspapers directed toward women have decided to broach the subject
in the last two years, and a book on women's suicide is scheduled
to come out soon. The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine is
sponsoring research projects on suicide, and the Chinese
Association of Mental Health established a ``risk prevention''
committee in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few places like Lutou, local officials have been
moved to action by watching neighbors and relatives die. Simple
steps have reduced suicide rates _ restricting use of the most
lethal pesticides, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to know why they gave up their lives so easily and
wanted to help rural women see that this was not a good solution,''
said Xie Lihua, explaining why the self-help magazine she had
founded for country women, Rural Women Knowing All, took the bold
first step of publicizing the problem three years ago. In June
1996, the magazine offered readers the equivalent of $12 for
stories of women who had killed themselves. It received hundreds of
responses and for the next two years ran monthly profiles of
suicides, accompanied by a psychiatrist's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``From their letters we realized that rural women have no sense
of their own self-worth,'' said Ms. Xie, who is also a senior
editor at China Women's News and a fiery advocate for women in the
countryside. ``Rural women like listening to stories, so we thought
we would use stories to persuade them that suicide is not an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is an uphill fight in a country where one suicide
conference was canceled last year and mainstream newspapers have
not even mentioned the topic. ``I would not write about it,'' said
one woman who is a reporter for a national news organization. ``It
would make China look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese say that when they tally all deaths listed as
suicides, the rate comes out to 18 per 100,000 deaths annually. But
many scientists say that number is certainly an underestimate, in
part because it does not include many suicides recorded as
``violent death,'' or ``accidental death, cause unknown.'' Taking
such factors into account, the World Bank's collaborative project
put the rate at 30.3 per 100,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Bank researchers compared rates in different
countries, using the same methods in each, they found that the
overall suicide rate in China was about three times the average for
the rest of the world and that the rate among women was five times
that for other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these incredibly high rates and the pattern we see
is so very different from the rest of the world,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kleinman, a professor of medical anthropology at Harvard University
who has studied suicide in many Asian countries. He added, ``The
Chinese deserve credit for beginning to address this issue, that
hasn't been dealt with to now.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest suicide study in progress is being led by Dr.
Michael Phillips, a Canadian psychiatrist who has lived and worked
in China for many years, and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine. They are investigating hundreds of suicides
from 26 sites around the country, speaking to friends and relatives
of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Their surprising early results confirm the impressions of rural
Chinese doctors: that a large number of suicides in the countryside
are impulsive acts by people who show no signs of mental illness,
depression or alcohol use _ factors commonly associated with
suicide in the West.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many of the suicides are chaotic minidramas _
precipitated by a minor family quarrel, an illness or bad news _ in
which a woman rushes home and downs a bottle of organophosphate
pesticide. Swallowing these lethal chemicals is by far the
preferred method. Although painlessly ingested, they quickly
produce a wide range of devastating symptoms including chest pains,
wheezing, cramps and, later, seizures and coma. Attempts almost all
occur during summer, when farm work is exhausting and tensions run
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an argument,'' Ms. Wang, the nurse, said. ``The wife
runs in and locks the door. The husband knocks down the door and
finds the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Wang's high school classmate drank the poison
after arguing publicly with her husband about which to do to first,
transplant seedlings or plant cotton. Among the suicides recounted
in the self-help magazine, one woman killed herself after her
husband slapped her, another after a neighbor failed to cut down a
tree overhanging her yard, another after learning that her husband
had a mistress, another after her husband refused to return to the
village from his city job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skeptical about this,'' said Phillips, ``but now
I think that a significant proportion of the attempts are
impulsive, where the intent is not to kill oneself or there is no
clear motive at all _ it's more of an expression of frustration
rather than a desire to die.'' The doctor heads the Research Center
of Clinical Epidemiology at Huilongguan Hospital in Beijing and
teaches at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and other researchers say that because drinking
pesticide is such an effective suicide method, it increases the
number of deaths resulting from impulsive acts by women who do not
really want to die. In Western countries, though women far
outnumber men in suicide attempts, they rarely succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chinese statistics only tally deaths, they have little
idea of how many suicide attempts are unsuccessful. In Lutou there
were 8 deaths among the 48 patients who attempted suicide in 1996
and the first half of 1997, although the death rate is almost
certainly higher in more remote towns with less sophisticated
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xie attributes the problem in part to rural Chinese culture,
whose customs and language reinforce women's feelings of
worthlessness and helplessness, she said. In the countryside, the
traditional saying ``nan zhong nu qing'' (``man heavy, woman
light'') still holds sway. Men control family assets, and women do
not even eat dinner with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many rural areas they still think women are useless,'' Ms.
Xie said. ``They do field work, give birth, take care of the
husband, the children, the in-laws. So to them if there is a family
problem they think the sky has collapsed.'' Ms. Xie said her
grandmother had committed suicide after being abandoned by her
husband for failing to give birth to a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese scientists attribute the suicide rate to the
economic and social changes over the last 20 years, as large
numbers of rural men moved to the cities seeking work, further
burdening their wives. With the gap widening between rich and poor,
some believe that rural women are increasingly aware of the
comforts they will never have.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the economic reforms have improved life in
many villages _ crammed them full of televisions and washing
machines. In Lutou, a relatively well-off township with a
per-capita income of about $350 a year, officials say that
increased incomes have helped to defuse their suicide problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a combination of factors working together rather
than any single factor,'' Phillips said. ``I think it's not
considered disgraceful; there are no strong religious prohibitions,
and historically some types of suicide were considered honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   In those cases where women truly intend to die, he added, ``it
may be seen as a final avenue of escape for people who have few
outs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese cities, social workers and doctors are devising
suicide prevention efforts _ hot lines and family counseling
services. But there are no hot lines in rural Lutou, said Mrs. Wang
with a laugh, noting than many people in the surrounding villages
do not even have phones.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the summer of 1997, the local Woman's Federation and
Communist Party cadres tried a more pragmatic solution, beginning
with a notice broadcast on local television that urged farmers to
guard against pesticide poisoning and suicide, attaching greater
stigma to the practice. The newspaper in the nearby city of Zaoyang
carried a similar reminder. In villages without phones or
televisions, the message was played over the loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the local government banned the most poisonous
pesticides, and people were taught how to treat suspected victims.
Villages now have ombudsmen trained in conflict resolution as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the campaign started, there have only been eight suicide
attempts at the Lutou Township Hospital, and they were divided
equally between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publicity has made the farmers aware that committing
suicide is a bad thing,'' Ms. Wang said, ``that if it works or if
it doesn't work it still doesn't help the situation.'' She added,
``And if there are conflicts between neighbors or between husband
and wife, the new women know they can consult the legal system
instead.''  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposal by President Clinton to invest some portion of Social
Security reserves in stocks ignited a brushfire of criticism last
week, although the attacks may have focused on easily solved
problems and ignored some thornier issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he strongly
doubted that the plan could be insulated from political
interference. Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, argued that the concept would give the
government undue influence over corporate affairs. Other critics
asked how the government could pursue an antitrust case against
Microsoft if it were also a Microsoft shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers, administrators and scholars point out that stock
investments by governments and their agencies are neither new nor
rare. States, cities and several independent federal agencies,
including the Federal Reserve System, have pension plans that have
invested heavily in stocks for years. And those investments have
not, they say, created the widespread problems critics predict.
</P>
<P>
   What has proved difficult is determining who bears the burdens
of any losses and who reaps the benefits of any surpluses _ a
question made compelling by the difficulty of predicting market
performance. Even more daunting is the challenge of providing small
retirement accounts, like those envisioned by both the president
and his Republican critics, without being overwhelmed by
administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Cavanaugh has a snappy answer to the question of whether
the government can invest in stocks without becoming bogged down in
political shenanigans or corporate meddling. ``Can it be done? It's
been done,'' he said. ``We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh was the first executive director of the Federal
Retirement Thrift Investment Board, created by Congress in 1986 to
cover federal employees, including members of Congress like Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about potential conflicts between shareholding and
governing _ as in the Microsoft case _ Cavanaugh shrugged. Since
the plan invests in a stock index fund, he said, the accounts of
the federal lawyers and the federal judge in the Microsoft case
almost certainly hold a few Microsoft shares. But because Congress
designed the agency to be insulated from both the political process
and the corporate battlefield, he said, no ``horror stories'' have
emerged. The White House has also cited the protections of a stock
index fund in defending its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Strong legislation protects the agency from political pressure,
Cavanaugh said. Corporate meddling is precluded because the
commercial bank selected to manage agency investments also votes
its shares on matters like takeovers and executive compensation.
The only factor the bank can consider in casting its votes,
Cavanaugh added, is what is best for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not can it be done. The question that should
be asked,'' he said, ``is whether the Congress, having protected 3
million federal employees from political manipulation of their
retirement funds, will be willing to extend that same protection to
the 150 million beneficiaries of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that the federal retirement system's
approach would work for a fund as large as a Social Security stock
fund would be _ the president's proposal calls for investing about
$700 billion in stocks over the next 15 years, an amount that would
have made it the largest single investor in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Schotland, a Georgetown law professor who helped drive the
campaign to modernize TIAA-CREF, the pension plan for the nation's
university and college faculty, said it might be wiser to delegate
the voting of shares to an independent fiduciary institution.
Others said the problem could be resolved by requiring that the
government cast its shares with the majority of other shareholders
in any important dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Most statewide pension funds have invested in stocks for years,
as have most large municipal pension programs. According to
Nicholas Greifer, senior policy analyst with the government Finance
Officers Association in Chicago, only three states _ Indiana, South
Carolina and West Virginia _ did not permit stock market
investments by statewide pension funds as of 1997. Since then, all
three have obtained legislative or voter approval to permit such
investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state funds have a somewhat uneven record when it comes to
insulating investment decisions from improper influences, several
pension industry executives said. Roland Machold, who retired in
July as director of the New Jersey Division of Investments, said
that over the years ``there is hardly a state that hasn't had some
brush with scandal with its pension fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But most frequently, Machold said, those problems have involved
the selection of outside consultants or investments in exotic
assets, like venture capital investments in local businesses,
substandard mortgages and poorly understood investments like
derivatives. ``The states have almost never screwed up buying
nationally listed securities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures have occasionally ordered pension funds to
abstain from certain investments _ for instance, in companies doing
business in South Africa during apartheid and, more recently, in
tobacco companies. But most state pension funds with strong
professional leadership have avoided interference by special
interests, said Ian Lanoff, who ran the Labor Department's
compliance program under ERISA, the federal law governing private
pensions, in the Carter administration and who now specializes in
pension law in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the refusal by New York City's pension funds to help
bail the city out during its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, and
the later refusal of Michigan public pension funds to help rescue
Chrysler Corp. More recently, he said, the largest public pension
funds have been largely successful in resisting efforts to ban
investments in Northern Ireland and in companies involved in
Holocaust reparations disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ERISA requires pension funds to base investment decisions solely
on the best interests of retirees, Lanoff said. ``Most states have
taken ERISA principles and applied them to their own plans.''
Similar standards would help insulate a Social Security fund even
further from political interference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But public pension funds have been less successful in insulating
themselves from politics in the tug-of-war over fund surpluses and
shortfalls, said Gene Kalwarski, a public-pension specialist at
Milliman &AMP; Robertson in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``vicious and bitter debates'' over whether
surpluses in public pension funds should be used to improve
retirement benefits or to reduce the amount taxpayers must
contribute the next year, he said. Similarly, if a fund falls short
_ perhaps because of stock market losses _ the battle rages over
whether to cut benefits or raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is unrealistic to expect that such battles _ already a
feature of the Social Security debate _ will not continue,
especially if future stock returns do not mirror recent strong
gains, several legal scholars said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the plan assume that any shortfalls would remain
the responsibility of federal taxpayers, as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainties persuade some that stock investments by the
Social Security fund raise more problems than they solve. ``My own
instinct is to be very chary,'' said Richard Nathan, director of
the Rockefeller Institute of government, the public policy research
arm of the State University of New York in Albany. ``The past in
the stock market is not necessarily prologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Boyd, who specializes in state government studies at the
institute, shared that concern. ``State funds are large, very, very
large,'' he said, ``but the Social Security fund would be huge.
That makes it more visible, but more cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   But trying to give beneficiaries a stock market tonic in the
form of small individual accounts _ a feature of both the
president's plan and several Republican alternatives _ raises
administrative problems that Cavanaugh says would be virtually
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of providing individual plans, similar to corporate
401(k)s, to workers at businesses with 10 or fewer employees would
consume most of what the typical Social Security beneficiary could
afford to invest, Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of America's 6.5 million businesses are very
small, he said. And it is that factor, not the number of Social
Security participants, that will determine the ``economies of
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, financial services companies charge about $300
for each participant in such small-scale plans. Since the average
Social Security wage is approximately $20,000 a year, a worker
trying to save 2 percent of that would invest just $400 a year but
pay $300 a year in expenses.
</P>
<P>

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposal by President Clinton to invest some portion of Social
Security reserves in stocks ignited a brushfire of criticism last
week, although the attacks may have focused on easily solved
problems and ignored some thornier issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he strongly
doubted that the plan could be insulated from political
interference. Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, argued that the concept would give the
government undue influence over corporate affairs. Other critics
asked how the government could pursue an antitrust case against
Microsoft if it were also a Microsoft shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers, administrators and scholars point out that stock
investments by governments and their agencies are neither new nor
rare. States, cities and several independent federal agencies,
including the Federal Reserve System, have pension plans that have
invested heavily in stocks for years. And those investments have
not, they say, created the widespread problems critics predict.
</P>
<P>
   What has proved difficult is determining who bears the burdens
of any losses and who reaps the benefits of any surpluses _ a
question made compelling by the difficulty of predicting market
performance. Even more daunting is the challenge of providing small
retirement accounts, like those envisioned by both the president
and his Republican critics, without being overwhelmed by
administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Cavanaugh has a snappy answer to the question of whether
the government can invest in stocks without becoming bogged down in
political shenanigans or corporate meddling. ``Can it be done? It's
been done,'' he said. ``We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh was the first executive director of the Federal
Retirement Thrift Investment Board, created by Congress in 1986 to
cover federal employees, including members of Congress like Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about potential conflicts between shareholding and
governing _ as in the Microsoft case _ Cavanaugh shrugged. Since
the plan invests in a stock index fund, he said, the accounts of
the federal lawyers and the federal judge in the Microsoft case
almost certainly hold a few Microsoft shares. But because Congress
designed the agency to be insulated from both the political process
and the corporate battlefield, he said, no ``horror stories'' have
emerged. The White House has also cited the protections of a stock
index fund in defending its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Strong legislation protects the agency from political pressure,
Cavanaugh said. Corporate meddling is precluded because the
commercial bank selected to manage agency investments also votes
its shares on matters like takeovers and executive compensation.
The only factor the bank can consider in casting its votes,
Cavanaugh added, is what is best for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not can it be done. The question that should
be asked,'' he said, ``is whether the Congress, having protected 3
million federal employees from political manipulation of their
retirement funds, will be willing to extend that same protection to
the 150 million beneficiaries of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that the federal retirement system's
approach would work for a fund as large as a Social Security stock
fund would be _ the president's proposal calls for investing about
$700 billion in stocks over the next 15 years, an amount that would
have made it the largest single investor in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Schotland, a Georgetown law professor who helped drive the
campaign to modernize TIAA-CREF, the pension plan for the nation's
university and college faculty, said it might be wiser to delegate
the voting of shares to an independent fiduciary institution.
Others said the problem could be resolved by requiring that the
government cast its shares with the majority of other shareholders
in any important dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Most statewide pension funds have invested in stocks for years,
as have most large municipal pension programs. According to
Nicholas Greifer, senior policy analyst with the government Finance
Officers Association in Chicago, only three states _ Indiana, South
Carolina and West Virginia _ did not permit stock market
investments by statewide pension funds as of 1997. Since then, all
three have obtained legislative or voter approval to permit such
investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state funds have a somewhat uneven record when it comes to
insulating investment decisions from improper influences, several
pension industry executives said. Roland Machold, who retired in
July as director of the New Jersey Division of Investments, said
that over the years ``there is hardly a state that hasn't had some
brush with scandal with its pension fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But most frequently, Machold said, those problems have involved
the selection of outside consultants or investments in exotic
assets, like venture capital investments in local businesses,
substandard mortgages and poorly understood investments like
derivatives. ``The states have almost never screwed up buying
nationally listed securities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures have occasionally ordered pension funds to
abstain from certain investments _ for instance, in companies doing
business in South Africa during apartheid and, more recently, in
tobacco companies. But most state pension funds with strong
professional leadership have avoided interference by special
interests, said Ian Lanoff, who ran the Labor Department's
compliance program under ERISA, the federal law governing private
pensions, in the Carter administration and who now specializes in
pension law in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the refusal by New York City's pension funds to help
bail the city out during its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, and
the later refusal of Michigan public pension funds to help rescue
Chrysler Corp. More recently, he said, the largest public pension
funds have been largely successful in resisting efforts to ban
investments in Northern Ireland and in companies involved in
Holocaust reparations disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ERISA requires pension funds to base investment decisions solely
on the best interests of retirees, Lanoff said. ``Most states have
taken ERISA principles and applied them to their own plans.''
Similar standards would help insulate a Social Security fund even
further from political interference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But public pension funds have been less successful in insulating
themselves from politics in the tug-of-war over fund surpluses and
shortfalls, said Gene Kalwarski, a public-pension specialist at
Milliman &AMP; Robertson in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``vicious and bitter debates'' over whether
surpluses in public pension funds should be used to improve
retirement benefits or to reduce the amount taxpayers must
contribute the next year, he said. Similarly, if a fund falls short
_ perhaps because of stock market losses _ the battle rages over
whether to cut benefits or raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is unrealistic to expect that such battles _ already a
feature of the Social Security debate _ will not continue,
especially if future stock returns do not mirror recent strong
gains, several legal scholars said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the plan assume that any shortfalls would remain
the responsibility of federal taxpayers, as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainties persuade some that stock investments by the
Social Security fund raise more problems than they solve. ``My own
instinct is to be very chary,'' said Richard Nathan, director of
the Rockefeller Institute of government, the public policy research
arm of the State University of New York in Albany. ``The past in
the stock market is not necessarily prologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Boyd, who specializes in state government studies at the
institute, shared that concern. ``State funds are large, very, very
large,'' he said, ``but the Social Security fund would be huge.
That makes it more visible, but more cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   But trying to give beneficiaries a stock market tonic in the
form of small individual accounts _ a feature of both the
president's plan and several Republican alternatives _ raises
administrative problems that Cavanaugh says would be virtually
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of providing individual plans, similar to corporate
401(k)s, to workers at businesses with 10 or fewer employees would
consume most of what the typical Social Security beneficiary could
afford to invest, Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of America's 6.5 million businesses are very
small, he said. And it is that factor, not the number of Social
Security participants, that will determine the ``economies of
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, financial services companies charge about $300
for each participant in such small-scale plans. Since the average
Social Security wage is approximately $20,000 a year, a worker
trying to save 2 percent of that would invest just $400 a year but
pay $300 a year in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House and Republicans have disputed that
administrative costs would be that high, Cavanaugh is not
persuaded. ``You would be better off putting your money in the
mattress,'' he said.

POPE SAYS NEGLECT OF THE PRIVILEGED PROMOTES SECULARIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ John Paul II urged the bishops of North and South
America gathered here to take better care of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But sounding a new and somewhat uncharacteristic note, the pope
also instructed them to minister to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love for the poor must be preferential, but not exclusive,''
the pope said in an Apostolic Exhortation, his definitive answer to
the questions raised in a 1997 synod of bishops of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading sectors of society have been neglected and many
people have thus been estranged from the church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that secularization is sweeping unions, the military,
politicians and other better-off social groups, the pope warned
that, ``If this evangelization of society's leaders is neglected,
it should come as no surprise that many who are a part of it will
be guided by criteria alien to the Gospel and at times openly
hostile to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since communism collapsed, John Paul II has devoted much of his
attention to the moral failings of capitalism. This document, like
previous ones, lashed out at the inequities of an unbridled
free-market system.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more in countries of America, a system known as
`neo-liberalism' prevails; based on a purely economic conception of
man, this system considers profit and the law of the market as its
only parameters,'' he said. But now, the pope is also raising the
spiritual needs of a wealthier flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm surprised,'' said George Weigel, a theologian who
is writing a biography of John Paul II. ``But it sounds like good
news. It is a new recognition of a new social reality in Latin
America, that it is moving beyond an oligarchy and impoverished
masses, and developing a middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see it as the pope's concern that the church in Latin
America, having rejected the Marxism embedded in liberation
theology, but not the message, has overemphasized the poor and
alienated the rich. And many church leaders who had gathered in
Mexico to receive the document expressed complete agreement with
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People whose gains are ill-gotten are sinners, of course,''
said Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, a Vatican official from
Medellin, Colombia. ``But there are also people who have worked
hard to earn a decent living.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The pope is saying that a mother may prefer her
child who is sick, but she does not abandon the ones who are
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope summoned the bishops of what he prefers to call
``America'' to Mexico to urge greater solidarity and cooperation
between the north and south of the continent. He is asking them for
a new evangelization of the Americas, where the church sees its
main hope of expansion in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most urgent problems raised by the bishops and
addressed in the pope's reply had to do with the Catholic Church's
difficulty in ministering to even one sector of society, let alone
all.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of priests _ a preoccupation in the United States,
where one priest ministers to 1,000 parishioners _ is an emergency
in Latin America, where there is one priest for 13,000
parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, as he looks ahead to the next millennium, expressed
dismay about a rival evangelization taking place with the spread of
evangelical Protestant movements.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1990 visit, the pope scolded Mexican bishops for having
left their flock ``deplorably vulnerable'' to proselytizing
Protestant denominations. Since that visit, though, the number of
converts has steadily grown.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Barranco, director of Mexico City's Center of Religious
Studies, estimates that the number of Protestants has grown by 30
percent to 40 percent since the 1990 census and that they now
number between 4.6 and 4.9 million. Not all are evangelical or
Pentecostal; at least some have joined traditional Protestant
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of proselytizing by sects and new religious groups
in America cannot be ignored,'' the pope said. ``Pastoral policies
will have to be revised, so that each particular church can offer
the faithful more personalized religious care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Believers in Latin America have often blended ancient indigenous
rites with Catholic ritual. The pope urged bishops to indulge local
traditions, as long as they do not clash with church orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   He asked them to discover ``the true spiritual values present in
popular religiosity, so that enriched by genuine Catholic doctrine,
it might lead to a sincere conversion and a practical exercise of
charity.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, which is made up of 74 densely packed chapters, is
long and unwieldy in tone, the product of many committees.
</P>
<P>
   But one theme was particularly personal to the pope, namely, his
desire to unify North and South America into one church, which is
why he calls it a Synod of America.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has always expressed deep reverence for Our Lady of
Guadalupe, a dark-skinned virgin said to have appeared to an Indian
peasant named Juan Diego 476 years ago, and who helped convert
Mexico's Indian population to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   She is Mexico's national saint, and her shrine receives about 3
million pilgrims a year. The pope, who offered a Mass at her
basilica on Saturday, his third visit to her shrine, declared in
the document that her saint's day, Dec. 12, should be equally
commemorated in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Some view that exhortation as a symbol of the pope's real
intentions for the Americas in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pope thought at one point that a spiritually
chastened Eastern Europe would take the lead in ushering in a new
evangelization,'' said the Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology
professor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, N.Y. ``But now he
sees that that is just not happening. He realizes that the U.S.,
with its unrivaled power _ economic, technological, social and
cultural _ is the future. So what does the church do? Its biggest
resource is Latin America _ there alone the church presence is
really strong. They are here within the empire, they have a better
chance of influencing the U.S. than any church in any other
place.''

JUDGE ORDERS LEWINSKY TO SUBMIT TO STARR INTERVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ordered Monica Lewinsky on Saturday
to submit to an interview with the independent counsel on behalf of
House prosecutors, drawing a bitter White House attack on their
effort to force Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, issued moments
before senators resumed a second day of questioning in President
Clinton's impeachment trial, ignited a furious question-and-answer
session on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the fairness of the House prosecutors' using
the authority of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to compel
Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation, while Republicans demanded to know how
the Senate could untangle important conflicting testimony without
hearing from witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling came in response to a request from Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, after Ms. Lewinsky rejected a
request to meet with the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Johnson said that House prosecutors had no right
under Ms. Lewinsky's immunity deal with Starr to force her to
submit to their questioning. But she ruled that the independent
counsel could compel Ms. Lewinsky to answer questions from his
staff and allow the House prosecutors to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., one of the 13 House prosecutors, all of
whom are Republicans, opened Saturday's session in the Senate by
explaining that the prosecutors, or managers, merely wanted a
routine meeting with Ms. Lewinsky before deciding whether to ask
the Senate to depose her.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, with sarcasm in his
voice, ridiculed a claim by the House prosecutors that they were
merely seeking a routine interview with a potential witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what that little conversation is going to look
like, held in the independent counsel's office, with the people
there who have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little
chat?'' Ruff said. ``I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers have balked at allowing her to meet with
the House managers, arguing that it would cast her in ``a partisan
light.``
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to trail along with the House managers struck us as
wrong,'' Jacob Stein, a lawyer for Ms. Lewinsky, said in a
telephone interview Saturday. Stein said it was unlikely that Ms.
Lewinsky would appeal Johnson's order, and he did not know when the
interview might take place.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional officials say the interview could happen this
weekend. Ms. Lewinsky would face intense questioning from Starr's
lawyers. The House prosecutors believe that her answers could be
pivotal as the Senate decides early next week whether to question
witnesses or to decide Clinton's fate without witnesses, the
managers say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the impeachment procedures adopted by the Senate, senators
would have to vote separately on whether to depose witnesses and
then whether to call any to testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, using the awkward procedure of submitting
written questions to the trial's presiding officer, Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, who reads them aloud, challenged the House
prosecutors about why they did not consult the Senate before
seeking Starr's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal practice to do this,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla. ``We would have been incompetent and derelict if we hadn't
tried to talk to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question posed by Republican senators about
examples of conflicting testimony where witnesses might help, Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., cited the president's testimony about gifts
he gave to Ms. Lewinsky, the differing accounts between Ms.
Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan Jr. over what details of her
relationship she shared with Jordan, and the conflicting accounts
involving Betty Currie's role in dealing with Ms. Lewinsky's gifts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House managers entered the Senate chamber Saturday morning
well aware of the swirling talk among senators about ending the
trial, and that the pressure was on the prosecutors to reverse that
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not on what individual senators may be saying,''
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said on CNN on Friday night. ``Our
focus is on trying to do our job and present this case. We believe
that there's a compelling case that the president did commit
perjury before the grand jury, and engaged in a series of acts
involving obstruction of justice. We are going to proceed, to the
extent that the Senate will allow us to do so, to make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady acknowledged that the White House had challenged parts of
the House managers' arguments, but he insisted that overall the
prosecution was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll pick at little parts of the case, but there are some
of these things that just can't be explained away, and the
president's defense has consisted throughout in denying the obvious
and asserting the implausible.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the trial begins on Monday, when senators are
to begin debating whether to dismiss the case and whether to depose
witnesses. Votes on one or both motions could happen later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a guardian of Senate tradition,
shocked the Capitol on Friday when he announced that he would
introduce the motion to dismiss. Byrd, an 81-year-old Senate dean,
said he did not believe that witnesses would add any meaningful
testimony and that the two-thirds vote required to convict Clinton
was not within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate on dismissal and witnesses takes place, in
open and closed sessions on the Senate floor, Democrats and
Republicans said Saturday they expected the flurry of private
meetings and mini-negotiations over how best to end the trial to
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, on Saturday endorsed a suggestion
of Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, to convene all
100 senators in the ceremonial Old Senate Chamber to discuss how to
bring the trial to a close.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that rarely used chamber two weeks ago that senators
struck an unusual bipartisan accord on the rules for the first
phases of the Senate trial. ``We have to figure out how to serve
our constitutional duties,'' Snowe said on CNN.

RUSSIA'S PREMIER TRIES TO FILL VACUUM AT TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ His boss is back in the hospital, leaving him with most
of the work. His budget for 1999 is dismissed as unrealistic, and
it doesn't even take into account $8 billion that Russia has
already promised not to pay its creditors. The economy is sure to
get worse before it gets better, and the International Monetary
Fund is still playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia, now four months
in office, the new year has yet to bring good news. President Boris
Yeltsin's latest ailment, diagnosed as a bleeding ulcer, only
confirms a trend that was already evident: Primakov, a former
foreign minister, has had to assume more and more of the
president's duties, being careful not to show any unseemly
enthusiasm for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's presidential elections are technically still 18 months
away, and most _ though not all _ of the top contenders would
prefer to hold off the start of a real campaign. But the vacuum at
the top has become so obvious, and so persistent, that some are
beginning to wonder how much longer the country can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest noise has come from Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow,
who is widely seen as the leading contender for Yeltsin's job. A
former Yeltsin ally who has now made a point of keeping his
distance from the increasingly unpopular president, Luzhkov came
right out and told journalists recently that the time had come for
Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's tone became slightly more tactful after Yeltsin's most
recent hospitalization, but like the little boy who has finally
blurted out that the emperor has no clothes, he wants to be the one
to spread the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret to anyone that he has not been in good health
for a long time,'' Luzhkov said last Monday, referring to the newly
hospitalized Yeltsin. ``Society and the state must get an answer
from the president on how he wants to resolve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Primakov has been filling the gap well enough
to make himself Russia's most trusted politician, several public
opinion polls indicate. Arriving in the political and economic
firestorm that erupted after Aug. 17, the day the ruble collapsed
and Russia went into virtual default, Primakov has earned points
simply for restoring an impression of political stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Primakov came on the wave of expectations of a civil
war,'' said Igor Bunin, director of the Political Technologies
Center, a local research group, ``he is considered a stabilizer of
the political situation. With the lack of trust in the president
and the Parliament, the government's rating is very high,
unprecedentedly high.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov may or may not end up being a contender for Yeltsin's
job, but on one thing all observers agree: Given the president's
well-known sensitivity to real or apparent rivals, Primakov will
certainly not tip his hand until he has to.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For now he is simply strengthening his position inside a
government that is fast filling up with Primakov appointees. Many
are old allies from his five-year stint as head of Russia's foreign
intelligence agency. The most notable of these in recent days was
Yuri Kobaladze, the former press officer at the spy agency, who has
reportedly been named deputy head of Russia's state-owned radio and
television company.
</P>
<P>
   These appointments have been closely watched for clues to the
direction of Primakov's economic and other policies, which are
still unclear. Most analysts assume that Primakov is aiming above
all to secure the loyalty of a large and unruly bureaucracy during
a time of political transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in Primakov's position would try to insert his own
people in key positions,'' said Thomas Graham, a Russian expert and
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Primakov's principal achievement has been his ability to
buy peace with the Communists who dominate Russia's usually
truculent Parliament, in part by making one of their deputies, Yuri
Maslyukov, his chief deputy minister for economics.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists have repaid him by withholding criticism of a $25
billion budget that on paper commits Russia to the strictest
austerity. But that same budget _ which must be voted on by the
Parliament twice more before it is adopted _ has been roundly
criticized by the IMF as not tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts have criticized the document for making a series of
rosy assumptions _ including a stable ruble, moderate inflation and
the expectation that international lenders will stump up $4 billion
in credits to fill an anticipated budget deficit of the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also assumed that its foreign creditors, who are owed
$17.5 billion this year, will be willing to roll over half that
amount with a new restructuring agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, representatives of the so-called London Club _
creditors who hold Russia's old Soviet-era commercial debt _ agreed
to a restructuring arrangement that allows Russia to avoid a
technical default.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, who was in Washington the week before last to lobby
the monetary fund, has said that Russia will not bend to the fund's
main demands, in particular the rollback of a recent cut in the
Russian value-added tax. He has also insisted that Russia is asking
only as much money _ about $5 billion _ as it needs to keep paying
back its overall fund debt, which is about $16.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest in the fund only amounts to refinancing debts to
the fund itself, the debt that our predecessors contracted in the
name of Russia and that we recognize,'' Maslyukov told the Russian
newspaper Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
   As a fund team assembles here for another look at Russia, many
observers, Russian and foreign, expect that more credits will
eventually be forthcoming, for political if not economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West and Primakov are tied together whether they like it
or not,'' Graham said. ``The West cannot afford a catastrophe in
Russia any more than Primakov can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations of high school students, the sequence of science
has been a given: 9th-grade biology, 10th-grade chemistry and, for
the minority who make it that far, 11th-grade physics.
</P>
<P>
   But that sequence, established a century ago when science was a
simpler matter, is being reversed, as a growing number of
scientists and educators agree that physics ought to come first.
</P>
<P>
   While only a few schools actually have retrained their teachers
and made the difficult transition to ninth-grade physics, there is
increasing consensus that flipping the sequence gives the
curriculum a coherence it now lacks, and allows students to build
on concepts they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proposing a kind of conceptual physics that is not so
mathematical, using just the algebra ninth-graders know,'' said
Leon Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is the leading
advocate of physics first. ``You can teach Newtonian motion, the
conservation of energy, and give a feeling for what an atom is, so
they can walk into chemistry the next year with grace and
confidence. Having those concepts first seems to be especially
helpful for girls and minorities. I'm sure it's a winning battle,
but like truth and justice, it's going to take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In good part, the push to reorder science education is a
response to a century's worth of advances in scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old curriculum came from the 1800s when biology was very
descriptive,'' said Michael Bernstein, who teaches ninth-grade
physics at Friends Seminary, a Manhattan private school. ``Kids
would go out in the field, collect samples, draw pictures and
dissect things. They didn't learn the chemistry of what goes on
inside cells, because it wasn't known. And in chemistry, they would
do some pretty things in test tubes and learn some basic reactions.
But now biology is by far the most complicated of the sciences,
with much, much more biochemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said that giving freshmen a thick biology text full of
new vocabulary and new concepts, as he did at the public school
where he used to work, runs the risk of putting them off science
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``These poor little ninth-graders come in with no chemistry or
physics,'' he said. ``You can talk to them about energy, but they
don't really know what energy is, so they end up with this huge
textbook, having to memorize things they don't have the background
to understand. With hands-on physics as their first high school
science, they can really get excited about learning fundamental
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the success of putting physics first has been the
enormous growth in the number of students taking advanced courses
at schools that have flipped their sequence.
</P>
<P>
   At North Hunterdon High School in Annandale, N.J., for example,
there were only 38 students enrolled in any Advanced Placement
science class in 1990-91, the last year of the old sequence. The
new curriculum has brought steady increases in those numbers, and
this year, a record 226 students are in Advanced Placement science:
98 in biology, 49 in physics, 41 in environmental science and 38 in
chemistry. Students who complete the Advanced Placement courses and
pass Advanced Placement exams with good marks can get college
credit for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this sequence helps students stay with science,
by presenting it logically,'' said Tom Palma, the science
department chairman. ``In any ninth-grade biology class, you keep
hearing the teacher say, `you'll understand this better next year
when you study chemistry.' And in chemistry they say, `you'll
understand this better next year, when you get physics.' So why not
teach it that way?''
</P>
<P>
   In most ninth-grade physics classes, many activities are
designed around practical questions, like why sunsets are red, how
a lightning rod protects a house, which part of a hot pizza burns
your mouth, or why a bird can sit on a power line without being
zapped. Students may estimate how many kernels of corn they would
have to pop to fill a coffee can, analyze the mechanics of a roller
coaster, launch water rockets, or design a container that would
keep an egg dropped from a roof from breaking.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent North Hunterdon lab, 23 ninth-graders were studying
conservation of energy with cut-up Slinkys taped to a yardstick.
Working in noisy groups of three, they attached different weights
to the Slinkys, measured how far they stretched, graphed the data,
and calculated whether the gravitational potential the weighted
spring lost from its scrunched-up position equaled the
springing-back potential it gained when it dropped.
</P>
<P>
   There were weights that fell off, mathematical errors,
conceptual confusions _ and, because of the difficulty of measuring
moving spring, some hefty margins of error _ but by the end of the
hour, all but one of the groups had proved, more or less, that
energy was conserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes more sense, to start with physics, to go from
gravity to machines to motion, and study how the whole world works
before you start breaking it up,'' said Amy McKinsey, a
ninth-grader planning to move into advanced placement chemistry
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to physics first is slow, though. While no one knows
exact figures, fewer than 100 schools teach ninth-grade physics.
Not coincidentally, several are in the Chicago area, Lederman's
home territory. Naperville North High School, 30 miles west of
Chicago, began offering ninth-graders a choice of earth science or
physics in 1996. That first year, most chose earth science, but now
the balance has tipped, with slightly more choosing physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids really do like it,'' said Bill Engler, the science
coordinator. ``And now the teachers want to teach it, both because
it's a fun course, and because they've seen that the kids who've
had it can do more advanced work when they go on to the other
subjects. We're guessing that next year, for the first time, we'll
have to offer an advanced physics course.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, putting physics first seems to have been adopted at
as many private schools as public ones. In New York, it is mostly
private schools, including Friends, Packer, Calhoun and Trevor Day.
But in Philadelphia, the school board is hoping to nudge all 42
public high schools toward ninth-grade physics over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has this whole wonderful domino effect,'' said Natalie
Hiller, the Philadelphia system's science education coordinator.
``Once students know the big ideas, it opens the whole world of
science for them. This is something that's been bubbling under the
surface of science education for years, but now it's really
beginning to happen. It's a big change, though, and it's not always
met with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there are far more biology teachers than physics
teachers, in part because under the traditional sequence, only a
quarter of all high school students ever got to physics. In the
course of the transition, there comes a year when there is no
introductory biology class, forcing all the biology teachers to
teach physics, a subject many feel ill-prepared to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem of turning this thing upside down is that
you have a big group of teachers who are heavy on the life sciences
end of things, the descriptive part, not even the biochemistry,''
said Jim Nelson, a teacher trainer in Florida. ``It's a major
problem to find teachers who are comfortable teaching physics.
Teacher training is still an important component of what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At North Hunterdon, Palma offered twice-weekly after-school
training for the physics-teachers-to-be and promised them that, if
necessary, he would come into the classroom and teach the first
lesson of the day, while they took notes so they could teach it for
the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only came down to that a few times,'' he said. ``But the
logistics of the switchover years are four years of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other obstacles, too: So far, there are no biology or
chemistry texts written specifically for students who have already
had introductory physics. And even physics teachers, accustomed to
teaching a math-heavy curriculum to the school's most advanced
students, often object to the prospect of taking on ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot of physics teachers who say they don't do
freshmen,'' Lederman said. ``But uniformly, the people who are
doing it are enthusiastic.'' In Science magazine last summer,
Lederman and a co-author, Marjorie Bardeen, published ``Coherence
in Science Education,'' arguing that the time is right for physics
first, given schools' increasing trend of requiring at least three
years of high school science, as called for in the 1996 National
Science Education Standards, published by the National Research
Council.
</P>
<P>
   While there is widespread criticism of American science
education, and great interest in reform, physics first is not the
only approach being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Some favor the European model, in which students typically take
two science courses at the same time, progressing through, say,
biology and chemistry simultaneously, with both the text and the
teaching coordinated so that the fundamentals in chemistry are
covered before the biochemistry comes up in biology.
</P>
<P>
   Others, especially in seventh to ninth grades, are integrating
the sciences by studying each topic as a physicist, biologist or
chemist might, looking, for example, at the chemistry of water, its
specific heat and its effect on weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about all kinds of different approaches,''
said Harold Pratt, director of science projects at the National
Academy of Science's Center for Science, Mathematics and
Engineering. ``Physics first is maybe a little bit of a physicist's
perspective. Other scientists might say ninth-graders can learn a
lot about their bodies or the environment without knowing
chemistry. But physics first is the model you see schools changing
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Two widely used ninth-grade physics curriculums are ``Conceptual
Physics,'' the textbook used at North Hunterdon, and ``Active
Physics,'' a series of projects on different themes, each lasting
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Eisenkraft, the science coordinator at Fox Lane High
School in Bedford, N.Y., favors ``Active Physics,'' in part because
of the flexibility it gives students who miss a unit, or have
trouble with one topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might start out with developing a sport that could be
played on the moon,'' he said. ``To do that, students have to learn
about weight on the moon, air resistance on the moon, friction on
the moon. All sports involve friction. After a couple weeks,
students have enough knowledge to start creating their sport. They
find that a lot of sports wouldn't work on the moon, like in
baseball, a hit could take 30 seconds. Then the next project might
be how to have a rock concert where people's hearing won't be
damaged, so we start talking about decibels. For kids who had
trouble with the moon sport, you can say, just try this one.''

ALBRIGHT'S TRIP TO RUSSIA UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN MUCH PROGRESS

   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright embarks
Sunday on a trip to a weakened but obstinate Russia, with little
expectation on either side that much improvement will be made in a
relationship plagued by disagreement on everything from Russia's
economic collapse to air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the euphoria in the heady days when Russia was
envisioned as a full member of a ``Group of Eight'' industrialized
democracies, the hope as Albright heads to Moscow is to keep a
dialogue alive, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her arrival, Russian officials were openly referring to
the ``sour'' nature of the relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has stridently criticized the
air strikes against Iraq, and First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov was in Washington the week before last complaining about
an economically flattened Russia being forced to live under the
thumb of a U.S.-dominated International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   To this mix of problems, the administration suddenly added a new
one: the unveiling last week of its plan to deploy a new missile
defense system that would require renegotiation of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a move that the Russians have
historically opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In pique over the air strikes against Iraq in December, the
lower house of the Russian parliament in December abruptly canceled
the vote on the ratification of Start 2, the treaty that would
reduce both nations' stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The Clinton
administration's missile defense system proposal would almost
certainly further complicate passage of Start 2 in the Parliament,
Russian arms control experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardening of the stalemate on the strategic arms treaty,
which has languished in the Russian Parliament since 1993, was
further confirmation that the notion of a ``strategic partnership''
_ once key to the Clinton administration's approach to Russia _ has
all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of the relatively upbeat expectations of previous
visits to Moscow by Albright, the administration acknowledged the
diminished influence the United States now holds over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disarray, added a senior administration official who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, made it ``more than
ordinarily difficult to reach decisions on even the most important
policy questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clearly, Albright will not be doing any business with the ailing
president, Boris Yeltsin _ it was not even clear, officials said,
whether she would see him. Instead, she will focus her energies on
Primakov, whom she met many times when he was foreign minister
before his elevation to prime minister in the political chaos that
followed Russia's ruble devaluation and virtual default Aug. 17 and
Yeltsin's dismissal of his entire reformist-led government.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that the Clinton administration acknowledges
that the Yeltsin era is all but over, Albright is scheduled to meet
with three likely presidential candidates: Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, former Gen. Alexander Lebed, and economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the issues on Albright's agenda with Primakov
address problems associated with Russia's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The week before her arrival, Maslyukov, the leading Communist
member of Primakov's government, was told by the IMF and
administration officials that the assumptions in the draft Russian
budget were unrealistic and not sufficient to qualify Russia for a
new loan.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget presumes Russia will finance only about $4.5
billion of the $17.5 billion in foreign debt payments it is
scheduled to make in 1999. To avoid being declared bankrupt, Russia
must meet the rest of the obligations with restructured deals and
new loans, chiefly from the IMF Stanley Fischer, the fund's first
deputy managing director, said new lending would only be possible
if Russia raised more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, in its turn, is making a big issue of the negotiations
for new troop levels under the 1990 treaty that established levels
for conventional forces for a Europe still divided into NATO and
the now defunct, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   In an expression of its opposition to NATO expansion to include
three former Warsaw Pact countries _ Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary _ Russia is demanding that NATO agree to specific limits on
troops in certain European regions before NATO's 50th anniversary
celebration in April, where the three will be formally admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian and Clinton administration officials suggested this
is one area where Albright may make progress.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will also stress the administration's unhappiness over
what it contends is Russia's heightened assistance to Iran on
missile technology in the last six months. Officials said it was
less clear what, if anything, Albright could accomplish on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, the administration slapped economic
penalties on three Russian institutions after asserting that they
were providing Iranian scientists with technical assistance. In
response, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that talking to Russia
``in the language of sanctions and pressure is absolutely
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, administration officials said, Albright would tell
the Russians that, if Russia does not stop assisting Iran in this
way, the United States will end the joint U.S.-Russian satellite
launch program that expires next year and is worth about $1 billion
to Russian aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will also probe Primakov's position on Iraq, officials
said. Primakov, who prides himself on his knowledge of the Arab
world, has denounced the administration's policy on Iraq in the
strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia senses a diplomatic opening for itself on Iraq at the
United Nations, where the Russians sense the United States is
increasingly isolated in its approach to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, where the Russians are traditionally sympathetic to
the cause of the Serbs, their fellow Orthodox Slavs, but are
apparently wearying somewhat of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, Albright might achieve a little more, officials said.
The Russians have said they oppose NATO air strikes against the
Serbs, who are fighting an insurgency of ethnic Albanian guerrillas
in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright will ask the Russians to use their influence to
persuade Milosevic to comply with a cease-fire agreement made in
October.

GORE BUILDING NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: N.J., N.H., Iowa, Mass., Texas)  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As vice president, Al Gore has traveled to
California so many times that aides have lost count. They think his
latest trip this weekend, his second of the year, is the 52nd. But
they are not eager to bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   He has built a prodigious network of constituent groups and
contributors to help him win California's 54 electoral votes, the
most of any state, and help him become the fifth incumbent vice
president to capture the White House by election. (The others were
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   California always has been critical in the presidential
equation. But by moving up its primary to join New York and eight
other states on March 7 in 2000, just weeks after the first two
election tests, the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary,
California's primary holds life-threatening powers over
underfinanced campaigns that are still forming.
</P>
<P>
   While that might suggest an urgent need to organize and tap
financial sources, Gore appears to be the only aspirant from either
party who has amassed a powerful array of support at this early
juncture of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, we're just at the very beginning,'' said Gina
Glantz, campaign manager for Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator who recently entered the presidential race. ``Sooner more
than later, we'll have a more formal organization in California.
But we're just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said
any others who might be contemplating a run, like Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, had not significantly raised their profiles in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the primary is so early, they should have
started organizing six months ago,'' Torres said. ``If they would
ask me for advice now, I'd tell them not to waste their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who lectured at Stanford University after his three
terms in the Senate, is not without ties to California. He has
campaigned for Democrats from swing districts, like Reps. Ellen O.
Tauscher and Gary A. Condit, and his friendship with Michael D.
Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co., could lead to big
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reality is, Gore is leaps and bounds in front,'' said
Rep. Loretta Sanchez, from California's Orange County. She also is
a director of Gore's political action committee, Leadership '98,
and an incoming chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, a
position that requires neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strength in California flows directly from the power of
incumbency and instant access to Air Force Two, a combination that
allows him to deliver federal largess and to campaign for Democrats
whenever he wants _ and often on the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   On a dozen visits last year, he announced grants and programs
worth more than $550 million, and almost every Democrat running for
statewide office won in November, including Gray Davis, the state's
first Democratic governor in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did in planning for this weekend, Gore has made
special efforts to court the same groups that twice turned out
money and votes for Clinton, including Hispanic and black voters
and people in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Through science and technology issues, long a passion of his,
Gore has tried expanding that base by impressing environmentalists
and Silicon Valley executives with his knowledge of topics like
``salmon as an indicator species'' and ``massive parallel
computing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has taken unusual steps to familiarize himself
with high-tech issues, meeting periodically with small groups of
industry representatives at all levels _ ``Gore Techs,'' his aides
call them _ to discuss new and future technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave an address on forestry, water issues and clean air
about a year ago at Lake Tahoe,'' said Ruth Hunter, a board member
of the California League of Conservation Voters. ``He was more
informed than some of the enviros.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo, the Internet portal, said he
and other high-tech executives had grown to respect Gore for
interest in issues vital to Internet growth, like privacy and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one meeting I was in with him, he talked very eloquently
about network economics, how decision making can be distributed in
the network world,'' Yang said. ``It's good to see that he can
think about these things and not reduce himself to sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   With people of Hispanic descent now California's fastest growing
ethnic group, making up 30.8 percent of the state's population,
Gore has pursued them as aggressively as any group. Last year, he
often appeared at campaign and issue-related events with Cruz M.
Bustamante, who became the state's first elected lieutenant
governor of Hispanic descent, and with Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the
new state assembly speaker. In one East Los Angeles event with
Hispanic union workers days before the election, Gore delivered his
entire get-out-the-vote message in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know George Bush Jr. is doing all he can to show support for
the Latino community in Texas, speaking Spanish and all that,''
said Bustamante, who refers to Gore as Alberto. ``But I can't think
of any candidate, Democrat or Republican, who could break the bond
that exists for the vice president.''

   Yvonne Burke, a Los Angeles County Supervisor, said Gore had
developed a similar bond with many black Californians for promoting
issues important to low-income people, like economic development in
inner-city neighborhoods and employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the vice president also won points when he attended
events like the funeral last fall of Tom Bradley, who was a hero to
many blacks as the first black mayor of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, people coming to California, come to raise money and
only see the more affluent communities,'' Ms. Burke said. ``The
president has always been visible in all of Los Angeles'
communities, and the vice president's approach has been very
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   As for fund-raising, a sensitive subject for Gore since his 1996
appearance at a Buddhist temple almost led to a Justice Department
investigation, the vice president is relying heavily upon people in
the entertainment industry who raised money for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They include David Geffen, the record industry executive, and
Rob Reiner, the actor and director. Both said Gore had attributes
that made him more attractive than Clinton was before becoming
President.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Bill Clinton had to start from scratch,'' Geffen
said. ``Al Gore is extremely well-known and well-liked. I can't
imagine why he would not enjoy great support.'' He called Bradley a
``very decent and honorable guy,'' but a primary candidate who has
``zero chance'' to defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner had Gore's help last year, leading a successful ballot
initiative that raises taxes on cigarettes and uses the money for
children's services.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say that he's not as glamorous as President Clinton,''
Reiner said of the vice president. ``But in a strange way, that
makes people even more dedicated to him. He's a policy wonk, but at
least with him you get none of the extras and distractions you get
with the president.''

OPPOSITION PARTY POLITICIAN GUNNED DOWN IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A high-level official of South
Africa's new multiracial political party, the United Democratic
Movement, was assassinated Saturday, riddled with bullets as he
left a grocery store near his home in a rural area about an hour's
drive north of Durban.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign for South Africa's second national elections
just gearing up, the killing of the official, Sifiso Nkabinde, once
again raises questions about whether political violence will return
as the vote approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde was a controversial figure who was expelled by
President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress party for
allegedly spying on the party for the former apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was accused of inciting political violence in his
hometown of Richmond and stood trial on 16 murder charges. He was,
however, acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nkabinde had been elected secretary-general of the
UDM, a party launched by two prominent politicians, one black and
one white, in the hopes of developing support across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   While the party was initially dismissed as a curiosity, polls
have shown that it has growing support and that this backing _
between 5 and 7 percent _ is indeed coming from both blacks and
whites.
</P>
<P>
   But a cloud of violence had always surrounded Nkabinde. After he
was expelled from the ANC, a violent turf battle developed around
him in Richmond. Dozens of people died in what appeared to be a
tit-for-tat exchange between ANC supporters and those that stayed
loyal to Nkabinde.
</P>
<P>
   With national elections expected sometime this spring, political
analysts had been concerned about the role Nkabinde might play at a
time when violence in the KwaZulu-Natal province has, on the whole,
been declining.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most of the province's political violence was
related to the rivalry between the African National Congress and
the Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. In the last decade, more than
10,000 people died in political clashes between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But they have been negotiating to end their differences. Lately,
there has been talk of partnership, and many believe that in
exchange for cooperation, the Inkhata Party's leader, Chief
Mangosutho Buthelezi, has been offered the deputy presidency if, as
expected, the ANC once again wins the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Nkabinde and his party remained a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nkabinde was not popular with the ANC, Mandela issued a
statement Saturday saying that ``the government would leave no
stone unturned'' in search of his killers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Nkabinde was gunned down by several
assailants shortly before 8 a.m. as he left the Bridgeway
Supermarket, accompanied by his bodyguard and his bodyguard's
mother, both of whom were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they recovered more than 60 shell casings
from the scene. Nkabinde's car, a silver BMW, had 33 bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, the head of his party, Bantu Holomisa, had arrived
in Richmond and condemned the shooting as ``barbaric.'' He said
there could be no doubt that the killing was politically motivated,
but did not speculate who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   A car apparently used by the assailants was found about 20
minutes after the shooting, parked in Richmond's cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Around Richmond, the mood was tense as many residents waited to
see whether there would be further killings. In 1997, shortly after
Nkabinde was expelled from the ANC, murders were so frequent that
the government sent in the army to patrol the area.
</P>
<P>
   When Nkabinde was arrested, things quieted down. But after his
release, more violence followed. Finally, the government
transferred all local police officers from Richmond, in an effort
to stop what officials believed was police complicity with
Nkabinde.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there has been little violence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, police set up roadblocks on the roads approaching
Richmond and were stopping and searching all cars, while army
helicopters hovered over the area.
</P>
<P>
   The United Democratic Movement was founded by Holomisa, who was
himself expelled from the ANC for insubordination, and Roelf Meyer,
once a powerful figure in the largely white-supported National
Party. The party's platform includes holding a referendum on
reinstituting capital punishment and abolishing affirmative action.

SOCIAL INSECURITY IN BRAZIL FOR GOVERNMENT RETIREES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ They have been called ``privilegiados'' and
``maharajahs'' who collect lavish pensions and benefits, and
portrayed as budgetary vampires who drain the pension system and
contribute nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, millions of retired government workers across Brazil are
watching the financial crisis that is enveloping Latin America's
largest economy tear the first breaches in the social contract that
has shaped their lives. What else, they wonder, will be open to
question in the new scheme of things?
</P>
<P>
   ``You work really hard, and what is it for? Just to worry at the
end of your life?'' said Djalma da Silva Rodrigues, who worked for
the Federal Revenue Department for 38 years, many of them at the
country's borders for the customs service. ``God in heaven, what is
this? We gave everything for our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly perverse,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is financially on the ropes, with its currency plunging
in value since the government allowed it to float freely against
the dollar a week ago. Hard currency reserves are dwindling. The
Group of Seven major industrialized nations, the United States and
the International Monetary Fund have contributed to a $41.5 billion
bailout package to pull Brazil through the current turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   In return, foreigners expect Brazil to show that it can carry
out structural changes that strike at vested interests. The vote in
Congress on Wednesday night to trim welfare benefits proved it can
_ even though the markets appeared unimpressed in their reaction,
and the plunge in the currency and the flight of dollars continued
on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will raise the pension contributions of most
government workers to just under 25 percent for the highest
earners. The measures will save Brazil only $2.5 billion this year,
but the plan shatters a longstanding cultural taboo against retired
government workers' having to continue to pay into the pension
system.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, retired government workers _ 905,000 _ now outnumber
the 902,000 active civil servants. Government projections indicate
that pensions will produce a $29 billion deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
   If outsiders viewed Wednesday night's vote as a test of
commitment to sound fiscal management, retired workers watched
through a different lens.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw it as the just end to a sweet ride. Others, like
Rodrigues, were bitter and felt the government was changing the
rules not so much in the middle of the game but after it had ended
for most of them. Retirees from the private sector, who have had to
buy supplemental retirement policies to collect their pensions of
more than 1,200 reals a month, now some $750, said it was about
time.
</P>
<P>
   But for all government workers, Wednesday's vote, which is
expected to be approved by the Senate, shatters a sense of security
that had shaped the lives of public servants. The congressional
bill increases the pension contributions of civil servants and, for
the first time, requires most government retirees to pay at least
part of their pensions back into the social security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, this vote has been one of the biggest blows on the
heads of workers,'' said Claudette Alves da Silva Souza, president
of the municipal workers union of Sao Paulo, which represents
147,000 civil servants. While the congressional vote itself affects
only federal workers, Sao Paulo officials said last week they would
apply it to state and municipal workers as soon as the federal law
took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Souza said she agreed with the need for reform to balance
public accounts, but noted that the government had not struck at
more powerful vested interests, like Brazil's wealthy landowners,
the banking sector or multinationals operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Civil Service, some classes have remained
protected. The military, both retired and active workers, have so
far been exempt from the reforms affecting the rest of Brazil's
public workers, and they will not have to contribute to the pension
system. Judges and teachers are also protected from some of the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's being hit?'' Ms. Souza said. ``It's the middle class and
below that's being called upon to pay for the mistakes of a
government that implemented a disastrous policy.'' She said that
many civil servants went to work for the government at the start of
their careers because of the retirement benefits offered.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's pension system for government workers remains generous
by any standards. Retired civil servants receive their highest
salary for as long as they live, and after retirement they continue
to collect any salary increases their union negotiates, as if they
were still working.
</P>
<P>
   Pensioners today say that is a legacy of Brazil's decades of
hyperinflation _ the dizzying price rises that were halted by
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 1994 Real Plan, which for
almost the first time in workers' memory gave them a currency and
stability they could count on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Henrique Carlos Goncalves, 50, retired two years ago after
working for 37 years, 22 of them for the city of Sao Paulo. Now he
works in private practice, but still pockets a monthly pension of
1,500 reals. He expects to lose about 150 reals of that because of
Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   But he argues that governments at all levels in Brazil have used
pension funds as political purses, and he says that is what has
bankrupted the system. ``That still persists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To many private-sector workers, like Levy Kauffman, a former
vice president of the telephone company, it was high time for
Brazil's governing class to abandon its privileges. Watching the
congressmen who supported the government reform speak above the din
of opposition critics, he said, ``We're at a stage in Brazil where
a minority that's organized controls a majority that's
disorganized.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman, 75, nodded as he watched Roberto Jefferson, a
congressman from Rio de Janeiro, defend the social security reforms
as necessary for Brazil's solvency. ``For each real the public
servant puts into the pension system, the government puts in 10,''
Jefferson intoned. ``And there's no actuarial table in the world
that can make sense of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Kauffman said, as if at last hearing somebody who
spoke his language.
</P>
<P>
   Even some civil servants, like Jose Cruz, a retiree from the
Federal Revenue Service, did not dispute that pensioners should
finally make some contribution. Cruz is a regular at the ``Retired
Persons' Room,'' a lounge the ministry sets aside for former
workers on the top floor of the Federal Revenue Service tower here.
</P>
<P>
   As he heard Rodrigues criticize the congressional reforms, Cruz,
80, shook his head. Because he collects more than 3,000 reals a
month, he will contribute under the new system, cutting his income
to the tune of some 750 reals a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bleeding is more or less reasonable,'' Cruz said, ``but
when you mess with people's pockets, nobody likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the prospect of the money, it was perhaps the sense
that other Brazilians were looking at him as a kind of freeloader
that wounded Cruz the most. ``They say we didn't contribute
anything,'' he said, ``but nobody in the world retires without
having given something.''

   Shaun, still looking wide-eyed, doesn't make a sound as his
parents whisk him up and put him on a ``buddy seat'' in the
barber's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk starts talking to Shaun in a softer voice than usual,
offers the child candy as a sweet distraction and begins to comb
his baby-fine hair.
</P>
<P>
   As the protective cape goes on, Shaun begins to laugh and Kirk
begins to snip away at his dark locks.
</P>
<P>
   During this process, Shaun sits rather patiently for a young
child, but as his tiny curls fall around him, he is constantly
trying to follow Kirk's scissors.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of minutes, Shaun goes from looking like a baby to a
young man.
</P>
<P>
   A first haircut is a special event in a child's life, and their
parents', too.
</P>
<P>
   Some children laugh, others cry. Some get scared, others won't
sit still.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents race to scoop up the first lock of the child's hair
for the baby book. Others take photos of the big event. Some just
sit nearby and watch anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people compare the first trip to the beauty shop to the
first trip to the dentist, and it shouldn't be,'' said Brenda
Fields, director of administration at Vogue College of Cosmetology.
``There's nothing painful about it (the haircut).''
</P>
<P>
   The age at which children should get their first haircut really
depends on the hair of the individual child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how fast their hair grows,'' Fields said. ``
It's a good idea to get their haircut at about 1 to 1 1/2 years to
trim the ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said this even applies to children with fine, thin hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner you cut that thin hair, the thicker it will grow in
and it will look better, too,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   But some children have their hair cut out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be brushed anymore in the back,'' Zorida Dysinger,
Shaun's mother, said before her son had his hair cut. ``It just
gets too tangled.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk tells more humourous tales of why fathers opt to get their
sons' hair cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mamas like the curls in their kid's hair and they don't
want to cut it,'' Kirk said. ``But the first time a daddy has his
son out and someone mistakes him for a girl, that's it. They come
to me and say, `He needs a young man's haircut, please.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Fields believes the trip to the stylist has more to do with
the ``real'' first haircut the child got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first haircut kids get is usually when they cut their own
hair; that's why parents take them to us,'' Fields said. ``We also
see kids after their parents have tried to give them a trim. I
advise against anyone cutting their own hair or their child's hair.
Unless you've had a lot of practice, you're not going to get the
kind of cut you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields has been cutting hair for 18 years and Kirk has been at
it for 39 years. When it comes to first haircuts, they both said
they've seen everything from children who sit perfectly still to
children who cannot be distracted long enough for the haircut. But
in all, Fields and Kirk said, most of the children were just a
little scared and uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a first haircut we make sure the child is comfortable,''
Fields said. ``We take it slow and cut tiny amounts at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Eskew, manager of Head Shapers, said the child's comfort
level is the main concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the first haircut) can be really trying for the child,''
Eskew said. ``We won't cut hair when they're crying.''
</P>
<P>
   A safety must for the child, the parents and the stylist is that
the child sit still.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably more dangerous for the hairdresser than the
little one,'' Fields said. ``I've cut myself so many times because
they won't sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew suggests help from the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, both parents will come in with the child,''
Eskew said. ``One will hold them while the other one gets the
child's attention. Just whatever it takes to get them to be
still.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are also encouraged to treat this first haircut as a
significant occasion. Don't squeeze it in between trips to the
grocery store and picking up dry cleaning. Take pictures and make
sure you get that first lock snipped off of Junior's head.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops like Town &AMP; Country Barber Shop and Head Shapers give
out ``Official First Haircut'' certificates to preserve the moment
for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the first cut depends on the barber or stylist. Kirk
charges the same amount as an adult cut, $8. Eskew said normally a
child's cut runs $12.50 at her shop.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should tell the child in advance about going to get a
first haircut to prepare them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a stylist or a barber, let the child go with you
in advance,'' Eskew said. ``It makes them more comfortable with the
stylist when it's (the child's) turn.

 &HT;    Martin Luther King III climbs own mountaintop
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He was only 5 when his father, Martin Luther
King Jr., gave the ``I Have a Dream'' speech in Washington, D.C. He
was 10 when his father was shot to death in Memphis, Tenn., in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, who will speak in Austin this evening,
has carried the weight of his father's legacy on his broad
shoulders ever since. Like other children of martyred icons of the
1960s, King, 41, has struggled with his role as the oldest son of
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But King's prominent role in this year's Martin Luther King Jr.
Day celebrations and his new post as president of the organization
his father co-founded, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, show that he may be coming into his own.
</P>
<P>
   King, who lives in Atlanta, also is national chairman for the
Kindness and Justice Challenge, which encourages children to
perform acts of kindness and justice to honor Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday. He has traveled extensively to promote the
challenge, doing an ``excellent'' job relating to schoolchildren
and their parents, said Matt Heyd, project director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a terrific spokesperson for that effort,'' Heyd said.
``They really admire what Mr. King stands for, (that) . . .
everybody can be great because anybody can serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Carroll, one of the organizers of the gala where King will
speak tonight at the Omni Southpark Hotel, said King has a
back-to-the-basics message that she thinks will be well-received.
</P>
<P>
   King says ``we need to reshape our priorities in regards to
children and family,'' Carroll said. ``Let's get involved with our
children. Let's look at them as our future.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who has two sisters and one brother, grew up in Atlanta
and graduated from Morehouse College. For many years, public
speaking has been his main profession.
</P>
<P>
   He was a commissioner of Fulton County, which includes Atlanta,
from 1987 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the board of directors of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference appointed him president. The organization
promotes voter registration and civil rights and campaigns against
racism and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has had a low profile recently, and observers
are hoping that King can reinvigorate the group.
</P>
<P>
   King publicly committed the leadership conference to a broad
agenda of uniting African-Americans around common goals at the
group's annual convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is to expand our efforts toward the education and
empowerment of our youth, the economic empowerment of our community
and the advancement of nonviolent conflict resolution for our
society,'' King said in a July article in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. ``We need the experience and wisdom of the
old coupled with the energy and talent of the young. We are all in
this together.''

 &HT;    Thermometers test food for doneness, safety
 &HT;    WITH ART, RECIPES at end of file
 &HT;    By Kevin Tankersley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If one were to visit a restaurant kitchen, one
likely would see a thermometer dial peeking out of the top of the
chest pocket on the chef's white jacket. No, the chef isn't sick
and keeping track of his or her own temperature, but using that
thermometer to check the doneness of food being served to the
restaurant patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three key reasons to using a thermometer,'' said
Jill Gully, a cooking coach at H-E-B's Cooking Connection, pointing
to a sign displayed in the store's meat department: It eliminates
the guesswork on whether food has cooked long enough; it prevents
overcooking; and helps ensure food safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all important'' reasons, Gully said. Plus, besides
assuring food is cooked properly, thermometer use also can save the
consumer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minimal investment,'' Gully said of the simple dial
thermometer, which sells for about $6. ``If you've got a couple of
pounds of ribeyes and burn them, that's more than the cost of the
thermometer.''
</P>
<P>
   A digital thermometer sells for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   Using a food thermometer is simple, Gully said. Take the
temperature of the meat near the end of the cooking time. When
cooking large items such as roasts, chickens or turkeys, simply
insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, making
sure the tip of the thermometer does not come in contact with bone
or large pockets of fat. Wait 10 to 15 seconds and the internal
temperature of the meat will be displayed on the dial or digital
readout.
</P>
<P>
   The thermometer must be inserted into the meat at least 1 1/2 to
two inches to work properly, Gully said. For thinner cuts of meat,
such as steaks or hamburger patties, the thermometer can be
inserted from the side. A patty or steak can be lifted with a
spatula or tongs to avoid hands being burned from the frying pan or
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Gully said determining the exact time meat is cooked through
contributes to how good it will taste when served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beef is 72 percent water,'' she said. ``The longer you cook
it, the more the water evaporates. The (proper) temperature will
tell you when it's safe but still maintaining the maximum moisture
and juiciness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gully said a thermometer comes in handy in other areas of
cooking as well. It can tell a bread baker when water is at the
proper temperature to add yeast, or let a cook know when leftovers
are reheated to a safe degree, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics show that only 5 percent of all households possess
a meat thermometer,'' Gully said, ``and only 2 percent use them on
a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are few recipes where a thermometer can come in handy:
</P>
<P>
   CAJUN GARLIC PORK ROAST
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 pound boneless pork loin roast
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon seasoned salt

<P>
   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Blend all seasonings well and rub
mixture over all surfaces of pork loin. Place pork in shallow
roasting pan and roast until meat thermometer inserted in roast
registers 155 to 160 degrees, about 60 to 90 minutes. Remove pork
from oven; let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings, each with 163 calories, 24 grams protein, 7
grams fat, 195 milligrams sodium, 66 milligrams cholesterol.

</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, mix well all seasonings and vegetable oil. Rub
mixture over all surfaces of tenderloins. Cover and refrigerate
from 2 to 24 hours. Grill over medium-hot coals, turning
occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until thermometer inserted
reads 155 to 160 degrees. Pork is done when there is still a hint
of pink in the center. Slice to serve.

   ROASTED SIRLOIN WITH RED PEPPER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   1 boneless beef top sirloin steak 3 pounds), cut 2 inches thick
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried or fresh rosemary leaves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Pepper Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2 medium red bell peppers (a 7-ounce jar of roasted red peppers
may be substituted)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Prepare peppers by broiling 3 to 4 inches from heat on a baking

charred skin from peppers and remove seeds. Preheat oven to 350
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To make sauce, blend peppers, vinegar and salt in blender using
pulse switch until coarsely chopped. Press rosemary into both sides
of sirloin steak. Roast on rack in a shallow roasting pan in oven
for 50 to 60 minutes or 16 to 20 minutes per pound. Remove roast
when a meat thermometer inserted in center reaches 135 degrees for
medium-rare or 150 degrees for medium doneness. Let roast stand 10
minutes before carving into thin slices. Serve sliced beef with red
pepper sauce. Sauce may be served at room temperature or heated.
Sauce yields 1 cup. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipes from Texas Beef Council (www.txbeef.org) TESTING THE
TEMP
</P>
<P>
   A thermometer should be inserted into food just prior to the end
of the recommended cooking time. Insert the thermometer into the
thickest part of the meat, being careful not to touch bone or fat.
For a whole chicken or turkey, the thermometer should be placed in
the thickest part of the thigh or breast.
</P>
<P>
   The thermometer should be inserted 1 1/2 to two inches; if
testing temperature on a thinner steak or patty, insert from the
side. Wait 10 to 15 seconds for the temperature to register on the
thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   For roast, steaks or chops, the temperature should read about
130 degrees for a rare piece of meat; 140 degrees for medium-rare;
150 for medium; or 160 for well done.
</P>
<P>
   For ground been patties, meat balls or meat loaf, the
temperature needs to be 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   A fully-cooked ham should be reheated to 140 degrees, while a
fresh ham needs to be cooked to 155 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   A whole turkey or chicken needs to reach 180 degrees in the
thigh or 170 degrees in the breast. If the bird is stuffed, the
stuffing must reach a temperature of 165 degrees. Poultry parts and
ground poultry should also be cooked to 165 degrees.

 &HT;    Few simple additions can turn bedroom into inviting cold-weather
haven
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If recent chilly nights had you shivering under
your covers, perhaps it's time to winterize your bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   One solution way to winterize your bedroom for enjoyable warmth
is to sleep under a down comforter.
</P>
<P>
   Down is the fluffy, delicate undercoating of a goose. It is one
of nature's best insulators because it retains the body's natural
warmth while allowing air to flow through and moisture to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Sears Home Fashions sales manager Jane Hagy said down can
actually be used any time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down is a year-round covering because it breathes,'' Hagy
said. ``I grew up in Minnesota, where we kept our down comforters
on the bed throughout the year. I still leave mine on all
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for down comforters, Hagy said to look at the
ounce weight. The more ounce weight a comforter has, the more
``fluff'' it will have.
</P>
<P>
   She also said to look for a box stitch because this will help
ensure the longevity of the comforter. Box stitching holds the down
in place for an even distribution of warmth and ease of
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Box stitch comforters also better serve a wider range of
climates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should last a long, long time because all you have to do
is fluff them up,'' Hagy said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagy said most down comforters only come in white because they
are usually covered with a duvet to provide color and to help keep
them clean.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to winterize your bedroom is with flannel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold a lot (of flannel sheets). In fact, we don't have
many left,'' said Margaret Barrientos at Kmart department lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos said the biggest sellers this season have been from
the Martha Stewart Collection in colors such as burgundy, hunter
green and navy. She recommended going with a brand name you trust
when buying flannel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for the name brand because some of the other ones aren't
worth it,'' Barrientos said.
</P>
<P>
   Flannel sheets get softer with time. The more you wash and dry
them, the cozier they get.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping on a featherbed also can winterize your bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Featherbeds have been popular in Europe for years, and now they
are appearing in more American bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are buying them for the comfort, softness and
the feel,'' said Kathy Schmedthorst, Dillard's manager of home
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Schmedthorst said the featherbeds are placed on top of a
person's mattress and can be slept on directly. Also, both the
mattress and the featherbed can be covered with a flat sheet
because most fitted sheets will not go over both.
</P>
<P>
   Schmedthorst suggested the latter because the quills of the
feathers tend to stick out on an exposed featherbed.
</P>
<P>
   The featherbed might not be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allergies can prevent you from sleeping on a featherbed,''
Schmedthorst said. ``But they are very comfortable. They're like
being all snuggled up and are really neat to sleep on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmedthorst also said sleeping on a large feather or down
pillow can add to the comfort level of your bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Down pillows are praised for their ability to permit the head
and neck to locate their natural resting position, and feathers are
valued for their ability to supply sleepers with comfort and
support for a lesser cost.
</P>
<P>
   Feather pillows are usually made with at least 50 percent
feathers, with the rest consisting of down.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a feather or down pillow, keep this in mind: Soft
pillows are for those who sleep on their stomach, medium pillows
are for those who sleep on their back and firm pillows are for
those who sleep on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswomen from Dillard's, Kmart and Sears said other
popular winter bedroom fashions included electric blankets,
electric mattress pads, heated throws and woven throws.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, being comfortable is the key. If your bedroom is too
hot or too cold, your sleep time can be fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room itself has to be kept comfortable for you, but
everyone's level of comfort is different,'' said Dr. Robert
Springer, director of the Southwest Sleep Center.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, these bedroom fashions could make the
difference in you and your mate fighting over the thermostat all
night.

 &HT;    Details of habeas corpus rule
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clarence Gideon was charged with breaking into a
poolroom, a felony. He didn't have the money for an attorney, so he
asked the court to appoint one.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused, so he represented himself and was convicted.
From his Florida prison cell, Gideon filed a handwritten petition
for habeas corpus. The Latin phrase, meaning ``you have the body,''
is the name of a legal principle that demands that the government
bring to court a person (i.e., ``the body'') it has in custody so a
judge can decide whether the prisoner is being legally held.
</P>
<P>
   Habeas corpus predates the Magna Carta and is embedded in both
the U.S. and Georgia Constitutions. Its right can be suspended only
when the nation is threatened, such as in cases of invasion or
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In Gideon's case, he said his constitutional rights had been
abridged because he had not had proper representation at trial. His
appeal resulted in the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling,
Gideon vs. Wainwright, requiring states to appoint counsel to
represent indigent defendants charged with serious state offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court has required
states to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in misdemeanor
cases that could result in jail time and for defendants pursuing
direct appeals of their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal that
claimed the U.S. Constitution required appointed lawyers for
indigents in their state habeas petitions. Exzavious Gibson's case
before the Georgia Supreme Court claims that right is in the
Georgia Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indigent death row inmates get appointed lawyers when they
pursue their habeas claims through the federal courts because
Congress, in 1986, passed legislation ordering it.
</P>
<P>
   Death-row habeas corpus petitions typically make one or more of
these types of challenges:
</P>
<P>
   _ The performance of the lawyer who represented the defendant at
trial was so deficient that an adequate performance could have
resulted in a different outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   _ An investigation of the prosecutor's case reveals that
important evidence favorable to the defendant _ such as bias on the
part of a witness, or a plea deal that may have influenced the
witness' testimony _ had been suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is information that shows possible misconduct by jurors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The trial was tainted by an unconstitutional bias, such as the
composition of the jury that imposed the sentence or the grand jury
that brought the indictment.

 &HT;    Habeas corpus in death row cases a `minefield'
 &HT;    WITH sidebar DEATHROW-HABEAS
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is no doubt that Exzavious Lee Gibson killed
Douglas Coley in the winter of 1990. He stabbed the Eastman grocer
39 times and left him to die face down in a pool of blood behind
the counter of the family store.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the slaying, police found Gibson in his
grandmother's home, hiding in a closet. Coley's wallet and
blood-stained money were found stuffed under Gibson's bed. An hour
later, the 17-year-old gave police a videotaped confession.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge County prosecutors sought the death penalty against Gibson
and, after a four-day trial, a jury sentenced him to die in
Georgia's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   While Gibson's case appears fairly straightforward, it has
become anything but. After Gibson's direct appeals were denied, he
filed a petition for habeas corpus, a civil lawsuit routinely filed
by death row inmates that challenges the legality of a conviction
and sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Gibson, who has an IQ of 76, became the first
condemned inmate in the modern history of the death penalty who was
forced to proceed with his habeas hearing without a lawyer. A
transcript of the proceeding showed Gibson clearly had little idea
of what was going on before him, at one point even telling the
judge he did not know how to plead in a proceeding that did not
require it.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson offered no evidence, asked no questions and raised no
claims. His petition was dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   After having no lawyer at all, Gibson is now represented by
Atlanta's most prestigious law firm, which is asking the Georgia
Supreme Court to make it a constitutional right for death row
inmates to have state-funded counsel in their post-conviction
proceedings. Georgia is one of only two states in the country with
the death penalty that does not provide lawyers at this stage.
Wyoming is the other and it has no prisoners on death row.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Supreme Court does not appear eager to hear Gibson's
case. King &AMP; Spalding lawyers filed Gibson's petition before the
court in May 1997; the 20-month wait is an extraordinary lag time
in a court known for its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The case raises issues that affect the rights of all death row
inmates and could pose thorny policy questions for state lawmakers:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Georgia Supreme Court ultimately decides to hear
Gibson's appeal and agrees that condemned prisoners have a right to
counsel during habeas proceedings, who will pay for the appointed
lawyers and how much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   _ If death row inmates have a right to counsel, why not a
prisoner facing a sentence of life without parole?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not an inmate sentenced to five years for burglary?
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 40 percent of all death sentences nationwide are
overturned on appeal, many through habeas corpus petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's court appearance may have cost him his best chance of
obtaining relief in court. Because all death penalty appeals
involve horrible killings and rarely involve a question of whether
the defendant committed the crime, appellate courts scrutinize
whether the death sentence was properly and constitutionally
imposed. Gibson, only 17 at the time of the killing, was a drug
addict with diminished mental abilities. His trial lawyer's closing
arguments in which he pleaded for Gibson's life lasted only a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty, almost 500 people have been executed. More than 3,500
people now sit on death rows in 38 states _ including 121 in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 75 people have been freed from death row after
evidence showed they were wrongly convicted, according to the
Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   These freed prisoners surely benefited from having competent
counsel, said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely unconscionable that in a country that has
over a million lawyers, a person would stand alone at the bar of
justice facing the death penalty,'' Bright said of Gibson's case.
``There's no excuse for it, and there are so many people on death
row now in Georgia that if something is not done, this is going to
happen again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, most habeas petitions for death row inmates
have been handled by a state and federally funded resource center.
But the center has just two lawyers and one investigator, and its
caseload is so overwhelmed that Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice
Robert Benham has asked Georgia law firms to take on death row
habeas cases for free. Benham's plea attracted many volunteers, but
not enough to represent Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Anderson, president of the American Bar Association, said
the Georgia Supreme Court should hear Gibson's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A society that takes life as a punishment must take all
necessary steps to ensure that the person whose life was taken
received due process of law,'' Anderson, an Arkansas attorney, said
in a recent interview. ``That means representation of counsel
through every step of the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing details of Gibson's crime, Anderson said the case
presents grisly facts that make it ``extremely difficult'' for any
court to have to decide such an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it points up the importance of everyone in our society
receiving due process, especially people on the fringes of society,
especially the most despised members of society,'' he said. ``If
constitutional rights can be taken from these people, they can be
taken from anyone, even you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oconee circuit District Attorney Timothy Vaughn, who prosecuted
Gibson's case, said Gibson has had enough access to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a difficult issue,'' he said. ``But with more
lawyers, the state and counties will have to pay for them, and the
cases will go on and on and on. The cases will become so
financially burdensome that nobody seeks the death penalty
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Thurbert Baker said the Georgia
Constitution includes no right for state-funded lawyers in habeas
proceedings, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled there is
no federal right for it as well. ``This is going to be a matter for
the Legislature to take up, if it chooses to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Mississippi Supreme Court heard a challenge
similar to Gibson's by a death row inmate convicted of killing four
nieces and nephews. It ruled that the due process clause of its
state constitution requires death row inmates to have state-paid
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigent death row inmates are simply not able, on their own,
to competently engage in this type of litigation,'' the court ruled
in the 7-2 decision.
</P>
<P>
   In motions before the Georgia Supreme Court, Gibson's lead
attorney, Joseph Bankoff, a King &AMP; Spalding partner who specializes
in commercial litigation, called Gibson's habeas hearing ``one of
the most unfair and one-sided evidentiary hearings conducted in
this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankoff said King &AMP; Spalding took on Gibson's case for free
after being presented with the record by two of the firm's younger
associates, Christian Genetski and Courtland Reichman.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading the record of the trial court, I was offended in
the same way they were by what we read and what we saw had
happened,'' Bankoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Bankoff noted that five months after Gibson's
hearing, Paige Whitaker, a state attorney who specializes in death
penalty cases, prepared a 49-page order denying Gibson's petition
and mailed it to the judge who presided over Gibson's hearing. The
judge, Carlisle Overstreet of the Augusta circuit, signed
Whitaker's proposed order without change.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, habeas corpus litigation in death penalty cases
has become one of the most complex of legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   John Godbold, former chief judge of the federal appeals court in
Atlanta, has said that ``the average trial lawyer, no matter what
his or her expertise, doesn't know any more about habeas than he
does about atomic energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strict rules require death row inmates to raise all their habeas
claims initially in the state courts. If the claims are not raised
at this time, they are considered to be defaulted when the inmate
takes his case to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Indigent death row inmates have neither the freedom, legal
resources nor the legal skills to master this process, a group of
prominent Atlanta lawyers have told the state Supreme Court. In a
friend-of-the-court brief, the lawyers _ Emmet Bondurant, C.B.
Rogers, Conley Ingram and Miles Alexander _ said denying inmates
counsel in these proceedings has the same effect as abolishing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habeas corpus is a minefield,'' said Atlanta lawyer Jack
Martin, an expert in death penalty litigation. ``The slightest
little misstep causes even the most valid constitutional claims to
be lost for good. The law shouldn't be a game, but that's what it
is. It only shows how essential it is for them to have a lawyer.''

SENATORS SEEK END TO TRIAL, BUT DIVIDE ON BEST COURSE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the trial of President Clinton moving into an
unscripted period of critical votes, an increasingly restless
Senate is searching anxiously for a way to bring the impeachment
proceedings to a swift conclusion. But on Saturday the parties
appeared sharply divided over how to do this.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, after two weeks of passionate opening arguments by
House prosecutors and the White House, that the Senate still lacks
the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats would like to end the trial now, either by
supporting a motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the
case or by voting against calling witnesses, which would pave the
way for a final vote on the articles of impeachment. Such motions
are to be considered this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could argue this until hell freezes over and the end result
would be the same,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday morning, senior Republicans said they would oppose
the Democratic effort to dismiss the case and they signaled that
would be a party position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it sets a constitutional precedent that doesn't make
any sense,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority whip.
``Every single impeachment trial in the history of the United
States Senate has had a resolution by voting up or down on the
articles.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp words against Byrd's motion reflected the fact that
the Republicans, their caucus divided, face a far more difficult
and risky political calculation than the Democrats, even though
they, too, would like the trial to end relatively swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public-approval ratings soared after his State of the
Union address and the public remains overwhelmingly opposed to his
removal from office. Conservatives, however, who make up the
Republicans' base, are already rebelling against an early end to
the trial. And many Senate Republicans are loath to sharply
repudiate the House Republicans who pushed through the two articles
of impeachment on a near party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting this tug and pull, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a
conservative, said, ``I don't feel the need to have witnesses,''
but quickly added, ``The House, as of now, has given us every
reason to believe they're going to ask for witnesses, so this is
not about me.'' He said ``impartial justice'' required that if the
House prosecutors wanted to depose witnesses, then ``within
limits'' they should be allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, by contrast, have become less certain about
the merits of deposing Monica Lewinsky or Clinton's secretary,
Betty Currie, or his confidant, Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I think the House is going to have to make its case,''
said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who just a week ago was openly
leaning toward calling witnesses. ``If they can make a case for
witnesses, I'll vote for them, but it has to be a strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing those conflicting sentiments, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott is looking for a way to have only a handful of witnesses
deposed in private and to stringently control the length and scope
of the questioning so that the trial could end in February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The leader's intention is to have this not go beyond
mid-February,'' said John Czwartacki, his spokesman. Such a plan
would give a bow to the House managers' insistence on witnesses but
leave the end of the trial in sight.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from clear whether senators would really be able
to control the process if they voted to allow depositions of
witnesses behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are envisioning perhaps a week of taking
depositions. But David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, told the
Senate on Friday that if witnesses are summoned for deposition, the
White House would want to call witnesses itself, cross-examine
witnesses and subpoena documents for discovery. ``I think you are
looking realistically at a process of many months to have a fair
discovery process,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats looked far less likely Saturday to help negotiate time
limits because they were infuriated by the House managers' surprise
request to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr _ even before the
Senate vote on whether to call witnesses _ to force Ms. Lewinsky to
testify before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous thing,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
``To take that desperate act, all I can think of is, they are
losing it. It is mindboggling, absolutely mindboggling, this
arrogant disregard of the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to end the trial is for six or more Republicans to
bolt and vote with the Democrats this week to block witnesses. (In
the case of a 50-50 tie, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist can
cast the decisive vote if he chooses.)
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's decision to sponsor the motion to dismiss the case
signaled that the 45 Democrats will have a nearly united front to
end the trial, since Byrd, the Senate's constitutionalist, had once
said he might consider voting for Clinton's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Republicans say, Lott is not trying to hold anyone to a
party position on witnesses, giving Republicans maneuvering room on
this issue. ``Nobody's going around saying, `You ought to do this,
you ought to do that,''' said one influential Republican senator.
``There's a general feeling we don't want to give the back of our
hand to the House. Other than that, there's broad latitude to do
what you damn well please.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas are also floating about as informal discussions go
on inside the parties and across party lines. But an agreement on
how to end the trial could still prove elusive. ``There's a
majority to end the case but not a majority for any individual
motion to achieve that objective,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, for instance, opposes a vote on articles of
impeachment and wants to dismiss the case outright because that
would discredit the House's vote to impeach . ``We're now arguing
about history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans insist that they have an actual vote on the
articles so they can say they followed the trial through to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has suggested that after witnesses are
deposed, if it is ``absolutely guaranteed'' there are not 67 votes
to convict the president, the Senate could recognize the House
impeachment as ``the highest vote of condemnation and of censure''
and vote to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch's proposal has drawn fire from Republicans, who want a
vote on conviction, and Democrats, who fear that adjournment would
leave the charges pending against Clinton and leave him never fully
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   With the questioning of House prosecutors and White House
defense lawyers set to wrap up Saturday, the next few days will
give senators long hours to negotiate. ``This procedure forces us
to interact a lot,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said wryly,
``because we are all around in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial rules, beginning Monday, the Senate will be in
session but veering between public forums and closed discussions,
unless Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., win a
bid to make all trial deliberations public. Such a rules change
would take 67 votes to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule calls for the White House and House prosecutors
each to get one hour for public debate on the effort to dismiss the
case. At that point, when Harkin and Wellstone make their motion to
open the proceedings, that must be debated in secret _ for up to 16
hours. The vote would be held in public and if their move fails,
the Senate would go back into closed session so that the lawmakers
can deliberate in private _ for up to 16 hours _ on whether to end
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Senate would move on to the motion to depose
witnesses. For this the House managers and White House would have
three hours each to debate for and against the proposal in public
session. But the debate by the senators would once again take place
in a closed session and could last up to 16 hours. At that point
the back-to-back votes on whether to dismiss the case and whether
to call witnesses would take place in public.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such a prospect this week, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
said the mood in the Senate was ``like a two-week root canal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The dance floor shakes as dozens of couples
wiggle to the blaring music, while others snuggle with glasses of
Korean whiskey _ bought by the bottle _ on the soft blue couches of
the upscale Basquia nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The club oozes wealth, from the replicas of Greek statues to the
$100 entrance fee, which includes five beers and a plate of fruit.
The waiters move around swiftly with drinks and, as part of the
club's appeal, will even introduce single men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Basquia is hardly representative of Seoul, and even here where
Korea's rich young professionals mingle and drink whiskey,
consumption is down and attendance is lower than in the good old
days just 16 months ago. But in a country that has endured a
nightmare of economic crisis and bankruptcies, what is most
striking is that Basquia is still thriving.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the pulsating beat in the club is an apt symbol
for all of South Korea, for these days the national mood is
shifting from bleak to buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more than a year after South Korea had to accept a
humiliating bailout from the International Monetary Fund, it is
showing signs of crawling back from the abyss. Unemployment rates
are still rising, and the economic misery is widespread, but there
is a growing conviction that South Korea has already bottomed out
and may now help lead the way for Asia out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists are even forecasting up to 2 percent growth for
this year, dismal by recent Korean standards but a giant leap from
the 6 percent contraction for 1998. And rating agencies are
beginning to upgrade Korea's sovereign risk rating from junk-bond
status back to investment grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and business executives are getting excited that South
Korea may finally be embracing the deep restructuring that could
redefine the economic landscape. Another cause for optimism is that
Korea has repaid $2.8 billion to the International Monetary Fund in
the last few weeks, a milestone on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since President Kim Dae-jung threw open the doors
to foreign investment, Westerners have been pouring money into this
country at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's moving ahead more quickly than we had anticipated
earlier,'' John Dodsworth, senior resident representative for the
International Monetary Fund in Seoul, said of the Korean economy.
``There's a lot of optimistic sentiment out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodsworth and other economists say, though, that it will take
years to restructure South Korea's economy _ and others in Asia _
and build a new base for long-term growth. The broadest challenge
is not simply to carry out the IMF conditions but rather to nurture
markets from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just a restructuring of business or industry,'' said
Oh Ho-gen, executive chairman of the banking industry's Corporate
Restructuring Committee. ``Restructuring is a misleading term. It's
redefining our economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that a real sustained recovery is still going
to take a while. And as this country enters its second winter of
economic hardship, it is likely that more Koreans will lose their
jobs and tumble into the government's strengthening but still
skimpy safety net. Now the most immediate challenge to the
presidency of Kim Dae-jung, the task that will define his legacy,
is the reshaping of Korea Inc.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Kim has been engaging in a shoving match with the
top Korean conglomerates, known as chaebol. The chaebol have long
dominated the economy and enjoyed close ties to the government, in
the kind of crony capitalism that helped bring the economy to its
knees last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kim is trying to cut them loose and force them to slim
down. He has ordered them to restructure, reduce debt levels, stop
guaranteeing debts of affiliates, and focus themselves on key
businesses while getting rid of unrelated ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, he stakes the success of his presidency, among
other things, on reforming the chaebol system,'' said You
Jong-keun, economic adviser to Kim and governor of North Cholla
province. ``He would consider a failure to reform the chaebol
system as a failure of his economic reform program.'' The chaebol,
which are awash in a sea of debt, have been resisting the radical
changes that are needed to improve efficiency and revive the many
areas of the economy they dominate. The biggest test so far has
been an arrangement, called the ``Big Deal,'' in which the
government is essentially forcing the top five chaebol to swap
businesses; Samsung Group agreed with little enthusiasm to turn
over its fledgling car-manufacturing affiliate to Daewoo Group,
which is much stronger in that area. Daewoo Group will in turn hand
over its ailing electronics unit to Samsung, whose strength lies
there.
</P>
<P>
   LG Group also capitulated and agreed to turn over its
computer-chip-making unit to Hyundai Group in a multibillion-dollar
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is also with great reluctance that the top five chaebol are
inching toward overhauling their empires under the government's
direction _ but this is progress compared with just several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a sea change in Korea, even though there's a long
way to go,'' said Henry van Dyke, who travels frequently to Korea
as head of mergers and acquisitions in the region at Morgan Stanley
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Samsung and Daewoo, for instance, staged protests in
mid-December to block the commercial exchange, and the other
business swaps have met with some resistance as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising, for the biggest losers of the Big Deal
will be the workers. About 170,000 employees at the top five
chaebol are expected to lose their jobs this year, according to the
Tripartite Commission, made up of representatives of government,
business and labor unions to mediate labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   They will be a significant addition to the 1.6 million Koreans
who are already jobless. Layoffs have become an explosive issue in
Korea, where many workers once thought they had lifetime
employment. Last year, after tense, protracted bargaining with the
labor unions, the banks dismissed 39,000 people, about 10 percent
of the nation's entire pool of bankers.
</P>
<P>
   And unemployment, which averaged 7 percent last year, is still
soaring. The government expects the number of unemployed to jump to
2 million, and economists say that figure is probably understated.
</P>
<P>
   At the prodding of the International Monetary Fund, the
government used 10 trillion won, or $8.5 billion, last year to
widen the social safety net, and more money will be spent this
year. A year ago, only workers dismissed from larger companies were
eligible for the government dole for three months, but now the
government says that all employees who lose their jobs can get
benefits for half a year.

   w/POPE _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Midwest as the American
Catholic Church and its 61 million members struggle harder than
ever to evangelize Generation Y and to hold on to young people who
have grown up in the church but drifted. Priest shortages are
rampant and the number choosing religious life dwindles. Crowds of
youth will come to see the pope, but dismiss his moral mandates. As
the aged pope nears the end of his papacy, the future of the church
lies in their hands. Will they accept church law which Jean Paul
has declared ``immutable'' on issues such as celibacy of priests,
birth control, abortion, homosexuality, and women in the pulpit? A

schoolgirl, she had a recurrent dream: should she kill her father
after a wall poster declared him to be a ``criminal''? It was 1957,
and Chen's father had just been denounced by Mao's communists as a
``bourgeois rightist.'' A respected Chinese journalist with proven
communist revolutionary credentials, he was shipped off to one of
China's first forced labor camps. Now, after four decades, the
Communist Party is finally debating behind closed doors whether to

be doing everything it can to stop the spread of private
entrepreneurship on this socialist island. On Jan. 1, Cubans
celebrated the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. But
there's little to celebrate. The economy is a mess. In recent
months, the government appears to have back-peddled on economic
reforms that were so highly touted only a year ago. Spurring the
government on is economic turmoil in Asia, Brazil, and other parts
of the world, ``proof'' that capitalism doesn't work, at least
according to Castro. (Emling, Cox News Service)

the capitol's biggest business lobbies, which range from the

   DEATHROW _ ATLANTA _ As the Georgia Supreme Court opens its
January term on Monday (Jan. 25), there's one important case
pending that it apparently does not want to consider: whether to
allow death-row inmates the right to have appointed lawyers during
their post-conviction appeals. The issue is a thorny one for the
court because it doesn't want to require the Legislature to pay for
death-row lawyers, but it is also aware that about two-thirds of
all death-row convictions are ultimately reversed. And there are
dozens of former death-row inmates who have been found to be
innocent, including a couple in Georgia, and they obtained their
relief in the courts through habeas corpus petitions. Their claims
would never have gone anywhere without competent counsel to
represent them. The case before the Georgia Supreme Court involves
Exzavious Gibson, who is without a doubt guilty of stabbing
repeatedly a grocer during an armed robbery. But Gibson, who has an
IQ of 76, had to represent himself during his post-conviction
hearing, the procedure of which has been described as complicated
as any in the legal system. Georgia is one of only two states in
the country (Wyoming being the other) that does not appoint counsel
for death-row inmates filing habeas corpus petitions. (Rankin,

 SEOUL, South Korea: a year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The transition, however, has produced some sorry victims, like
Cho Il-young, who have fallen through the holes in the safety net
because they lost their jobs before the program was expanded or
because their companies were never registered. Cho, a 30-year-old
factory worker, was let go more than a year ago from a small
affiliate of Kia Motors, a car manufacturer that was one of the
first chaebol to collapse. He has not collected any benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work one day only to find that the company was
folding, but he could not bring himself to tell his wife. Instead,
he prepared for work every day, and went to the employment office
in the morning and the library in the afternoon. At the time, his
company was too small for him to receive unemployment benefits, so
he had to draw on his personal savings to pay for food and other
daily expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, he finally broke down and confessed to his
wife, who had suspected something was amiss all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my savings have almost bottomed out, but I don't
have any opportunities for new employment,'' said Cho, who cannot
receive benefits, because he is not newly unemployed. Now he is
angry because the price of ramen noodles, his staple food these
days, rose to 400 won, or 34 cents, from 330 won when the won
weakened. But prices never fell again when the won recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all different types of work,'' he said. ``But I
couldn't even break even. I couldn't even make enough money to
cover transportation costs. There's a lot of talk about the economy
rebounding, but this is true only in the statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another cloud over South Korea is political uncertainty. Not
only does it share a border with North Korea, a heavily armed
communist state that could explode or implode at any time, but Kim
is locked in a bitter confrontation with the opposition political
party, and he is supposed to give up power late this year to a
coalition partner under a deal that most analysts expect to fall
apart at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kim so far has surprised some of his critics by the
vigor with which he has moved to restructure Korea's economy and
lift it out of its worst contraction since the end of World War II.
Along with Thailand, South Korea seems eager to rip apart the seams
of the old economy and tailor itself for future growth.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of investor confidence is that the South Korean
currency, the won, has soared from its lows a year ago. Now a
dollar fetches about 1,180 won, compared with 1,600 in December
1997 and about 800 before the crisis erupted. The government
stabilized the won partly by increasing interest rates early last
year, but now interest rates have come down again.
</P>
<P>
   The falling interest rates have eased the debt burdens of many
companies. With lower rates, investors have poured their money into
the Korean stock market, which last year more than doubled, in
dollar terms, over the previous year and was the world's best
performing market in dollar terms in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thailand, the government has also moved far more quickly
than Japan and other Asian countries to fix its broken banking
system, pouring in more than 64 trillion won, or $54 billion, to
retool it. One of the reasons South Korean banks are in such bad
shape is that they lent on the basis of government instruction,
becoming ``the ATMs of the Finance Ministry,'' as William Overholt,
Asia strategist at Nomura International in Hong Kong, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea's military culture is mainly to blame'' for many of the
banking system's troubles, said Choi Gye-sung, a 54-year-old Korean
banker who took early retirement last year. ``The military culture
means giving orders, and it doesn't matter if things work out or
not,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes will take longer to change, but the fear of a collapse
of the financial system is gone. With the number of bankruptcies
declining, a measure of calm is returning to the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody believed that something worse might come before the
end of the year, like an American crisis or a credit crunch, but
that didn't happen,'' said Cho Dal Ho, chief economist at Samsung
Economic Research Institute, referring to the end of 1998. ``We
expected the bank loans would blow up, but our expectation turned
out to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Another striking initiative of Kim has been his campaign to lure
foreign investors with new tax incentives and subsidies and quicker
approvals. Attitudes in Korea Inc. have shifted from antipathy to
admiration of foreigners, and Western investors have swooped into
Korea on bargain hunts, bumping into one another as they swish in
and out of Korean company offices and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   From corporate tire-kickers to property investors to big-time
acquirers, foreign investors poured in $8.9 billion in investment
last year, more than one-third of the entire amount invested in the
previous 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year opened, the government sold off a
multibillion-dollar controlling stake in Korea First Bank to an
American consortium; this deal and all the others will bring in
Western-style management and a focus on profitability. But perhaps
the biggest spur toward profits at the top chaebol will come from
the smaller, nimbler competition.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at Daesang Corp., the top seller of monosodium
glutamate in Korea, strategic planners are thinking a bit more
about profits. Last year, Daesang sold a money-making venture in
animal feed to BASF Co., based in Germany, so that it could pay off
its debts. And it is moving out of marginal businesses as well, to
boost overall profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the days of high growth, all that mattered were
increased sales and increased market share,'' said Lee Geon-duck, a
manager in strategic planning. Immediately he began scribbling on a
sheet of paper a set of equations on profitability that have become
the mantra of the company. ``But now what really matters is the
amount of profit generated from each investment.''

WITH SWITCH IN HEIR PLAN, KING HUSSEIN STUNS JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ King Hussein of Jordan is preparing to name one
of his sons as his heir, Jordanian officials said Saturday,
culminating a dizzying week in which the king returned from six
months of cancer treatment abroad and then dismissed his brother as
crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden ouster of Crown Prince Hassan, who is 51 and had been
the king's designated heir for 34 years, has stunned even
Jordanians long used to surprises from the 63-year-old king, who
has made change in course a hallmark of his 47-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The king has not yet offered any clue as to why his brother fell
into disfavor, and he has not yet signaled which of his five sons,
by four wives, he might now elevate to the head of the line for the
Hashemite throne.
</P>
<P>
   Since the king returned on Tuesday to announce that he had
``thoughts and ideas'' about changing the line of succession,
Jordan had been buzzing with speculation and disbelief. But on
Friday, Jordanian officials said, the king made the news official
in a meeting in which he told his brother to prepare for a royal
decree that would designate a new heir.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince, who is described in an official biography as
the king's closest confidant, had run the country as regent during
all six months of his brother's absence, as he had done countless
times before.
</P>
<P>
   The king was reported by Jordanian officials to have told the
crown prince that he wanted to designate him as his deputy, albeit
with limited power, but people close to Hassan said he had taken
the news badly and might well choose to live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   According to knowledgeable Jordanians who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the leading candidates to succeed Hussein are now Prince
Abdullah, 37, the king's eldest son and an army major general in
charge of a royal security force, and Prince Hamzeh, 18, the king's
eldest son by his current wife, the American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzeh, who is now attending a course at the British military
academy in Sandhurst, England, has long been seen as the king's
favorite. He was at his father's side through much of the grueling
cancer treatment, at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, and
unconfirmed talk around the Royal Court has long suggested that
Queen Noor wanted Hamzeh to become king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, whose treatment included six rounds of chemotherapy and
the transplant of bone marrow, has pronounced himself ``fully
recovered from the cancer,'' a variety known as non-Hodgkins
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   But his latest illness was his second brush with cancer in the
last seven years, and it has robbed him of his hair, weight and
some physical vigor. For the latter reason, diplomats in the
Jordanian capital, Amman, have suggested that the king might now
find it difficult to resume a full work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They say they know of no reason to doubt that the king has been
cured, but they also have described his sudden attention to
succession as reflecting a fresh sense of mortality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither Abdullah nor Hamzeh has been given much of a public
profile in Jordan, but both are said by people who know them to
have the same charm and charisma that have helped the king to guide
Jordan through turbulent times.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hassan has found it difficult to shake an image of
being relatively aloof. Still, he has also won many admirers
through his long years as his brother's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   That has been particularly the case within the business
community, which regarded him as well-equipped to help Jordan
through economic strains. And even Jordanians who have never been
great admirers of the crown prince are shocked and confused by the
move to sideline him from the succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is any way to treat a brother,'' said a
former Jordanian official who, like most people critical of the
king, would speak only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who is one of the world's longest-serving leaders, has
a long record of surprising friends and foes, through decades of
artful swerves that included his sudden embrace in 1994 of a peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But never before has he courted so much potential discord within
his family.
</P>
<P>
   When he designated Hassan as crown prince in 1965, the king's
sons were infants, and a series of assassination attempts against
Hussein had raised concern about how Jordan would fare if he were
killed. The move required an amendment to Jordan's Constitution,
which had stipulated that the eldest son of the reigning monarch
inherit the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of a son as the new heir would restore that
line.Hussein was designated in 1952 and formally took power the
next year, succeeding his grandfather, King Abdullah, assassinated
in Jerusalem in 1951 and his father, King Talal .

BRONCOS-FALCONS HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DOOZY

   It is true. No denying it. Most football fans yearned for a
Minnesota-Denver tango in Super Bowl XXXIII. That matchup would
have delivered the teams with the best records from each
conference, two clubs with explosive offenses and, combined, more
marquee stars. The rookie receiver Randy Moss would spice the
entire affair. Purple Pride would overflow. Minnesota purple vs.
Denver orange? How much more colorful could it get?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Denver Broncos versus the Atlanta Falcons in Super
Bowl XXXIII is cooking, simmering, boiling to a point that come
next Sunday, we will see a super show. This game is going to
provide tingling theater. Among the reasons are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dan Reeves-vs.-Mike Shanahan/John Elway factor. It began
with niceties from both camps when the teams earned their Super
Bowl berths. Bad blood was behind them, the parties initially said.
New day. New time. Uh, not quite. Emotions have begun to spill for
Reeves, the Falcons' head coach, and Shanahan, Denver's head coach,
and Elway, Denver's quarterback, three guys who used to work
together in Denver before a nasty split. The bad blood between them
has begun to spill. Sharp criticisms. Old wounds have been reopened
between men who used to work closely together who grew to not trust
or enjoy each other. They fought it. They could not help it. And
now, on the inside, for sure, there is little cooling it. Take bad
karma between leadership, wrap it into a football game, a game with
the highest stakes possible, and the trickle-down effect is
enormous. You have drama. The result is one party left flying and
the other left crying. Tremendous desire. Tremendous personal
stakes. Worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrell Davis of Denver and Jamal Anderson of Atlanta are
running backs who will excite every time they touch the football.
The challenge will be special for both teams' defenses to squeeze
these exciting runners and their gifted offensive lines. Both backs
are adept pass catchers, too. Both also know the importance of
outplaying and outrushing each other. Tremendous desire. Tremendous
personal stakes. Worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ No slap against the Vikings, but the Atlanta defense is more
fun to watch. Bigger and harder hitters. And led by bruising
tacklers Bill Romanowski at linebacker and Steve Atwater at safety,
the Broncos can offer crunching blows all day long. The best
football is, in part, hitting. Pure smack-you-in-the-mouth hitting.
Get ready for a physical game. Tremendous desire. Tremendous
personal stakes. Worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   People around the Falcons now think of them as a team of
destiny. Even Reeves talks about this, because before they became
Dirty Birds the Falcons were simply foul.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise that had made the playoffs only once in the
last six seasons. They began the 1997 season, Reeves' first in
Atlanta, with a 1-7 record. The season before Reeves came, Atlanta
was a 3-13 team.
</P>
<P>
   But this season the Falcons righted themselves, began to
implement Reeves' plan of smart, sound and simple football (run the
ball, stop the run, don't make turnovers and create turnovers) and
then smelled success.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual and special way, the Falcons late in the season
turned Reeves' life-threatening quadruple heart surgery into
positive motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said: ``As a coach, you preach and preach things, and you
can only hope it gets through to the players. This is a different
group because they are close and they have responded. They
listened. They have done all of the things we as coaches have asked
and that makes me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcon players say that when their coach faced his
life-or-death situation, it turned up their focus. They listened
even more. Responded more. Details, details. Thus Reeves, when he
returned as the playoffs unfolded, had them squarely in the palm of
his hands. For Reeves, a coach's nightmare had become a coach's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that when it looked like we might lose
Coach Reeves for good that everybody stopped dead in their tracks
and got serious _ real serious,'' said Tony Martin, a Falcons
receiver. ``We turned a negative into a positive. We became even
more of a team and everybody around here gave everything a little
more attention and effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all served the Falcons well. It helped push them
over the top in the playoffs, to a tough victory at home over their
personal Big Brother, the San Francisco 49ers, and then the
improbable victory at heavily favored Minnesota. Is destiny
calling? Is Super Bowl XXXIII simply meant for Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone around the Falcons sure thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XXXIII, someone is going to scoop the ball up and
score on a game-swinging play, or knock it loose and recover it to
save the day, or catch it for 90 yards in a flashy moment, or,
simply, be in the perfect place at the perfect time for one key
moment or for several throughout the game. The hero.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking the Super Bowl XXXIII MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the likely candidates?
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrell Davis _ Won it last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jamal Anderson _ Durable. Dependable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terance Mathis _ Falcons receiver with a flair for the
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shannon Sharpe _ Denver tight end with a lot of mouth, a lot
of production.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jessie Tuggle _ Falcons linebacker is league's career-leading
scorer on fumble returns and among all current players is leading
tackler.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darrien Gordon _ Denver double trouble as punt returner and
cornerback.

By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ That Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan dislike each other is
no exaggeration. It is a feud with an intensity that is rarely seen
in the stoic coaching world of the National Football League. But
instead of consuming the two men, as such emotions can sometimes
do, this feud has created one of the strangest rivalries in sports.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, their disdain for each other has pushed both men
toward the excellence that has put them in Super Bowl XXXIII, where
Shanahan's Denver Broncos will play Reeves' Atlanta Falcons next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty ironic, all of this coming together,'' said
Broncos quarterback John Elway, who started his first game for
Reeves in 1983. ``The relationship with Dan, for both me and Mike,
just didn't work out. Now, we're all going to play each other. That
is strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems between the two men began in the late 1980s when
Reeves was coach of the Broncos and his relationship with Elway had
become so strained that Reeves began to think that Elway and
Shanahan were plotting against him, scripting plays behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves finally fired Shanahan for insubordination after the 1991
season. Instead of wrecking Shanahan's career, though, the firing
rejuvenated it. The San Francisco 49ers hired him as their
offensive coordinator and then he became head coach of the Broncos
in 1995, two years after team owner Pat Bowlen had fired Reeves.
Reeves would go on to New York to coach the Giants for four
seasons, get fired again, then join Atlanta and turn the Falcons
franchise around in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan and Reeves would never forget _ or forgive _ each
other. And each man has wanted to prove something in this most
personal of rivalries: Reeves that he could win without Shanahan _
something many have questioned _ and Shanahan, that he could win a
Super Bowl without Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been proved right. Reeves has taken the Falcons to an
improbable 14-2 regular-season record and then led them to the
Super Bowl with a stunning upset of the Vikings in Minnesota in the
conference title game. If the Falcons beat the Broncos, it will be
Reeves' first Super Bowl championship as a coach after failing
three times with the Broncos _ all while Shanahan was an assistant
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has already won the championship that has eluded
Reeves. The Broncos upset the heavily favored Green Bay Packers in
the Super Bowl last season and, if they can win the title again,
Shanahan will be regarded as one of the top coaches in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to these two, one will have defeated the
other in the National Football League's ultimate game.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Shanahan and Reeves have prospered from their rivalry,
according to friends of the two men. They have used each other as
motivation, pushing to succeed not solely because of personal
pride, but because one wanted to prove to the other that he was
better. It has been a competitive, long-distance race, one of the
great grudge matches in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch each other, and if one messes up, the other loves
it,'' said an assistant coach who has worked with both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Mike is working extra hard right
now, because it would torment him forever to lose to Dan in the
Super Bowl, and Dan is working extra hard for the same reason,''
said the assistant coach. ``That is how much they hate each other.
They would rather fall off a mountain than lose the Super Bowl to
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Another assistant who has worked with both Shanahan and Reeves
said: ``Basically one wants to prove that the other can't coach,
then rub his face in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness of the feud, and its public nature, has even
shocked some players. Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe, who was
drafted by Reeves, said: ``I would be lying if I said I wasn't
surprised. But obviously this has been eating at Dan for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves was coaching the Giants, he would scan the papers
for news about Shanahan. If the Broncos lost, Reeves would mock
Shanahan in front of Giants coaches, several of those coaches said
last week. When Shanahan won the Super Bowl last year, one former
assistant said Reeves told him and others that the day was ``one of
the saddest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has been equally spiteful. In the days following last
season's Super Bowl victory over the Packers, Elway and Shanahan
told members of the Broncos that the organization would never have
reached that point if Reeves had still been the head coach,
according to a Broncos official. After the Broncos beat the Falcons
in September 1997 in the only other game in which Shanahan and
Reeves have faced each other, Shanahan said, ``Thank God Dan and I
don't have to play.'' He was only half joking.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's exchange between Reeves and Shanahan spelled out for
all to see just how deep-seated this feud has become.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves opened the discussion last Wednesday after repeatedly
being asked at his news conference about his relationship with
Shanahan and Elway. Reeves finally began talking when he was
reminded of a 1993 article in which Elway said it was ``hell''
playing under Reeves, who once said Elway needed to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John Elway had a problem with me, I'd have liked to have
known about it before reading about it in the newspaper,'' Reeves
said. ``That was the biggest problem I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Reeves began speaking of both Elway and Shanahan. ``I had
a lot of great times with those guys,'' he said. ``I can be cordial
to them, I can play golf with them. I won't go out to eat with
them, or go socially to a function with them, but if I was sitting
next to them, I would have no problem carrying on a conversation
because I can look back on a lot of great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that I've done and decisions I've
made that I didn't enjoy doing that affected people's lives, but
are they going to be over the hurt of it, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said if he had not believed that Shanahan had gone behind
his back to undermine his relationship with Elway, he wouldn't have
fired Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan responded last Thursday by all but calling Reeves a
liar, saying the Falcons coach had unfairly questioned his
character. Shanahan added that he and Reeves could never be friends
again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that Dan Reeves, if he had a problem with
Mike Shanahan, that he would at least have told me when I was an
assistant coach,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were golfing partners,'' Shanahan continued. ``We were as
close as a head coach and assistant coach could be throughout six
and a half years. It just didn't end the way I would have liked it
to end, and sometimes that has something to do with communication.
Perception sometimes on somebody's part, plus people get a little
carried away. What he may have perceived was not the situation, and
I'm sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan added that the relationship between Reeves and Elway
was already severely strained when he got to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Reeves knew,'' said Shanahan. ``Dan Reeves knew his
relationship with John was terrible. There are no ifs, ands or buts
about that. It was a tough relationship from the second year on.
Everybody in this town knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Elway on Thursday: ``It wasn't a fun time. It was a tough
time for everybody. It was one of those things you wish didn't
happen but it did, and nobody can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan and Reeves seemed like a great match. Reeves hired
Shanahan out of the University of Florida in 1984, where Shanahan
had earned a reputation as a great offensive thinker. He made
Shanahan wide receivers' coach and just one year later, promoted
him to offensive coordinator. Shanahan kept that job for three
years before becoming coach of the then-Los Angeles Raiders in
1988. He was fired from the Raiders only four games into the 1989
season, then rejoined Reeves as quarterback coach.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan's value was undeniable. Elway loved his
quarterback-friendly schemes, and it is no coincidence that under
Shanahan as offensive coordinator, Elway went to two Super Bowls
and had 60 touchdown passes and 48 interceptions. Elway also
compiled all but 13 of his 41 fourth-quarter comebacks under
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   When Shanahan was with the Raiders, Elway tossed 22 touchdowns
to 27 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   To Elway, Shanahan also served as a pseudo-therapist, since he
listened to many of Elway's complaints about Reeves, the chief one
regarding what Elway believed was extremely conservative
play-calling. Reeves feels that even by listening to Elway _
instead of stopping such conversations dead in their tracks _
Shanahan was being disloyal. Everything quickly deteriorated after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people hurt in the whole situation,'' said
Elway. ``It wasn't just us three. There were a lot of people hurt
in our families, Mike and mine and his. The thing I regret is that
it got to this point. But it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Elway summed up the story perfectly to a
teammate, telling him, ``I think you will see two guys in the Super
Bowl who will really want to beat each other to a pulp.''

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton boogied into his victory rally chewing
on a Cohiba and beating on bongo drums.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of relieved Democrats pulled up to the White House for
the bacchanal of vindication. The president decreed it safe to
party in the Oval Office once more.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration began the instant the Senate dropped impeachment
charges against Clinton and took up a censure resolution against
Henry Hyde and his House managers, condemning them as bozos who
dared to waste the upper chamber's valuable time with a persecution
based on the bogus premise that low sex is a high crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strode through the revelers to say a few words. ``Now we
know what the definition of `is' is,'' he roared with a grin. ``I
 &UR; is &LR;  off the hook. Let me begin by expressing heartfelt thanks to
my friends and co-conspirators here _ Geraldo, Whoopi, Barney,
Betty, Vernon, Dale, Quintus Robertus Byrdus, Larry Flynt and all
you Baldwin brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so grateful that it ended before we had to leak what
Terry Lenzer and his private eyes dug up on Bill Rehnquist's funky
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm so happy I don't have to fake remorse anymore. Now I
can concentrate on real remorse _ feeling sorry for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you all know, I do have a tendency to get cocky, once I get
out of a mess, and make an even bigger mess. But it's going to be
hard to top myself, or bottom myself, this time. I'll keep praying
with Jesse and all my other ministers that my bad-boy side doesn't
get back in through the West Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am purging myself of anger. Nelson Mandela told me to turn
the other cheek. I'm going to stop replaying that videotape of
Diane Sawyer slapping around Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr was obsessed with me. But who isn't? To tell the truth,
he wasn't completely off-base. I lied. Hey, that wasn't so hard. I
lied! I lied! I lied!
</P>
<P>
   ``Even spending $50 million, though, he did miss a few things.
First, I did inhale. Second, I did evade the draft. I flat out
didn't want to be marching around some courtyard in Fayetteville
when I could be up at Yale. And Gennifer Flowers? Yup, lots of
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but I do drive people squirrelly.
Henry Hyde used to be judicious. Now he's just a crank. I've always
been lucky in my enemies. Only a group of uptight sourpusses like
Hyde, Barr, McCollum and Sensenbrenner could have sent my numbers
through the roof. Hey, did y'all notice, during the State of the
Union speech, the way I leaned my elbows on the lectern, so I would
look warm and open while the Republicans looked cold and distant?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually a double celebration _ a victory party for me
and a kick-off rally for Hillary's Senate campaign. Honey, I didn't
have a chance to tell you, what with all the excitement, but you're
moving! Harold Ickes found you a great little condo in Battery
Park. We took some more money out of your blind trust for the
security deposit. There was plenty left after you paid off Paula
for me. Lots of couples have commuter marriages. We can make it
work. MCI has that 5-cent thing on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``My good friend Sidney Blumenthal is working on repealing the
22nd Amendment so I can have a third term. I not only want to build
that bridge to the 21st century. I want to walk over it. It's the
least I deserve, after all the time those Republican meanies have
stolen from me. I want my four years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al, you were right when you said that Americans have the
president they deserve! Besides, America is addicted to me. The
news media need me to keep people reading and watching. After the
Cold War, I'm all they've got. The public needs me for its daily
soap-opera fix. Wall Street needs me. Who better to preside over a
bull market? Lawyers need me so they can moonlight as TV pundits.
The Democrats need me to teach them how to win. The Republicans
need me to raise money. Right-wing blondes need me to get their own
cable shows. Hollywood needs me to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've survived everyone _ Gingrich, Livingston, Ovitz. I
dominate the culture. I define the debate. It's a perfect match of
the man and the moment. I give the people anything they want at a
time when they don't need anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, my fellow Americans, tonight I say to you, you're
welcome.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS' SPECTACLE: BRING THEM ALL ON
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This season is going to be nutty enough, so the
Knicks might as well load up on characters rather than character.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, fans are going to be treated to the spectacle of
strangers being thrown together in the name of a National
Basketball Association season, 50 games in three months, with
dubious prospects of artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are going to be in better shape than others. (Not so
fast, you heavy-breathing Knicks.) Other teams are going to be more
cohesive. (Mr. Houston, meet Mr. Sprewell. Mr. Camby, meet Mr.
Ewing.)
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Dave Checketts, the chief executive officer of
Madison Square Garden, is renouncing his ``self-righteous''
attitude, in which he maintained he would not hire players on the
divisive side, the Knicks might as well go for broke.
</P>
<P>
   There is no claim here of any insider basketball scoops about
the availability of Rod Strickland and Dennis Rodman, but one does
hear their names bandied about. The unpredictable point guard and
the eccentric forward would fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took a huge risk in hiring Latrell Sprewell because
he could blow at any time. I'm a firm believer in giving people
second chances, but I like to hear them throw around a little
remorse and a little insight, however phony it may be. Just fake
it.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Sprewell sounds like a guy who thinks he had a bad
day at the gym when he tried to choke his coach last season, so why
is everybody always picking on him? I would have admired the Knicks
more if they had passed on him, but I can understand why they went
for his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing he can do is stay out of the newspapers,'' said
Herb Williams, the 40-year-old solid citizen just retained for his
18th season in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, if they think you're not playing hard, they will
needle you, but if you hustle, you can make a mistake here and
there,'' said Williams, referring to on-the-court blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has talent on his side, along with the fact that the
Knicks were in dire need of a makeover. I cannot work myself into
any maudlin state over the departure of Charles Oakley and John
Starks because, in the past year, I found myself terminally bored
with the same limited and dysfunctional act.
</P>
<P>
   However, I suspect this new lot has even greater potential for
dysfunction. Few of the Knicks spent time working out together
during the lockout, partly because their nominal leader, Patrick
Ewing, was busy as the head of the players association.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach, the disciplined and knowledgeable Jeff Van Gundy,
is a trifle testy about hearing that 10 or 11 Indiana Pacers were
working out together but that his squad is symbolically arriving in
separate sport-utility vehicles from different corners of the
basketball globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys are in good shape and some guys' conditioning level
is less than NBA-level right now,'' Van Gundy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said he can see extra weight on some players, while
others might ``look all right, but their cardiovascular condition
is not great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing looks heavy, and he has bad knees, and Van Gundy admitted
Ewing could be challenged by three games in three nights, which
happens three times during the retooled schedule. ``I wouldn't want
to use him for just 24 minutes rather than his usual 35,'' Van
Gundy said, ``but I'd ask him if he wanted to take a game off now
and then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks sound like candidates to get whacked by the short,
grueling season, but Williams said: ``This game is 90 percent
mental and 10 percent physical. You start looking for hidden
agendas, that's where you get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the worst thing a player could do was pace
himself, ``because that's where you get hurt.'' He did not think
the Knicks would be at a disadvantage because of their reliance on
the 36-year-old Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the teams that have won championships,'' Williams
said. ``Sure, the Bulls had Michael, but Houston won with Hakeem,
and Detroit won with Isiah, and before that the Lakers won with
Magic. The older guys know how to get your rest and stay mentally
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of mentally ready, Williams said it might help Sprewell
to join the franchise with perhaps the heaviest news media coverage
and most demanding fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes care of it right here, then he knows he can handle
anything,'' Williams said. ``I think it's tougher here, but also
better.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell can avoid the coach-choking, teammate-battering
image he had with Golden State, he will have a chance. The nice
thing about this short and frantic season is that between the 50
games and the travel, there won't be much time for practices. That
will be good for Van Gundy's throat, if nothing else.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ As a nurse turned computer systems manager,
Laureen West is one of a crowd of consultants able to describe how
year-2000 computer malfunctions could interrupt the distribution of
medicines. But as a brain tumor patient who needs daily doses of
synthetic-thyroid and other drugs to stay alive, the 43-year-old
Mrs. West has no rivals when it comes to convincing listeners that
it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. West's obvious lack of ease in talking publicly about a
condition she long kept private only adds to the wallop when she
speaks, whether to church groups here in her hometown, to seminars
for health care officials or, as in October, to a Senate
subcommittee as an expert witness on Y2K, as the year-2000 problem
is known.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are confronted with her, it is hard to view Y2K as
just a computer issue,'' said Joel Ackerman, founder of the Rx2000
Solutions Institute, a Minneapolis clearinghouse for year-2000
medical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. West, who works with the clearinghouse as a consultant,
embodies much of what is most troubling about Y2K: uncertainty
about the extent of the problem, questions about who the reliable
experts are and doubts about where reasonable precautions slip over
the line into dangerous overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K threat stems from computer designers' onetime practice
of using just two digits for recording of the year in dates, like
99 for 1999. Accordingly many computers and electronically
controlled machines mistake 00 for 1900 rather than 2000, or cannot
interpret it at all.
</P>
<P>
   To date, almost all the publicity about Y2K in health care has
focused on concerns that because medical devices like pacemakers,
X-ray machines and intravenous pumps have embedded microprocessors,
they could malfunction. While evidence is mounting that most
medical devices will be fine, Mrs. West and others are drawing
attention to their demand that the health care industry give the
public much more information about how it plans to handle the
distribution of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask yourself how many people you know who are
drug-dependent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, it has been an uphill battle for consumers.
National groups that could apply pressure for information and
coordinated planning, like the American Association of Retired
Persons, are only beginning to look at the possibility of Y2K
breakdowns in the medical pipeline. The nation's largest overseer
of health care delivery, the Department of Health and Human
Services, says the entire issue of drug distribution in the year
2000 is not its concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state issue, because they regulate the pharmacies,''
said Campbell Garbett, a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of specific reassurances that the risks are
minimal, there is a ready audience for the worst-case scenario that
Mrs. West describes. It starts with interruptions in the shipments
of raw materials to drug companies, breakdowns in the factories
that make crucial medicines and snarls in the transportation and
warehousing networks that distribute them. It continues with chaos
at the nation's 118,000 pharmacies, where computers keep patient
records, and at the HMOs and insurance companies that must
authorize payments before most prescriptions are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. West also fears that power and phone systems vital to all
these links in the chain could collapse for days, even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In response to all this, she has argued that the federal
government should enact a one-time waiver allowing patients to buy
90-day supplies of drugs whose prescriptions are currently
restricted by law to 30 days, and should encourage insurers to
reimburse promptly for such stockpiling. Patients, she says, should
be warned immediately to begin setting aside money to cover their
share of the costs of the added supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the health care industry call Mrs. West's
prescription counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could create a lot of problems that wouldn't exist
otherwise,'' said Keith Mallonee, vice president in charge of
systems development at the McKesson Corporation, one of the
nation's largest drug distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mallonee and others say patient stockpiling could create
shortages of some medicines, a development that would be especially
threatening to the poor, many of whom would not be able to afford
stockpiling's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since studies show that patients often fail to consume
their entire supply of medicine from prescriptions running 30 days
or longer before switching to new drugs or simply quitting,
distributing large drug supplies to consumers could be very
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can advocate not stockpiling,'' said Daniel Nutkis,
president of the Odin Group, a health care research and consulting
firm in Nashville, Tenn., that created Vitalsigns 2000, the first
Y2K planning group representing every part of the medical pipeline.
But the issue, Nutkis said, is how large the stockpiles should be _
perhaps only a few days' supply _ and how much, if any, should be
maintained by consumers rather than health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Nutkis also said new kinds of cooperation within the industry
might well be part of any solution. For instance, while competition
would normally drive a pharmaceutical company to make sure that it
could meet the full demand for its particular drug, it would now
make sense, he said, to build up supplies of unique drugs in
preparation for Y2K and have everyone agree to stock less of those
drugs for which there are alternatives. ``There are only a few
therapies where you only have one option,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. West says she is taking criticism of her proposals
seriously and is open to discussing alternatives to home
stockpiling, for instance creating regional supplies in secure
locations like armories.
</P>
<P>
   What might seem like minor glitches to those running the health
care system, she argues, could mean anxiety, pain or even death for
many of the tens of millions of Americans taking drug cocktails to
control AIDS, insulin for diabetes, drugs to prevent rejection of
transplanted organs, and numerous other medications.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``And it's not just the chronically ill we need to
consider,'' Mrs. West said. ``If you have a terminally ill patient,
you have to have enough narcotics to allow them to go humanely.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for disaster is nothing new for Mrs. West, a Mormon who
keeps supplies of food and water in her basement in response to
religious teachings as well as Y2K fears. But it took Y2K to
transform her into a campaigner with very public health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm walking a gangplank when I speak in public,''
said the intensely private Mrs. West. But, she added, neither she
nor the fears she voices will disappear any time soon: ``I live,
breathe, think about year 2000 all day long.''

U.S JETS ATTACK MISSILE SITES IN SOUTHERN IRAQ 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFF GERTH  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American jets attacked two Iraqi surface-to-air
missile batteries Saturday after encountering anti-aircraft fire
and MIG jets in the no-flight zone over southern Iraq, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the American planes fired laser-guided bombs
after encountering the Iraqi jets and anti-aircraft fire north of
Basra.
</P>
<P>
   The attack involved two American F-14 Tomcats and two F/A-18
Hornets. They were not damaged and returned safely to the aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson in the Arabian Gulf, according to the
spokesman. He said that it was not known whether the attack on the
missile sites was successful, but that an assessment was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's incident ends a short lull in what has become a
pattern of cat-and-mouse confrontations between Iraqi and American
forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the United States and its
allies imposed no-flight zones in the northern and southern parts
of Iraq to protect Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the patrols violate its sovereignty and has routinely
tested them. Earlier this month there were almost daily clashes,
but there had been no incidents for more than a week. Pentagon
officials said they were not sure why there had been a brief
respite, but they speculated that it could have been due to bad
weather and religious festivities after the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan ended last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government has protested to the U. N. Security Council
about the enforcement of the no-flight zones, according to an
account of Iraq's official news agency reported from Baghdad by
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   The written protest, by Iraq's foreign minister, said allied
aircraft were responsible for ``9,428 aggressive air violations
between August 1998 and the end of 1998,'' AFP reported.

KURDISH REBEL FLEES ITALY, BUT TO WHERE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Germany)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ During their weeklong religious holiday that
is now drawing to an end, many Turks have been playing a variation
of a popular parlor game: Where's Apo?
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, widely known as
Apo, is Turkey's most wanted fugitive. He left Italy eight days ago
after a stay of more than six weeks, but nobody seems to know where
he went.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Ocalan disappeared from Rome, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit of Turkey said he had learned from ``extremely reliable
sources'' that Ocalan had flown to Russia. But on Friday Russia
denied that he was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can officially say that Ocalan is not on Russian
territory,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Greece reported that Ocalan had applied for a
six-month residence permit from the Greek government, but the
application was denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish foreign ministry has summoned the ambassadors of
Estonia, Ukraine and South Africa, all countries to which Ocalan
was reported heading, and warned that they must not shelter him.
</P>
<P>
   Each day brings a new round of speculation on Ocalan's
whereabouts. He was said to be in Belarus, then Lebanon, then Iran.
On Friday, one Istanbul newspaper reported that Ocalan was in the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the world recognizes as part of
Azerbaijan but which is under the military control of ethnic
Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Nagorno-Karabakh is not part of Armenia from a legal
point of view, Turkey could not apply any pressure on Armenia,''
the newspaper said. ``If Turkey were to exert any pressure, that
would imply a de facto recognition of Armenia's control of the
enclave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish defense minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, said he had no
idea where to look for Ocalan, but pledged that Turkey would not
let him rest. ``Wherever Apo goes,'' he said, ``we will keep
chasing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey holds Ocalan responsible for an estimated 30,000 deaths _
that being the total number of soldiers and civilians said to have
died in the 14-year war waged by his Kurdistan Workers Party. He
portrays himself as the leader of a struggle against oppression.
</P>
<P>
   After Ocalan arrived in Rome in November, Turkey demanded that
Italy extradite him for trial here. That proved impossible because
Italy's constitution does not permit the extradition of suspects
who might face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Italian efforts to send Ocalan to Germany, where he is sought in
connection with several crimes, also failed. Many Kurds live in
Germany, and the government there feared violence if it brought
Ocalan to trial.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said: ``We
regret that the path chosen by Italy does not appear to have
advanced the goal of bringing Ocalan to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, a group based in New York, said Ocalan's
guerrillas were responsible for hundreds of executions. It said
Italy and the international community have ``in this case missed an
important opportunity to signal that those who commit atrocities
will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have repeatedly demanded that the Turkish government
investigate and hold accountable those members of its security
forces responsible for serious violations of international human
rights,'' the group's executive director, Holly Cartner, said in a
statement. ``Had Turkey done so, it might have found greater
international sympathy for its case against Ocalan.''

 &HT;    Fate finally unites Bowl, Anderson
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been a great week of practice for Jamal
Anderson. He is so prepared for this Super Bowl that it's almost
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Before the serious media riot breaks out in Miami, the Falcons
audacious running back has refined his sound bites at humble
Suwanee. A little clearing of the throat in advance of the most
grueling few days of public relations imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, Anderson's ready. Every adjective is honed, every
overstatement is at the point of peaking. Seeing a German
television crew Wednesday, he immediately went into his rap about
capturing whole new continents. ``I'm trying to make sure I cross
over. I want to be on all the European stations, that's my goal. If
I see a camera from Europe, I'm coming to find it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (going after) Spain, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Russia. The
folks freezing in Siberia, y'all will get to watch me. Y'all will
get to say, 'He's very, very handsome, and a pretty good player.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Another line Anderson auditioned several times last week
concerned his ambitions about a future career on celluloid,
something beyond NFL Films. ``I'm trying to be like Will Smith.
Will Smith saved the world twice. Why can't I save the world, too?
Somebody out there must have a script for a football player who can
save the world. Why not?'' he wondered. It has played very well,
and we expect to hear much more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is unconcerned about the infamous Super Bowl
distractions. In fact, he has every intention of becoming one.
</P>
<P>
   You gain 1,800 yards, perfect a dance craze and cure a blighted
franchise, then the horizon is truly endless.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the one Falcons personality best suited for the epic
compost-slinging to come and still have plenty left for game day.
To borrow an old image, Anderson is quite comfortable making like
an AM radio on scan. Now is no time to clam up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have fun,'' he says, serving a valuable reminder.
``It's fun to be in the situation we're in. That's why I say
nothing's really a bother to me, because I'd rather you guys be
here `bothering' us than bothering the Packers or any other team.
All I wanted to do for so many years is win, and now we're winners.
This is it, it gets no better than the Super Bowl. Everything is
fun for me, it really is. That's what I'm trying to convey in my
interviews and my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It's inevitable that something Anderson says will be
misinterpreted this week. The volume alone is sure to create some
kind of trouble. That's how Super Bowl week works. He might mention
a fondness for deviled ham; it will come out: ``Anderson Cuts Deal
With Satan!''
</P>
<P>
   He says he will mind his words when it comes to the opponent,
promising nothing that will give the Broncos an edge. And Anderson
just might be bright enough to carry that off, for he is not some
cheap Hollywood Henderson knock-off. ``Trust me,'' he says. ``I've
got to run the ball 30 times; you think I want somebody to hit me
harder? No, no, no. I'm going to say, `The Broncos are tough, the
best team, defending champs. They're vicious, ferocious, tenacious.
They're good, man.'''
</P>
<P>
   If ever a man and moment were meant for each other, this is it.
Raised on the idea that to be average is to be invisible, growing
up at the knees of all those celebrities his father guarded,
Anderson accepts what is happening to him as completely natural. He
is merely assuming a rightful place. ``Now (the celebs) are coming
to see me at the Super Bowl, the ultimate stage,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my element. This is my destiny,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one concern. Is the Super Bowl big enough to hold
Jamal Anderson?

 &HT;    Welcome to Reeves' town: Americus, Ga.
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMERICUS, Ga. _ They're painting the town red. And black and
white. With images of Falcons and such sentiments as ``Dan's Our
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Atlanta lines up against the Denver Broncos next
Sunday in Miami, all the storefronts on West Lamar Street will have
a fresh coat. Maybe even up North Lee Street.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the frenzy that has gripped this city of 17,000 and
you'd think it was the Americus Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII. A
native son, Dan ``Our Man'' Reeves has coached the Falcons to the
NFL promised land, and the folks here are acting like they're
cheering on a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   From the city limits, where the sign at Clinic Drug Store reads
``Way To Go Dan Reeves &AMP; Atlanta Falcons,'' to the heart of
downtown, Americus is busting its buttons about the hometown hero.
</P>
<P>
   Banners have been ordered. A window of The Kinnebrew Co.
clothing store _ ``the Neiman Marcus of Americus,'' founder Hulme
Kinnebrew Jr. said _ features an autographed picture of Reeves from
his days as a Dallas Cowboys running back. The local newspaper is
sponsoring the Dirty Bird Talent Search: The person who does the
best interpretation of the now-famous Falcons dance wins $250.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, a Dan Reeves statue? ``We'll see, if they win the
game,'' Mayor Russell Thomas Jr. said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The whole city is in one happy dither. ``It's the biggest thing
to hit Americus since the flood of '94,'' said Caren Allgood of the
Downtown Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Americus suddenly discovered that Reeves used to
play football here. He was the starting quarterback at Americus
High, Class of 1960. They've followed his career as a player at the
University of South Carolina and with the Cowboys. Some folks, like
his high school coach, Jimmy Hightower, bought a satellite dish to
follow Reeves' coaching career at Denver and New York. Reeves was
the first inductee into the local sports hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   They've had so many Dan Reeves Days here, they could add up to a
week. He was home last spring to dedicate a recreation complex and
receive another proclamation: The road off Highway 19 leading to
the ball fields was named Dan Reeves Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves hasn't forgotten his hometown, either. He carries around
a souvenir from his youth, a scar on his right hand. ``We used to
play football in the cow pasture on our farm,'' he said. ``One
time, I went a little too wide around end and got tackled by the
barbed-wire fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The media descended upon Americus this week to check the local
pulse and was greeted with a down-home hug. ``Welcome CNN'' croons
the marquee at Sumter Bank and Trust, followed by a prediction:
``Watch Dan Reeves &AMP; The Falcons Do The Dirty Bird All Over The
Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Club at Americus High heard company was coming and
jumped into action Wednesday, frantically painting storefronts,
even unoccupied shops. ``We'll probably be painting right up until
the kickoff on Sunday,'' said Ginger Bass, the art teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to get in on the act. As Bass' students were
putting their brush strokes on the front of Elizabeth's Christian
Book Store the other afternoon, a woman drove up in a pickup.
``Please paint my truck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we did,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a new gift shop around the corner walked up and
asked to be involved. ``You'll have to get on the list,'' Bass told
him. She pulled out a wad of phone messages. ``These are just from
this morning. The Ford dealer just called, and that's going to be a
nightmare. That whole building is glass windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass isn't worried about running out of paint, but she's already
out of catchy slogans. ``Dan's Our Man,'' ``Catch That Falcon
Spirit,'' and ``The Birds Of Prey Are Here To Stay'' went quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking the store owners to help me out with slogans; I'm
burned out,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure on, the folks at Computer Business Services
came up with ``How 'Bout Dem Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Jones of the Nancy Jones School of Dance weighed in with
``Hats Off To Our Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Jones said. ``It's kind of fitting for a dance
studio.'' She said she didn't teach Reeves how to dance, ``but I've
danced with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of week. Not everyone you meet in Americus
claims to have danced with the Falcons coach, but they all seem to
know him and are eager to share their Dan Reeves stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know his nickname is `Tuck'?'' Kinnebrew asked. ``I
think he got it because of Friar Tuck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he got it from the nursery rhyme, `Old Dan Tuck,''' said
his daughter-in-law, Carolyn Turner. ``Whenever he comes home, we
still call him Tuck. Americus is really excited for Dan. Everywhere
you go, that's all people talk about. This is a big, big deal for
us, seeing the success a hometown boy is having. There's a lot of
local pride and hometown enthusiasm here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's a Christian, and his mother shops with us,'' said
Malinda McKinney, who owns Elizabeth's Christian Book Store.
``We're just so proud he's done extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came from the Wal-Mart,'' Mayor Thomas said, ``and
everybody I saw in that store wanted to talk about Dan and the
Falcons. One fellow said to me (that) after that game against the
Vikings the doctors don't need to put Dan on a treadmill to check
the strength of his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates have been dusting off their memories, too.
Loveard McMichael, athletics director at Southland Academy, dug out
his Americus High team pictures.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael, No. 11, was a junior backup quarterback behind
Reeves, No. 10, the senior starter for the Americus Panthers. ``We
would have won the state championship if Dan hadn't broken his
collarbone,'' McMichael said. ``He missed several games. He had a
pin put in his collarbone so he could play and _ this tells you how
tough the guy is _ when they pulled it out, the pin was bent up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I didn't see the pin personally, but that's the local
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he fumbled the ball one time in a game,'' said Ken
Hart, a former tackle now in the construction business, ``and coach
Hightower kind of humiliated him in practice the next day. He threw
a ball down three or four times in a row and made Dan practice
recovering a fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember hanging out with him all that much,'' said
ex-fullback Randy Green, now disabled with two ailing hips. ``He
was mostly with Pam (now Reeves' wife) when he was free. But I'm
ecstatic for Dan. In fact, I was pulling for Denver last Sunday; I
want to see him in a grudge match in the Super Bowl. I believe
he'll win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Reeves' old friends have stayed in touch. The Class of
'61 sent him a good luck card this week. And all of Americus, it
seems, wants to let Dan Our Man know that the hometown folks are
pulling for him in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is such a personable fellow,'' the mayor said, ``it makes
it real easy to be supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So tell me,'' Nancy Jones said, ``are they as excited in
Atlanta as we are down here?''

 &HT;    'On to Miami' slogan proved premature in Minnesota
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS, Minn
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis cab driver negotiated the rush-hour traffic
deftly and swiftly through the snow, the way the Vikings ran
through the NFL regular season. He was in a festive mood, as was
the entire city, and with good reason. The temperature rose from
subzero to slightly above freezing. Former wrestling oaf Jesse
Ventura was hours from being inaugurated as governor. And the next
day, the town's superb football team had a great opportunity to
advance to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the happy cabbie chatted it up with his passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time to be in Minnesota,'' he said, glancing into
the rear-view mirror. ``Everyone's excited, especially about our
Vikings. What do you think of them? It should be a good game, don't
you think?''
</P>
<P>
   The response: ``Yeah, because the Falcons are a very good team,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the driver's eyes got narrow. He stopped the car at
the light, turned his head completely around and then expressed the
perspective that permeated the Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``I'm not worried
about Atlanta. We'll definitely beat them. No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the arrogance of the metropolitan area. It was not just
the taxi driver. There was the owner, Red McCombs, calling in
unsolicited to a Minneapolis all-sports radio station last week to
say, ``We're going Bird hunting and then on to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   There was tight end Andrew Glover, proclaiming: ``When we are at
home, we are impossible to beat. Only the Vikings can truly beat
the Vikings.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the local newspapers _ The Minneapolis Star Tribune
and the St. Paul Pioneer Press _ with special editions already
prepared to distrubute after the game, proclaiming, ``ON TO
MIAMI.''
</P>
<P>
   There were athletic stores in the malls with T-shirts on display
calling the Vikings ``NFC Champions.'' There were several scheduled
``victory parties,'' including one thrown by McCombs at a downtown
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it was all so premature, all so arrogant. The Falcons
earned their first Super Bowl trip with a dramatic 30-27 victory on
Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal in overtime _ a kick that
touched off a explosion of emotions in Atlanta and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible, when you think about it,'' said Falcons coach Dan
Reeves, who five weeks earlier had undergone quadruple bypass heart
surgery. ``I couldn't be prouder.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only for the outcome, but for the way the Falcons defeated
the Vikings, an 11-point favorite with a 16-1 record and way too
much confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons took a 7-0 lead on the first drive of the game, but
the Vikings went ahead 20-7 after key fumbles by Harold Green and
O.J. Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota could have held that lead at the end of the first
half. But coach Dennis Green _ whose offense had attacked all year
_ wanted more. So quarterback Randall Cunningham dropped back to
pass on third-and-10 from the Vikings 18. Falcons defensive tackle
Chuck Smith beat Pro Bowl tackle Todd Stuessie to the outside,
swooped in and knocked the ball from Cunningham. Travis Hall
recovered for the Falcons at the 14 with 59 seconds left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler hit Terance Mathis with a touchdown
pass on the next play, cutting the deficit to 20-14 and bolstering
the Falcons' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play by Chuck was huge,''said linebacker Jesse Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the break, the Falcons continued to bore in.
Andersen cut the Vikings' lead to 20-17 on another field goal. It
seemed that momentum had shifted inside the noisy, purple-dominated
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a big-top circus. The Vikings ran onto the field
before the game through a massive inflated ark. The sounds of a
sustained, screeching horn reverberated off the Dome's walls. Every
so often, the Vikings fight song blared through the speakers that
hung high above the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Into this noisy atmosphere came the Vikings fans, who seemed
intent on paying homage to their unbeatable team on the final step
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it appeared in the final quarter when Cunningham
directed a long Minnesota scoring drive _ 15 plays, 82 yards _ to
put the Vikings ahead 27-17 with 13:41 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were in control then,'' Matthew Hatchette said.
</P>
<P>
   They were, but they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who wound up 27-for-43 for 340 yards and two
touchdowns, hit Tony Martin for a 70-yard gain that resulted in
Andersen's 24-yard field goal with 11:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota responded with running back Robert Smith, who led the
Vikings to the Atlanta 21 by gaining 41 yards on four carries. When
the Falcons defense held with 2:07 remaining, Minnesota trotted out
place-kicker Gary Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had not missed a kick since December 15, 1997, against
Denver. He had made all 39 of his field goal attempts this season,
and everyone considered the 38-yarder to put the Vikings ahead by
10 a chip shot.
</P>
<P>
   But he missed. The Falcons, still trailing by seven, celebrated
as if they had won the game, and the Vikings seemed to have the
life sucked from them. ``I couldn't believe it missed,'' Anderson
said. ``But that's field-goal kicking. You either make them or miss
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered and limping from hits in the backfield, Chandler
orchestrated an eight-play, 71-yard drive in 1:28. Without
timeouts. He hit Mathis for 9 yards and Ronnie Harris for 29 yards.
He rushed for 9 yards. At the end of the play, he hurt an ankle,
but stayed in the game. Jamal Anderson, who was held to 67 yards,
got a key first down on a 6-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Minnesota 16, Chandler's pass was
deflected and dropped by Vikings safety Robert Griffith with 57
seconds to go. Reeves gave Chandler two options on the next play,
and Chandler went with the same play. He was flushed out of the
pocket to his left and then fired a hard pass to Mathis, who
cradled the ball at the goal line for the touchdown with just :49
remaining. Andersen's extra point tied it at 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drive right there by Chris ranks right up there with the
great drives,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said, ``It was all or nothing. In a way, it makes it
easier because you know you have to score a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was still time left for the explosive Vikings offense.
But on third down from the 27, Green instructed Cunningham to take
a kneeto force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he was following the team's pattern from all year.
Still, the Vikings fans booed.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, there was silence when the Falcons'
Andersen lined up from the Vikings 21 for the biggest kick of his
17-year career. Several Falcons on the bench were on their knees in
prayer. Reeves was not one of them. ``I wanted to see it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Andersen's kick ripped through the uprights, the players
raced to the field and fans in Atlanta fled to the streets _ both
in delirious celebration. Tears of joy flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day at the office,'' punter/holder Dan Stryzinski
said. ``I knew (Anderson) would get it done. He's the best clutch
kicker in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said about the 26th game-winning kick of his career:
``The unit did its job. All I had to do was mine.''
</P>
<P>
   By doing his job with icy perfection, he sent the Vikings
players and fans home crying. When they departed the building, a
gray sky had begun to snow.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed as if someone had pulled the plug on a city's
life-support system. Cunningham sparked images of Yul Brynner as
Pharaoh in ``The Ten Commandments,'' on his knees, head down,
pounding the turf with both hands _ just as Pharaoh did when he
realized that his troops, chasing Moses, were swallowed up in the
Red Sea. The Vikings did not get victory. What they got was the
silent treatment. No one considered that the most poignant noise
64,000 people could make would be silence. Regarded as the loudest
of NFL buildings, the Metrodome was like a library, except for the
Falcons falling all over each other in utter joy on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The people _ most clad in purple, many wearing painted faces,
horned caps and most definitely liquored breath _ exited the
building like school children in a fire drill: orderly and quietly.
Some looked back over their shoulders to reaffirm if what they'd
witnessed was true. And sure enough, they saw the Falcons basking
in their finest moment, and the Vikings who remained on the field
watching in stunned disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was our year,'' Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock said. ``It was an unbelievable experience out there. I
just never saw it coming like this. Never. I just feel empty.''
</P>
<P>
   The crestfallen Vikings trudged toward their locker room in the
bowels of the building, heads bowed. Beaten. Crushed. Pro Bowl
receiver Cris Carter cried uncontrollably and had to be aided by
brother John off the field, up the ramp and toward the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Vikings said a word. There was a stony, eerie
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't quiet at all,'' Falcons defensive lineman Shane
Dronett insisted. ``I could hear the fans cheering all the way from
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had a sustained celebration on the field that
included Reeves doing a version of the crazed ``Dirty Bird'' on the
platform after receiving the trophy for the NFC Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stand this, my heart's going to be in great shape,''
Reeves said. ``The only thing tougher than (the game) is going to
be dancing, in downtown Atlanta, the Dirty Bird. That ain't going
to be a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons fans would argue that; Vikings fans wouldn't. They
envisioned the Vikings as champs, nothing else. It seemed the
possibility of defeat never entered their minds. And so, a city
mourned.
</P>
<P>
   A Tribune editorial noted that, at a coffee bar in town the day
after, the music played was ``mournful music they used to play in
Eastern Europe when the dictator died.''
</P>
<P>
   Business died, too. Merchants anticipated on Monday a mad rush
for Vikings garb or big-screen televisions to watch the Super Bowl.
Instead, it was dead. The people were in mourning. Travel plans to
Miami were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL provided both the Vikings and Falcons locker rooms with
about 200 hats proclaiming each team NFC champs. The Falcons
proudly wore theirs. And the Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got shipped back to NFL Properties,'' said Dennis Ryan,
Vikings equipment manager. ``I saw the box, but I never opened it.
I don't know what the hats looked like, and I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Falcons said they did not come to Minneapolis to
lose. ``We came here to win,'' said Tuggle, defiantly, two days
before the game. ``I don't think the Vikings have been hit like
we're going to hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hit Minnesota took was emotional. ``I guess I have to accept
that Atlanta scored more points,'' McCombs said. ``But I just can't
grasp how. I knew we were going to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Only, he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know that Gary Anderson would miss or that Moss would
drop a possible touchdown in the second quarter or that Smith would
be rendered ordinary or that their potent offense would be impotent
after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, McComb and his fans didn't know that the Falcons would
not quit, that the offensive line would not make one false-start
penalty despite the noise, that the defense would surrender just
seven points in the last 40 minutes, that Chandler would be so
clutch, that grit and will can overcome talent, that the Falcons
have worn destiny all season.
</P>
<P>
   Worn it snug, like a championship ring.

 &HT;    Inside Baseball: Hole in roof another headache for Expos
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In yet another episode of Canadian baseball calamity, the roof
coming down on the Montreal Expos last week was greeted around the
majors with shaking heads. A brand new $24 million roof on Olympic
Stadium didn't last out the first big snowfall before a
3,200-square-foot panel _ the second largest of the 63 panels that
make up the roof _ ripped open under the weight of melting snow and
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it has nothing to do with the Expos, really,''
Montreal manager Felipe Alou said. ``But if you're in Taiwan and
you read this, you're saying, `There go the Expos again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Upon reconsideration, it had been a pretty good winter for the
club. Club president Claud Brochu is ready to sell his 7.6 percent
of the club, which could lead to refinancing and some firmer
economic ground. Although attendance was down more than 500,000,
Alou likens the current young talent pool with his 1994 team, a
powerhouse that was poised to make a run into the postseason until
the strike killed the season and eventually stripped the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to spring training last year without a team,'' Alou
said, ``just a group of mostly young men who hadn't played in the
big leagues or hadn't played together. We feel like we have a team
now.''
</P>
<P>
   One that might be playing home games with one eye cocked at the
ceiling. The roof, a seriesof Teflon-coated fiberglass panels, was
promised to bear up under 3-foot snowfalls and wasn't ever supposed
to need clearing. The manufacturer, the American firm Birdair, also
installed roofs at the Georgia Dome, the Minneapolis Metrodome and
the Pontiac Silverdome, all of which have had problems with
collapsing segments.
</P>
<P>
   So much for a strong Expos start in 1999. Alou already has his
solution for dealing with a hazardous roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to be making too many trips to the
mound,'' the manager said. ``I'll send out the pitching coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave matters
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine was voted Brave of the Year by the Atlanta chapter
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The 1998 Cy Young
winner drew 13 votes, Andres Galarraga received three and Javy
Lopez one. . . . The club's decision to hold a two-day FanFest Feb.
6-7 while individual game tickets go on sale can be grouped with
the team's new family discount-ticket packages. The aim: to try to
reclaim some of the 103,000 fans it lost at the gate in Turner
Field's second year of operation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the Braves coaching staff been revamped, the
scouting department will look new after the retirement of two
longtime employees. Major-league scout Bill Wight, who had been
with the organization since 1967, and Fred Shaffer, who has spent
50 years in baseball, both retired. Additionally, longtime
minor-league pitching coach Bill Slack, most recently assigned to
the Danville Braves of the Appalachian rookie league, announced his
retirement. . . . Pitching coach Leo Mazzone's book on the mound
craft goes on sale this spring. The book, co-written with
California sports author Jim Rosenthal, will be titled either
``Pitch Like a Pro'' or ``Pitch Healthy, Pitch Smart.'' Publisher
St. Martin's Press is still undecided. Mazzone dedicated the book
to manager Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Around the majors
</P>
<P>
   The Mets brought reliever Armando Benitez, acquired from
Baltimore, to meet the New York press, and most questions focused
on Benitez's drilling the Yankees' Tino Martinez last summer and
provoking one of the year's worst brawls. ``I'm not concerned that
this young man will be intimidated by New York,'' Mets pitching
coach Bob Apodaca said. ``He has come a long way. He pitched his
way out of the Dominican Republic. He has faced tougher situations
than this.'' . . . The Phillies are concerned that catcher Mike
Lieberthal's pelvis injury still hasn't healed fully, despite four
cortisone treatments and a steady diet of anti-inflammatories.
Philadelphia was 51-48 before Lieberthal went down with the injury
in late July and then went 24-39 without him. Back-up catcher Bobby
Estalella will be out until mid-May after shoulder surgery, and
newly acquired reserve Tom Prince has hit .198 in 12 major league
seasons. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's rotation is setting up like this: right-hander Pete
Harnisch, left-hander Denny Neagle, right-hander Brett Tomko,
left-hander Steve Avery and either right-hander Jason Bere or
left-hander Dennis Reyes at No. 5. The first four went a collective
53-37 in 1998. Last year, Reds manager Jack McKeon used 11
different starters, who went 53-60. . . . Great news for Braves
general manager John Schuerholz: Albert Belle's new contract with
Baltimore stipulates that he cannot be traded over its first three
years and can be dealt to one of only eight teams in the final two
years. The Braves are on the approved list. . . . Economics for
1999: Minnesota is hoping to pare payroll from $26 million to $11
million. That way, if the Twins can draw 1 million fans, they'll
turn a profit. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres' regret for acquiring reliever Randy Myers
mounts, as the club continues without success to dump his contract,
which has two years remaining at $12.25 million. The latest efforts
are concentrated with Seattle in a proposed trade for third baseman
Russ Davis and reliever Bobby Ayala. The Padres might pick up $2
million of the contract, but the Mariners' 1998 scouting reports on
Myers are poor, and the club already has given closing duties to
free-agent acquisition Jose Mesa. . . . The intoxication of
expansion: ``If they give me three months, I'll give them 10
years.'' That from free agent Billy Ashley after he signed with
Tampa Bay. In 618 career at-bats, Ashley is hitting .233 with 236
strikeouts, one every 2.6 at-bats.

 &HT;    Bure lifts Florida, division
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Waffle House of the NHL's six divisions just
gained a little glitz.
</P>
<P>
   When the Florida Panthers swung a deal with Vancouver for
disgruntled superstar Pavel Bure, it created the first rumbling in
South Florida since the fledgling franchise made a stunning run to
the finals three years ago. It also might wake up the Panthers'
brethren in the Southeast Division, where the mediocre Carolina
Hurricanes, at only 20-18-7, are the lone team with a record that
tilts to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it doesn't really change our thinking and how we'll
go about things next year,'' said Thrashers general manager Don
Waddell, whose team will play next season in the Southeast with
Florida, Carolina, Washington and Tampa Bay. ``But certainly it
could increase goal scoring in our division, which is fine by us.
Sometimes one guy can do that. One team signs a superstar, and then
the other teams feel they have to go out and get somebody. It's a
big move not just for Florida but the division as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's ascension to the Stanley Cup finals last
year, the Southeast generally is considered the weakest of six
divisions. The Panthers made the deal knowing that the division is
up for grabs and hoping to use it as a marketing boost this year
and next, assuming they can extend Bure's contract. A five-year
deal paying Bure $9 million to $10 million annually could be
completed by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We have)19,258 seats to fill (in a new building),'' Florida
president Bill Torrey said. ``We have a lot of competition here _
football is huge, the Marlins have new ownership, the Heat (is
getting) a new building. Pavel is somebody people want to see, and
they'll pay to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers have been a thrill ride since being born in 1993.
Fifth-place finishes in their first two seasons led to the firing
of coach Roger Neilson and the hiring of Doug MacLean. In MacLean's
first season, the Panthers finished 10 games over .500, got hot in
the playoffs and reached the Stanley Cup finals, losing to
Colorado. Then came the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation after that year was that anything less than
the finals was a disaster,'' Torrey said. ``We signed a couple of
guys in free-agency who didn't play well and it hurt us. We were
looking for leaders who could help our younger guys, because we
knew in the next few years we had some guys coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers were bounced from the playoffs in the first round
in 1996-97. Last season, after a 7-12-4 start, MacLean was fired by
general manager Brian Murray, who named himself as interim
replacement. Murray went only 17-31-1 the rest of the season, then
set himself up for more criticism by hiring his brother, Terry, as
Florida's new coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   If Bure can cool this soap opera, it will be his greatest
achievement yet. Certainly, he possesses the talent. The Russian
had consecutive 60-goal seasons (1992-94), scored 51 for the
Canucks last season and led all scorers in the Winter Olympics with
nine goals in six games, including five in a semifinal win over
Finland. In his Florida debut Wednesday against the New York
Islanders, Bure scored twice in a 5-2 win _ and that was on
jet-lagged legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laughing at myself, the way I was skating and handling
the puck,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Torrey said, ``Pavel has shown he's one of the
great goal scorers in the league and he's only 27 years old. On top
of that, he's one of the top personalities in the game. We have
guys in this league who score 50 goals who don't have Pavel's
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrey didn't have to mention Eric Lindros by name. Not that
Lindros wouldn't give another boost to the Southeast Division.

WITHOUT RESTRAINTS, OLYMPIC IDEAL IS TAINTED

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Behind police barricades, accused
members of the International Olympic Committee pleaded their cases
Saturday in an attempt to avoid expulsion for misconduct in the
Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   About half a dozen IOC members arrived Saturday morning to face
questioning from a commission headed by Richard Pound, a Montreal
attorney. No members had resigned by noon.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were kept outside IOC headquarters by security guards
and police officers. As many as 11 members could face a
recommendation of expulsion on Sunday by the IOC's executive board
for accepting cash payments, tuition aid, medical treatment and
lavish gifts totaling three quarters of a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, the senior IOC member from Australia, tried to
contain another brush fire of scandal by saying he now believed
that offers of $35,000 apiece, made to two African IOC members the
night before the vote on Sydney's bid to win the 2000 Summer Games,
were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, president of Australia's Olympic Committee, said
Friday he had made the last-minute offers to Charles Mukora of
Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda on Sept. 22, 1993,
the night before Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes. Coates
defended the payments as attempts to help the Olympic committees in
the African countries, not attempts to line the pockets of IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said he accepted the explanation. ``I have no reason to
believe that was bribery,'' Gosper said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gosper did not explain the difference between what was
appropriate for Sydney and what was inappropriate for Salt Lake
City. And he admitted he was in the awkward position of having to
seek a vote of confidence for the two cities from the IOC's
executive board on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What now threatens to cripple the Olympics _ big money, big
temptations, big excesses _ is a corrupted evolution of the
financial revival that saved the Olympics 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Juan Antonio Samaranch, a Spanish marquis, became president
of the IOC in 1980, the five Olympics rings were fool's gold. The
1972 Summer Games in Munich, Germany, shed the blood of Israeli
athletes and shredded any notion that sport and politics are not
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to pay for the 1976 Winter Games with public money,
Denver shuffled them to Innsbruck, Austria. The 1976 Summer Games
in Montreal left a debt of $1 billion. The 1980 Summer Games in
Moscow were boycotted by the United States after the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic movement was in trouble,'' said Pound, an IOC vice
president. ``The IOC had little financing, unity was shaky at best
and the Games were becoming a Cold War battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won the 1984 Summer Games in 1978 essentially
because no one else wanted them. Tehran lost interest when the
shah's regime began to collapse. Islamic fundamentalism had no use
for sport. The Soviets led a retaliatory boycott in Los Angeles,
but what could have been a Cold War disaster became a hot property.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ueberroth brought to Los Angeles an Olympics that was
privately financed through television rights fees, corporate
sponsorships, ticket sales and licensing agreements. Shrewdly, he
gave exclusivity to various categories of corporate sponsorships.
Coca-Cola was the official soft drink, IBM the official technology
sponsor, Levi-Strauss the official outfitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lake Placid, they had 50 official Band-Aid sponsors,''
joked Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles,
referring to the 1980 Winter Games. ``Peter had one sponsor per
category, which created value for the sponsor and allowed him to
demand larger amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 1984 Summer Games turned a profit of $220 million,
everyone decided they wanted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter added a couple of zeroes to everything,'' said John
Argue, who was president of the Los Angeles bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, at an IOC meeting in East Berlin, one of the most
infamous food fights in Olympic history took place among cities
vying for the 1992 Summer Games. Brisbane, Australia, sent in a
planeload of lamb and lobsters for a party whose tab has been
placed at nearly $2 million. Paris also airmailed a gastronomical
feast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the most food they had ever seen in East
Berlin,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no rules, so there were no rules to be broken. Ms.
DeFrantz heard stories of IOC members being put up in one of Paris'
most exclusive hotels ``for a long time, with their families. It
was out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Summer Games were eventually awarded to Barcelona,
Spain, in 1986. That year, the IOC placed a limit of $150 on gifts
that IOC members could receive, but like traffic rules in Italy,
this limit appeared to be more of a suggestion than a law. There
are no real checks and balances on the IOC, which answers to no one
but itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say it's better to be an IOC member than a king,''
said Fred Ball, who was a member of Salt Lake City's bid committee
for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the IOC began holding the Winter and Summer Games in
separate years. The Winter Olympics now stood alone, instead of in
the shadow of the Summer Games. More corporate money could be
raised; budgets increased and so did the projected economic
benefit. Salt Lake City's expected budget of $1.45 billion is
nearly as large as the budget for the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
The estimated economic impact in Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter
Games is $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the winner was the city willing to lose the most
money,'' Pound said. ``Now the Games are seen has having a
beneficial economic impact. Sometimes that attracts the lowest
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidding process has become a sort of neurotic mating ritual
in which bid cities, eager to please IOC members, tend to spend
money ``like drunken sailors on leave,'' Pound said. Salt Lake City
spent $14 million in private funds just trying to win the 1998 and
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a corrupt process,'' said Robert Helmick, who resigned
amid allegations of conflict of interest in 1991 as an IOC member
and as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``It starts with
first-class air tickets for IOC members and their wives. That's
$10,000 to $12,000. Then there is the excessive lifestyle bestowed
on IOC members by the bid cities. Fur coats, jewelry. They might
pay for college tuition for someone's kid. Or find him a job. It
goes beyond what is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some IOC members have been as eager to receive as the bid cities
have been eager to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people from poorer countries travel to the United States,
they are very impressed,'' said Francois Carrard, the executive
director of the IOC ``The different level in standards can lead to
temptation. The other side is generous and says, `My dear friend,
what can I do for your family?' But those people should have read
the rules. Blame has to be shared.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because a vote is now held every two years to name a city to
host the Winter or Summer Games, there is steadier work for
so-called middlemen, or agents. Pound spoke sharply last week of
wanting to rid the Olympic movement of these agents, who reportedly
promise to deliver a bloc of votes for exorbitant sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were allegations that bidders hoping to have the
Winter Games in Sion, Switzerland, were approached by an agent who
claimed he could deliver 25 IOC votes for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we are through with so-called Olympic agents, I
doubt that it will be a profitable business, if it ever was,''
Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City began setting off alarms at the USOC as early as
1989, when it was attempting to become the American candidate city
to bid on the Winter Games. At the time, officials were concerned
about the image that drinking was not allowed in the Mormon
capital. The Olympics, after all, are as much a 16-day party as a
16-day sporting competition.
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials who came to inspect Salt Lake City said they
found their hotel rooms stocked with bottles of wine and cases of
beer. Once, the inspection team was taken out in a horse-drawn
carriage while champagne was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them that was overkill,'' said Sandy Knapp, who headed
the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a case of beer and a few bottles of wine were
penny-ante stuff. But the USOC's initial vigilance lagged as the
inducements in Salt Lake City grew to include cash payments and
benefits of more than $100,000 apiece to some IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Olympics in Salt Lake City was considered paramount
by the USOC, whose officials feared that corporate support might
swoon after the Atlanta Olympics and that the USOC's quadrennial
budget of $400 million could shrink by as much as $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   With Salt Lake City as host, the USOC has made $54.5 million
from its cut of television rights fees and expects to earn
approximately $193 million more in cash and supplies in a joint
marketing agreement. Not until November 1997 _ two years after the
Salt Lake vote _ did the USOC institute a formal policy limiting
gifts to officials by bid cities to $50 in one phase of the bid
process and $150 in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did my predecessors fall down on the job?'' said Bill Hybl,
the current USOC president. ``In the future, we're going to do a
great deal more.''
</P>
<P>
   There is growing evidence that Samaranch was aware of
improprieties in the bidding process. Pound said he had once been
offered a $1 million bribe during television rights negotiations
for the Games and had informed Samaranch. But no disciplinary
action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Henderson, who headed Toronto's unsuccessful bid for the
1996 Summer Games, said that Samaranch approved an arrangement in
which the Toronto bid committee paid the rent for the husband of
Pirjo Haggman, an IOC member from Finland. She resigned last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has both democratized the Olympic movement by
providing more opportunities for women and athletes from developing
nations, and made it more elitist with his autocratic, secretive
management style.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that the Olympic movement is more important than the
Catholic Church, and he threw a $16 million party in 1994 to
celebrate the IOC's centennial congress, two years after athletes
were left to swelter in an unair-conditioned village at the 1992
Summer Games in his native Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to catch too many people,'' Arnold Beckett, a
former member of the IOC's medical commission, said of the
committee's attitude toward doping. ``It won't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The same criticism has been applied to corruption. His
detractors believe that Samaranch simply didn't want to know. Or
didn't want to act. He said he received only rumors, not facts.
Either way, everything he built has begun to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC needs to worry about losing the magic of the
Olympics,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in charge of international
relations for the Atlanta Olympic organizing committee. ``As they
have become such big business and have become so obsessed with
being big and having the best athletes, they have lost a little of
the magic of bringing the whole world together in the interest of
peace. They don't think people will pay big money for that. To me,
that's all they've got.''

   ROCKPORT, Wash. _ For the 229 bald eagles that Libby Mills
counted last Wednesday, the eight-mile stretch of the Skagit River
between here and Marblemount is the four-star, all-you-can-eat
sushi bar of Washington's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills, 46, a naturalist with the Nature Conservancy, has
spent every winter Wednesday for the past 17 years counting the
eagles along this stretch. She notes _ on waterproof paper _
whether they are in trees, soaring in the air, flushed by human
intrusion or on gravel bars where they feast on the chum salmon,
dead for about a month and smelling accordingly, after their
upstream battle to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills pinpoints the eagles on contour maps, recording
whether they are adults, which are (at least 6 years old, or
juveniles, distinguished by their splotchy coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this crossroads town on Highway 20, three hours
northeast of Seattle, the clouds have descended into a pervasive
mist, and the moss on the bark of the vine maples is thick enough
to grow its own ferns. Coming out of from the Cascade Mountains,
the Skagit River runs clear enough to show submerged fish carcasses
and skins in sharp detail, while across the water, eagles are
concealed behind layers of cottonwood, alder and fog. Their
melodic, trilling squeaks can be heard throughout the woods, the
male's voice higher and weaker than the female's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial thing is to remember, each eagle is good for two
big blotches of white,'' Ms. Mills said, referring to the confusing
density of the crowd of birds along the river. Those blotches were
so thick that a novice birder counted 10 eagles without moving the
binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills' data are used by the private Nature Conservancy for
measuring the health of the river, the salmon and the eagles, as
well as the eagles' breeding success along the stretch of river,
one of the largest winter concentrations of eagles in the country.
The bald eagle count peaked at 320 the week before last, with 310
the week before, and 285 before that, she said, with many flying in
from northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The number has increased significantly over the past decades,
primarily because of the reduction of logging in the eagles'
nesting areas, and the banning of the pesticide DDT, which kept the
shells of raptor eggs from hatching.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Ms. Mills said, there were 180 nesting pairs of bald
eagles in the state, and now there are more than 500 pairs. The
bird is still on the federal endangered species list, though
officials are debating whether to take it off.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills started counting at 9 a.m., when most of the eagles
had left their night roosts in cottonwoods or Douglas firs. An
early bird-watcher has the best chance of success, before the
crowds set in and scare off the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right along the highway you're likely to have people coming
out and creating a hubbub,'' Ms. Mills said. ``Usually when people
come up, the birds just bolt.'' Some eagles will stay away from a
gravel bar for a full day if it has been disturbed by a human, she
said. The first weekend of the month, when 700 people visited one
section of the road where volunteer eagle watchers were stationed,
only 40 birds were seen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills, who patrols the river banks in a station wagon
bearing the slogan ``Study Nature, Not Books,'' tries hard not to
count an eagle twice, though this can be difficult, when the
basically identical birds gather as thick as pigeons near fusty
fish carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a really great day of birding is not spent counting,
but just watching behavior,'' Ms. Mills said, recalling how she has
seen an eagle carry an octopus back to its nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very easy bird to watch, and I like that it gets other
people interested in birds,'' said Ms. Mills, who often speaks to
school groups about eagles. ``Often times, watching eagles gets
them interested in the whole environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take just about any bird and pay any attention to
it, they're all equally interesting. Everything is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a designated counting spot where she used to be able to find
100 eagles, she pointed to a 20-foot conifer that now blocks her
view of the river. ``That's how long I've been here,'' she said,
hoping out loud that 30 eagles were not hidden behind what had been
a seedling when she started working here in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperature rose and the swan-white slopes of El Dorado
Mountain shone through the clouds, Ms. Mills started looking for
eagles riding the rising warm-air columns. or thermals. Soon after,
she saw 20 birds spiraling high, perhaps ones she had counted
earlier, perhaps not. The thermals lift them high enough to reach
the shelter of tall trees higher in the hills, where they spend the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see one slide on up Illabot Creek to a big night
roost, or slide on across the sky to another night roost,'' Ms.
Mills said. ``With all that lift, there's a lot of saved energy.
It's really easy to kind of get woozy watching them, instead of
watching a winter wren or a dipper. The eagles seem a lot less
real, almost.''
</P>
<P>
   One soared for more than 40 seconds before flapping its wings.
They wheeled counterclockwise, slipping in between each other
easily, at the same pace as the eddies in the fast green river.

ISRAEL'S TOP COURT WEIGHS INTERROGATION METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Shai Nitzan, a government lawyer, had some news for
the Israeli Supreme Court during deliberations earlier this month
on the methods used by the Shin Bet security service during
interrogations of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A stifling, foul-smelling sack placed over the heads of suspects
would be replaced with ``something more airy,'' Nitzan told the
court. There were also plans to replace tight handcuffs used to
bind suspects' arms painfully behind their backs with looser chain
shackles, Nitzan said.
</P>
<P>
   The sack and handcuffs were ``not intended to burden'' the
detainees, Nitzan assured the court. The sack was used to isolate
suspects from each other, he said, and handcuffing was a security
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of nine judges considering these and other methods
_ called torture by the United Nations, Amnesty International and
other human rights groups _ was extraordinary, and is unparalleled
in other countries. For the first time, Israel's Supreme Court is
weighing the legality of such techniques, used against hundreds of
Palestinian suspects interrogated every year by Shin Bet.
</P>
<P>
   The methods include shackling prisoners in painful positions
while depriving them of sleep for days, covering their heads with
sacks and subjecting them to loud music. Typically, suspects are
held for many hours between interrogation sessions on miniature
chairs that tilt forward. During questioning, some are grabbed by
the collar and violently shaken, causing their heads to whip back
and forth.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court hearings on the legality of these methods
began a year ago in response to petitions by Palestinian prisoners
and human rights groups, but only three sessions have been held so
far and the most recent, held this month, ended with an indefinite
delay. The court has been hesitant to rule on a matter that Chief
Justice Aharon Barak has said should properly be regulated by
parliamentary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the court, Nitzan told the judges that a ministerial
committee on the Shin Bet had decided this month to submit a bill
on the conduct of interrogations. But with Parliament about to
break up ahead of early national elections in May, there is
virtually no chance that such a bill will pass in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   So the issue remains before the court. The question facing the
judges is whether in trying to foil terrorist attacks, the Shin Bet
may continue using techniques sanctioned in 1987 by a state
commission of inquiry into interrogation methods. That commission
ruled that under certain circumstances, the Shin Bet could use ``a
moderate measure of physical pressure'' detailed in a secret
section of its report.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, in response to suicide bombings in Israel, the
ministerial committee has approved ``increased physical pressure''
during interrogations, and in several cases the Supreme Court has
permitted the use of such methods against detainees. Amnesty
International asserts that this amounts to an effective
legalization of torture.
</P>
<P>
   But in court last week, Nitzan and another government lawyer,
Yehuda Schaffer, asserted that Israel was not violating the 1984
U.N. Convention Against Torture, which Israel ratified in 1991. The
methods used by the Shin Bet do not constitute torture, Nitzan
argued, and are ``legal and desirable'' when used to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``the necessity defense'' under the Israeli Penal Code,
which absolves government agents of criminal liability if their
acts were required to prevent immediate, serious harm and there was
no other way to achieve their goal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli human rights groups argue that the ``necessity defense''
applies only after the fact and in extreme cases, and cannot serve
as a prior authorization for routine abuse.
</P>
<P>
   They cite findings by the U.N. Committee Against Torture, which
has called Israeli interrogation methods torture or ill-treatment,
which are banned by the 1984 convention. While the committee
acknowledged that Israel faces a ``terrible dilemma'' in fighting
terrorism, it asserted that ``no public emergency of any kind
justifies the use of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   To support this position, the Public Committee Against Torture
in Israel, one of the groups petitioning the court, submitted an
affidavit by the lawyer for Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in
the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No efforts were made to question or interrogate McVeigh
outside the presence of his attorneys,'' the lawyer, Robert Nigh,
said. ``Mr. McVeigh was never subjected to physical abuse by any
law enforcement officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Oyediran, an Amnesty International observer at the latest
Supreme Court hearing, said that in failing so far to issue a
ruling, the court had neglected its duty.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The AdOne Classified Network, the premier Internet
classifieds business, announced Monday that the company and its
ClassifiedWarehouse.com consumer Web site have been acquired by a
consortium of leading U.S. media companies including The Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership projects that ClassifiedWarehouse.com's
classified advertising database, which averages more than three
million new ads per month, will grow to in excess of six million
new classifieds per month by the end of the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, known as AdOne, L.L.C., is the first purely
Internet start-up backed by a consortium composed of blue-chip
traditional media and new media companies. Lycos Inc., the second
most visited Internet portal, will play an important role in the
new partnership through its distribution agreement with AdOne and
ClassifiedWarehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   George B. Irish, president of Hearst Newspapers and vice
president of The Hearst Corporation, said Hearst's investment in
AdOne was ``a good fit with our strategy of competing locally with
our newspapers' electronic classifieds and nationally with Lycos'
distribution and content.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hearst, the acquiring media consortium includes
MediaNews Group, the seventh largest newspaper company in the
United States, The E.W. Scripps Company, a diversified media
company and the nation's 10th largest newspaper publisher; Advance
Publications Inc., a diversified media company publishing
newspapers in 22 markets, and Donrey Media Group, a wholly-owned
affiliate of Stephens Group, Inc., of Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled these blue-chip media companies have chosen to
back our vision of an open network composed of locally-based
classified advertising from premium media properties in large,
medium and small markets,'' said Brendan Burns, the president and
CEO of AdOne, L.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``AdOne brought together this unique group of high-caliber
traditional and new media companies because of their strong belief
in our inclusive corporate partnership philosophy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said AdOne has been successful because the company
bolsters its affiliates' positions as the most significant
information hubs in their local communities.
</P>
<P>
   The new AdOne, affiliated media partners, and the company's
ClassifiedWarehouse.com consumer site are solidly positioned to
play the leading role in the rapidly expanding $123 million online
classifieds marketplace _ a market which industry experts predict
will grow to nearly $2 billion by 2002, according to Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said that, with completion of the acquisition, AdOne and
its ClassifiedWarehouse.com consumer site will feature:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strong backing from four of the top 10 U.S. newspaper media
companies and a leading Internet portal;
</P>
<P>
   _ Significant market penetration in 38 of the top 50 U.S. media
markets;
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 350 affiliated media properties in the top 50 U.S.
media markets;
</P>
<P>
   _ The highest quality, most comprehensive collection of Internet
classifieds updated daily from leading newspapers and top-brand
online providers;
</P>
<P>
   _ A classifieds database predicted to grow to in excess of six
million new classifieds per month by mid-1999; and
</P>
<P>
   _ Established distribution deals with leading Internet brands
such as Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium was brought together as a result of a commitment
in the third quarter of 1998 from MediaNews Group, as the
consortium's lead investor, coupled with strategic initiatives
completed by AdOne's management team during the third and fourth
quarters of 1998.

REGIONAL LEADERS SUSPEND SANCTIONS ON BURUNDI
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: East Africa) 
(DW) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ East African leaders voted Saturday to
suspend the economic sanctions they had imposed more than two years
ago on Burundi, a tiny nation whose troubles have cast a large
shadow over the region.
</P>
<P>
   The move was one of several steps that heads of state took here
this week aimed at increasing cooperation among countries in East
Africa. The talks specifically sought a firmer place in the region
for Burundi and Rwanda, two countries still searching for stability
after the ethnic violence that claimed hundreds of thousands lives
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the heads of state from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania
pledged to admit Rwanda into their plans for an East African
Community. Slated to begin this July, the community is an ambitious
effort to integrate the economic lives of more than 80 million
people through a trading block that would eventually share
passports, public works and currency.
</P>
<P>
   Though Burundi has not even applied, it was a measure of the
high hopes for the community, as well as for Burundi itself, that
the nation seemed all but admitted anyway. ``If Burundi applies,
its application will be treated favorably,'' said Francis Muthaura,
executive secretary of the Commission for East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed friendliness toward Burundi could not have
contrasted more to another meeting here in July 1996, when the same
countries gathered to protest a coup led by Maj. Pierre Buyoya.
Buyoya contended that he took power to end fighting that began in
1993 between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-controlled Army. But the
other African leaders then imposed what they pledged would be a
strictly enforced embargo on trade with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was that most goods seeped through anyway. But
supporters of the sanctions argued that they caused enough economic
trouble that Buyoya, who is Tutsi, complied with his neighbors'
demands that he share power with Hutu opposition groups and begin
peace talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth round of peace talks began here this week. Saturday,
Buyoya _ now addressed as ``Mr. President'' by his peers _ pledged
to remained committed to the peace talks even in the absence of
sanctions. ``The government of Burundi shall leave no stone
unturned to assure that we arrive at a peace agreement that is
all-inclusive by the end of this year,'' Buyoya told heads of state
and top ministers from states including Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya,
Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Nyerere, the former Tanzanian president, who is also the
negotiator for the Burundi talks, had opposed lifting the sanctions
out of fear that the peace talks would in fact collapse. The
leaders underscored that the sanctions were only being suspended
and could be reimposed any time until representative democracy is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should understand the meaning of suspension,'' Daniel
arap Moi, president of Kenya, said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sanctions initially won support among other African
nations, critics have argued with increasing force that they were
hurting average Burundians, for whom the cost of some basic goods
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also argued that the sanctions were beginning to
endanger the peace negotiations, in part because Buyoya's Tutsi
opponents complain that he has conceded much to the ethnic Hutu but
has received little in return. The Hutu make up 85 percent of
Burundi's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifting of sanctions is a very important signal from the
regional leadership to Burundians that they really do recognize
their sacrifices and the government's commitment to the peace
process,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``It is also a way of taking away ammunition from those
within Burundi who are still resisting negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, defended the sanctions
as having achieved results through a deliberate and coordinated
strategy rather than violence. ``We have got plenty of conflicts in
Africa'' he said. ``However the way they are handled is sort of
sometimes ad hoc. We don't give enough time to the dealing of these
problems.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The potent jet-stream disturbance that spawned severe
thunderstorms across the South in the past few days will weaken as
it splits over the middle Atlantic and southeast seaboards,
diminishing the threat of severe weather Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some showers and thunderstorms will already be in progress
across southeast Florida early Sunday morning, but only isolated
incidents of strong gusts or hail are possible as energetic
jet-stream winds quickly lift northeast away from the state. In
their wake, a sluggish, weak upper-level low-pressure system will
touch off a few spotty showers over the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the risk of moderate to locally heavy rains will
lessen after the first part of the day from the eastern Carolinas
to southeast New York as a cold front and a trailing, weakening
jet-stream disturbance push off the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and mild, gusty winds from the south will also start to
diminish along the New England seaboard during the day as the cold
front forges east. However, gusts to 40 mph are possible Sunday
morning in some coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavy snow will develop in the central and southern
Sierra Nevada of California as a potent upper-level low-pressure
system near San Francisco forces Pacific moisture to glide up the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few thunderstorms will also develop underneath the
lofty low across parts of central and southern California. Farther
east, moist Pacific winds will give rise to mountain snows across
parts of Nevada, Utah, western Wyoming and northwest Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Severe Storms
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms stampeded across the South on Friday night,
inflicting damage on Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. By
definition, a storm is ranked ``severe'' if it produces one or any
combination of the following three kinds of weather: tornadoes,
wind gusts of 50 knots or greater (57 mph), hail at least
three-quarters of an inch in diameter. A thunderstorm that produces
heavy rain and flooding does not constitute ``severe'' weather.
Instead of issuing severe thunderstorm warnings in these cases, the
National Weather Service posts flood warnings or flash flood
warnings.

`DOLLARIZATION' BY ARGENTINA HITS RESISTANCE

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ The Argentine government's announcement this week
that it would consider replacing its currency with the dollar over
the next several years has soothed the concerns of international
investors that Argentina might follow Brazil's example and devalue
its currency, the peso.
</P>
<P>
   But sharp attacks by the opposition, which controls the lower
house of Congress and leads in opinion polls before presidential
elections, has dimmed the likelihood that the proposal will get
very far. American officials said Saturday that they doubted
Argentina would decide to ``dollarize'' its economy unless it came
under dire pressure from an economic meltdown in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using the dollar, as Panama currently does, was
discussed at a Cabinet meeting Thursday and is said to be something
that President Carlos Saul Menem has considered before.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a trial balloon, the Central Bank
president, Pedro Pou, told reporters this week that a ``monetary
association treaty'' with the United States could eventually lead
to a common currency across the Americas, much like the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   Menem has the power to decree the change. The conversion would
not be very difficult since the peso is already pegged one-to-one
to the dollar, dollars are commonly accepted in commercial
transactions here, and a large proportion of capital kept in
Argentina banks is in dollars. But Pou said that rather than act
alone, the government would seek to negotiate a treaty with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such a treaty would require the consent not only of the U. S.
Senate and both houses of the Argentine Congress but also of
whoever is elected to replace Menem as president early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, including the mayor of Buenos Aires,
Fernando de la Rua, the candidate who has a healthy lead in the
polls, expressed nationalistic scorn for the idea. ``It's not very
serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Embassy officials said they were surprised by the
announcement. ``There are no formal negotiations or discussions
under way,'' one said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But
they have informed us of their interest and ideas.''

<P>
   PENDLETON, S.C. _ In this stretch of the Bible Belt where
highways are punctuated with billboards about ``Heaven. Hell. The
Choice Is Yours,'' it was one hellish bad week.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts most is the impeachment trial in Washington. It has
become painfully obvious here that the Senate will not convict
President Clinton. In this community that perceives itself as a
fire wall against indecency, many people sound despondent. They say
the nation will pay a terrible price for winking at the president's
sins.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as hurtful are Clinton's soaring approval ratings. With
poll after poll reminding them that they are out of step with the
rest of the country, people here say they feel isolated. Many
suspect that the polls are rigged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found anybody who doesn't want to throw his butt
out, and I deliver appliances all over this country,'' complained
Johnny Landreth Jr., owner of Landreth Appliances, who was eating a
fried-chicken lunch beneath the ``No Swearing'' sign at Bill's Cafe
on Highway 76. ``Either the pollsters are asking the wrong
questions or this country is so wrong morally that we are going
down the tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing salt in last week's wounds, as people here perceive it,
was that ``show business'' State of the Union speech that polls
said Americans loved so much, along with the endless broadcasts of
the president's lawyers attacking the House case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of voters here and across South Carolina
disapprove of Clinton and want him removed by the Senate, according
to an early January poll by Richard Quinn, a Republican political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is immune to Bill Clinton's charms,'' said
Quinn, whose office is in Columbia, and who has done presidential
polling here since 1980. ``We know him too well. He is seen by
voters here as the prototype of the Southern con artist.''
</P>
<P>
   This state is reliably one of the most conservative in the
South. With the exception of Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign, voters
have not chosen a Democrat in a presidential election since 1964.
The state Legislature in 1996 banned same-sex marriages. That same
year the Greenville County Council, representing one of the state's
most prosperous regions, declared homosexuality incompatible with
community standards.
</P>
<P>
   Political antipathy toward Clinton's policies and religious
outrage over his involvement with a White House intern have mingled
here in the western edge of the state with home-grown pride in the
case for conviction. Rep. Lindsey Graham, a Republican who serves
this part of the state, is one of the House prosecutors, or
managers, making oral arguments against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People here smile with satisfaction when describing Graham's
just-folksy arguments against the president in the Senate chamber
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from Washington, Graham said he can feel the
rage that's bubbling up across his district over Clinton's likely
acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty tough,'' said Graham, whose office gets angry
calls whenever he concedes on talk shows that the president's
defenders may have a point. ``They are letting me know in no
uncertain terms what they think of this guy. There is probably
nothing I could say about the president that would be too out of
bounds for my constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bill's Cafe, Landreth's wife, Linda, described Clinton's
probable acquittal as a frightening signal of trouble down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The president's behavior, she said, is a modern-day re-enactment
of the biblical story of David, king of the Israelites, and
Bathsheba, a married woman not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at Bathsheba and instead of going back in his house,
he sent for her and had adultery with her and the Lord made him
pay,'' Mrs. Landreth said. ``Now, why was Clinton with Monica
Lewinsky when he should have been in his own house with Hillary? I
think it means that this country is going to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   The district that Graham represents, which snakes along the
state's western border with Georgia, from the Savannah River
nuclear power site up to the North Carolina border, percolates with
a noisy mix of religious and entrepreneurial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regional economy is as good as we can remember in our
lifetimes,'' said Burrell Nelson, executive director of the
Economic Development Alliance of Pickens County.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, at 2.8 percent, is far below the national average.
Nelson said that a boom in metal-working, plastics and chemical
industries means that just 1,500 people are without jobs in a
county of 104,000. The region has also been inundated with
retirement and vacation development, as well as new industrial
parks and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Up County, as it is called here, has clung tenaciously
amid the boom to its fundamentalist Christian roots. On every
highway there are billboards and church signs warning, ``Watch
Thoughts Before They Become Works,'' and asking, ``Troubled? Have
You Tried Prayer?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Feed Place cafe in the town of Pickens, where a ``meat
and three'' _ that is, a choice of meat and three vegetables _ goes
for $5.25, the men's room does not have condom machines. Instead,
there are ``salvation'' brochures stacked on the toilet. They show
a life preserver labeled ``CHRIST'' being thrown to a man swimming
in a stormy sea labeled ``SIN.''
</P>
<P>
   National indifference to sin is a nagging problem that several
top students at Pickens High School say they worry about,
especially as it applies to what Clinton has been up to in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president can commit perjury and get away with it, does
that mean the next president can do something even worse and get
away with it?'' asked Amy Garrison, 17, a senior who has been
admitted to the engineering program at nearby Clemson University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Echoing an argument that Graham made on the Senate floor last
Saturday, Ms. Garrison said that ``if the Senate can kick out
federal judges for lying and obstructing justice, why should the
president be above the law?''
</P>
<P>
   In Graham's home town of Seneca, where about 80 churches serve a
population of 12,000 people, Pastor Bill Rinehart of the United
Assembly of God Church said his congregants are struggling to
perform their Christian duty to ``love and accept'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   That duty conflicts with the equally important Christian
obligations to teach values to children, Rinehart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you do this when the president is a sociopath?'' asked
Rinehart, whose 500-member church has a Web site, which is called
www.extremechurch.org. ``Anarchy has got to be somewhere down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastor compared Clinton's future to that of Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, whose execution by a firing squad was
broadcast to the world in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Rinehart said that while he is ``frustrated'' by national polls
showing that the president is more popular than ever, there are
countless precedents showing that majorities can be horribly
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roman Empire fell because the majority of the people were
hedonistic and self-gratifying,'' Rinehart said, adding that he
finds disturbing American parallels to Rome's fall, in particular
the public's willingness to put economic good times above ``honor
and truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Irked but less apocalyptic, Ralph Gleaton, Pickens County
assistant prosecutor, said the expected acquittal of the president
in the Senate reminds him of criminal cases he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same frustration I felt when I believed a jury knew a
defendant to be guilty and chose to let him go anyway,'' said
Gleaton, a prosecutor for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Gleaton, though, said he has been forced to learn to live with
losing cases that, in a just world, he should have won. In the same
fashion, he expects that he and other angry people in South
Carolina will figure out a way to live with the president's
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to tell you, in all honesty, I don't worry about it that
much,'' Gleaton said. ``If he is not convicted, the sun will still
rise in the east and my dog will still lick my face.''

   Only an hour after Brian Billick was hired as the coach of the
Baltimore Ravens last Tuesday, he was on his way to Mobile, Ala.,
for a week of Senior Bowl practices. There were also interviews
with assistant coaching candidates because he has a staff to
assemble.
</P>
<P>
   Put hundreds of chatty coaches in one spot, in this case to
scout players participating in Saturday's Senior Bowl, and rumors
will fly, and Billick, the former offensive coordinator of the
Minnesota Vikings, was at the center of a lot of them. There was
talk that Billick was interested in hiring Johnnie Lynn, the
Giants' defensive backs coach, as his defensive coordinator,
although the former Ravens coordinator Marvin Lewis is a strong
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There was also talk that Billick and his former boss, Coach
Dennis Green, had agreed on a trade involving the Vikings' backup
quarterback, Brad Johnson. The Ravens would get Johnson for a No. 1
pick in April's draft, and then the Vikings would select a
linebacker or a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year,'' Billick said, ``especially with all of
the coaching changes, the rumors are flying. You can't believe half
of them. Nothing has been settled about Brad.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe this: The landscape of the National Football League has
taken another dramatic shift. Billick was only one of the eight
head coaching changes this year. In the end, there were some
surprising, and not so surprising, aspects to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, Green Bay, Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City,
Baltimore, San Diego and Carolina changed coaches. And Miami almost
did.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his job in St. Louis, coach Dick Vermeil had to dismiss
several assistants. To keep his sanity, Dolphins coach Jimmy
Johnson hired as his assistant Dave Wannstedt, who had been fired
by the Bears. Chicago, recently one of the worst-run teams in
football, was supposed to announce the hiring of Arizona's
defensive coordinator, Dave McGinnis, as its head coach. A news
conference was scheduled, then canceled. The Bears would not say
why.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Marty Schottenheimer of the Chiefs resigned, and Kansas
City hired from within, picking its defensive coordinator, Gunther
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns chose Chris Palmer, the offensive
coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars, as the first coach of
their new team.
</P>
<P>
   There were three black head coaches in the National Football
League before the latest openings. There are still three black head
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, ownership wisely did not fire Coach Steve
Mariucci, who has yet to lose a regular-season home game, but
brought back Bill Walsh, the man who won four Super Bowls in the
1980s, as general manager. Terry Donahue, a former UCLA coach, was
hired as the team's director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   What do all the changes mean? Clearly, coaches like Bill
Parcells of the New York Jets and Dan Reeves of the Atlanta Falcons
have changed the rules of the game. Both men took sorry
organizations and turned them around in just two years, Parcells
leading the Jets to the American Football Conference title game
this year and Reeves leading Atlanta into Super Bowl XXXIII. It is
the fourth Super Bowl for Reeves, who has lost in his first three.
</P>
<P>
   Quick turnarounds like those create pressure on every other
team. It is a part of what at times can be a cruel profession.
</P>
<P>
   Or a joyous one. The key for three of the four teams that
reached the final four _ the Jets, Atlanta, and Minnesota _ is that
each team worried about right now, not five years from now. One of
the first critical moves of these franchises was to sign a veteran
quarterback. The Jets signed Vinny Testaverde, Minnesota signed
Randall Cunningham and Atlanta traded for Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had been with Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Baltimore,
where he was cut last year. But he excelled in the Jets' system,
playing with more weapons than ever. The same could be said for
Chandler, who had been with Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Arizona, St.
Louis and others before having a Pro Bowl season with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting to develop a quarterback, these coaches took
their chances with veterans, and the gambles paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to win this game as best you can,'' Parcells said this
month. ``People get caught up in `You've got to make this move for
next year.' Then next year never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   More pressure to win also means more responsibilities and less
time to have a life. Johnson cited this as one reason he almost
stepped down this month. The stress of the job almost certainly
contributed to Reeves' having heart surgery about five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get less time to relax, way less time,'' Parcells said.
``It used to be after the last game of the season was over unless
you went to the Super Bowl. Between then and the draft, you could
work at your own pace. Now, the minute we're out of the playoffs,
I've got the expansion list to turn in. I'm a month from free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from one thing to the other, then the combine, the
draft, minicamps. Then you can't take rookies until June 1. That
takes your summer. There's less time to recharge. That's what gets
some of these guys. One thing to the other and the other and
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, getting to a Super Bowl can ease all pains. Just
ask Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb Moves Into Top 10  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb has impressed scouts so much
that some think he has improved his draft position significantly,
and is now not just a bottom pick in the first round. He has most
likely elevated himself to the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League scouts like McNabb's strong arm,
mobility and smarts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would love to take him at No. 16, but he probably
will not last that long. Some scouts think the St. Louis Rams,
tired of the inconsistent Tony Banks, will grab McNabb at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the Giants will take an offensive lineman, like
Wisconsin offensive tackle Aaron Gibson. &QL;

 &HT;    Not a bad carreer for Torre
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Torre holds one record unmatched in the major leagues,
probably in all baseball. He played for three teams, later managed
all three, then was fired by all three. Eventually he will be fired
by a fourth, for isn't that the inevitable fate of every manager of
the Yankees? Billy Martin holds the record of four, Steinbrenner
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was first a victim of the New York Mets, a short cab ride
from the borough where he grew up. The Braves came next, to be
followed by the St. Louis Cardinals, but it is Atlanta with which
he has had an ongoing relationship from the time he was 13 years
old, going on 14. He came to visit his brother, Frank, who was
playing first base for the highly esteemed Atlanta Crackers, and
who would win the Southern Association pennant in 1954. Whitlow
Wyatt managed, Dick Donovan, Leo Cristante, Frank DiPrima and Chuck
Tanner, the same, were stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the ones I remember best,'' Torre said. ''I remember
the all-star game, too. They had to put up ropes to hold back the
crowd in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   He suited up and worked out, but no one would ever had suspected
that that fat little kid would ever see the inside of a major
league uniform. Hit the first home run in a National League game in
Atlanta Stadium, set a record for home runs by a Braves catcher,
that still stands, and win the Most Valuable Player prize, as he
did as a Cardinal in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he burst into bloom so fast created early problems
in his life. The trade to St. Louis cleared his head. He was a
carouser in Atlanta, lived in the fast lane, and too often drove in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't dodge that,'' he said. ''When you get traded for the
first time, it opens your eyes. You take stock of yourself. The
Cardinals had just won two pennants and the year I left, the Braves
won a championship. I knew I'd better get my act in order.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during a party in one of those beachside villas at Palm
Beach, during spring training in 1969, that Paul Richards came down
the stairs, announcing with unbridled happiness that Torre had been
traded to St. Louis for Orlando Cepeda. Later, though, Torre and
Richards would bury the hatchet, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran into him at Dodger Stadium one day, when I was managing
the Braves, and we shook hands and made up,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   He never played in a World Series, and ''that left a void in my
career.'' Now he has managed and won two, in his hometown, only
home-grown New Yorker ever to manage the Yankees. All the way from
Clark Griffith down through Miller Huggins, Casey Stengel and the
not so immortal Stump Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't imagine how exciting it is. You walk into a
restaurant and they give you a standing ovation. That makes New
York a small town to me. I remember when I was first with
Milwaukee, a reporter asked me what my ambition was, and I said,
'To play in the big leagues.'
</P>
<P>
   ''An old timer sitting close by said, 'No, you want to star in
the big leagues.' I never forgot that.''
</P>
<P>
   In between managing the Braves and the Cardinals, Torre spent
six seasons broadcasting Angels game on television, hand-picked by
Gene Autry. During most of this time, Marietta was his home. Like a
first date, there's nothing like first memories, the year of '54.
They cling like ivy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tallest building in town was the Fulton National Bank.
Ponce de Leon Park was a ballplayers' dream. I stayed just up the
street at the old Poncey Hotel. Cokes cost a nickel. Earl Mann
owned the Crackers, all those things still stick in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He had returned this time, the American League Manager of the
Year, as the main man at the Georgia Tech Baseball Benefit at the
Marriott Marquis. He spoke to a sold-out house, like a hero
returned. ''Last night,'' he said, ''I spoke at the Rochester
Institute of Technology. Now tonight at Georgia Institute of
Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned. ''How's that for a guy who took four and a half
years to get through high school?''

 &HT;    Inside Pro Basketball: Hill has no great love for ex-Dukie
Laettner
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fun is only beginning in Detroit, where Grant Hill has made
it clear he does not have a warm relationship _ or any other sort
of relationship _ with his old Duke teammate Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently what he thought about his ``buddy'' Laettner
joining the Pistons, Hill shot back, ``Who says he's my buddy?''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, although they won two NCAA titles together at
Duke, Hill and Laettner never were buddies and haven't had a
relationship since Laettner left school in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to popular belief, us Dukies don't stick together all
that much,'' Hill said. ``He's a different person now, and I am a
different person. I don't know him as well now as I did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill concedes that he admires the former Hawk forward's
competitiveness, but he qualifies that after Laettner's indifferent
season with the Hawk. ``Any time you bring in free agents, you're
rolling the dice,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Dumars told me that you never really know a guy until you
play with him,'' Hill said. ``You think you know from afar, but
until you go through a season, through all the practices and
travel, only then do you know what a guy is truly like.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Christian is at a point where he wants to win.
Some things didn't go well in Atlanta, for whatever reason. But he
knows how to play, he's been an All-Star, and he knows how to win.
He will make us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess' angst
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess' coming home party in Denver turned into farce
Thursday night, the Nuggets calling off a 3 p.m. press conference
while McDyess suffered a severe case of angst over his decision to
accept $20 million less than the Suns were offering him to remain
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A tearful phone call brought three Suns players, Jason Kidd, Rex
Chapman and George McCloud, to McNicholds arena, site of the news
conference, in hopes they could bring McDyess back with them. The
players sat in a long white limo for hours awaiting McDyess'
decision before he finally agreed to the deal at 1 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess apparently could not deal with the news that the Nuggets
were renouncing his friend LaPhonso Ellis in order to make cap room
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice surgery a ploy?
</P>
<P>
   Agent David Falk denies that Glen Rice's flirtation with surgery
on his non-shooting elbow is linked to unhappiness with his
contract. Rice's injury is not ``a thinly veiled attempt at a
holdout,'' Falk insists, although Rice has complained for two years
because the Hornets refuse to rework the remainder of his contract,
which calls for salaries of $5.4 and $7.1 million. Rice has a
floating chip in his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's ever going to hold out, he'd have done it last year,''
said Falk, who asked the team to renegotiate last year on a deal
that would have paid him an average of $9 million per year through
the year 2003-04.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rice's absence from camp came five days after he told
The Gaston Gazette he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a
holdout if his contract were not reworked.
</P>
<P>
   Dark days ahead for Bulls
</P>
<P>
   File these items away for future reference:
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls can become the second NBA champion to finish below
.500. That happened last to the Celtics after Bill Russell retired
in 1969. Satch Sanders recalls, ``We all got on Russell and begged
him not to quit because we knew without him there would certainly
be, to put it mildly, difficulty. But he felt his time was up. He
wanted to get into other things, so he left.''
</P>
<P>
   First-round pick Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor says he wants to be
a Milwaukee Buck for life. ``I was pushing my agent all summer to
let me buy a house in Milwaukee,'' Traylor said. ``Milwaukee is a
good place for me. This is where I want to be. I don't want to be
one of those guys bouncing all over the league. I want to make a
commitment here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the newly rotund Shawn Kemp says he actually missed Mike
Fratello during the lockout. ``Mike is similar to George Karl,''
Kemp said. ``He challenges me, and I enjoy playing for a coach who
challenges me. He has no problem asking you to go out and do
something maybe you didn't do the week before. You miss him getting
on you about that.'' Kemp must have really missed Fratello when he
sat down to eat. He came in 30 pounds over his playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Aching Pacers
</P>
<P>
   Is the Indiana Dynasty to be stillborn? Before camp even
started, Rik Smits complained of sore feet, Dale Davis a neck
injury and Derrick McKey a back strain.
</P>
<P>
   Said Smits: ``It might be in some practices I can only go an
hour and a half or so. It will probably be the same as last year.
But maybe (the feet) will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   McKey had offseason knee surgery and now is having back
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Laker promises
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West started the week in L.A. talking about Tom Gugliotta,
Scottie Pippen, Kevin Johnson and Derrick Coleman. He ended up with
Travis Knight and Derek Harper. ``I don't know nothing,'' Shaquille
O'Neal said. ``They asked me who do I want. I said a couple names.
I look around, those couple names signed somewhere else. So, I
don't know what's going on.''

CLINTON'S MEDICARE PLAN MEANS BIG DEBATE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., La.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is proposing a major expansion of
Medicare to cover prescription drugs, a change long sought by older
Americans, and a federal advisory commission may soon endorse the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But drug companies are gearing up to fight any plan for the
government to provide prescription drugs as a basic benefit in the
traditional Medicare program. They fear that it would lead to
federal regulation of drug prices, which is anathema to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers also fear that private insurers would follow the
government's example and demand discounts as deep as any made
available to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is thus preparing for a major debate over prescription
drugs. Rep. Pete Stark of California and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, both Democrats, are drafting bills to authorize
Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine,
has a bill that would help Medicare beneficiaries get drugs at
reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans agree that there is a need to help the elderly with
drug expenses, though they tend to favor more modest plans.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message last week, Clinton said that
he wanted to use the federal budget surplus to shore up Social
Security and Medicare and that Medicare should cover ``the greatest
growing need of seniors: affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton foresees a total of $4.4 trillion in surpluses over the
next 15 years, and he would use $1 of every $6 _ $650 billion to
$700 billion _ for Medicare. The White House said on Thursday that
Clinton wanted to replenish the Medicare trust fund while also
providing ``a long-overdue prescription-drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   For many elderly people, drug costs are a heavy burden. Spending
on prescription drugs has increased at a brisk pace, not so much
because the prices of older drugs are rising as because people are
using more drugs, and some new, highly effective medications have
high prices _ $10,000 a year or more. The Food and Drug
Administration is approving more drugs, and doctors say that many
of the new products are clearly superior to the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and lobbyists for the elderly said that
prescription drugs, though often costly, were essential to any
respectable health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the federal advisory
commission studying the future of Medicare, said, ``Drugs are as
important today as a hospital bed was in 1965,'' when Medicare was
created. Breaux said that drug benefits would simply update
Medicare to make it comparable to the health insurance offered by
most private employers with more than 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are likely to become even more important, because the
industry, in the words of its lobbyists, is entering a golden age
of medical and scientific discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have developed dozens of products to treat
afflictions of the elderly, including heart disease, stroke,
rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis.
Researchers are working on drugs to treat or prevent Alzheimer's
disease and may soon be able to tailor drugs to genetic needs.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Medicare prescription-drug coverage would depend on
the generosity of the benefit and other factors, but even the
strongest proponents admit that it would be expensive. The Medicare
commission is studying several options. A relatively modest drug
benefit would cost the government $10 billion to $15 billion a
year, it said, and could add $9 or $10 to the monthly Medicare
premium, now $45.50, which is deducted from a person's Social
Security check.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not pay for drugs used by patients
outside the hospital. But Medicare officials said that 80 percent
of beneficiaries regularly used prescription drugs, reflecting the
high incidence of chronic illnesses among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   A new government study says that 65 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries have supplemental insurance to help pay drug costs,
while 35 percent have no such coverage. Premiums for private
insurance covering prescription drugs are often high, and there is
no guarantee that the people who need coverage can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, published this month by the Commonwealth Fund,
said that 11 percent of beneficiaries spent more than $100 a month
of their own money on prescription drugs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American
Association of Retired Persons, said: ``We have long favored the
addition of prescription-drug coverage to Medicare. The lack of a
drug benefit is really dumb medicine. Drugs keep people healthier
and out of hospitals.'' Drug therapy often reduces the need for
hospitalization, surgery and nursing-home care, which can be much
more expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, the main trade association for drug
companies, said, ``Any expansion of prescription-drug coverage for
Medicare beneficiaries should come through the private sector and
not through the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said: ``It's very important that any reform should
be fully financed, without resorting to government-imposed price
controls. Such controls distort the marketplace, they reduce the
incentive to innovate and our industry would vigorously oppose
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare commission is considering a proposal under which
the government would offer a fixed amount of money to each
beneficiary to buy insurance covering a comprehensive package of
health benefits, including doctors' services, hospital care and
possibly prescription drugs. Under such a plan, drug companies say,
Medicare patients could obtain drug coverage through competing
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers provide coverage of prescription drugs for their
retirees, and many health-maintenance organizations offer drug
coverage to elderly subscribers, though they are not required to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies and members of the Medicare commission want to
maintain these sources of drug coverage. If Congress establishes a
drug benefit under Medicare, they say, it must be careful not to
create an excuse for HMOs and employers to drop the drug benefits
they now provide.
</P>
<P>
   If the government created a Medicare drug benefit, it would
become acutely concerned about drug costs. Drug companies insist
that the government must not establish a list of approved drugs for
Medicare beneficiaries or a uniform national price list. On the
other hand, administration officials and congressional Democrats
say Medicare ought to get substantial discounts because it would be
one of the nation's biggest purchasers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers often follow Medicare's payment policies, and
that possibility worries drug companies. ``Seniors account for
one-third of the market,'' said Holmer, the president of the
pharmaceutical association. ``Any practices that would affect such
a large proportion of patients become trend setters for all health
plans, for better or for worse.''

VOLCKER AUDIT ON HOLOCAUST COULD YIELD $750 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A search by independent auditors for unclaimed deposits
placed in Switzerland between 1933 and 1945 is expected to conclude
by the end of March and to turn up funds that would now be worth
about three-quarters of a billion dollars with interest, Swiss bank
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, which is overseen by a committee headed by Paul
Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, was the result of a
1996 agreement between Swiss banks and Jewish organizations to
search for funds deposited by people who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides stressed that the commission had not yet
obtained all the audited data, but that it had so far found about
100 million Swiss francs, the equivalent of about $73 million at
current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that not all the funds had been deposited by
people who later died in Nazi death camps. Moreover, the task of
matching the names of depositors with those of Holocaust victims is
only about one-quarter done and could take years to complete, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit has progressed independently of a settlement reached
in August by Swiss banks to pay $1.25 billion to Holocaust
survivors to resolve class action suits in the United States and
thus avoid a possible boycott of the banks' business. It has been
overshadowed in recent months by a flurry of lawsuits against banks
and insurers in other European countries and manufacturers accused
of profiting from the use of forced labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banking groups say they hope the results of the audit will
lay to rest disputes over how much money from Holocaust victims
remains in Switzerland. But even as the work draws to a close, some
Swiss bankers are complaining of excessive costs for the audit,
which they say could run as high as $700 million. Other officials
say such estimates are overdrawn, but several regional banks
announced recently that they were suspending payment of the
auditing fees, which the banks agreed to cover, until the matter of
pricing is cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, more than 200 auditors from four international
accounting firms _ Arthur Andersen, KPMG Peat Marwick, Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, and PricewaterhouseCoopers _ have scoured the records of 26
private and publicly owned Swiss banks, including the two largest,
UBS and Credit Suisse, after an agreement was reached in May 1996
to search for unclaimed funds deposited between 1933 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Banking officials say the auditors have largely completed that
task and are now engaged in matching the names of account holders
with lists of Holocaust victims. Earlier this month, the Swiss
banks agreed to put up $4 million to match a contribution from the
World Jewish Congress to pay for computer storage of the lists of 3
million Holocaust victims from the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel.
These are intended to facilitate the matching of names.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the commission headed by Volcker, with three members
each appointed by Jewish organizations and the Swiss banks, is
expected to meet in Zurich, Switzerland, to discuss the auditing
process and to begin preparing a report.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Swiss weekly, Sonntagszeitung, reported
that Swiss banking officials expected the audit to turn up about
100 million Swiss francs. Michael Bradfield, a spokesman for
Volcker, refused to confirm the figure, saying, ``We are just
beginning to get hard data'' from the auditing firms.
</P>
<P>
   But Swiss bank officials, who requested anonymity, said they
believed the figure to be accurate. They said 100 million Swiss
francs would be equivalent today to 1 billion francs, based on a
formula developed by a team of experts appointed by Volcker to take
account of inflation and interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Bradfield, who was general counsel at the Federal Reserve under
Volcker, said that not all the funds had been deposited by people
who died in the Holocaust, adding that only about 28 percent of the
matching work has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the $8 million spent on computerizing the Yad Vashem
files, many account holders may never be identified. Spellings of
names often vary, and some depositors who later perished may have
used lawyers, fiduciaries, and financial trustees inside
Switzerland to open accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonntagszeitung said officials at three cantonal banks,
citing the high costs of the audit, said they had suspended payment
of auditing fees. The newspaper quoted Kaspar Ottiger, director of
the cantonal bank in Schaffhausen, as saying that the costs of the
audit ``are in no proportion to the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Felix, spokesman for the Swiss Bankers Association,
said: ``Our interest is to bring the process to a successful
conclusion, to produce a report with a clear statement about the
role of the banks in the period of the war.''

QUIETLY, TEAM OF LAWYERS WHO DISLIKED CLINTON KEPT JONES' CASE
ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., Md., Texas, Ark., Conn., Va.) (Eds: SUBS 8th graf, Marcus did ..., to fix garble.)  
(DW) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JILL ABRAMSON 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This time last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton
described, in a now-famous appearance on the NBC News program
``Today,'' how a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' was trying to
destroy her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, some of the most serious damage to Bill
Clinton's presidency came not from his high-profile political
enemies but from a small secret clique of lawyers in their 30s who
share a deep antipathy toward the president, according to nearly
two dozen interviews and recently filed court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers were deeply involved for nearly five years in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. They then helped push the
case into the criminal arena and into the office of the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader was Jerome M. Marcus, a 39-year-old associate
at the Philadelphia law firm of Berger &AMP; Montague, whose partners
are major contributors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Jones never met him or knew he had worked on her
behalf, Marcus was involved in virtually every important decision
and document in her lawsuit, according to billing records and
interviews with other lawyers who worked on the case. As much as
anyone else, he helped keep Ms. Jones' case alive in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus recruited others to assist his efforts, including several
friends from the University of Chicago Law School. One of those
approached, Paul Rosenzweig, briefly considered doing work for Ms.
Jones in 1994, according to billing records and interviews, but
decided not to. In November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office,
where he and Marcus had several telephone conversations about the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosenzweig who fielded a ``heads-up'' phone call from
Marcus on Jan. 8, 1998, that first tipped off Starr's office about
Monica S. Lewinsky and Linda R. Tripp. The tip was not mentioned in
the 445-page Starr report, even though it revived a moribund
Whitewater investigation that otherwise it now seems would not have
produced an impeachment referral to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus did make his views known publicly last month when he
wrote an impassioned commentary in The Washington Times urging the
impeachment of Clinton. ``The cancer is deadly,'' Marcus wrote.
``It, and its cause, must be removed.'' He identified himself in
the newspaper simply as ``a lawyer in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting Ms. Jones' lawsuit and helping Mrs. Tripp find her
way to Starr, Marcus found other allies, including another Chicago
law classmate, Richard W. Porter. Porter had worked as an aide to
former Vice President Dan Quayle and on the Bush-Quayle campaign,
where he did opposition research; he was a partner of Starr's at
the law firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Conway III, a New York lawyer educated at Yale, shared
Marcus' low view of Clinton. When the Jones case led to Ms.
Lewinsky, Marcus and Conway searched for a new lawyer for Mrs.
Tripp and encouraged her to take her explosive allegations to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are only now coming into focus, as a few of their
associates have begun to discuss their activities and their names
appear repeatedly in the final legal bills submitted by the
original Jones legal team. Marcus, Porter and Conway did not
respond to numerous phone and written requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the Senate this week, the president's
lawyers said that there was collusion between Starr's office, Mrs.
Tripp and the lawyers for Ms. Jones in the weeks leading up to the
president's deposition last January. If witnesses are called in the
Senate impeachment trial, the president's lawyers may explore the
issue further, several Clinton legal advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, denied there was
collusion between the independent counsel's office and the Jones
team, including Marcus. ``There was absolutely no conspiracy
between the Jones lawyers and our office,'' Bakaly said. ``Judge
Starr has testified to the circumstances as to how this matter came
to our attention, and the actions that we took thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his grand jury testimony in August that his
political enemies ``just thought they would take a wrecking ball to
me and see if they could do some damage.'' That wrecking ball was
wielded by Marcus and his colleagues, who managed to drive Paula
Jones' allegation of sexual misconduct into the courtroom and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, Porter and Rosenzweig were classmates at the University
of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1986. Conway met the others
through the Jones case. Some of the lawyers were also involved with
the Federalist Society, a legal group that includes conservative
and libertarian luminaries like Starr, Robert H. Bork and Richard
Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, the most overtly political member of the group, was also
an associate of Peter W. Smith, 62, a Chicago financier who was
once the chairman of College Young Republicans and a major donor to
Gopac, a conservative political group affiliated with former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Beginning in 1992, Smith spent more than
$80,000 to finance anti-Clinton research in an effort to persuade
the mainstream press to cover Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, according to the journalist David Brock, Smith helped
introduce him to the Arkansas state troopers who accused Clinton of
using them to procure women when he was governor of Arkansas. Brock
wrote an article based on the troopers' account of Clinton's sexual
escapades that was published in the January 1994 issue of The
American Spectator, a conservative magazine. According to Brock,
Smith wanted to establish a fund for the troopers, in case they
suffered retribution. Brock said he opposed payments because they
would undermine the troopers' credibility.
</P>
<P>
   To allay his concerns, Brock said, Smith urged him to speak to
Porter, who was then working at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, the Chicago law
firm that employed Starr in its Washington office. Brock said he
had hoped his talk with Porter would put an end to any planned
payments to the troopers, but Smith did pay them and their lawyers
$22,600. In 1992, Smith also paid Brock $5,000 to research another
bit of Arkansas sex lore regarding Clinton, a rumor that has since
proved to be baseless. Brock did not pursue an article.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's trooper article in The American Spectator mentioned a
woman identified only as ``Paula,'' and in May 1994, Ms. Jones
filed her lawsuit against Clinton. Ms. Jones' lawyers of record
were from the Washington area, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph
Cammarata, whom Marcus had helped recruit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Davis and Cammarata billing records show that from their
earliest involvement in the case, they were consulting with Marcus
and Porter. Conway also helped draft briefs, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were heavily involved,'' Cammarata said, ``but they
insisted that they not be identified, but that was fine with me. We
were just two guys involved in the middle of a world war, and we
had no guns. We needed all the help we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more important to the Jones case than Marcus. Besides
helping to write several important briefs, Marcus spoke numerous
times at the most critical moments in the case with Cammarata and
Davis, offering legal advice that Cammarata said was ``vital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the billing records, Porter also offered ``legal
strategy'' and once wrote a memo on ``investigative leads'' that
might embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter was a cheerleader,'' Cammarata said. ``He used to call
up and say, `Maybe we can find you some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's legal advisers said he noticed a marked
difference in quality between the routine legal pleadings filed by
the Cammarata and Davis team, and the highly polished, scholarly
briefs written by the shadow legal team headed by Marcus and
Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, meanwhile, was so successful at keeping the extent of
his role a secret that even Cammarata only found out recently that
Marcus helped recruit him, through a mutual acquaintance, to work
on the case. Marcus, Cammarata said, ``just told me recently that
he had a lot of trouble finding anyone to represent Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Marcus also briefly considered assisting the
Jones lawyers. In June 1994, Rosenzweig, a lawyer at a small law
firm in Washington, with experience working in the Justice
Department, ``expressed interest'' in doing legal work, but he did
none, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway wanted his role kept hidden as well, because his New York
law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, included influential
Democrats like Bernard W. Nussbaum, a former White House counsel.
Conway's name does not appear on any billing records.
</P>
<P>
   Although the billing records show communication between Porter
and the Jones lawyers from 1994 to 1997, he denied in a written
statement last fall doing legal work for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Because Porter is a partner at the firm where Starr worked until
he took a leave of absence last August, any role played by Porter
in the Jones case could have posed a conflict of interest for Starr
once he became independent counsel. Starr has said he did not
discuss the Jones case with Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has acknowledged contacts with Davis, specifically six
telephone discussions the two had in 1994, before Starr became
independent counsel. In fact, Starr has been criticized the phone
conversations to Attorney General Janet Reno, when he was seeking
to expand his investigation to the Lewinsky matter. Starr has said
it did not occur to him to mention the conversations because he did
not do work on the Jones case and simply offered his publicly
stated position on a point of constitutional law that presidents
are not immune from civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jones lawyers argued before the Supreme Court in May
1996, paving the way to the fateful 9-0 decision that the president
was not immune from civil lawsuits, Conway went to Washington for a
practice argument. He joined Davis, Cammarata, Bork and Theodore
Olson, a Washington lawyer and friend of Starr, at the Army-Navy
Club here.
</P>
<P>
   When Cammarata and Davis quit as Ms. Jones' lawyers after she
failed to reach a settlement with Clinton's lawyers in 1997, Marcus
and his colleagues established ties to her new lawyers at the
Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke and the
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., which helped pay her
legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rosenzweig went to work as a prosecutor in
Starr's office. From November to January, Rosenzweig spoke several
times by telephone with Marcus and discussed the Jones case, a
lawyer with knowledge of the conversations said. But Bakaly,
Starr's spokesman, said that Rosenzweig did not tell any of his
colleagues about what he learned about developments in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Mrs. Tripp was cooperating with the Jones lawyers.
She was also taping her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, which her
friend, Lucianne Goldberg, a Manhattan literary agent, had
incorrectly assured her was legal. In December, Mrs. Tripp became
frantic that she might be prosecuted because such taping is illegal
in Maryland, where Mrs. Tripp lives. Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg
thought of a possible solution: perhaps she could receive immunity
from prosecution from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg called Smith, the Chicago financier, and Porter for
advice on how Mrs. Tripp might approach Starr. In a teleconference
during the first week of January 1998, Ms. Goldberg talked to
Porter and Marcus. Meanwhile, Marcus sought new lawyers for Mrs.
Tripp. Conway suggested an old friend, James Moody, a Washington
lawyer and fellow Federalist Society member, whom Mrs. Tripp
retained.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was Starr's former law partner, Porter did not want
to be the first one to call the independent counsel's office on
behalf of Mrs. Tripp. So it Marcus made the call to Rosenzweig.

SPORTS COLUMN: L.T. FITS THE CRITERIA FOR THE HALL OF FAME TO AN
L.T. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla.) (js) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was a Giants linebacker, you never had to search for
Lawrence Taylor. He was always right where he was supposed to be,
charging the quarterback he hoped to sack or chasing down a
ballcarrier.
</P>
<P>
   He's much harder to find now.
</P>
<P>
   When the chimes rang inside L.T.'s big brick home in Upper
Saddle River, N.J., nobody answered. On the icy doorstep was a Fed
Ex envelope, addressed to him, that appeared to have been there for
several days. The sender was John Bankert, the executive director
of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the package of information we sent each of the 15
finalists about a week ago,'' Bankert was saying now over the phone
from his Hall of Fame office. ``We ask each one, `Should you be
elected, where can we contact you at about 11:30 next Saturday
after the vote?' We haven't heard back from Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even two of Taylor's attorneys, Larry Lustberg and Thomas
Melani, didn't know exactly where Taylor was, other than
``somewhere in Florida,'' where he has a part in an untitled Oliver
Stone movie.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is believed to be in Miami, where the Hall of Fame
selection meeting will be held the morning before the Super Bowl.
If elected, he would be invited to a noontime news conference
there. And if the voters abide by the ``criteria for election,''
Taylor will ``go in on roller skates,'' as his Giants coach, Bill
Parcells, once predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criteria for election to the Pro Football Hall of
Fame,'' reads Section 3, Item C, of its bylaws, ``is a nominee's
achievements and contributions as a player, coach, or contributor
in professional football.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most feared defensive player of his time, Taylor defined
the position of outside linebacker. If all 36 members of the
selection committee abide by the Hall of Fame's criteria, he was
dominant enough in helping the Giants win two Super Bowls to
deserve to be a rare unanimous choice.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he were not unanimous, 29 votes, equivalent to the
required 80 percent, would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   But just as there was only one L.T. as a linebacker, there has
been only one L.T. since then: two drug arrests, false federal tax
returns, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, questioning by a grand jury
investigating organized crime, suspended driver's license for
outstanding parking tickets, three traffic summonses for leaving
the scene of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the resume of a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how the Hall of Fame criteria read, assuming
Taylor gets to the final yes-or-no vote along with five other
nominees, some of those 36 selectors, out of self-righteousness or
self-importance, surely will wince at Taylor's rap sheet and not
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: How many won't? Two or three? Five or six? Even
if it's seven of 36, Taylor will still be elected.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's eight or more, Taylor won't be elected. And
according to the criteria, that would be an injustice.
</P>
<P>
   If Taylor had been a baseball player, Hall of Fame voters would
judge him on ``integrity, sportsmanship, character'' as well as his
``record, playing ability and contributions'' to his team. But the
Pro Football Hall of Fame, for whatever reason, has no morals
clause, so to speak, in its criteria.
</P>
<P>
   With a minimum of four, and a maximum of six, inductees each
year, three other first-time candidates could be measured this year
for their bronze busts _ Eric Dickerson, Howie Long and Coach Marv
Levy _ along with two holdovers from last year's yes-or-no vote,
Ozzie Newsome and Steelers owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   The other nine finalists up for discussion are Coach George
Allen, Carl Eller, Ray Guy, Tom Mack, John Stallworth, Lynn Swann,
Ron Yary and Jack Youngblood, and in a separate yes-or-no vote, the
old-timers committee's candidate, Billy Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Taylor is elected Saturday, will the Hall of Fame be
able to find him in time for the news conference?
</P>
<P>
   In searching for Taylor on Friday, one of his attorneys provided
the cell phone number for one ``Eric,'' who supposedly is always
with Taylor somewhere in Florida these days. But when Eric
answered, he was not with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving; I'll be in Lawrence's presence in half an hour,''
Eric said. ``Call back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, Eric was ``still 10 minutes away.'' Ten
minutes later, ``Lawrence is still on the set, call back in 20
minutes.'' Twenty minutes later, ``He has a break in five
minutes.'' Five minutes later, ``Things are hectic here, call back
in 10 minutes.'' Ten minutes later, ``Give me your number, Lawrence
will call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   As of early Saturday morning, Lawrence had not called.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the Giants alerted the news media on Friday
that ``Lawrence Taylor will be on a conference call'' Monday at
noon. He will presumably be discussing his Hall of Fame candidacy
from somewhere in Florida, if he can be found.

   MARCHING WITH THE REVEREND. Martin Luther King is revered for
making the civil rights movement a matter of conscience. But
another remarkable side of the movement is rarely mentioned, writes
columnist Bill Maxwell: the bravery of the thousands of old people
throughout the South who joined the marches and willingly faced the
teargas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. Maxwell describes
marching alongside an old woman who was later struck and kicked by
state troopers during a historic demonstration in Selma, Ala.
``King knew how important these old folk were, for he routinely
praised them in speech and in deed,'' says Maxwell. ``He brought
out the best in all of us.''

   THE BIG LIE VS. THE BIG TRUTH. The Big Lie has various
components but encompasses two themes _ illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants _ and erroneous concepts about both, notes
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. The opponents of illegals are
almost always the opponents of legals. Their argument that ``a
tidal wave of immigrants will overrun the country, choke cities,
increase pollution, dumb down our schools, rip off the welfare
system, drain tax payers, and work for low wages to the detriment
of others,'' is completely wrong writes Contreras, who offers
correct data about immigrants coming to America. ``And, anyway, the
truth is, without young immigrants, the United States will fall
victim to old age.''

   ``INDIANS HELPING INDIANS'' IS A MOTTO WHOSE TIME HAS COME.
History has made it clear that neither the states nor federal
government (nor tribal governments, for that matter) have found a
way to reduce the unemployment on many Indian reservations,
observes columnist Tim Giago. Costly programs have failed, he says,
because there has never been any long-range planning and the
Band-Aid approach to treating a major wound has proven ineffective.
``But I suggest (again) one possible cure: that successful Indian
casino owners provide jobs to tribes with high unemployment,''
Giago writes. ``The old motto, `Indians helping Indians' should be
the motto of the new millennium, now that there are so many
financially successful Indian nations.''

   U.S. POSTAGE STAMP TO COMMEMORATE MALCOLM X. The formerly
described ``angriest black man in America,'' Malcolm X is now to be
depicted on a postage stamp in the Postal Service's Black Heritage
Series, started in 1978 to commemorate the individual achievements
of African-Americans. The Malcolm X stamp is the 22nd stamp in the
series, writes columnist Akilah Monifa. ``Though I greatly admired

   SE RI PAK: EDGING BELOW PAR. Enjoying life on the LPGA tour may
be Se Ri Pak's hardest lesson. Even when she had to go 20 extra
holes to win the U.S. Women's Open, Se Ri Pak had a way of making
golf look easy _ smooth swing, remarkable patience and unwavering
concentration. If only the rest of her life were that simple. ``The
past six weeks have offered a glimpse of how the brightest star in
women's golf since Nancy Lopez ultimately may not have enough space
_ not to mention freedom _ for her potential to blossom, '' says

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The year was 1965, the time of my personal introduction to
Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
and my baptism into the civil rights movement.
 &HT;    Dozens of nightstick-wielding state troopers, deployed by
Alabama Gov. George Wallace, stood at the end of the Edmund Pettus
Bridge on the outskirts of Selma. I was a 19-year-old junior
attending Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. A group of my
schoolmates and I had taken time out of school and had come to
Selma to help initiate a voter registration campaign and, of
course, to hear Dr. King speak at Brown's Chapel Methodist Church.
 &HT;    Fear, the stuff of black life in the South during those days,
had always been my constant companion. But when the nearly 300 of
us, led by King, Ralph Abernathy and Andy Young, descended the hump
of the bridge, I wanted to turn and run. The helmeted troopers,
white men full of hatred and false courage, were determined to halt
our march.
 &HT;    A fat trooper, standing behind a waist-high patch of grass,
stared into my eyes. He understood my fear. Sensing his need to
brutalize us, I was convinced that my life would end that day on
the dusty easement of the Edmund Pettus.
 &HT;    Because I was near the end of the wave of protesters, I could
not see King and the other leaders of the march. Looking into the
faces of the other marchers, I saw fear and anticipation. I was
surprised to see that about half of them were old people _ women
and men whose wrinkles and scars and slow gait chronicled the
South's legacy of inhumanity. The presence of these elders made me
hopeful and ashamed that I had waited so long to join the movement.
 &HT;    In front of me, a mass of bodies surged forward, heads bobbing
rhythmically, and words to the song We Shall Overcome echoed in the
warm air. Suddenly, a voice, amplified over a bullhorn, yelled,
``Turn back and go home.''
 &HT;    We moved forward.
 &HT;    ``Disperse! Turn back!''
 &HT;    Frightened white journalists mustered the strength of mind to
stay alongside us as we marched toward the courthouse, where we
were to let the world know that black people in the South had a
right to vote.
 &HT;    ``Niggers!'' another voice, somewhere beyond the first row of
troopers, shouted.
 &HT;    ``Turn back!'' a trooper said.
 &HT;    We refused.
 &HT;    The marchers in front of me no longer moved as a single body. We
became individuals, pushed by the realization that we would be
attacked by white men who wanted to obliterate us.
 &HT;    The words ``god--- niggers'' came from the crowd of white
counterdemonstrators gathering behind the troopers.
 &HT;    Then, the screaming began.
 &HT;    Our women were the first to run as the troopers attacked, their
nightsticks coming down like rain. For the first time in my life, I
heard human bones crack. An old woman next to me fell to the
pavement after a trooper backhanded her across the chest. Falling,
she struggled to hold her green and orange gingham dress over her
legs.
 &HT;    The trooper's next move shocked even me, a kid born and reared
in a South Florida ghetto, who had seen violent incidents nearly
every day. He kicked the woman in the stomach. As the crowd pulled
me forward, I lost sight of her and never saw her again.
 &HT;    When tear gas canisters hit the bridge and a poisonous cloud
rose into the air, the troopers, all wearing masks, rushed us and
knocked many of us down. No one of us fought back. March organizers
had taught us that we would be whipped, injured, jailed and perhaps
even killed. The clubbing seemingly went on for an hour or longer
as sheriff's deputies joined the troopers and encircled us.
 &HT;    The gas was overpowering, burning our lungs and eyes and
nostrils. Most of us, at least those still standing, simply wanted
to get out of the line of fire. By now, however, the cops had
smelled blood _ a lot of blood flowed that day known as ``Bloody
Sunday'' _ and were singling out younger males to chase and beat.
 &HT;    I was one of the unlucky ones.
 &HT;    A deputy struck me in the neck from behind with his nightstick,
and, when I turned to face him, he jabbed me in the solar plexus
with the weapon. My college roommate was beside me. He was hit in
the face, and I saw blood stream down his cheek.
 &HT;    I could see King and Abernathy. Several deputies were dragging
them toward a squad car. Young stood near an officer in charge,
pointing at other officers beating three girls. Again, I was hit,
this time on the forehead. Tasting my own blood, I raised my arms
to ward off the blows. Women were screaming and children were
crying. But the cops continued to pound us.
 &HT;    That night at the church, I took full measure of what had
transpired. We out-of-towners had far less to lose than the local
black residents who participated in the demonstration. They stood
to lose everything _ their jobs, their churches, their homes. And,
yet, they had the courage to stand with King on the side of
justice.
 &HT;    Indeed, King deserves praise for making the civil rights
movement a matter of conscience. But another remarkable side of the
movement is rarely mentioned: That story is the bravery of the
thousands of old people throughout the South who willingly faced
the gas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. King knew how
important these old folk were, for he routinely praised them in
speech and in deed.
 &HT;    Martin Luther King has been dead since 1968, but I, along with
others who had the honor of knowing him, remain touched by his
courage and dedication to the cause of justice. He brought out the
best in us. He taught us to overcome fear, to overcome hatred and
to turn the evil of the oppressor into a positive force in our
lives.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES A SCHOOLS INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-SCHOOLS-CONSTRUCTION) 
(lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Voicing scorn for the performance of New York City
educators, Gov. George Pataki appointed a special state commission
Saturday to investigate wrongdoing in the construction of the
city's public schools and accusations that some administrators
inflated student attendance to reap more government aid.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki directed the commission to examine the School
Construction Authority, the state agency that was created in the
late 1980s to improve how city schools are built, but has since
become known for deadly accidents, cost overruns and seemingly
inexplicable design problems that in one case left a $300,000
wheelchair ramp under the hoop on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education hopes to spend $11 billion on
construction and repairs over the next five years, refurbishing a
system that remains overcrowded and antiquated, with scores of
schools still using hand-stoked coal burners as if caught in some
Dickensian time warp. The authority's checkered history, though,
has stirred concerns that no matter how much money the government
pours in, the results will be lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki acted without consulting Mayor Rudolph Giuliani or the
city schools chancellor, Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do better,'' the governor said in a statement,
delivering an unexpectedly biting critique of the city schools.
``It is time to demand better. I understand and fully expect the
education bureaucracy and its allies to rise up in protest, howling
with doom-and-gloom predictions to divert attention from the
system's obvious failures. They have thrived on the status quo for
so long they don't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also instructed the panel to examine how principals and
other administrators compile and report attendance figures, which
help determine education aid and the size of a school's budget. The
city's Board of Education has had chronic difficulty keeping track
of the 1.1 million students in the sprawling system, and there have
been inquiries in recent years into whether schools have falsified
attendance figures to collect more for their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commission will concentrate on these two areas, it
has the authority to look into other aspects of the school system.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing the panel, Pataki is making his most forceful
foray into the operation of the city schools since he took office
in 1995. The state wields considerable influence over local school
districts, but in his first term, the governor shied away from
getting deeply involved in the often fractious disputes over
education policy among Giuliani, the schools chancellor, the Board
of Education and other prominent officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic leaders in the state Legislature on Saturday
questioned why Pataki waited until his second term to focus on the
system, contending that so late in his tenure he shares the blame
for school conditions. The authority has spent $7 billion since it
was created.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments Saturday could be interpreted as
somewhat of a rebuke of Giuliani. The mayor does not control the
system, but Giuliani has formed a close alliance with Crew, and has
championed what he says are the changes that he and Crew have
wrought. Giuliani has also tried to turn around the School
Construction Authority by installing a former top aide as its
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has a cool relationship with Pataki, his fellow
Republican, seemed surprised Saturday by the news of the
commission. The governor did not notify the mayor about the panel
before announcing it, though he did brief his Republican allies in
the state Senate on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really at a loss to explain to you what the basis for it
is,'' Giuliani said, defending the construction authority's recent
record under the latest chairman, Howard Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Saturday, the governor said his
decision to set up the commission without consulting Giuliani and
Crew did not indicate that he was displeased with either of them.
Pataki said he thought both men had done an excellent job, adding
that he strongly supported long-stalled legislation in Albany that
would give the mayor more control over the system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deputy schools chancellor for operations, Lewis Spence,
declined to comment on the commission, saying he was waiting to
learn more about its scope and intent.
</P>
<P>
   In concentrating on the School Construction Authority, Pataki is
not going after some agency far removed from his administration.
While Giuliani appointed the authority's chairman, the governor
named one of the other two board members; Crew is the third. So
Pataki has had the opportunity to exert control over the authority.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Pataki's appointee to the board, Paul
Atanasio, resigned after investigators criticized his role in the
hiring of a supervisor at an authority project in Brooklyn in which
a falling brick killed a girl. The governor has not yet nominated a
replacement for Atanasio and has said he wants to let the mayor
appoint someone for that position.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan and chairman of the
Education Committee, said that because Pataki helps to supervise
the School Construction Authority, he did not need a panel to
figure out what was wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a little bit like George Steinbrenner was having
trouble with how the Yankees are doing,'' Sanders said, ``and
instead of calling in his manager, whom he appoints, he appoints a
committee to find out what is going on with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to such criticism, Pataki said, ``I would hope that
they would be interested in finding out whether or not we are
getting a fair return for what we invest in our schools. I don't
think that people believe that we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor named his state inspector general, Roslynn
Mauskopf, to head the commission, which is scheduled to complete
its work by Dec. 1. Its budget is to begin at $300,000, with the
administration adding money when necessary, the governor's aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   In naming the commission, Pataki invoked the Moreland Act of
1907, which grants the governor the authority to establish panels
with the power to subpoena documents and witnesses. Pataki has not
used the authority before. His predecessor, Mario Cuomo, invoked it
only a few times, most notably when he set up a panel to examine
government ethics in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous recent Moreland investigation occurred
in the 1970s, when a panel under Gov. Hugh Carey looked into abuses
in the nursing home industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new panel is not the first to examine the School
Construction Authority; Sanders is holding hearings on the
authority, and state Sen. Roy Goodman, R-Manhattan, has also led
investigations into its activities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mauskopf acknowledged those inquiries, but said hers would
be the definitive one. ``A lot of these questions have been asked
in the past,'' she said. ``But for too long, the individuals and
the institutions involved have just pointed fingers at one another,
in an attempt to give quick answers or excuses. It's now time to
take a hard look at the problems.''

   MARCHING WITH THE REVEREND. Martin Luther King is revered for
making the civil rights movement a matter of conscience. But
another remarkable side of the movement is rarely mentioned, writes
columnist Bill Maxwell: the bravery of the thousands of old people
throughout the South who joined the marches and willingly faced the
teargas, the dogs, the truncheons, the guns. Maxwell describes
marching alongside an old woman who was later struck and kicked by
state troopers during a historic demonstration in Selma, Ala.
``King knew how important these old folk were, for he routinely
praised them in speech and in deed,'' says Maxwell. ``He brought
out the best in all of us.''

   THE BIG LIE VS. THE BIG TRUTH. The Big Lie has various
components but encompasses two themes _ illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants _ and erroneous concepts about both, notes
columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. The opponents of illegals are
almost always the opponents of legals. Their argument that ``a
tidal wave of immigrants will overrun the country, choke cities,
increase pollution, dumb down our schools, rip off the welfare
system, drain tax payers, and work for low wages to the detriment
of others,'' is completely wrong writes Contreras, who offers
correct data about immigrants coming to America. ``And, anyway, the
truth is, without young immigrants, the United States will fall
victim to old age.''

   ``INDIANS HELPING INDIANS'' IS A MOTTO WHOSE TIME HAS COME.
History has made it clear that neither the states nor federal
government (nor tribal governments, for that matter) have found a
way to reduce the unemployment on many Indian reservations,
observes columnist Tim Giago. Costly programs have failed, he says,
because there has never been any long-range planning and the
Band-Aid approach to treating a major wound has proven ineffective.
``But I suggest (again) one possible cure: that successful Indian
casino owners provide jobs to tribes with high unemployment,''
Giago writes. ``The old motto, `Indians helping Indians' should be
the motto of the new millennium, now that there are so many
financially successful Indian nations.''

   U.S. POSTAGE STAMP TO COMMEMORATE MALCOLM X. The formerly
described ``angriest black man in America,'' Malcolm X is now to be
depicted on a postage stamp in the Postal Service's Black Heritage
Series, started in 1978 to commemorate the individual achievements
of African-Americans. The Malcolm X stamp is the 22nd stamp in the
series, writes columnist Akilah Monifa. ``Though I greatly admired
the man, a Malcolm X postage stamp was the farthest concept from my
mind,'' Monifa adds. ``I'm sure from his, too.'' Can a Malcolm X
holiday be far behind? she wonders.

LEGISLATURES ACROSS U.S. TO TAKE UP INTERNET ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., N.Y., Wash., Calif., Nev., Va.)  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The contentious and complex debates over protecting
children from the evils of cyberspace, controlling unwanted
commercial e-mail and protecting consumer privacy online are
expected to move to statehouses in the coming months as state
legislatures convene around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine of the 50 states will hold legislative sessions this
year, with 46 of those scheduled to be under way by Feb. 2. At
those sessions, some 1,200 to 1,500 proposals dealing with the
Internet are expected to be filed, said Paul Rusinoff, state policy
counsel for the Internet Alliance, the largest high-tech and
Internet trade association in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting if you look at this context,'' Rusinoff said.
``We saw some of the first state bills dealing with the Internet in
1995. There were three of them. Last year, the association looked
at over 700. And I think as more and more legislators go online
themselves, and start hearing from constituents, the issues are
going to multiply.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list, he and officials with the National Conference
of State Legislatures and the U. S. Internet Council agree, will be
bills intended to protect children from adult material and online
predators, and measures to outlaw or regulate unsolicited
commercial e-mail, known as spam.
</P>
<P>
   But well-intentioned efforts to protect children from indecent
materials and online predators, and even measures involving spam
e-mail, often raise constitutional questions regarding free speech
and censorship. Another problem is that federal and state laws are
aimed at regulating a global medium.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have won virtually every court challenge of
efforts to limit minors' access to the dark side of the Internet,
including a lawsuit against the original Communications Decency
Act, passed by Congress in 1996, and state laws passed in recent
years in New Mexico and New York. A second federal law, named the
Child Online Protection Act, which was passed last year, is being
challenged in federal court in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, personally, that there is going to be much
appetite for content-control legislation in state legislatures
because they realize that is going to be very difficult to
accomplish,'' said Mark Rhoads, legislative director of the
Internet council, a coalition of Internet and high-tech companies
formed in 1996 specifically to work on Internet legislation at the
state level.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rhoads said he expected that several bills aimed at
controlling content on the Internet would be proposed, he said
lawmakers ``are more likely to move in the direction of trying to
empower parents to more intelligently supervise their children's
online time'' with filters and other new technology.
</P>
<P>
   A number of bills to curb unsolicited commercial e-mail are also
expected. Last year, legislation seeking to control such e-mail was
introduced in 17 states. Bills were passed in two states,
Washington and California, bringing to three the number of states
with such laws. Nevada was the first, passing a bill in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While some argue that it seems futile for a state to try to
regulate e-mail on a global network, proponents say such laws can
help slow the barrage of unsolicited messages that often advertise
get-rich-schemes and adult-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington law prohibits companies from sending e-mail with
a misleading subject line or false return address to Internet users
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   California's law also requires that all unsolicited commercial
e-mail sent to users in that state contain the word
``advertisement'' in the subject line.
</P>
<P>
   California enacted a second law that allows owners of computer
systems in the state to sue the senders of spam e-mail in an effort
to recover losses caused by network clogs or computers crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads and Rusinoff said they also expected the federal debate
over whether laws are needed to protect consumer privacy online to
move to the state level. Other proposals they expect to see, Rhoads
said, include those seeking to outlaw online gambling, and several
to establish digital signatures, online notary publics and other
means of verifying identities on the Internet so that more private
and government business can be conducted online.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress has passed a three-year moratorium on new state
and local taxes on Internet services and Internet commerce,
Internet taxes are not expected to be an issue in state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Rusinoff and Rhoads said they thought few of the bills would
become law. But the flurry of legislation should raise the
awareness of the importance of forming new committees and state
offices to deal with Internet issues, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the odd features of the state policy environment right
now is that there is not really a committee structure to deal with
the Internet,'' Rhoads said. ``Only four or five states have
science or technology committees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusinoff, whose group worked with Virginia to write the first
comprehensive state Internet policy agenda, says his group will be
urging other states to follow that model.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia proposal calls for tougher laws against
sexually-oriented solicitation of minors via the Internet and the
posting of information on how to contact a child on a pornographic
Web site; a requirement that Web sites clearly post what private
information they collect and how it is used, and a law that would
allow the prosecution of senders of unsolicited bulk e-mail that is
``fraudulent, unauthorized, or otherwise illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes making online transactions and contracts
legally binding and would require the state to offer more
government services over the Internet.

A BIAS LAWSUIT OFFERS A GLIMPSE OF THE SHELF LIFE OF A TV
ANCHORWOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio, Ind., Calif., Texas, Mass.)  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ She was the blonde, green-eyed Action News
anchor who brought Hollywood sizzle to Connecticut television,
racking up top ratings and zipping around town in a red Jaguar.
Rival stations warred over her services, driving her yearly salary
to $250,000 in the nation's 27th largest television market.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Peckinpaugh knew she was living off a fleeting asset.
And when three big-city television stations made what she called
million-dollar job offers, Ms. Peckinpaugh made a trade-off. She
decided to stay with her Hartford employer in return for what she
says was a promise that she could grow old on the airwaves here.
Ms. Peckinpaugh said she recognized ``that female anchors are often
in perilous positions once they are 40 and over,'' but banked on
statements by station executives that she was so beloved by viewers
that they would always have a place for her.
</P>
<P>
   If there ever had been such a deal, it did not last. Ms.
Peckinpaugh, now 48, has fallen down the anchor ladder and now
rises at 2:30 a.m. to read the morning news at another station,
where she has no desk and no direct-dial telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh, the divorced mother of a 10-year-old, says it
was not just the years that caught up with her. In an age- and sex-
discrimination lawsuit against her former employer, which owned the
CBS station here, she maintains she was blacklisted after she
complained that the anchorman who was the other half of
Connecticut's dream team had groped her in a hotel room after a
late-night telethon. He says it was just a friendly hug and a kiss,
like the ones the two had exchanged many times before. Ms.
Peckinpaugh also maintains she was dropped from the evening
newscasts in favor of two younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Now 56, the silver-haired anchorman, Al Terzi, remains the dean
of Connecticut anchors, drawing an annual salary of about $325,000.
</P>
<P>
   In commercials and on billboards and buses, the anchor teams of
local television news have the grin and glow of newlyweds, or
perhaps a mom and dad who never fight. But the dark side of these
arranged marriages spilled out last week as Ms. Peckinpaugh and
Terzi told their stories for a jury in U.S. District Court in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh is suing Post-Newsweek Stations, a division of
The Washington Post Co., which owned WFSB Channel 3, Hartford's CBS
affiliate, when she worked there. The station has since been sold
to the Meredith Broadcasting Group.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce often bares dark secrets, and the professional one
between Ms. Peckinpaugh and Terzi is no exception. The litigation
has resulted in the disclosure of thousands of station documents,
offering an unusual peek at how the glamour couples of television
news are chosen, coddled and _ if their ratings sag _ jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis House, a Channel 3 anchor-reporter, said in a deposition
that when his contract came up for renewal in mid-1995, he won a
promotion by mentioning to management that he had heard about two
promising openings in Houston. House, now 34, said his agent had
told him a Houston station was ``looking for white males'' so they
could ``pair them up with a female or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In TV, you are cast in these big piles _ blonds, or
whatever,'' House explained. ``We are pieces of furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ryan, the president of Post-Newsweek Stations, said women's
longevity on the air depends simply on performance. ``The standards
that exist apply to both men and women _ on-air performance,
communication skills, writing skills, journalistic credentials,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh's fate may not have been inevitable. Don
Fitzpatrick, a television news talent consultant in San Francisco,
said the top anchors in several major markets are well into their
50s, and said aging baby boomers do not want to see familiar
figures removed. ``In the early '70s there was pressure to hire
women, and by the late '70s, there was pressure to put out to
pasture some of the older women,'' he said. ``I don't think that's
true today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Peckinpaugh, the wild ride in television news began in
Richmond, Va. She had grown up in Ohio, majored in history and
communications at Indiana University, then worked in public
relations for an airline and cut radio spots for the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was front-page news in The Hartford Courant when she was
recruited to Connecticut in 1984 to be the star anchor at WTNH
Channel 8, the ABC affiliate in New Haven. (Like the CBS and NBC
stations in Hartford, it serves the entire state.) Initially, she
was part of a team that unseated Terzi, but by the next year they
were paired and their evening newscasts became the highest-rated in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh played along with what some journalists consider
the humiliations of television news, including lip-synching the
words ``You'll love it!'' in a station promotion. She bought a
shore-front condominium and vacationed in Europe and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Terzi testified that they had a warm relationship.
Then during Memorial Day weekend in 1987, they worked in New Haven
until after midnight on the Children's Miracle Network Telethon,
then headed to the Park Plaza Hotel, where organizers had provided
rooms for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh said that after a reception for telethon
workers, Terzi insisted on walking her to her room. He went into
her room and checked the bathroom and under the bed, which she said
made her uncomfortable. ``I felt like he was in my space,'' she
said in a deposition. Then, she testified, ``He grabbed me and
tried to kiss me and tried to stick his tongue in my mouth, and I
was totally thrown back.'' She said she pushed him, but he just
grabbed tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing his folksy bass to the witness stand, Terzi, who is
married, gave a very different account of the incident. He said
that in the elevator on the way to her room, she had thrown her
arms around him and given him a big hug. ``She said we made a great
team,'' he testified. ``I said, `I agree.' I hugged her back.''
</P>
<P>
   Terzi said that did not strike him as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the kind of a person that liked to put her arms around
people, be very friendly,'' he said. Terzi said that when they
reached her room, he had checked around just to reassure her that
the room was safe. ``Given Ms. Peckinpaugh's popularity,'' he said,
``anything is possible.'' Then, he said, they had a good-night hug
and a kiss. ``I just said, `It's great working with you,''' he
recalled. He said he then left.
</P>
<P>
   Terzi said that during the next week, he detected a coolness
from Ms. Peckinpaugh, but said he did not know it had anything to
do with him. Eventually, they talked in the station parking lot.
``She said she thought the kiss and the hug went too far,'' he
said. ``I said, `What do you mean? We do that all the time.' '' He
added, ``It made no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 3, the CBS station in Hartford, had been recruiting Ms.
Peckinpaugh, and shortly after the incident at the hotel, she
jumped ship. She was the anchor for the 5 and 6 p.m. editions of
``Eyewitness News,'' which had soared to No. 1 one in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1991 that Ms. Peckinpaugh decided to trade what she
said were rich offers from Boston and Dallas stations for long-term
security in Hartford. As part of the deal, which brought her salary
to $250,000 by mid-1994, she won a provision that her primary
assignment throughout the four-year contract would be as anchor of
early evening newscasts, or else be paid off under a provision
called ``pay, no play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh testified that in March 1993 she was happily
presiding over the 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts. But she was going
through her second divorce, and, as she contemplated refinancing
her house, she sought out the station manager, Christopher J.
Rohrs, to check on her job security. She quoted him as saying,
``The people in the state of Connecticut love you'' and, ``You can
grow old at this station.'' Rohrs denies making such a statement,
and said he would not advise an employee about financing a house.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That summer, she said, Rohrs called her into his office and
said, ``We have a present for you.'' The station was hiring Terzi
away from its competitor, leading to the possibility of a
Terzi-Peckinpaugh reunion. His contract prevented him from
immediately appearing on the new station, leading to months of
tense speculation about who would be chosen as his co-anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh, and many other Channel 3 journalists, assumed
Terzi would be paired with her, according to testimony. But station
executives said no such decision had been made. Ms. Peckinpaugh
said she began getting subtle hints that her luster was dimming.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said, her news director began complaining
about her wearing glasses instead of contacts while delivering
brief newsbreaks. She said that another night, after she had her
bangs styled off her face, a group of colleagues gathered around a
television monitor to poke fun. Another time, she said, the news
director waited by the elevator to complain about a mangled word.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, when you're a star player, you are treated
differently,'' she testified. ``All of a sudden, I was being
treated just the opposite _ and that's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh asserted that Terzi persuaded the station not to
pair the two of them because she had protested the Plaza Hotel
incident. Terzi said he was ready to move on and was ``hot'' that
she brought the matter up. He said he thought, ``Here we go
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Station executives, who call her lawsuit ``a simple case about a
contract, not a conspiracy,'' said they had begun having concerns
about her the year before, based on declining ratings and viewer
research.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1994, she learned that she was not assured of being
Terzi's partner when she and two other anchorwomen were asked to
tape brief segments with him. A research firm hired by the station
then showed the clips to shoppers at malls to test the reaction. At
the time, Channel 3 had three anchorwomen and two anchormen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh asserts that over the next several months,
several station executives said they had ``too many women,'' and
wanted to use the testing to decide which one to get rid of. On the
stand, Rohrs, the former station manager, said he simply had ``too
many anchors.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman S. Hecht, a market researcher from Syosset, N.Y., who
specializes in television, conducted about 400 telephone interviews
and showed the tape to about 300 shoppers. On Thursday, he
testified that his research showed Ms. Peckinpaugh was
``polarizing'' _ while she had fans, she also had many viewers who
chose her as their least favorite. He said many found her to be
unprofessional _ ``silly, goofy.'' After asking several questions
about the anchor teams' appeal, Hecht computed a ``net enjoyment
score'' in which Ms. Peckinpaugh came in last.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the results of the tests, the station decided to
pair Terzi with the woman who tested most favorably: Denise
D'Ascenzo, who is eight years younger than Ms. Peckinpaugh and
remains Terzi's partner today.
</P>
<P>
   After losing her anchor assignments, Ms. Peckinpaugh left the
CBS station in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Peckinpaugh is the wake-up anchor for Hartford's NBC
station, WVIT Channel 30, which she said in an affidavit was ``the
only news anchor position I have been able to obtain since leaving
WFSB.'' At her new station, she started in 1995 at $45,000 a year
and now makes $80,000. Her son does not go to bed until 9:30 p.m.,
leaving her with about five hours of sleep. ``You never get used to
it,'' she said. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   She does have a consolation. Since she went on, her station's
ratings for that time slot are way up.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOOD MIKE, BAD MIKE AND THE ANTI-MIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Mike gone, only the Anti-Mike can save us.
</P>
<P>
   This is about our two Mikes, Jordan the Good Mike and Tyson the
Bad Mike. You might also call them the Cool Mike and the Hot Mike,
the Plastic Mike and the Iron Mike, the Angel Mike who is applauded
for skipping out on us and the Devil Mike who can't even get credit
for a clean knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jordan's Second Leaving. It is still being treated as
an arrival, the next stage in his celebrity-hood, instead of what
it is, a great performer's loss of interest in entertaining us.
This rejection of the audience is being spun as a wonderful
opportunity for the National Basketball Association to redefine
itself _ yet again and become richer; are we supposed to infer that
Mike planned it this way, saving the valley and then moving on,
like Shane? It's a clever scenario to help sell books and
magazines, and to support his many sponsors, understandably
concerned that Mike playing golf, taking his kids to school, and
doing the dozens with his old frat brothers will not have the
commercial appeal of Mike above the rim.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that Mike will live forever, remember the role
Johnny Carson played in the national culture (he was the Michael
Jordan of late-night TV) and the enormous coverage of his
retirement and his replacements. How often have you thought of
Carson since? And he had a clothing line, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tyson's latest comeback has been treated with a
puzzling contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Were the sports-talkers disappointed that he hadn't driven
Francois Botha's nose bone into his brain? Or bitten it off? Tyson
is that rare athlete who didn't completely lose his legs in prison
and who has come back from deserved punishment and humiliation. He
showed poise and professionalism in the Botha fight. He was losing
for four rounds, but never lost his composure, even as the White
Buffalo taunted him, fouled him, made Tyson look as clumsy as he
was. But Tyson waited for his time, then threw the punch that won.
Had any other fighter _ any athlete _ displayed such control, it
would have been lauded as a victory of character.
</P>
<P>
   Was there wishful thinking among commentators that Tyson, who is
clearly not yet bored with us, was coming apart, rather than back?
As with Jordan, investors are not likely to drop him until he is
commercially wrung out.
</P>
<P>
   This Mike and Anti-Mike business is not new. Post MagicBird,
when the NBA/Nike combine bought into Air Jordan, everything Mike
did was golden. Anti-Mike was a gold mine, too, but a guilty
pleasure brought to us by Don King (the Anti-David Stern?) and Las
Vegas casinos. Mike was beloved by the suits, Anti-Mike by an '80s
hip-hop generation. When Mike came to life mainly in big games, it
was proof that he was willing to empty out body and soul for us.
Had that been Anti-Mike, he would have been accused of coasting on
a regular basis. When Jordan gambled between playoff games, it was
evidence of his fierce need for constant competition. Tyson would
have been suspended or at least censured, to protect the perceived
integrity of the spread.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan had appeared on a Barbara Walters broadcast, heavily
medicated, or crashed cars into trees, he would have gained
sympathy as a courageous example of an emotionally troubled man
struggling for stability instead of a pathetic, henpecked sicko. If
Jordan had come back from years in prison and then from months of a
recent banishment with his physical skills diminished, he would
have been extolled for making up in finesse what he had lost in
muscle. Which is, of course, how Mike was treated when he returned
from his baseball sabbatical. Anti-Mike is being dismissed as being
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The high concept of Good Mike and Bad Mike is as much business
decision as moral judgment, and both Mikes have been happy enough
over the years to model their assigned roles, Jordan gracious and
diplomatic in public, Tyson snarly and unrepentant. Each knew his
constituency, Jordan with the haves, those who identified with the
members of the board, Tyson with the have-nots, those who
identified with the members of the band. For those who ``feared
being left behind,'' according to Nelson George's rewarding 1998
book, ``Hip Hop America,'' the ``fierce, reckless fury'' of Tyson's
``rapid rise from thug to champion'' offered hope.
</P>
<P>
   George wrote: ``The challenge Tyson, and his generation's
particular brand of pride, faces is whether he has the staying
power to thrive in a highly uncertain future.''
</P>
<P>
   We will find out soon enough. I'm rooting for the Anti-Mike, who
has always seemed more real to me than Mike, less calculating,
closer to the edge. Tyson talks money, but is about passion, fear,
disgrace, redemption. Jordan talks about the love of the game, but
everything he has ever done has been for money.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Mike is back and could save us by turning the sports
century around before it's too late, before the jock-industrial
complex convinces us that the only way to truly win is to control
market share.

THE SELFLESS SPREWELL, OR THE SELFISH ONE?
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KNICKS-JOHNSON) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the off-kilter jokes subside, and Latrell
Sprewell, the basketball player, supplants Latrell Sprewell, the
national anger-management spokesman, the Knicks will learn what
kind of player and teammate they have gambled to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be the impatient guy who goes one-on-five, monopolizing
the ball because he has no faith in his teammates? Or will he stop
living for each possession and make use of good help?
</P>
<P>
   Will Sprewell return to the player who blended seamlessly with
Chris Webber, Tim Hardaway and Chris Mullin early in his career, or
revert back to the one who forced shots and sometimes made awful
decisions 14 months ago?
</P>
<P>
   What of the locker room, where either the miserable person who
often brought down his teammates could resurface, or the quiet guy
who quickly dressed and left whether he scored 30 points or 6?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was put in a situation where he had to succeed and be the
guy,'' said Muggsy Bogues, the Warriors' veteran point guard. ``I
thought he was a great teammate, but he developed tunnel vision on
the court sometimes, taking too much responsibility and doing
whatever it took to win. Now he's got other guys around to help
him. It's different. I think New York will be good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's former teammates characterized him as determined,
loyal and unbelievably talented. Bimbo Coles called him the best
shooting guard in the National Basketball Association behind
Michael Jordan. ``He was a guy who could do everything,'' Coles
said. ``He never gets tired, comes into camp ready and plays hard
on both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also portrayed Sprewell as a player who may be more
comfortable as a role player than someone expected to rescue a
slumping franchise, a role he will assume soon with the Knicks of
Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the only things I thought he should work on was that he
needed to trust his teammates a little more,'' said Donyell
Marshall, the Warriors forward. ``He would try and do so much on
his own. But a lot of that had to do with our personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the guys he's going to have on that team, you've got no
choice but to trust those guys. We really didn't have a veteran or
a leader, someone to say, `Let's slow it down,' or `Let's take good
shots.' I don't think that will be the case there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player, but he doesn't really like the limelight
where he's the man,'' Coles said. ``He's just a player that wants
to play. As far as playing the role of getting on guys, he doesn't
want that responsibility. He doesn't want to jump on somebody.
Here, they wanted him to play a role as a leader. It just didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back with regret on Friday after being traded to the
Knicks for John Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris Mills, Sprewell
asked not to be judged solely by the events of Dec. 1, 1997. ``One
bad day,'' he called his choking of P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   But the month leading up to his violent outburst alone hardly
portrays a model teammate. Buried in the transcripts of his
arbitration case against the NBA and the Warriors is Sprewell's
testimony to the grievance arbitrator, John D. Feerick. Feeling
like a scapegoat and wanting to be traded, Sprewell helps construct
an unflattering portrait of himself as a team captain at the
beginning of the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell admitted to laughing in the middle of a blowout loss,
missing a team flight because he overslept, questioning daily his
coach's authority and, finally, wondering why everyone was blaming
him for the Golden State's woes.
</P>
<P>
   For more than six pages of Feerick's findings, Sprewell emerges
as an agitated young star, hypersensitive to criticism and
unreliable as a team leader. Saying Carlesimo once called him ``an
idiot,'' Sprewell testified: ``I don't see why he would. ... I just
felt really offended by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with his rookie year in 1992 and leading to the attack
on Carlesimo, Sprewell said he was fined or disciplined numerous
times for missing practices or breaking team rules. He talks about
fights with former his teammates Byron Houston and Jerome Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of Sprewell's on- and off-court incidents have been
documented, he addressed them personally during the hearing last
year.
</P>
<P>
   After an altercation with Kersee a few years ago, Sprewell
testified he said, ``I'm gonna get my peeps,'' and that he might
have said, ``I'm going to kill you,'' to Kersee, but that he did
not mean it. He then said he retreated to the locker room, picked
up a 2-by-4 and threatened to hit two teammates if they did not let
him go. He said he eventually put down the piece of wood without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   If his short temper stands out in the transcripts, so, too, does
Sprewell's utter lack of respect for Carlesimo and his stewardship.
Sprewell admits to missing a flight to a game in Utah because ``he
fell asleep and did not wake up on time.'' On Nov. 9, 1997, he
begins laughing during a blowout at the hands of the Lakers after
Coles jokes that he wants to foul out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo benched Sprewell, who uses a profane word before
calling his coach ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Feerick, ``He said he thought it disrespectful to be taken
out of the game and that Carlesimo did not shake his hand after the
game.'' Over and over, Sprewell comes across as a disconnected
athlete who refuses to hold himself accountable for some of the
team's failings.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a year later, his teammates from last season
contend that the frustration of losing and the feud with Carlesimo
overcame him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have already judged him because of the incident, but I
think you'll see a different person than the one perceived to be a
bad guy,'' Bogues said. ``You see the hairstyle and the scowl, and
that's image. But that's not Spree. He works hard and he doesn't
like to step on toes. I think he'll be a great addition.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I just hope with everything that's happened he
doesn't lose his aggressiveness.''

LEADING REPUBLICAN GRANTS `REASONABLE PEOPLE' CAN DIFFER ON
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Fla., Ark., Minn., Ill., Calif.)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-REPUBS,
IMPEACH-BIBLE-BELT, IMPEACH-WITNESSES-REVIEW)  
(mk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the leading members of the Republican
prosecution conceded Saturday that even if the Senate thought
President Clinton was guilty of perjury, ``reasonable people''
among its members could disagree on whether he should be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a written question from Democratic senators, Rep.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the 13 House prosecutors, or
managers, in Clinton's trial, said he was convinced that both
perjury and obstruction of justice, the offenses covered by the
impeachment articles, fell within the constitutional category of
``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   But before voting to convict the president, he told the
senators, who are sitting as a court, they must ``consider what's
best for this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham continued: ``It's never been hard to find out whether
Bill Clinton committed perjury or whether he obstructed justice.
That ain't a hard one for me. But when you take the good of this
nation, the upside and the downside, reasonable people can disagree
on what we should do.''
</P>
<P>
   That concession was the most dramatic moment of the second and
last day of questioning, following three days of presentations by
the managers and by the president's defense lawyers. Charles Ruff,
the White House counsel, said later that Graham had ``stated for
you the essential of the role'' the Senate must play.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if, indeed, reasonable people can differ,'' Ruff said,
does that not mean that ``whatever conduct you believe the
president committed,'' it would be difficult for the Senate to
legitimately determine whether he should be removed?
</P>
<P>
   He said the essence of the problem was unchanged: ``Is there a
sufficient danger to the state, danger to the state, to warrant
what my colleagues across the aisle have called the political death
penalty? And I think that the answer to that is no.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for the last several days, maneuvering
outside the chamber influenced what went on inside. Just as the
Senate was convening, shortly after 10 a.m., word spread that a
federal judge had ordered Monica Lewinsky, whose sexual
relationship with Clinton led to his impeachment, to meet
informally with the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Democratic senators bombarded the managers
with angry questions: Why had they not consulted with senators
before asking the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to seek
Saturday's ruling? Did they notify the president's lawyers? Did
they think their actions had raised fundamental questions of
fairness and due process?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., answered that no one had talked to
the senators because the Senate's rules had not been involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a witness that you're going to produce, you have a
right to prepare that witness,'' he said. ``It's as simple as that.
It has nothing to do with the formal proceeding of taking the
deposition, which is covered by the rules that you've passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's perspective could not have been more different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK,'' he asked,
``to have one side using the might and majesty of the independent
counsel's office, threatening a witness with violation of an
immunity agreement if she doesn't agree to fly across the country
for this friendly little chat?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he said the ``looming presence'' of the
independent counsel would intimidate Ms. Lewinsky during any
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ms. Lewinsky or anyone else is called as a witness
remains an open question. On Monday the senators will vote first on
a motion to dismiss the case and _ only if that fails _ on whether
to call witnesses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The managers continued to press their demand for witnesses. Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., listed numerous conflicts he said witnesses
could help clear up: between the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and
Clinton; between that of Ms. Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan, who tried
to get her a job in New York, and between that of Clinton and his
secretary, Betty Currie, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``White House counselors say this is going to drag on for
months,'' Hutchinson said. ``Well, if it drags on for months, it is
because they want it to drag on for months. We'll do all we can to
end this in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ruff and his colleagues, they continued to insist that
all the material questions had already been asked of the major
players.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., asked Ruff a question of special
import, in view of Graham's suggestion that the good of the nation
was an important element in deciding whether to convict Clinton.
Supported by many commentators in the news media, Democrats have
argued off the floor that it would be folly to remove a president
who is given favorable poll ratings by almost three-quarters of the
public. Wellstone wanted to know if that mattered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Polls themselves were not the whole answer, Ruff replied, but
``only one clue as to what the American people are thinking.'' But
the American people have certainly given strong suggestions that
they did not feel that the political structure needed the
``cleansing'' the managers have spoken of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the people, the belief of the people in this
president's ability to govern, must educate each of you,'' the
counsel said, ``not mandate a result, but surely guide the result
that you reach in this proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the 25-year veteran of the House
Judiciary Committee who is serving as chief prosecutor, rose in
response, thanks to a friendly question that was read out later by
Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not delegates who are sent here to weigh our mail every
day and then to vote accordingly,'' he said. ``Our work here is not
an ongoing plebiscite. We are elected to bring our judgment, our
experience and our consciences with us here. I have always believed
that there are issues of transcendent importance that you have to
be willing to lose your office over.''
</P>
<P>
   Equal justice under the law was one such issue, Hyde said,
adding a few words that made clear how beleaguered he has come to
feel as pressure has mounted from almost every side to abort the
trial early next week: ``Despite all the polls and all the hostile
editorials, America is hungry for people who believe in something.
You may disagree with us, but we believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Still later, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., another manager,
provided a footnote to the debate that Graham had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, in apparent pique with his Republican
colleague, ``reasonable minds can differ as to whether the
president should be removed from office. But reasonable minds can
only differ if those reasonable minds come to the conclusion that
enforcement of the sexual harassment laws in this country is less
important than the preservation of this man in the office of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky came to light as the
result of a sexual harassment suit against him by Paula Jones.

<P>
   The bacon is crackling and popping in the frying pan, and the
man who looks carved out of a sequoia is feeling weak. But Larry
Johnson has two sons sitting at the kitchen table, so he keeps
flipping the bacon as his mouth waters and his stomach growls for
the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The player who still brings home the bacon now forces himself to
turn his back. For six months, Johnson has had little use for a
fork and knife. Passing vegetarian initiation, Johnson learned the
value of a spoon for all the bean pies he ate during the league's
lockout, part of a diet that has left 20 pounds lighter entering
the Knicks training camp last week. The pressure on his perennially
aching back and bad ankle has been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But this weight loss is not only about a diet. Johnson's new
sleek physique comes as a result of his exploration with the Muslim
faith. He leaned on the religion's discipline nearly every day as
his alarm went off at 5 a.m. and cut through the sultry Texas air
like a fog horn.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping out of his Dallas home before dawn, he arrived at the
community center he built in his old neighborhood for a workout
with his personal trainer. Two hours in the morning, two hours at
night. That was hard enough. On Dec. 20, just before the winter
solstice kicked in, Johnson's days actually seemed longer.
</P>
<P>
   A month of Ramadan had begun. About 6:50 a.m., after
weight-lifting and running, Johnson would gulp down a protein
shake, inhale a Power Bar and then wait until nightfall before
eating or drinking again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not believe at around 3 or 4 p.m. just how grouchy
and how ready I was to bite someone's head off,'' said Johnson,
during the second day of Knicks' training camp on Friday. ``By 5:30
p.m., I could eat grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 p.m., the veggie burger on his plate was as good as a
prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you the essence of meat,'' Johnson said with a smile.
``There's no taste. The taste is me piling on about 15 pieces of
pickle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan ended last week. So far, Johnson has been tempted by the
McDonald's Happy Meals his sons tote around the home he recently
bought near the Knicks' facility. ``I see those french fries and
hamburgers,'' Johnson said. ``And I say to them, y'all are killing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has resisted a dive into the deep fried foods. And he
attributes his newfound willpower to the Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the discipline of it,'' Johnson said. ``It's just
the straight-up discipline of being a man. It's not just about
eating, but about being a husband, a friend and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the mentally and physically fitter Johnson will have a lot
on his plate to deal with this season. The addition of Latrell
Sprewell means Johnson will be forced to play well undersized at
power forward, especially in his lighter form. But as a weathered
and worn player at age 29, Johnson wants to be able to run in the
more up-and-down offense the nuevo Knicks will turn on this season
and still keep his injury risk low by playing under 240 pounds.
Last year, he crested at 257 pounds after he severely sprained his
right ankle in November. He missed nine games, still felt great
pain, but returned.
</P>
<P>
   After Patrick Ewing crashed down on his wrist in December,
Johnson forced himself to play on an ankle that was as wobbly as a
flat tire by season's end. In a way, the lockout was a rebirth for
him. He had a chance to rest the chronic back problems that have
haunted him for several years and to heal his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   While other Knicks took the layoff as an opportunity to let
themselves go just a bit, Johnson was in the weight room filling in
his smaller frame with more muscle mass, a bulk that he believes
will help him bang against larger power forwards. Coach Jeff Van
Gundy isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Johnson is the perfect example of a guy who has been
able to focus in on what's important,'' said Van Gundy, who has
marveled at Johnson's conditioning and questioned that of his other
teammates. ``I think he's been a great example the first two days
of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also an example for Sprewell to follow. Johnson once
arrived in New York with a reputation for being a difficult
teammate in light of his head-bumping with Alonzo Mourning in
Charlotte. He was seen as the brash, gold-toothed Grandmama from
the shoe commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has been caustic and moody with reporters at times,
he has been nothing but the model teammate. If anything, Johnson
came to the Knicks two years ago and deferred too much to Ewing.
The once assertive Johnson became the wallflower. It took Ewing's
injury last season to bring out the star player in Johnson again.
Even though Ewing has returned this year _ and Johnson still
believes the offense has to revolve around their center in the
half-court _ this is not the plodding old Knicks, not with Sprewell
on the floor. Instead of resisting change, Sprewell's presence is
welcomed by Johnson, who understands what it's like to be the new
guy with a past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming in here, I didn't think too much about what
the guys thought of me,'' Johnson said. ``I knew inside who I was.
So I'd tell everyone to forget what you've read. You don't know
Spree by what you've read or seen on TV. You make mistakes all the
time. I learned that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans on being a supportive caretaker of his
controversial teammate. ``We're not going to introduce him to New
York,'' Johnson said. ``We're going to keep him low profile and
have him think nothing but basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was Johnson's focus during the tedium of the lockout.
Instead of letting up, he pressed on with the discipline of a new
religion. It won't be easy to carry on in his new way of living.
Some mornings, it's especially tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm getting up in the morning, fixing breakfast for my
boys, and they're eating turkey bacon,'' Johnson said. ``Man,
that's smelling good.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CHANGE IS DEMANDED TO RIGHT THE OLYMPIC WRONGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OLYMPICS-SCANDAL) 
Robert H. Helmick, a lawyer in Des Moines, was president of the
U.S.Olympic Committee and a member of the IOC from 1985 to 1991. He
remains a member of the USOC board of directors.

 By ROBERT H. HELMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scandal surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City for the
2002 Olympics is only a symptom of a more deeply rooted problem,
which will require a major shake-up of sport's international ruling
bodies if we are to preserve and protect the Olympic ideal. This
crisis requires a drastic reform of the International Olympic
Committee and its overly pampered ``lords'' and a renewed focus on
its real purpose: the athletes and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing short of the departure of the IOC's president, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, and his close associates will allow the sweeping
changes needed to restore public confidence in the Olympic Games
and their leadership, so badly tarnished by disclosures of cash
payments and perks made to influence the choice of the Utah site.
Without a thorough housecleaning, future scandals cannot be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The sordid story of the selling of the Olympics came as no
surprise to me and others familiar with the recent history of IOC
excesses. Rather than concentrating on the needs of athletes and
fair competition in the winter and summer Games, a culture built
around their own comfort became the norm for the 114 IOC members as
they girdled the globe to consider competing city bids.
</P>
<P>
   They got accustomed to being treated like royalty: first-class
air tickets, luxury hotel suites, limousines, lavish entertaining
and endless rounds of gift giving to win their favor _ and votes.
One of the Salt Lake City organizers protested that the IOC was
allocated $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 suite for
Samaranch, and an additional $1.1 million transportation budget,
including chauffeurs for IOC members. With this atmosphere, it's no
wonder that an extra $25,000 to influence a site-selection vote was
considered small change in this twisted version of a free market in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that almost encourages corruption to flourish.
Aware of the worldwide uproar, the IOC hierarchy has once again
settled on the ``few bad apples'' solution to deal with the most
flagrant offenders. Designated villains have already been fingered
to take the fall and perhaps the go-along-get-along IOC survivors
will even (gulp!) adopt a code of ethics. But this would be
applying a Band-Aid to a cancerous growth when radical surgery is
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than just expelling 10 or a dozen IOC members caught
with their hands in the Olympic cookie jar, systemic change must be
made to prevent future scandals. Or else it will be, in the words
of a sports sage, deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   What must be done? Samaranch's idea of concentrating greater
power in a smaller group is exactly the wrong solution. Instead,
the right course is to make the IOC more democratic, more
accountable and more open in its decision-making processes. The
self-perpetuating IOC members are now virtually installed for a
lifetime and owe their loyalty primarily to the reigning president.
As a result, internal criticism or even policy differences are
practically nonexistent. Limiting the terms of IOC members, ending
the practice of secret voting, mandating a larger percent of
athlete-members and opening IOC records to public scrutiny are
reforms whose times have come.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch must also go. He has made great contributions to the
Olympic movement but he will be too defensive and too focused on
defending the past rather than adapting to a new future. So, he
should not remain in office until his term ends in 2001, when he
will be 81 years old. A new leader would have a freer hand to
introduce and advocate the overhaul to clean up the current mess
and renew confidence in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Samaranch must take responsibility for the Salt
Lake City fiasco, even if he was not personally involved, because
it happened on his watch. After all, the leaders of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee stepped down to accept responsibility for its
members' actions. Samaranch's resignation would advance the Olympic
cause and dramatize the need for an overhaul in international
sport.
</P>
<P>
   I know: in 1991, when I was accused of impropriety, I resigned
as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, even though I felt
then, and still believe now, that the conflict-of-interest
allegations were not justified. It was a difficult choice, but I
left because it was necessary in the greater interest of sports and
the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the corporate sponsors of the Olympic Games should
demand far-reaching reforms. Companies that contribute millions of
dollars to support the games have the right and the responsibility
to make sure their reputations remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are a global treasure. They are held so dedicated
athletes can demonstrate the upper limits of human achievement, and
we may see the best athletes the world has to offer in competitions
that often have a spiritual dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget those heart-stopping moments when an underdog
U.S. ice hockey team defeated the Soviet Union or when U.S. female
gymnasts overcame adversity to capture a gold medal?
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the shabby perks and payoffs to Olympic officials
are simply fool's gold and must be relegated to last place. &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Australian Olympic officials, under pressure
at home and abroad after revelations of questionable payments
during Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 Summer Games, last week
called for change in a selection process that allows aspiring host
cities to offer substantial aid to national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials defended the Sydney bid
committee's decision to promise money for sports programs to
African members of the International Olympic Committee on the eve
of the vote for the 2000 Games. Sydney's bid won by a margin of two
votes over Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, including Australian Olympic Committee president
John Coates and IOC vice president Kevan Gosper, also asked for
quick assurances from the IOC that the Games would still take place
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for a vote of confidence,'' said Greg Thomas, a
spokesman for Sydney's organizing committee. ``We're very hopeful
that will happen. Salt Lake City has been guaranteed it will host
the Winter Games for 2002. I would be remarkable if the IOC did not
offer the same guarantee to Sydney in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney needs reaffirmation because of the stir caused by the
payments that Coates, a key member of the Sydney bid, offered to
Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda
on Sept. 22, 1993 at a Monaco hotel. That was the night before
Sydney defeated Beijing, 45-43, on the final ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Coates has acknowledged he made the offers of $35,000 each
because he felt he needed to shore up Sydney's support in Africa.
``You have to create a sense of them having some obligation to you
when they go into that room,'' he said of the vote. But Coates said
the offers, which were made in the name of the Australian Olympic
Committee, did not constitute bribery or break IOC rules because
they were between national Olympic committees and not between
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper confirmed that IOC regulations do not prohibit a national
Olympic committee from ``supporting the development of sport in
another part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be changed,'' Coates said of a system that is open
to abuse, ``but that is a process that we went into with our eyes
wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't win it on the beauty of the city and the sporting
facilities we had to offer, and we were never going to,'' Coates
added, saying that Beijing and Manchester, England, also had
programs to aid Olympic committees in Africa. Coates also said his
Africa strategy was influenced by the belief that Atlanta had used
a similar approach in its successful bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a good case for reviewing regulations and
process,'' said Gosper, a member of the executive board that met in
Lausanne, Switzerland, this weekend to hear evidence in the IOC's
investigation of corruption in Salt Lake City's successful bid for
the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Two IOC officials have resigned because of that inquiry and as
many as 11 others face expulsion or suspension. But now that
documents released Friday by Coates and the Australian Olympic
Committee have provided evidence of the final-hour payments, the
IOC had another incident to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the Sydney committee spokesman, said there was growing
concern about the impact on sponsorship. ``We'd be naive to think
that if all this continues, it won't have an effect on the Olympic
brand,'' he said. ``Our sponsors have raised general concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Sydney had raised $700 million (Australia) in
sponsorship but needed $200 million more to complete its budget. He
said fund-raising was on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said he had no intention of resigning, and Gosper, who
had been critical of the cash payments and suggested Sydney could
be stripped of the Games, tempered his comments Saturday after
speaking with Coates by telephone from Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue here is it was a continuous dialogue on a
program that was already documented and being audited,'' Gosper
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Australian Olympic Committee began providing formal aid to
athletes and coaches from the Oceania region in 1990, offering them
grants to travel to Australia and train at the Institute of Sports
in Canberra. According to Australian committee documents,
approximately 80 people benefited from that program in the first
three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, in the heat of Sydney's Olympic chase, the Australian
Olympic committee extended a similar invitation to 11 African
nations. It also offered more limited aid to Argentina, Colombia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday include copies of the cooperation
agreements signed with several of the African nations, including
Uganda and Nigeria. The Ugandan agreement was signed on Aug. 14,
1993; the Nigerian agreement on Sept. 6: 17 days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of a letter dated Aug. 25 that was sent to all 11 African
nations outlined the training grants in more detail. Whether or not
Sydney won its bid, the Australian Olympic Committee agreed to pay
for airfare, accommodations and meals for two persons from each
country for three months to the sports institute in Canberra. It
also agreed to pay a weekly living allowance of $40 (Australia).
</P>
<P>
   If Sydney won, the Australian committee agreed to extend its
annual offer through the 2000 Games and to pay for the African
Olympic teams to train one month before the Games in Australia with
free coaching, medical and physiotherapy services. The cost of the
14-nation program was estimated at $1.842 million (Australia).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was considered a good thing to do in the bidding process,''
Gosper said of the program. ``We were already doing it with
Oceania. It was openly done, and it was done generally, and it
wasn't in any way linked to a specific voting pattern. I knew about
it and was quite comfortable with it. The I.O.C. knew about it and
was quite comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gosper, who was part of the bid team, said he did not know
about Coates' decision in Monaco to offer Uganda's National Olympic
Committee, headed by Nyangweso, $5,000 a year for seven years to
support the Uganda national games and the same amount to the Kenyan
Olympic Committee, headed by Mukora, for unspecified ``Olympic
sports projects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is discomforting,'' Gosper said of the payments.
``But as Coates has said, it was a sustained effort up to the
decision. It was not introducing a new program. And it's very
important to say the program related to money going to the programs
of the NOC's. It was not going to personal improvement of bank
accounts or scholarships or favors to family members.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Reeves won't spoil fun for players, families
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves has done this Super Bowl
thing eight time previously, but he's still scratching his head
trying to figure out just how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   He was 1-1 as a player with the Dallas Cowboys, 1-2 as an
assistant with Dallas, and 0-3 as coach of the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   So he's mixing up a few things as the Falcons (16-2) prepare for
Super Bowl XXXIII against Denver (16-2) next Sunday in Miami. The
most notable development is that Reeves decided to allow players to
have their families stay with them at the Miami Airport Hilton and
Towers hotel.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line between coaches being too strict the week
before the Super Bowl, thus creating unnecessary anxiety, and
running too loose a ship, thus losing concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to enjoy it,'' Reeves said. ``It's not going to be
one of those things where we bunker down and take away everything
and not allow them to have a life this next week. They just got to
realize what is important, and get themselves ready for the biggest
game they've ever played in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families are staying with them at the hotel. That's
something not many teams would do, but that's the way we've
approached the whole season. Hopefully, we'll handle that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will eliminate curfews tonight and probably Monday nigh,
but later curfews are possible, even probable, every night as the
earnest preparation begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of lecturing from Reeves, the 14 other members of the
coaching staff and front office with Super Bowl experience, or the
team's four Super Bowl veteran players -- Cornelius Bennett, Eugene
Robinson, Tony Martin and Randy Fuller -- can prepare first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't realize until we get to the hotel that it's not
like a normal hotel on a road trip,'' Reeves said. ``Everything is
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has done a great job all year preparing . . . under
different circumstances. We had the week off to get ready for the
playoff game, where I missed two weeks (after heart bypass surgery)
. . . injuries . . . this group has done a good job.''

 &HT;    Atlanta prepares big sendoff for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Chuck Smith and his Falcon teammates roll through
Centennial Park at about 1:30 today in three buses, he'll be a bit
out of sorts while waving to fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (16-2) have had one week to get used to the idea of
playing the Broncos (16-2) in Super Bowl XXXIII next Sunday, but
there are still times it's hard to believe they beat the Vikings
30-27 in overtime in last Sunday's NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   So fans should forgive Smith if he looks a little bug-eyed
during today's official ``sendoff'' as the Falcons head to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time he and his teammates act like they belong in
the biggest game in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happened so quick,'' said Smith, a seventh-year
Falcon and native of Athens who was around when the team went 3-13
in 1996, and started last season 1-7 before winning 22 of 26.
``It's kind of strange how long we've been playing (this season).
Usually, I'm in Jamaica by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Keith Brooking is usually hitting the books
about about now. The rookie from Georgia Tech, who grew up in
Senoia, south of Atlanta, occasionally finds himself in a state of
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly overwhelming for me, and one of the reasons is I
grew up here and followed the Falcons,'' he said. ``I try to pinch
myself to make sure it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as fans began to take interest while the Falcons piled up
win after win in the midst of their franchise-record 11-game
winning streak, there was no predicting the reaction of the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rallies in Buckhead with overflow crowds, signs
all over the city, merchandise on sale every where, and talk of the
team dominates local radio and TV airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has surprised me how quickly the fans have caught on, and
supported us,'' said linebacker Henri Crockett. ``It's like
somebody flipped a switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is perhaps the best example of how confident the Falcons
are in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the (stuffing) out of a lot of teams,'' he said.
``Even when (the Vikings) scored that touchdown (to take a 27-17
lead in the fourth quarter last Sunday), I still felt like, 'We got
to hold up our end. I just felt like we were going to win.' I kind
of envisioned all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen, the native of Denmark whose 38-yard
field goal with 3:08 left in overtime is big on visualization. He
did a lot of it before that game-winning field goal, and he's
having fun visualizing today's sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are special moments in your life. Hey, that's why you
play the game,'' he said. ``It's been great, fantastic. You just
see people smiling everywhere. I hope there are thousands of people
there. Good vibes. . . . that's what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen can count on that.

 &HT;    NETANYAHU FIRES DEFENSE MINISTER WHO WAS CONSIDERING RUN AGAINST
HIM
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Leader of a country famous for pre-emptive strikes
on the battlefield, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Saturday night fired Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai before
Mordechai could resign to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   The move was the biggest surprise in a young election season
already full of surprises. Israeli television stations broke into
regular programming to show Netanyahu, at a press conference
flanked by other cabinet members, reading a letter firing
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   In it, and in Mordechai's response minutes later, Israelis saw
the two highest-ranking members of their government trading angry
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days,'' Netanyahu read, ``I have seen that your
personal ambition is stronger than anything else . . . A man who
betrays the principles of the voters is not worthy of being in our
ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai responded standing in front of his heavily-secured
home near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Netanyahu) sent me a letter full of lies and slander and
inaccuracies, which are typical of a petty politician,'' he said.
``He is not fit for my trust or the Israeli peoples' trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, 54, was a general in the Israeli army until
two-and-half years ago when he was heavily courted by both
Netanyahu's Likud Party and the rival Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the right-wing Likud Party and his active campaigning
was instrumental in helping Netanyahu edge out then-Prime Minister
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a highly-decorated military commander,
Mordechai was born in Iraqi Kurdistan and was the most prominent of
the Sephardic Jews, whose families immigrated to Israel from Asia
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly half the Israeli population, they are an important
voting block but have long felt alienated by Israeli Jews from
Europe and are under-represented in the political elite. The
Sephardic vote went to Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Netanyahu and Mordechai had become
increasingly strained over the last year. Mordechai, a moderate on
Israeli security issues who ept close contact with American
officials, complained openly about the slow pace with which
Netanyahu was handling the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a rivalry with Ariel Sharon, the right-wing former
general who Netanyahu appointed foreign minister in October.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's abrupt firing, though surprising, is indicative of
this prime ministerial election. The Israeli parliament, with
Netanyahu's coalition steadily losing support, in December moved
elections forward from the year 2000 to May 17 of this year. Since
then, the election season has been marked by defections from both
major parties, and a series of mysterious break-ins at Labor Party
offices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Mordechai was negotiating with a newly-formed
centrist political block seeking to unseat Netanyahu. The group was
headed by former Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. Shahak was reportedly
willing to let Mordechai head the group, and thereby be the
candidate for prime minister, if he had the better chance of
beating Netanyahu. They were reportedly close to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mordechai let pass a deadline for getting on the
Likud Party list for seats in parliament, though he had not said
whether he had decided to leave the party. There appeared to be an
ongoing bidding war between Netanyahu and Shahak for Mordechai's
loyalties, until Netanyahu fired him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Netanyahu) obviously thought he had him until the last
minute,'' said Israeli political scientist David Newman. ``If
anyone will take votes away from him it is Mordechai.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has seen a handful of supporters vow to oppose him in
the elections, but Mordechai is the most important.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said he was not sure if any previous Israeli prime
minister has fired a defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Israel has) lost a certain moderating influence in the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported Saturday that Netanyahu intended to
replace Mordechai with another former general, Moshe Arens, a Likud
member who had already announced that he was running against
Netanyahu in the party primary.

 &HT;    Credit Mrs. Reeves with husband's successes
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the school bus rumbled across rural Georgia, teen
matchmakers paired off a sophomore football player named Dan Reeves
with a cheerleader named Pam White.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was 15, White 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a mushy story,'' Pam Reeves recalled. ``The head
cheerleader used to ride the bus with Dan, and she believed we
would be a good couple. She finally pointed me out to him. He
called me and our first date _ a double date _ was a sock hop.''
</P>
<P>
   What attracted her to Reeves? ``Probably what attracts most
young girls to someone,'' she said with a rolling drawl. ``I
thought he was so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost four decades later, Dan and Pam Reeves are still
together. They wed in 1964 at First Methodist Church of Americus
while both finished up college: Dan at the University of South
Carolina, Pam at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   As Dan Reeves has become a legendary figure in the National
Football League _ the Falcons head coach has played or coached in
nine of the 33 Super Bowls _ his wife has provided the loyalty,
courage and flexibility for him to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be where I am without her,'' Dan Reeves said.
``When it comes right down to it, I just always wanted to do
whatever would make her proud. It was true in high school, it was
true when I married her and it's still true today.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves' stoic nature is credited for helping her husband
recover from a quadruple heart-bypass operation on Dec. 14 _ at the
heart of a pressure-packed season. Despite her private nature, she
provided moral support at a very public press conference, and
shielded him from ill-timed visits from well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely reserved _ she originally said she didn't want to do
an interview for this story because ``it is not part of my job
description'' _ Pam Reeves is described by friends as a Southern
lady, a Steel Magnolia whose loyalty to friends, family and
marriage comes first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pam is a very good balance for Dan,'' said Betty Manders of
Dallas, a friend of the family since 1965. ``She's the one who
keeps things in perspective. She's very grounded. But she's also
very witty and she's able to keep things from getting too somber.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a skill she's honed over the years as a football wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get too high on victory,'' Pam Reeves said. ``I
always tell my friends who congratulate me, `Be careful, or you'll
have to send me condolences next week.' But it also teaches you not
to get too low when you're getting beat. You always have to
remember to focus on the next game. Because in football, there's
always another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves, the youngest of four children, was introduced to
football by her father, W.D. White, a former state patrolman and
director of the local division of the Georgia Housing and Finance
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot with my daddy,'' she said. ``He taught me how to
drive.... He taught me how to shoot a .22. And he taught me about
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she developed a deeper understanding of the game
as her husband traveled the country first as a pro football player,
then as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   A love for the game grew more slowly. Although she will watch a
``good college game'' by herself, she is not a full-fledged
fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably developed a passion for it when it started putting
bread on the table,'' she said. (Dan Reeves has a five-year, $9
million contract with the Falcons.)
</P>
<P>
   She also mastered an understanding of the NFL culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the great thing about Pam Reeves is she understands
that everyone does better _ husbands and wives, coaches and players
_ if they're all on the same page,'' said Billy ``White Shoes''
Johnson, the Falcons' player programs coordinator. ``It's important
to see this at the top. It's good for all of us to see how
important they are to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When a garage sale fund-raiser was held last year at the
Falcons' training camp in Suwanee, Ga., Pam Reeves came in _ and
pitched in _ before anyone even realized who she was, Johnson said.
``She was just one of the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves equates her life to that of a military wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like being in the Army,'' she said. ``You learn to
be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first NFL stop was Dallas in 1965, shortly after she was
married. Reeves, a former quarterback, became a running back for
the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Dallas was hard on her, because the young couple was
hundreds of miles from their families. ``I had never been west of
the Mississippi before that,'' she said. But they had their babies
_ two girls and a boy _ and over 16 years, established roots.
</P>
<P>
   Manders and her husband, Dave, who also played with the Cowboys,
became friends with the Reeveses while they were neighbors in
adjacent apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Michigan, and she's from the South, so it took us a
while just to understand each other,'' Manders recalled. ``She
introduced us to so much about Southern culture, though. I like
grits now. And I remember when she brought over a sweet potato pie.
I had never heard of such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he a coach with the Cowboys, Dan Reeves got an offer
to be head coach of the Denver Broncos, and the family was uprooted
again, this time leaving behind decade-long friendships in Dallas.
But it was particularly hard on the oldest child, Dana, who was on
the cusp of 16 and had been attending a private Christian school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dragging my feet too, but I think she had the toughest
time,'' Pam Reeves said of her daughter. ``Of course, we were all
thrilled that Dan had this opportunity and we moved forward. But at
times, it was difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reeves family fell in love with Denver, however, and stayed
there for 12 years, until Dan Reeves was fired and then signed up
to head the New York Giants in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Pam and Dan Reeves moved as a couple, because their
children by then were in college or on their own. And the Reeveses
were captivated with the landscape of New Jersey. Yes, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when people think of New Jersey, they think of
Newark,'' Pam Reeves said. ``But it was one of the most beautiful
states I've ever seen. In many ways, it's very similar to Atlanta.
In fact, it has more pink dogwoods than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the call came from the Falcons, the couple were ready
to return to their native Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple settled in a French country home, throwing oriental
rugs on the heart-pine planks and filling the house with antiques
and the photos of their family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their free time was spent with two of their children,
Lee and Dana, and grandchildren. (Laura, their third child, still
lives in Dallas with her husband and child.)
</P>
<P>
   Both love books, with Dan preferring historical pieces and Pam
``reading anything I can get my hands on.'' Monopoly is their
favorite board game. And the couple often face off with a game of
gin or a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   The last two months have been tough. From Dan's bypass surgery
to the grueling NFL playoffs, both Dan and Pam have had to tap into
reserves of strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was not my nature,'' she said. ``I typically get
my strength from Dan, but I guess when the main man goes down, you
just do what you have to do. I didn't have time to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she doesn't go into the particulars _ preferring to
merely say ``it's like childbirth _ it sort of all fades away'' _
family and friends say Pam Reeves is the one who keeps things on
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Mom holding everything together, '' said her son Lee, a
31-year-old Atlanta lawyer. ``It was Mom who led the prayers for
Dad. It was Mom who kept up the smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says she is not a pillar of strength, but she is, for my
kids and for myself,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be where I am today
without her.''
</P>
<P>
   The trauma of the heart surgery led Dan Reeves to shed some of
his stern image. While discussing his bypass surgery during a press
conference, the coach broke into tears. His wife held his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Pam Reeves, that moment was wrought with emotion. She was
happy he felt secure enough to share a little more of himself with
the outside world. But intensely private herself, she also was
protective of how his tears would be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, crying is just part of being a heart patient,''
she said. ``But I was glad that everyone could finally see that Dan
is the sensitive person I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the couple is concentrating on the Super Bowl, although
their hallmark steadiness carries over in the preparations. Dan
Reeves has received more than 2,000 letters and cards of support,
and they were both touched by the turnout at the airport when the
team returned from their victory over the Minnesota Vikings in last
Sunday's NFC championship game. But Pam Reeves said the family is
trying to enjoy the hoopla without losing focus.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no special meal, bedtime or routine the night
before the Super Bowl, she said. Although the couple does plan to
get a nice seafood meal in Miami _ a bow to Dan's heart surgery and
low-fat diet _ things will probably be as routine as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a special game, but I don't see a lot of uptightness,''
she said. ``We'll probably come back (from dinner) and he'll do
whatever he normally does. And that will be that.''

INDY RACING lEAGUE HAS AN EYE OUT FOR NEXT SUPERSTAR 
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three seasons and 24 races into its checkered history, the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League has produced a bonafide marquee driver.
</P>
<P>
   And bid him ``adieu''.
</P>
<P>
   Former series champion Tony Stewart will not be in the starting
lineup for the season-opening TransWorld Diversified Services Indy
200 at Walt Disney World Speedway today. The original IRL ``Poster
Boy'' with Team Menard, Stewart's immediate racing future lies in
NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, where he is preparing to begin his
rookie season with Joe Gibbs Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Arie Luyendyk, the
IRL's all-time victory leader with four, plans to compete only in
the 83rd edition of that famed event on May 30 before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the irony. Stewart _ the prototypical American-born,
short-track, open-wheel driver for whom Tony George founded the
series in 1995 _ racing with fenders. And a roof. In front of
sold-out grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Luyendyk _ the series' first established ``name'' driver
_ never racing again at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.
Luyendyk made national headlines there after being slapped to the
ground by rival team owner A.J. Foyt in Victory Lane after the
inaugural True Value 500K night race in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the IRL once again having to audition for an undisputed
superstar. Not that the garage area is lacking marketable talent.
Reigning series champion Kenny Brack and 1998 Indy 500 champion
Eddie Cheever Jr. have spent the offseason preaching the IRL gospel
_ and dutifully dropping the names of Greg Ray, Billy Boat, Davey
Hamilton, Scott Sharp, Scott Goodyear, Robby Unser, Sam Schmidt and
Jason Leffler.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of the above capable of carrying the league through its
fourth season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem filling Tony Stewart's shoes,'' said Ray,
who has replaced Stewart as the lone IRL driver at Team Menard.
Ray, whose best IRL finish to-date is a second-place finish behind
Boat at TMS, will make his debut for millionaire car-owner John
Menard in Orlando today. But Ray already is matching Stewart on the
brashmeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, I was begging _ dying _ to go drive the
car with Tony on the same day,'' Ray said during a preseason test
in Fort Worth. ``Same car. Right now. Because I expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Stewart's a great guy and a great driver. I'll take him
on any day, anywhere, any time. I just hear that `Tony Stewart sets
the standards.' Well, knowing what I know, he didn't set the
standards. I just feel like he's gotten way more credit than he
deserves. Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, at 41 one of the series' elder statesmen, believes the
IRL can sell that kind of irreverent attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing drivers,'' said Cheever, ``are not ordained like the
Pope. They're created. The way you create them is to have racing
drivers competing against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL has done an incredible job understanding what the
American public wants _ oval racing. You'd be hard put to find a
series where the racing is harder. The IRL is emulating a lot of
things NASCAR did _ and racing on ovals is one of them. It's
probably the fastest racing series in the world. And as we've seen
\Rwith the crowds\S in Texas, once they see a race in person,
they're hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, in fact, suggested that the real ``star'' of the IRL at
this point is the racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good racing, very good racing,'' said Brack, a native of
Sweden who won a record three events in 1998. ``We need to draw
people's attention to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, the president of Charlotte Motor
Speedway and a NASCAR diehard, said IRL superspeedway races are
throwbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have no respect for each other,'' said Wheeler,
whose track is scheduled to play host to the IRL's Indy 500
``tuneup race'' on May 1. ``It looks like stock cars from 1958, on
dirt. They dart and do things that stock cars can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Auto Club Silver Crown graduate Donnie Beechler, who
qualified for eight IRL events as a rookie last season, agreed the
racing is the league's hook for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the IRL is that we are not in everybody's
living room every weekend like the Winston Cup series,'' said
Beechler, who posted a best finish of 10th last season. ``We run 11
races. When you are \Ron TV\S every Sunday or Saturday night, the
names become familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack has talked up the series during a slew of nationwide
public relations visits this offseason. But Brack, who drives for
four-time Indy 500 champion Foyt, remains reluctant to tag himself
as Poster Boy II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like a star?'' Brack said, rhetorically. ``I feel
like my normal self. For me, I've proved myself, and people know I
can drive. I get respect for that. But I don't look upon myself as
a star. I think being yourself is the best way, always.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack's reserved off-track style stands in contrast to that of
the ever-aggressive Stewart, who leaves the IRL having led the most
laps in series history with 1,502. That is 1,085 more laps than
runner-up Jeff Ward. But even with the resources of Team Menard at
his disposal, Stewart has yet to win the Indy 500.

   ``The greatest thing the IRL has going for it is the Indy 500,''
Wheeler said. ``The Indy 500 is still the greatest race in the
world. If Kenny Brack wins the Indy 500 this year, everybody in the
free world is going to know that _ at least for 48 hours.''

IMAGE DOES NOT VIOLATE LAW ON PORNOGRAPHY, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The crude, cut-and-paste renderings of a
homeless Olathe laborer did not violate a Kansas law designed to
outlaw computer ``morphed'' child pornography, a Johnson County
judge ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that raised potential constitutional issues, the
decision boiled down to one picture that showed the head of what
prosecutors alleged was a child pasted onto a picture of an adult
woman's nude body.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge John Anderson III ruled that he could not find
beyond a reasonable doubt that the face depicted a child under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Though Randy Shores possessed hundreds of pictures of women and
girls and many written notations describing sexual activity with
children, the judge found that only the one picture possibly
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case absolutely disgusts me,'' Anderson said. ``But I
swore to uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   He then found Shores not guilty of sexual exploitation of a
child and ordered him released from jail, where he had been held
since August.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he would not release to Shores his book filled
with hundreds of pictures of nude women and pictures of young girls
cut out of catalogs and magazines. And he said he would not allow
Shores to have his journal, in which he chronicled graphic
descriptions of his sexual fantasies involving young girls.
</P>
<P>
   He called the journal the ``single most shocking, disgusting and
really absolutely terrifying piece of evidence in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the journal and the ideas expressed in it were not
illegal under Kansas law.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Toth, an assistant district attorney, had presented the
journal as evidence of Shores' state of mind in possessing the
allegedly illegal pictures.
</P>
<P>
   For Shores to be found guilty, Toth had to show that Shores
possessed the pictures with the intent to satisfy his sexual
desires.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing to have the case dismissed, defense attorney Blithe
Cravens Leece said Friday that the state was overreaching in trying
to apply the law to Shores' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to judge his ideas, whether you find them
disgusting or not,'' Leece said.
</P>
<P>
   Shores, 43, who has a prior conviction for a misdemeanor sex
offense involving a child, was the first person in Kansas
prosecuted under the law that went into effect in July.

   HOUSTON _ a plus for adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Students never leave their little corner of the school. There
are four classrooms to a pod. Each classroom has a bathroom and a
``focus room,'' where students can go to cool off, study quietly or
work with a learning specialist or a peer. The classes eat lunch
one room at a time, in a common area two feet outside their
classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   The students wear uniforms _ blue or khaki pants and a
company-issued polo shirt. There are two or three teachers for
every class of 18 to 24 students.
</P>
<P>
   The school provides individualized education plans, using books,
videos and personal computers. Instruction focuses on the basic
skills required for high school graduation. The course work is
accelerated and intense, so there is no homework _ one less thing
for a student to forget or leave at home.
</P>
<P>
   The company contracts with local law enforcement agencies,
courts and public and private social services agencies to address
the needs of the whole child _ on site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're more than just an alternative school,''
said Anthony Edwards, administrator of Houston's newest Community
Education Partners school. ``We feel like we're a community
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston and in Dallas _ the latest district to sign on with
the company _ school board members and teachers union leaders rave
about the results achieved in the partnership schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so grateful to have them here,'' said Gayle Fallon,
president of the Houston Federation of Teachers. ``It's really made
a difference for the students. It's made a difference for the
teachers.''  &LR; brk:Students satisfied  &LR; tx:And students like the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Jaclyn Perez, 17, should be in the 11th grade. But she skipped
so much school, she's classified as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hanging with the crowd, skipping school, not doing
my work, arguing with the teacher. I was bad,'' Perez said. ``I
regret that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she stays in a partnership school for three semesters,
she'll have earned enough credits to go back to her home school.
Perez could return after two semesters, but she's doing so well at
the school, she's reluctant to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay here as long as I can,'' Perez said. ``And
go back just in enough time to graduate. ``Cause if I go back there
(now), I'm just going to start messing up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Eiland hated the partnership school his first few months. He
wanted to wear jewelry and flirt with the girls. His teachers say
he came to the school loud, belligerent and vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is the school's first student council president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so much better now,'' Eiland said. ``I've been on the
honor roll...I can't see why I couldn't do this at my home school,
'cause it's so easy to me. I learn fast and I work fast. This is
like the me I was in middle school. I'm proud of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Results like those obtained with Perez and Eiland are just what
the Kansas City school district needs, said Jim Dougherty, director
of De La Salle Education Center, a privately run alternative school
that works with the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that the district is thinking of doing this, because
God knows we need it,'' said Dougherty, who also made the trip to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll support them, but I'll also be concerned that the
district realize that they're part of the problem. We can't just
look at it as, `We have to fix the kids.' ''

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JILL ABRAMSON 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This time last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton
described, in a now-famous appearance on the NBC News program
``Today,'' how a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' was trying to
destroy her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, some of the most serious damage to Bill
Clinton's presidency came not from his high-profile political
enemies but from a small secret clique of lawyers in their 30s who
share a deep antipathy toward the president, according to nearly
two dozen interviews and recently filed court documents.
</P>
<P>
   While cloaking their roles, the lawyers were deeply involved _
to an extent not previously known _ for nearly five years in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. They then helped push the
case into the criminal arena and into the office of the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader was Jerome M. Marcus, a 39-year-old associate
at the Philadelphia law firm of Berger &AMP; Montague, whose partners
are major contributors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Jones never met him or knew he had worked on her
behalf, Marcus drafted legal documents and was involved in many of
the important strategic decisions in her lawsuit, according to
billing records and interviews with other lawyers who worked on the
case. As much as any of Ms. Jones' lawyers of record, Marcus helped
keep Ms. Jones' case alive in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus recruited others to assist his efforts, including several
friends from the University of Chicago Law School. One of those who
was approached, Paul Rosenzweig, briefly considered doing work for
Ms. Jones in 1994, according to billing records and interviews, but
decided not to. In November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office,
where he and Marcus had several telephone conversations about the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosenzweig who fielded a ``heads-up'' phone call from
Marcus on Jan. 8, 1998, that first tipped off Starr's office about
Monica S. Lewinsky and Linda R. Tripp. The tip was not mentioned in
the 445-page Starr report, even the information revived a moribund
Whitewater investigation that would not have produced, it now
seems, an impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus did make his views known publicly last month when he
wrote an impassioned commentary in The Washington Times urging the
impeachment of Clinton. ``The cancer is deadly,'' Marcus wrote.
``It, and its cause, must be removed.'' He identified himself in
the newspaper simply as ``a lawyer in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   In long efforts to promote Ms. Jones' lawsuit, and in helping
Mrs. Tripp find her way to Starr, Marcus found other allies,
including another Chicago law classmate, Richard W. Porter. Porter
had worked as an aide to former Vice President Dan Quayle and on
the Bush-Quayle campaign, where he did opposition research; he was
a partner of Starr's at the law firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, based in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Conway III, a New York lawyer educated at Yale, shared
Marcus' low view of Clinton. When the Jones case led to Ms.
Lewinsky, Marcus and Conway searched for a new lawyer for Mrs.
Tripp and encouraged her to take her explosive allegations to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are only now coming into focus, as a few of their
associates have begun to discuss their activities and their names
appear repeatedly in the final legal bills submitted by the
original Jones legal team. Marcus, Porter and Conway did not
respond to numerous requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the Senate this week, the president's
lawyers said that there was collusion between Starr's office, Mrs.
Tripp and the lawyers for Ms. Jones in the weeks leading up to the
president's deposition last January. If witnesses are called in the
Senate impeachment trial, the president's lawyers may explore the
issue further, several Clinton legal advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, denied there was
collusion between the independent counsel's office and the Jones
team, including Marcus. ``There was absolutely no conspiracy
between the Jones lawyers and our office,'' Bakaly said. ``Judge
Starr has testified to the circumstances as to how this matter came
to our attention, and the actions that we took thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his grand jury testimony in August that his
political enemies ``just thought they would take a wrecking ball to
me and see if they could do some damage.'' That wrecking ball was
wielded by Marcus and his colleagues, who managed to drive Paula
Jones' allegation of sexual misconduct into the courtroom and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, Porter and Rosenzweig were classmates at the University
of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1986. Conway met the others
through the Jones case. Some of the lawyers were also involved with
the Federalist Society, a legal group that includes conservative
and libertarian luminaries like Starr, Robert H. Bork and Richard
Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, the most overtly political member of the group, was also
an associate of Peter W. Smith, 62, a Chicago financier who was
once the chairman of College Young Republicans and a major donor to
Gopac, a conservative political group affiliated with former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Beginning in 1992, Smith spent more than
$80,000 to finance anti-Clinton research in an effort to persuade
the mainstream press to cover Clinton's sex life. Among others, his
efforts involved David Brock, the journalist who first mentioned
the name ``Paula'' in an article on Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Brock said, Smith helped introduce him to the Arkansas
state troopers who accused Clinton of using them to procure women
when he was governor of Arkansas. Brock wrote an article based on
the troopers' account of Clinton's sexual escapades that was
published in the January 1994 issue of The American Spectator, a
conservative magazine. According to Brock, Smith wanted to
establish a fund for the troopers, in case they suffered
retribution. Brock said he opposed payments because they would
undermine the troopers' credibility.
</P>
<P>
   To allay his concerns, Brock said, Smith urged him to speak to
Porter, who was then working at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, the Chicago law
firm that employed Starr in its Washington office. Brock said he
had hoped his talk with Porter would put an end to any planned
payments to the troopers, but Smith did pay them and their lawyers
$22,600. In 1992, Smith also paid Brock $5,000 to research another
bit of Arkansas sex lore regarding Clinton, a rumor that has since
proved to be baseless. Brock did not pursue an article.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's trooper article in The American Spectator mentioned a
woman identified only as ``Paula,'' and in May 1994, Ms. Jones
filed her lawsuit against Clinton. Ms. Jones' lawyers of record
were from the Washington area, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph
Cammarata, whom Marcus had helped recruit.

WASHINGTON.: helped recruit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Davis and Cammarata billing records show that from their
earliest involvement in the case, they were consulting with Marcus
and Porter. Conway also helped draft briefs, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus was heavily involved,'' Cammarata said, ``but he
insisted that he not be identified, but that was fine with me. We
were just two guys involved in the middle of a world war. We needed
all the help we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more important to the Jones case than Marcus. Besides
helping to write several important briefs, Marcus spoke numerous
times at the most critical moments in the case with Cammarata and
Davis, offering legal advice that Cammarata said was ``vital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the billing records, Porter also offered ``legal
strategy'' and once wrote a memo on ``investigative leads'' that
might embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter was a cheerleader,'' Cammarata said. ``He used to call
up and say, `Maybe we can find you some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's legal advisers said he noticed a marked
difference in quality between the routine legal pleadings filed by
the Cammarata and Davis team, and the polished, scholarly briefs
written by the shadow legal team headed by Marcus and Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, meanwhile, was so successful at keeping the extent of
his role a secret that even Cammarata only found out recently that
Marcus had trouble finding lawyers to agree to represent Ms. Jones.
``No one wanted to touch the case,'' Cammarata said. ``No one
wanted to take on the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Marcus also briefly considered assisting the
Jones lawyers. In June 1994, Rosenzweig, a lawyer at a small law
firm in Washington, expressed interest in doing legal work on
behalf of Ms. Jones, but he did none, said lawyers involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Conway wanted his role kept hidden as well, because his New York
law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, included influential
Democrats like Bernard W. Nussbaum, a former White House counsel.
Conway's name does not appear on any billing records.
</P>
<P>
   Although the billing records show communication between Porter
and the Jones lawyers from 1994 to 1997, he denied in a written
statement last fall doing legal work for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Because Porter is a partner at the firm where Starr worked until
he took a leave of absence last August, any role played by Porter
in the Jones case could have posed a conflict of interest for Starr
once he became independent counsel. Starr has said he did not
discuss the Jones case with Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has acknowledged contacts with Davis, specifically six
telephone discussions the two had in 1994, before Starr became
independent counsel. In fact, Starr has been criticized the phone
conversations to Attorney General Janet Reno, when he was seeking
to expand his investigation to the Lewinsky matter. Starr has said
it did not occur to him to mention the conversations because he did
not do work on the Jones case and simply offered his publicly
stated position on a point of constitutional law that presidents
are not immune from civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jones lawyers argued before the Supreme Court in May
1996, paving the way to the fateful 9-0 decision that the president
was not immune from civil lawsuits, Conway went to Washington for a
practice argument. He joined Davis, Cammarata, Bork and Theodore
Olson, a Washington lawyer and friend of Starr, at the Army-Navy
Club here.
</P>
<P>
   When Cammarata and Davis quit as Ms. Jones' lawyers after she
failed to reach a settlement with Clinton's lawyers in 1997, Marcus
and his colleagues established ties to her new lawyers at the
Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke and the
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., which helped pay her
legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rosenzweig went to work as a prosecutor in
Starr's office. From November to January, Rosenzweig spoke several
times by telephone with Marcus and discussed the Jones case, a
lawyer with knowledge of the conversations said. But Bakaly,
Starr's spokesman, said that Rosenzweig did not tell any of his
colleagues about what he learned about developments in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Mrs. Tripp was cooperating with the Jones lawyers.
She was also taping her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, which her
friend, Lucianne Goldberg, a Manhattan literary agent, had
incorrectly assured her was legal. In December, Mrs. Tripp became
frantic that she might be prosecuted because such taping is illegal
in Maryland, where Mrs. Tripp lives. Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg
thought of a possible solution: perhaps she could receive immunity
from prosecution from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg called Smith, the Chicago financier, and Porter for
advice on how Mrs. Tripp might approach Starr. In a teleconference
during the first week of January 1998, Ms. Goldberg talked to
Porter and Marcus. Meanwhile, Marcus sought new lawyers for Mrs.
Tripp. Conway suggested an old friend, James Moody, a Washington
lawyer and fellow Federalist Society member, whom Mrs. Tripp
retained.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was Starr's former law partner, Porter did not want
to be the first one to call the independent counsel's office on
behalf of Mrs. Tripp. So it Marcus made the call to Rosenzweig.

MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S SCHOOL SETUP `FITS A NEED,' KC SAYS OF
HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANIKA WHITE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With his shiny gold jewelry and outgoing personality,
17-year-old Adrian Eiland was quite the ladies' man at his Houston
high school.
</P>
<P>
   His skills on the drums were second to none. And, man, could he
sing.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to schoolwork, Eiland just didn't have time.
</P>
<P>
   So Eiland frequently skipped school. When he was there, he made
it difficult for the teachers to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of friends,'' Eiland said. ``And I got caught in
the mix. I got so into not going to school, it became an everyday
thing. After three years, when it got closer to graduation, and I
realized I wasn't going to graduate, I decided to come to CEP.''
</P>
<P>
   Community Education Partners is a private management company
that contracts with school districts to control behavior and
accelerate learning so sixth- through 12th-graders who are behind
in their studies can return to their home schools. This week,
Kansas City School District representatives visited Eiland's school
and others run by the company to see whether the model will work
for Kansas City's disruptive students.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Houston Independent School District
contracted with the education company to help steer the thousands
of students like Eiland back on course.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland started at Community Education Partners this school year
as a junior. He's worked so hard that by June, he will be eligible
to graduate with his public school friends. He's talking about
pursuing a music career at a college in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the spotlight,'' Eiland said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City district officials came away impressed by their
visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very positive, what they're doing for the children who
are labeled at-risk in the urban environment,'' said Board
President John Rios. ``This definitely fits a need that this
district has....I was very impressed with its management, and I
think it's something we definitely need to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he may recommend to the board by next month that the
district contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have said they would like to work with at
least 1,200 Kansas City students who are violent or chronically
disruptive and at least two years behind in reading and//or math.
</P>
<P>
   The company would spend at least $10 million to renovate empty
retail space or build a one-level facility to house the students
and furnish and stock it with state-of-the-art equipment. The
school district would have to pay a daily per-pupil fee to cover
operating costs and provide transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost to the Kansas City district is not yet known. But
the price may be worth it, Rios said, considering the program's
results.
BREAKER HEAD: The three Bs The program's motto is simple: Be here.
Behave. Be learning.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, so far, the three B's seem to be working wonders, say
district officials and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the schools opened, crime in the Houston public schools
has dropped 22 percent. The average student enrolled at a Community
Education Partners Partnership School, as they are called, advances
about two grade levels in reading and a little more than one year
in math. Students go to school about 20 percent more often than
they did before.
</P>
<P>
   When students return to their home schools, after an average of
one year, company and district officials say the students continue
to attend school more regularly, have fewer behavioral problems,
earn more credits and finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   So far, evidence of the company's success is mostly anecdotal.
District officials are developing a method to track whether program
benefits continue once students return to their home schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though the school buildings are colorful and plant-filled, the
Community Education Partners format is a rigid one:
</P>
<P>
   Students come through metal detectors every day. They are
thoroughly searched, relinquishing any jewelry and money or other
personal items over $5. No watches, jackets, backpacks or other
distractions are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Students are separated into pods by gender and by progress in
the program. The more students achieve and the better they behave,
the faster they move up in levels. The higher the level, the more
privileges they are given. For example, the highest level is coed _
a plus for adolescents. MORE

KANSANS COULD USE A `HANCOCK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between Missouri's willingness to continue
extending substantial tax relief and the cold shoulder Kansas
taxpayers appear to be getting this year can be summed up in two
words:
</P>
<P>
   Mel Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Without a legal restraint such as the one Missouri's Hancock
Amendment imposes on government's insatiable appetite for money,
taxpayers will always be vulnerable. A tale of two states provides
a good example why:
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Gov. Mel Carnahan this week proposed tax cuts of $191
million despite the prospect of a state revenue bonanza that will
trigger another round of rebates to taxpayers, including Kansans
working in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing rebates are the result of a strong economy that
boosts state income beyond levels allowed by ceilings engineered
nearly two decades ago by Hancock, a Springfield businessman who
went on to serve in the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's taxpayer-protection crusade was driven by his belief
that governments shouldn't fare better than those providing
government's money. His efforts brought forth a protective shield
for Missouri taxpayers that bears his name. Under the law, the
state is required to refund excess tax revenue or offset it with
tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan emphasized how the state's booming economy prompted his
tax-cut push, but it's a good bet that few such decisions are made
in Missouri without considering the constitutional constraints
voters approved at Hancock's behest in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the restraining effect of this sort of
external discipline need only look at similar doings in Topeka,
where Kansans are at the mercy of whatever their elected
representatives deign to give them in the way of tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   With the worries of getting re-elected now conveniently behind
them, Kansas pols seem in no hurry to continue pursuing substantial
tax relief. The governor's budget, for instance, recommends new tax
cuts of just over $15 million. This compares to the $250 million in
tax cuts enacted when elections loomed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget even proposes ending the moratorium begun
a few years ago on unemployment compensation tax collections from
business, even though the fund's balance still appears well above
the level needed to finance a typical year of claims. Meanwhile,
the Kansas jobless rate remains well below the national rate.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium is estimated to save Johnson County businesses
$90 million a year and upward of $160 million annually for all
state businesses. So, if the fund is healthy, why repeal this very
attractive tax break for business?
</P>
<P>
   While there's some concern about Boeing layoffs in Wichita, a
proposal to restore the tax in its entirety appears a reaction that
is both extreme and premature.
</P>
<P>
   The governor decries speculation that his commitment to tax
relief will wane in his final term, but his actions so far as a
lame duck reflect anything but a strong dedication to fight for the
taxpayers' best interests. Nor does there seem to be much interest
in the Legislature to push further tax relief. All of which is to
be expected in the absence of a legal device that forces elected
representatives to do right by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson here, if Kansans want to ponder it.

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TURNS SHARPLY PARTISAN OVER LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
turned sharply partisan Saturday after the Republican House
prosecutors took preliminary steps to have Monica Lewinsky testify
at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The move touched off Democratic senators who complained that the
House prosecutors were preparing Lewinsky to testify even though
the Senate hasn't decided whether there will be witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors defended their action, arguing that they have
a right to prepare witnesses for depositions or live testimony
before the Senate, in case the Senate decides to have witnesses.
They prepared to interview her Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, wrote Chief Justice William Rehnquist
to ask him to keep Lewinsky from being interviewed by House
prosecutors. Harkin argued that such an interview violates ``the
Senate's sole authority...of the Constitution to try
impeachments.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said it is up to the Senate and not a judge or the House
prosecutors to decide the procedures under which witnesses can be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators showed that their senatorial sensitivities were
ruffled by the House. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized the
step was an ``arrogant disregard for the Senate.'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said the House prosecutors' action ``invited the division
of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats sent a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
chairman of the House prosecutors, asking him to ``take no action
related to the proposed interview of any witness until such time as
the Senate has given you the authority to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde responded that he believes interviewing Lewinsky will help
prosecutors determine whether to call her as a witness. Hyde said
he is still determining which witnesses to ask the Senate to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules...do not require that the House obtain the
permission of the Senate merely to conduct an interview of a
potential witness,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the professed outrage by Democrats, many Republicans
said there was nothing wrong with the effort by House prosecutors
to interview Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had a
sexual relationship with Clinton. The president was impeached for
allegedly lying about that relationship to a federal grand jury and
obstructing justice in an effort to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said the House prosecutors had the
right to interview prospective witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are allowed to call witnesses, obviously the name Monica
Lewinsky comes up,'' Bryant said. Because Lewinsky was given a
grant of immunity last year in return for her testimony before
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury, her legal situation
is more complicated and the House prosecutors needed to get a head
start. He said there would likely be no similar delay in talking to
other potential witnesses such as Clinton secretary Betty Currie
and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they afraid of? Are they afraid of our talking to
Monica Lewinsky?'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the House
prosecutors, said. ``We're not doing anything abnormal. We are
exercising our privileges, our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the 13 Republican House
prosecutors, said the interview was necessary for the prosecutors
to decide whether to submit Lewinsky's name to the Senate as a
possible trial witness.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky can resolve some of the crucial conflicts in previous
testimony, McNulty said. ``This is lawyering 101 _ any good lawyer
would talk to a witness before deciding to put her on the witness
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff groused that Starr had become
``the moving force in the development of the truth and the facts,''
a role the Constitution had reserved for the senators.
</P>
<P>
   The flap over Lewinsky began when Hyde asked Starr to ask U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson whether Lewinsky's immunity
agreement with Starr requires her to cooperate with House
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ruled Saturday that Lewinsky had to submit to an
interview request by House prosecutors. Lewinsky could also decide
to have the interview conducted by Starr's office with House
prosecutors present. She flew to Washington from California and was
expected to be interviewed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, House prosecutors will seek to persuade the senators
that they need to hear from certain witnesses in order to help
resolve the many conflicts that have come out during the trial. If
the Senate does approve calling witnesses, it might also authorize
that only written depositions be taken of each witness. The Senate
would decide after seeing each deposition whether to call any of
the witnesses to appear before the Senate to testify in public.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will also hear arguments from both sides Monday on a
motion offered by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., on a motion to
dismiss, or end, the trial. Byrd's motion to dismiss is expected to
be defeated along party lines. Republicans have 55 seats while the
Democrats hold 45 seats. The vote on whether to call witnesses is
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said he and Sen. Susan Collins,
R-Maine, have asked Bryd to reconstruct his motion to allow a
separate vote on whether to dismiss each article.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one way to at least test the strength of the House
managers case on each article separately,'' Feingold said. Another
partisan battle began brewing Saturday as Lott floated the idea of
blocking floor debate on the motions to dismiss the case and to
call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate impeachment rules lawmakers can debate each motion
for up to 16 hours each behind closed doors, but only if they vote
to do so, according to John Czwartacki, Lott's press secretary. He
said Lott opposes giving the Senate time to debate because he
believes lawmakers' minds are already made up on each issue and
that it would only delay the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans would make a final decision on the debate
issue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' Daschle said of Lott's idea. ``It's an
extraordinary new development to gag senators.''

WHEN IT COMES TO MINORITIES, HOW SOON BASEBALL FORGETS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Pa . , Ohio, N.Y.)  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a severe case of out of sight, out of mind, Major League
Baseball and its member teams have suffered a collective lapse of
memory since the celebration 21 months ago of the 50th anniversary
of Jackie Robinson's barrier-breaking exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball celebrated Robinson and his impact on the game
and society that April night at Shea Stadium in 1997, six general
managers and eight managers have been hired. The five
highest-ranking positions in the commissioner's office, four of
them new positions, have also been filled. The number of members of
minorities in those 19 hires: one, Jerry Manuel, manager of the
Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, one black general manager left his job and
two black managers were fired, leaving the minority roster in those
high-level positions reduced by a net of two. Those statistics
don't say much for the vows and promises that were rampant during
the seasonlong salute to Robinson and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the heat's turned up a little bit, the people at the top
or in position to do something make a lot of promises,'' Frank
Robinson said. ``But as soon as time passes and the heat goes down
and it's cool again, it's business as usual. You look around and
not much has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is a veteran of the minority wars. He was Major League
Baseball's first black manager and later was an assistant general
manager for five years, but he never cracked the ethnic ceiling. He
now works out of the commissioner's office but far below the level
of the top five.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, in the midst of the Jackie Robinson
celebration, the executive council, under the leadership of Bud
Selig, named Paul Beeston president and chief operating officer.
Last July the owners elected Selig commissioner. A couple of months
ago, Sandy Alderson was named executive vice president of baseball
operations, Robert DuPuy executive vice president for
administration and Rob Manfred executive vice president for labor
relations and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those particular cases,'' Selig said of the four new
officials, ``obviously I thought about it, but for each one of
those positions we already had the candidates because of their past
experience and what they brought. But we're not done there yet, and
we're sensitive to the concerns that are raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular perception had it that Bob Watson had been interviewed
for the job Alderson got. ``I was never interviewed,'' Watson said.
``I talked to Paul Beeston in the middle of last summer, and he
told me they were thinking of restructuring. He said he would
include my name on a short list. That's the last I heard of it
until the news came out that Sandy was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, Watson said, is a good man with varied experience.
``But,'' he added, ``I would love to have had the opportunity to
pursue the job. I never got a real opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the major leagues' first and only black general manager
until he voluntarily left the Yankees a year ago, was interviewed
for the general manager's job with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Were
the Dodgers sincere, or was he merely a token candidate for the job
Kevin Malone got?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I served a very good situation for them,'' Watson
said without answering the question directly.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson knows the feeling. ``I went through it three
years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the analogy of hitting a baseball well and knowing it, he
added, recalling his own experience with general manager
interviews: ``It's the same way in the interview process. From the
way they treat you, the way they talk to you, you have a good idea
when you leave about whether they were really serious about it.
When I left the two interviews I had, I knew they weren't serious,
that I didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, Ed Wade of Philadelphia, Frank Wren of Baltimore, Billy
Beane of Oakland, Steve Phillips of the Mets and Brian Cashman,
Watson's successor with the Yankees, are the general managers who
have been hired since the start of the Jackie Robinson celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you recall, during the Jackie Robinson celebration year,''
Watson said, ``there were speeches made by people in higher
positions saying that in the future there would be a number of
minorities hired in decision-making positions, and that hasn't
taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's most recent employment study, for the
1997 season, said that 15 percent of senior executives, directors
and general managers in team front offices were members of
minorities, up from 11 percent two years earlier. The figure for
central offices was 17 percent, down from 21 percent. A club
official estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of players in the
major leagues are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of last season, three assistant general managers
have been named who are members of minority groups. Dave Stewart of
Toronto, David Wilder of the Chicago Cubs and Ruben Amaro Jr. of
Philadelphia have joined Omar Minaya of the Mets and Darrell
``Doc'' Rodgers of Cincinnati in that role, as well as two women,
Elaine Steward of Boston and Kim Ng of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   At the next level down, Al Avila was recently named the Florida
Marlins' scouting director and Don Reynolds is the Montreal Expos'
new farm director.
</P>
<P>
   As more members of minorities gain those positions, there will
be more candidates in the pipeline, as baseball officials refer to
it, to be considered for general managers' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson said: ``This assistant stuff is overrated. They
would let us get to the assistant level, but they don't let us move
from there up. Not much has changed. They flower it up a little
better, but it's still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing number of black and Hispanic players over
the years, the bulging managerial pipeline rarely has disgorged a
black or Hispanic manager. Since Don Baylor, Tony Perez and Dusty
Baker were hired in a two-month period at the end of 1992, teams
have named 35 managers, not counting interim managers, and Manuel
has been the only black or Hispanic hired.
</P>
<P>
   That Manuel was hired by Jerry Reinsdorf is not surprising. The
White Sox owner is co-chairman of Major League Baseball's equal
opportunity committee and at owners' meetings has been an outspoken
advocate for minority hiring. Leonard Coleman, as National League
president, has also worked behind the scenes to promote minority
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field-manager level, as with general managers, the
institution receives a failing grade,'' said Coleman, the sport's
highest-ranking member of a minority. ``Baseball has no excuses,
period. Willie Randolph and Cookie Rojas should not have to stand
in the third base coach's box for the next 10 years. They deserve
to be in a dugout calling the shots. Chris Chambliss, who was
minor-league manager of the year, should have the opportunity to be
major-league manager of the year. The old boy network has outlived
its time. Unfortunately, it still exists at a number of levels.''
</P>
<P>
   White managers often are recycled. The Yankees, for example, are
the fourth team Joe Torre has managed. Cincinnati is Jack McKeon's
fourth. Lou Piniella is with his third team, as are Jim Leyland and
Tony LaRussa.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the failure of clubs to hire minority managers and
general managers, Robinson said, was the way the four new positions
in the commissioner's office were filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one minority was interviewed for those jobs,'' he said.
``If the heads of baseball are not fair in that area, how can they
expect the people underneath them to be fair?'' &QL;

   SURHOFF WANTS A CUBAN SEASON
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff would like the Orioles to play the Cuban national
team in Havana and in Baltimore before the coming season, but he
doesn't know if the exhibition series will be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody would like to play the games,'' said
Surhoff, an Orioles outfielder, who was a member of the delegation
that visited Cuba last week. ``From a baseball standpoint, I think
it would be fun. It would be an interesting experience. But a whole
lot of things have to be considered. A lot of them are beyond the
players' control. There are issues that are stumbling blocks, and
there are significant issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-game series must be approved by the State and Treasury
departments on the governmental front and by Major League Baseball
and the players association on the sports side. Just as
fundamentally, the Orioles and the Cuban government have to agree
on the recipient or recipients of the proceeds of the games. They
failed to reach agreement during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials initially expressed concern about the
possible ramifications of a Cuban series. They were concerned that
all players could be at risk if Cuban-Americans reacted badly to
the idea of the games. Those fears, however, seem to have
dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also were not sure that players would support
such a series, but have received no indication that serious
opposition exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played against them before; I know they can play,''
Surhoff said, referring to the 1983 Pan-American Games and an
international tournament in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, Surhoff said, was educational. ``It was a lot
different than I thought it would be,'' he said. ``I just didn't
know much about Cuba. It's a Caribbean island, and it has some
beautiful spots to it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    POPE ELEVATES MEXICO'S ROLE IN CATHOLIC CHURCH, URGES DIGNITY
FOR POOR
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a homily that could set the stage for
Catholicism in the new millennia, Pope John Paul II on Saturday
assigned Mexico a special role in bolstering faith while scolding
governments in this hemisphere for practicing torture, racism, the
death penalty and other ``intolerable evils.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's homily in Mexico City's Our Lady of Guadalupe
Basilica, observed by millions here watching television and
listening to radios, underscored the church's concern for the poor,
with special recognition for indigenous Americans.
</P>
<P>
   During mass in the cavernous Basilica, Indians speaking various
tongues -- including Peru's Quechua, Mexico's Nahuatl and the
United States's Navajo -- offered readings of liturgy, alongside
speakers of English, Portuguese, French and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our cry: life with dignity for all. For all who have
been conceived in their mother's womb, for street children, for
indigenous peoples and Afro-Americans, for immigrants and refugees
. . . for those who suffer any kind of poverty or
marginalization,'' the pope said, speaking briefly in English,
among other languages he used during the mass.
</P>
<P>
   The pope added, also in English: ``No more violence, terrorism
and drug trafficking. No more torture or other forms of abuse.
There must be an end to the unnecessary recourse to the death
penalty. No more exploitation of the weak, racial discrimination or
ghettos of poverty. Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the pope's visit to Mexico -- before he heads to
St. Louis, Mo., on Tuesday -- is primarily to respond to a bishops'
meeting last year on the future of the church in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In a written exhortation released Saturday that is the pope's
response to that meeting, the pontiff instructed the church to love
the poor in a ``preferential manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the aging Catholic leader said, that love should not be
interpreted as ``exclusive'' of the wealthy or a nation's social
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this evangelization of the leadership sector is neglected,
it should not come as a surprise that many who are part of it will
be guided by criteria alien to the Gospel and at times openly
contrary to it,'' said the pope, who is worried about the spread of
Protestantism and secularism in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is known for his critical view of ``liberation
theology,'' a trend in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s that
enmeshed clergy in leftist movements -- some armed -- on behalf of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of communism, however, the Polish-born pope has
become more vocal in his criticism of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In his exhortation, the pope criticizes the spread of a
``neo-liberal'' or free-market system that appears to have ``profit
and law of the markets as its only parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans crowded around the Basilica on
Saturday, along the pope's motorcade route and in plazas where they
watched his homily on large television screens. The pontiff is
scheduled to make several more public appearances before his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   He thrilled Mexicans on Saturday by calling on Mexico's
dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe to help shape new faith in the
church and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen of Peace,'' the pontiff said in Spanish, his hands
shaking as he grasped his scepter and read his homily. ``Make all
of us, governments and citizens, learn to live with true freedom,
in accordance with justice and respect for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin of Guadalupe, so legend goes, appeared to an Aztec
Indian in 1531 and asked that a church be built on the site of
today's Basilica. The sighting of the dark-skinned Virgin helped
fuel the conversion of an entire continent to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The pope called the Virgin of Guadalupe ``Mother of America''
and declared that Dec. 12 -- the day Mexicans celebrate the Virgin
-- should from now on be celebrated by all Catholics in this
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's announcement prompted cheers around the city.
</P>
<P>
   A joyful Alvaro Ulloa, 19, of Mexico City, said it was only fair
to honor such an enduring symbol of the church in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin has existed for centuries,'' he said, ``and the
pope, well, he might not be here tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sanchez, a 19-year-old domestic servant, was also among
the adoring crowds who flooded the streets to catch a glimpse of
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said she defied her employer, who wouldn't give her the
time off to watch the pope on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fire me, I don't care,'' she said. ``At last I've seen
the pope. He speaks so well and all his words are so sincere. . . .
What I like most about what is said is that the Virgin of Guadalupe
will now be everywhere, not just in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion specialist and anthropologist Elio Madferrer said the
pope's decision to make the Virgin of Guadalupe a hemispheric
symbol is an attempt to create a stronger ``macro-identity'' for
Catholics who speak different languages and are devoted to
different religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Irish Catholics in the United States are going
to abandon St. Patrick, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theologian Alfonso Vietmeier of Mexico City's Center for
Ecumenical Studies said the pope's remarks in general were a ``very
clear, precise message from the church that it should defend
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the use of the words ``never again'' when referring to
torture will resound in Latin America as an attack on dictatorships
because those same words are slogans against abuses in Guatemala,
Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's use of English to denounce the death penalty,
Vietmeier said, could be interpreted as a direct jab at the United
States.

DESPITE BILLIONS SPENT ON CITY SCHOOLS, A HISTORY OF FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SCHOOLS-INQUIRY) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After decades of neglect and deferred maintenance
that left New York City schools crumbling, leaky, shabby and
sometimes dangerous, the state Legislature created the School
Construction Authority in 1988 with a mandate to resurrect the vast
archipelago of 1,100 aging public school buildings by Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   When he was governor, Mario Cuomo went to a Harlem school, a
Gothic 1901 pile of decrepit walls and broken windows, to sign the
law that stripped the Board of Education of school construction
tasks and assigned the authority to restore the system and build
scores of new schools. Speakers portrayed the future in rosy terms:
billions of dollars to come over the next decade, a new beginning
for a million pupils.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years and $7 billion later, critics say, the reality is
still a bleak portrait of dilapidated, dripping, sometimes
hazardous schools; of cost overruns and endless delays; of rapid
turnovers in the agency's leadership, and of waste, inefficiency
and incompetence in hundreds of school projects.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, Gov. George Pataki _ citing systemic failures,
horror stories of children lunching in cafeterias under umbrellas,
and allegations of attendance records falsified by bureaucrats to
inflate their budgets _ ordered a sweeping investigation of school
construction in the city.
</P>
<P>
   For years, politicians, educators and parents have called for an
overhaul of the school construction process, and with many projects
coming in years late, millions over budget and poorly executed,
they have had plenty of ammunition. Critics have pointed to many
causes: unqualified contractors, poor site supervision, too little
money, policy decisions beyond the authority's control.
</P>
<P>
   In a 71,000-word report this month, the Board of Education
pronounced the state of the city schools generally poor _ one third
needed major exterior work and another third had antiquated
electrical wiring and ancient coal furnaces _ and said that, at
best, the schools might be moderately fair after a five-year, $11
billion rebuilding effort that would require federal, state and
city help.
</P>
<P>
   The authority, whose three trustees are named by the governor,
the mayor and the city schools chancellor, has had some successes,
building 43 new schools and creating new classrooms for more than
70,000 students. By contrast, the Board of Education, starved by
the city's financial crisis, built only two schools between 1975
and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by offering incentives for early completion of work
and imposing penalties for poor performance, the authority said
last year that it had reduced the number of projects behind
schedule to 33 percent, from a staggering 88 percent in 1996. It
has replaced scores of project managers to improve supervision, and
has said it could do better if burdensome rules were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authority has been plagued by problems. The Board of
Education identifies projects the authority must undertake, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani sets the authority budgets, which fluctuate like
yo-yos, and 70 percent of the contractors who responded to a survey
said they would not bid for school work.
</P>
<P>
   With accounts of one bungled job after another, the renovation
of Erasmus Hall, the city's oldest high school, has become a
paradigm case. Design began in 1985, but construction did not start
until 1992. It was a $22 million fix-up that would take three
years. But asbestos was discovered, the board ordered the authority
to drastically redraft its plans in 1994, and delay piled upon
delay.
</P>
<P>
   The project is still ongoing, the cost is now upward of $100
million and officials hope for completion before the end of the
year. In the meantime, teachers and students have been bombarded by
noise and dust, plastic tarpaulins have been used to stop leaks in
a computer lab, and rainstorms bring out umbrellas for students
eating in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to demand better,'' the governor said Saturday.

 &HT;    POPE ELEVATES MEXICO'S ROLE IN CATHOLIC CHURCH, URGES DIGNITY
FOR POOR

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a homily that could set the stage for
Catholicism in the new millennia, Pope John Paul II on Saturday
assigned Mexico a special role in bolstering faith while scolding
governments in this hemisphere for practicing torture, racism, the
death penalty and other ``intolerable evils.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's homily in Mexico City's Our Lady of Guadalupe
Basilica, observed by millions here watching television and
listening to radios, underscored the church's concern for the poor,
with special recognition for indigenous Americans.
</P>
<P>
   During mass in the cavernous Basilica, Indians speaking various
tongues -- including Peru's Quechua, Mexico's Nahuatl and the
United States's Navajo -- offered readings of liturgy, alongside
speakers of English, Portuguese, French and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our cry: life with dignity for all. For all who have
been conceived in their mother's womb, for street children, for
indigenous peoples and Afro-Americans, for immigrants and refugees
. . . for those who suffer any kind of poverty or
marginalization,'' the pope said, speaking briefly in English,
among other languages he used during the mass.
</P>
<P>
   The pope added, also in English: ``No more violence, terrorism
and drug trafficking. No more torture or other forms of abuse.
There must be an end to the unnecessary recourse to the death
penalty. No more exploitation of the weak, racial discrimination or
ghettos of poverty. Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the pope's visit to Mexico -- before he heads to
St. Louis, Mo., on Tuesday -- is primarily to respond to a bishops'
meeting last year on the future of the church in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In a written exhortation released Saturday that is the pope's
response to that meeting, the pontiff instructed the church to love
the poor in a ``preferential manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the aging Catholic leader said, that love should not be
interpreted as ``exclusive'' of the wealthy or a nation's social
leaders.
</P>

   ``If this evangelization of the leadership sector is neglected,
it should not come as a surprise that many who are part of it will
be guided by criteria alien to the Gospel and at times openly
contrary to it,'' said the pope, who is worried about the spread of
Protestantism and secularism in Latin America.

theology,'' a trend in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s that
enmeshed clergy in leftist movements -- some armed -- on behalf of
the poor.

become more vocal in his criticism of capitalism.

``neo-liberal'' or free-market system that appears to have ``profit

DUKE'S SPECIAL BRAND  

</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Elton Brand greeted a visitor to Duke University
last week by warmly reaching out to shake hands with his right
hand, which is the size of a baseball mitt. Then Brand wrapped his
left hand over the top of the handshake, creating a baseball mitt
sandwich of sorts. He grinned and offered his official welcome to
Cameron Indoor Stadium, his basketball home. It seemed natural to
smile with him.
</P>
<P>
   It seems equally natural to say that Brand is special. The
adjective is vague for describing perhaps the most ferocious and
best college basketball player in the country, but it is the word
that those who know Brand best frequently use.
</P>
<P>
   Special player. Special person. Special combination of
athleticism and intelligence. A special Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a special human being,'' said Duke Coach Mike
Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   He is a 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound giant who is as difficult to
budge as an oak tree once he establishes position near the basket,
yet he is so quick that he routinely beats guards up the court in
transition. He is a 19-year-old sophomore whose oval-shaped face
becomes radiant when he talks about his mother, his stepbrother or
his grandfather. He is special enough to realize that special is
often just another word.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I think when people say I'm special?'' Brand asked.
``It depends whose saying it. If it's people from back home, people
who know what I've been through and know I've made it, then that
means a lot. If others say it, I try not to let it affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction is smart, because everyone is saying it. From
Peekskill, N.Y., which is Brand's home, to Madison Square Garden
Sunday, which is where second-ranked Duke (18-1) opposes No. 9 St.
John's (16-3). Brand said he played with or against at least six
St. John's players while he was at Peekskill High School or on AAU
teams and, playfully ignoring his own hype, wondered if they might
be astonished by his ascension.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that I can play, but they might be surprised,''
Brand said. ``They might remember me as that player back then and
I'm a totally different player.''
</P>
<P>
   There is strong speculation that Brand will become the first
Duke player with eligibility remaining to leave school for the
National Basketball Association. He would be a lottery pick in the
NBA draft if he decides to enter it. But Brand showed no sign of
tension over such speculation. As he answered a question about his
future, he rocked back and forth in a chair as if he were trying to
decide between pepperoni or sausage on his next slice of pizza. No
pressure, no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to look that far ahead,'' Brand said of the
possibility he might turn pro. ``I don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he decides he is ready, the NBA will be there for
Brand. Despite playing with a deep and talented team, Brand is
averaging 18.3 points and shooting 65 percent from the field while
also grabbing 9.2 rebounds a game. He is the first brutish pivot
player Krzyzewski has had at Duke, and the Blue Devils' offense
revolves around him. The idea is to get the ball to Brand inside,
where he either overpowers defenders or slithers around them.
</P>
<P>
   Overplay Brand and he will pass to Trajan Langdon (18.3 points a
game) or William Avery (14.9) for smooth jumpers or sweet drives.
Ease off Brand and he will toss up the 12-footer he is honing and
crash with Battier and Chris Carrawell. Beware if Brand perfects
his short jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given him some special gifts,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He
has a huge body, but he's very much finesse. He has huge hands, he
has long arms. With all his physical skills, if you're going to be
a really, really good player, you have to be intelligent. I think
he's really intelligent. He has a chance to be special.''
</P>
<P>
   There is that word again. So where does this special player
envision playing a year from now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd be back at Duke,'' Brand said. ``I can get more
out of the academics. I'm having a great time in college. My family
is not the richest family, but we're not the poorest either. We're
all right.''

<P>
   Still, Brand said he must weigh his options, and took particular
glee in revealing how he competed against the Charlotte Hornets'
Anthony Mason in pickup games last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held my own,'' Brand said. ``I more then held my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski talked about how Brand must learn to face the basket
on offense and help out more on defense, but he knows some of the
learning may occur in the pros, where Brand would be smallish as a
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not dependent on Elton to be here for two years or four
years. You know what I mean?'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm fine. I'm
going to tell him something based on the truth. He understands
that. If that means that he stays here for four years or less, I
will always give him an honest answer about where he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   With caution in his voice, Marty Blake, the NBA's scouting guru,
said: ``I think Brand is a good college player. Hopefully, he'll
stay in school four years and polish up his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand started polishing his game during hoop skirmishes at the
Dunbar Heights apartments in Peekskill, which he recalled as if
they happened eight days ago, not eight years ago. There was a half
court with cracked blacktop, a double rim and a metal chain for a
net, all within 30 seconds of Brand's apartment. Brand was tall and
pudgy as an 11-year-old, so he played with high school kids who
treated him like a tackling dummy. Forget Air Jordans. He needed
shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd foul me real hard on purpose,'' Brand said. ``I didn't
fight it. That's where I got tough. You get banged up playing with
older guys. You want to quit or call a foul, but you don't. You get
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand had a tooth smashed into the roof of his mouth during a
game against Nyack High School as a freshman and desperately needed
a dentist. He left the game for about a minute, somehow pushed the
tooth back in place and wound up scoring 21 points in a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brand became a Duke hero last season when he returned in just
eight weeks after fracturing a bone in his left foot. The
rehabilitation was supposed to take four months, but the Cameron
Crazies were again hoisting their ``Tickle me, Elton'' and
``Branded for Life'' signs much sooner than expected. Trace it back
to Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I see those guys when I'm home and they'll say,
`Remember, what I used to do to you?''' Brand said. ``I say, `Yeah,
right.' But they're right. They're the reason I'm tough.''
</P>
<P>
   As a single parent with two sons, Daisy Brand worked tirelessly
to make sure that the young Elton was busy when he was not playing
basketball. She checked his homework. She took him to three-hour
church services on Sunday. She signed him up for Boy Scouts. He
lasted about one week. She enrolled him in tae kwon do classes and
he quit. So she sent him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to walk around looking like a karate guy,''
Brand said. ``I almost cried.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother explained: ``I wanted him to know self-defense
because people pick on the bigger kids. I wanted him to be in
balance with his body.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also balance in Brand's life, as a player and a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main motivation is just to be the best,'' said Brand.
``Besides school, I'm concentrating on basketball and I'm going to
push myself to be the best. I don't want anyone to think or to feel
they're better than Elton Brand.''

HEALTH PROGRAMS, EDUCATION GET HELP IN WHITMAN'S BUDGET

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ With $1.1 billion more to spend in the coming
fiscal year, Gov. Christie Whitman will recommend giving a quarter
of it back to taxpayers and using most of the rest to cover
increased spending for public schools, state colleges, open space
preservation and expanded health care programs for children and the
elderly, New Jersey officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's $19.1 billion spending plan, outlined Saturday by
senior administration officials, includes $200 million to cover the
first installment of the property tax rebate plan that she
announced earlier this month. Whitman will formally present her
budget to the Legislature on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy and proceeds from the nationwide tobacco
settlement have helped swell the state's coffers and push revenue
forecasts up over the next 18 months, said State Treasurer James
DiEleuterio Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $92 million that New Jersey expects to receive next year
from the tobacco settlement, Whitman will recommend spending $18.6
million for new programs aimed at reducing smoking among
teen-agers, DiEleuterio said. The state is to collect $7.6 billion
over the next 25 years as part of the settlement of a class-action
suit against the major tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, DiEleuterio said the governor would propose using $36.4
million to cover increases in the cost of health benefits for state
employees. The remaining money would be used for new mental health
programs for state prisoners, early cancer screening, expanded
health care for elderly residents, and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Spending would rise about 4.5 percent, including money that
Whitman and state lawmakers have said they intend to return to
taxpayers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has also recommended that $750 million be placed in the
state's so-called ``rainy day'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $200 million for the property tax rebate
program, Whitman's budget includes $23 million for a program that
freezes property taxes for low-income elderly and disabled
homeowners. The budget also accommodates a $22 million tax cut,
proposed by Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican, which
would excuse about 200,000 low-income residents from paying state
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of new spending, Whitman is proposing a $317.7 million
increase for public schools, $70.7 million for state colleges and
universities, $100 million for open space preservation, $10 million
for new initiatives to help spur residential development in cities,
and $30 million for expanded health care programs for low-income
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, her sixth budget, it is fair to say that Whitman's
vision of a government that balances fiscal prudence with social
compassion has succeeded,'' said John Farmer, the governor's chief
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed budget, there would be no layoffs of state
workers. State aid to municipalities would rise by $23 million, the
first significant increase since Whitman took office six years ago.
The increase includes money, requested by Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco, a Republican, to cover inflationary increases for
municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also sets aside up to $35 million in incentives for
the state's 566 municipalities to reduce costs by sharing more
services, like police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of
Municipalities, said the budget ``appears to be pretty good news,
but we have to fully evaluate the details.''
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman unveiled her five-year property-tax rebate plan in
her State of the State address this month, she undercut one of the
Democrats' most effective campaign weapons: the state's high
property tax rates. After her bruising re-election campaign in
1997, Whitman promised voters that she would help reduce the
property tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Whitman would begin sending rebate checks to
homeowners this year. The checks, which would average about $120
this year, would eventually rise to $600 in the fifth year of the
program at an annual cost of $1 billion to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic lawmakers said Whitman should consider speeding
up the property tax rebate schedule, considering the state's rosy
revenue picture. ``We have enough money to do more right now,''
said Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr. of Jersey City.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles also said that Democrats are encouraged by what he
called the ``governor's professed conversion'' on property taxes.
``But we remain skeptical about the way she is proposing to spend
the revenue windfalls arising from these heady economic times and
her fiscal policy of increased borrowing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said he expected debate over how the proceeds from the
tobacco settlement should be spent. Under the agreement, states can
largely spend the money however they want.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Whitman had proposed using part of the proceeds
from the tobacco settlement to pay for health benefits for state
employees, Farmer said the governor wanted all of the proceeds to
pay for health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the Assembly speaker, described the proposal as a
``very good budget.'' ``It has a lot of aid to help citizens in
various communities,'' he said. ``I am particularly pleased with
the increase in the higher education budget. I am also pleased that
there are no layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   DiEleuterio said the strong economy had pushed up revenue
estimates by $275 million for the current fiscal year, which ends
on June 30. He said the state, anticipating strong growth but at a
more moderate pace over the next 18 months, is expecting that
revenues will be $897 million more in the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the best two-year period, 1997 and 1998, in the
last 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the money is coming from growing sales-, income-
and corporate-tax collections. He said half of the increase in
state income tax collections can be attributed to the Wall Street
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bernard Kenny, a Democrat from Hoboken who is a
member of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, said Democrats
would ``monitor the plan closely,'' considering that the budget is
heavily dependent on the economy. ``It would be a tragedy for the
taxpayers of New Jersey if the benefits of a thriving national
economy were squandered on election-year gimmicks,'' he said.

AMERICAN SOCCER COACH BEGINS FROM THE GROUND UP

 By JACK BELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Arena, the new coach of the U.S. men's national soccer
team, does not have a rebuilding job ahead of him. It is more like
buying a new house that is a handyman's special. The foundation is
there, but there is much work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of refurbishing needed became obvious last summer at
the World Cup in France, where the overrated and underachieving
U.S. team lost all three of its first-round games and finished last
in the 32-team field.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson, whose attempt to integrate younger players into
the team blew up in his face, resigned as coach after the debacle,
and now it is yet another new era for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, 47, who was born and reared in New York, has had success
wherever he has coached: his University of Virginia teams won five
national titles, and his D.C. United club won major-league soccer's
first two championships and this past year captured the Concacaf
Champions Cup and the Interamerican Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the next year, Arena will be the man in the white
lab coat, merrily experimenting with new players and new
combinations. He has directed the national team in one game, a 0-0
draw with Australia, since being named coach in October, but his
debut on the international stage truly begins Sunday when the
United States plays Bolivia in a full international ``friendly''
match in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Arena's 18-man traveling roster includes some national team
veterans (Tony Meola, Jeff Agoos and Claudio Reyna), but also eight
players who have appeared fewer than five times for the United
States and two who have never played for the senior national team
(goalkeeper Tom Presthus of D.C. United and Imad Bab of the New
England Revolution).
</P>
<P>
   ``The national team program accomplished a lot in the 1990s,''
Arena said recently by telephone from the team's training camp in
Orlando, Fla. ``We were one of only a few countries to have played
in the last three World Cups. But at this point I'm not concerned
totally with results. I am concerned with building a team that is
prepared to qualify for 2002, whether that means by winning games
or by developing a new team. It's about developing a new pool of
players, and with that there needs to be patience.''
</P>
<P>
   That new pool of players is certain to be a fluid one as Arena
prepares for the 2002 World Cup, which will be in Japan and South
Korea. The first regional qualification matches will be played in
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce told us at our first meeting with him at training camp
that he was going to look at some young guys,'' said Meola, who is
likely to start in goal today in Bolivia. ``We will see a lot of
new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will face Germany on Feb. 9 in Jacksonville, Fla.,
and Chile on Feb. 21 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., then play in the
four-nation Nike U.S. Cup '99 in March in Southern California. They
will travel to Mexico this summer for the Confederations Cup, where
they will be grouped with Germany, Brazil and New Zealand in the
first round.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arena's expansive approach has opened up opportunities for many
players, particularly young Americans who have been gaining
experience in MLS. And he is not shy about selecting players he is
familiar with: Roy Lassiter, Tom Presthus, Eddie Pope, Agoos and
Richie Williams all played for Arena's D.C. United club, and Meola
was the goalkeeper on Arena's first national champion Virginia
team.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has also made some inspired choices, such as Chris Armas,
a rapidly developing midfielder who plays for the Chicago Fire.
Another player in training camp, goalkeeper Zach Thornton (Meola's
former backup on the MetroStars), also shows much promise. An ankle
injury, however, kept Thornton off the traveling team.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has been the beneficiary of the winter break in some
European leagues and was able to put Reyna (VfL Wolfsburg in
Germany), Gregg Berhalter (Cambuur Leeuwarden in the Netherlands)
and Jovan Kirovski (Fortuna Cologne in Germany) on the roster for
the Bolivia game. Another young American playing in the
Netherlands, the attacking midfielder John O'Brien (F.C. Utrecht),
was picked for the training-camp roster but missed the sessions
because of a badly injured toe.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Americans playing overseas, including Kasey Keller
and Brad Freidel in England, were unavailable, and some were not
picked by Arena (such as Frankie Hedjuk of Bayer Leverkusen). That
is a situation that Arena (and all national team coaches) will have
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we need new blood,'' Arena said. ``The decisions are
tough and it's not like coaching a club team, because when you're
the national team coach you need to look at a four-year cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to tell the players that it's an honor to play for
the national team and get away from all the other stuff. It's great
to be able to play soccer and make money, but this is something
different. It's shouldn't be about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ``other stuff,'' Arena meant the meltdown in France of an
American team stocked with players who helped MLS get off the
ground and who were promoted more, perhaps, for their colorful
personalities than for their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things would never get to that point with Bruce,'' Meola said.
``Bruce lets everyone know where they stand every single day. There
are no secrets with Bruce. He will just put the best 11 on the
field and have his next-best 11 on the bench. There will be nothing
else involved with his decision. I've always known him as the kind
of guy who gets the most out of his players.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Arena has carte blanche from the U.S. Soccer
Federation to recast the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two World Cups all the international experience
has gone through a small group of players, which is good and bad,''
he said. ``If there was ever a time we can step away from those
players, it's now.''

EDITORIAL: JUDGMENT DAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Jan. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly a year after the nation first heard the name
Monica Lewinsky, the scandal that bears her name is at a decisive
juncture.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing to offer a motion Monday to end the impeachment
trial of Bill Clinton, Sen. Robert Byrd offered the Senate a just
way to bring this tormented case to a close. The House managers'
sudden move to interview Ms. Lewinsky with the help of Kenneth
Starr was what it looked like _ a desperate move to energize a
flagging case. It was also a brazen attempt by the House
prosecutors to hijack control of the trial from the senators and
chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd was right. There are not 67 votes to convict Clinton.
Byrd's assessment is based on a sound analysis of the state of
opinion in the Senate and the country. The evidence has been
exhaustively studied and a broad, indeed inevitable, consensus has
emerged. President Clinton behaved reprehensibly, betrayed his duty
to uphold the rule of law, and should be rebuked but allowed to
serve out his term. The only real suspense has to do with how the
Senate will get to confirming that obvious verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The case might have been brought to a conclusion at earlier
moments with a bipartisan resolution of censure. Once Starr's
evidence was put on the public record, that was obviously the
correct outcome. But House Republicans could not overcome their
partisan instincts and voted to impeach. At each turn, the case
defied the laws of gravity and sailed on to the next destination.
Now, finally, there is nowhere else for it to go.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional and legal issues, great and small, have been
microscopically examined. The evidence has been recycled so often
that many Americans can recite much of it by heart. The judgments
each senator must make in bringing this case to an end require no
further presentations of fact or analysis. The questions and
answers aired in the Senate these last two days have underscored
that point.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions have served mostly to allow each side to rehearse
old arguments, with the House managers stubbornly but
unpersuasively pressing at every opportunity to call witnesses.
Democrats used the early hours on Saturday to challenge the House
team's misguided effort to jump ahead of the Senate by getting a
court order to force Ms. Lewinsky to meet with Henry Hyde and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct, while indefensible, does not meet the
constitutional test for overturning a presidential election because
his actions did not threaten the welfare or stability of the state.
As Dale Bumpers instructed the Senate, Alexander Hamilton and the
other framers reserved impeachment for a crime against society and
a breach of the public trust. Concealment or deceit about a sexual
affair does not rise to that level.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers and the White House lawyers dueled fiercely
on this point, with the result that the case for removal was
weakened significantly. On Friday, Rep. Lindsey Graham insisted
that a president should be removed when he ``in a calculated
fashion puts the legal and political interest of himself over the
good of the nation in a selfish way.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, effectively countered
that Clinton's offenses do not reach the level of being intolerable
to the state. By Saturday, Graham was conceding that reasonable
people could differ on whether Clinton deserved ``the political
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In strictly legal terms, the House failed to make an ironclad
case. While most Americans have concluded that Clinton lied to the
federal grand jury and tried to impede justice, judgments we share,
White House lawyers have effectively attacked many of the
assertions made by the House. The senators clearly grew weary of
revisiting the case, and their pro-forma questions indicated a
desire to end the matter this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative that Senate moderates block the House plan to
use another round of Lewinsky interviews to prolong the trial. They
must search for an equitable way to end the proceedings. Moving to
adjourn the trial rather than to dismiss the charges would be
easier for Republicans to accept because it would leave the House
impeachment intact though not endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to go directly to a vote on the articles of
impeachment. Once the case is dismissed, the trial is adjourned or
Clinton is acquitted, the Senate can and should draft a resolution
condemning him. The time to conclude this case is surely at hand.

IT'S GETTING HARDER TO SCORE IN THE NHL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When North America plays the World in the National Hockey League
All-Star Game on Sunday in Tampa, Fla., the two high-powered teams
might combine for 15 goals, the way they did last season. They
might even score 22 goals, as they did in 1993, the most ever. Even
with Dominik Hasek of Buffalo starting in goal for the World, a
shutout _ even for one period _ is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But the expected goalfest will be a stark counterpoint to the
real games. Despite rules altered last summer to help the offenses,
NHL goal-scoring is down slightly from last season and down
significantly from earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The winter of 1999 is a chilly time of great goalies,
sophisticated neutral-zone traps and institutionalized obstruction
techniques executed by bigger, faster, more skillful players who
skate on sheets of ice that have stayed the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast: In 1981-82, Wayne Gretzky led the league
with 92 goals and 212 points. Last season, nobody scored more than
52 goals or 102 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different era,'' said Steve Yzerman, a 16-season
veteran who is captain of the Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red
Wings, and who will miss the All-Star game because of a facial
injury. ``There is more emphasis on keeping the puck out of our
net, being good defensively, and strong goaltending. A lot of
goaltenders are in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Hasek, the goalies in the All-Star spotlight are
Nikolai Khabibulin of Phoenix, Arturs Irbe of Carolina, Ed Belfour
of Dallas, Martin Brodeur of the Devils and Ron Tugnutt of Ottawa,
who has replaced the injured Curtis Joseph of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   With more than half the regular schedule completed, NHL teams
are combining for an average of 5.2 goals a game. Last season ended
at 5.3 goals a game, the lowest since 1955-56, when it was 5.1. As
recently as 1992-93, the average NHL game had 7.2 goals. And in
1981-82, Gretzky's greatest season, the average was 8.3.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, there were 160 shutouts, the most ever. So far this
season, there have been 95, 10 more than at this point last season.
Hasek leads the league with eight, on pace to break his career best
of 13 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Should anything be done? Perhaps, suggested Brian Leetch of the
New York Rangers, teams should play with three skaters against
three, instead of five against five. He was speaking with tongue in
cheek, and a bit ruefully. His team had just lost its second
consecutive game by a 2-1 score. Leetch, one of the game's best
attacking defensemen, has not scored for 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really explain goal-scoring,'' said Leetch, captain of
a team with three goals in its last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with dwindling scores and the perception of lessened
entertainment value, the league last summer changed several rules
in an effort to help offenses. The goal nets were moved out from
the backboards, from 11 feet to 13 feet, to give shooters more
space and better passing angles around the cages. The sides of the
goal creases were shaved, reducing the area that is forbidden to
attackers and lessening the chances of goals being disallowed after
video review.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 percent of the games, the league is using two referees
instead of one in the belief that restraining fouls will be
discouraged. And the size of goalie equipment is being more
strictly monitored. Still, at least one goalie is among the three
stars of most games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the goaltenders of our day are so good and
the defensemen are faster than ever,'' said Luc Robitaille, who
leads the Los Angeles Kings with 25 goals and has scored more than
500 in his career. ``The other thing is, as soon as teams are up by
a goal or two, they play the trap.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trap formation, the players on defense wait back between
the blue lines for attackers to come to them. Then the defending
team swarms the area, cutting off passing lanes, frustrating the
puck carriers and creating turnovers that trigger counter-rushes.
The New Jersey Devils perfected the system while winning the
Stanley Cup in 1995. Among the teams successfully employing the
style now are the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   What else can be done to combat the trap and encourage
aggressive attacks? Some suggest that the center red line be
ignored for offsides rulings, as it is in college hockey, to allow
longer passes over two lines. Now even a 10-yard forward pass is
illegal if it begins behind the blue line and ends over the center
red line.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including some in powerful positions, suggest
leaving things the way they are. One is Commissioner Gary Bettman,
who predicted ``a swing back up'' in goal scoring as players get
accustomed to the new rules. ``The new rules have been terrific and
the flow of the games has been great,'' he said. ``I don't think we
are looking at any more specific rule changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said the new rules have encouraged more forechecking,
with attacking teams venturing deeper into opposing territory. He
said games are closer now than they used to be, with more decided
by one goal. ``We have less 8-1 or 9-2 games,'' Bettman said. The
games are also taking less time, down seven minutes this season to
2 hours 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, said the use of two referees
discouraged interference behind the play. Paul Kariya, the Anaheim
sniper, said more room behind the net was helping the power plays.
But both he and his teammate Teemu Selanne said that taking that
space away from the neutral zone, between the blue lines, hurt
teams that wanted to build speed on the rush in the middle of the
rink.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his suggestion to improve the game, Kariya said, ``I'd
tell the league that if they want to open up scoring, they should
open up the neutral zone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who leads the NHL with 61 points, 20 of them goals,
played in college at Maine and is used to the red line being
ignored for offsides passing. Another player with a college
background is Chicago's Tony Amonte, fourth in the league with 24
goals. He supports the disappearance of the red line for offsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in favor of that for sure,'' he said. ``I'd love to see
that changed. That one rule would totally eliminate the trap. The
trap doesn't work without a red line. I think that's a great way to
get some more offense. I don't know if they are going to do that,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely, according to Bob Clarke, the Philadelphia
general manager, who is influential among his colleagues when they
recommend rules changes to the Board of Governors. In recent years,
Clarke has urged elimination of the red line for offsides, and the
league experimented with it during a few exhibition games last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see it tried,'' Clarke said. ``I don't think it
can be implemented without good players using it for a while.''
Asked about support for the idea, he sighed and said: ``I don't
think there is a lot. I think I am in a minority.''
</P>
<P>
   In the majority is the Devils' general manager, Lou Lamoriello,
who coached at Providence College and knows the rule well. ``It
won't help anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a school of thought in hockey that low scores
don't necessarily mean bad games. Goals per game averaged from 4.8
to 5.4 from 1952-1957, during the six-team era some recall as the
NHL's golden age. Richter, the Ranger goalie, noted that some of
the best moments of a 2-1 loss to Ottawa last week came when teams
exchanged odd-man rushes without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were going crazy,'' he said of the audience in New
York's Madison Square Garden. ``As a player, you love to be in
that, a one-goal game, back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gainey, general manager of the Dallas Stars, made the same
point. Although his team has the league's best record, he said two
of its most exciting games this season were a 1-0 loss to Calgary
and a 2-0 loss to Vancouver. ``They were well-played,'' Gainey
said, ``and the goalies were good.''
</P>
<P>
   And the goalies in those games were not even among the elite.
The best is Buffalo's Hasek, who has won the Hart trophy the last
two seasons as the league's most valuable player. Darcy Regier, the
Sabres' general manager, said that Hasek ``is on the cutting edge''
and that other goalies are imitating his style of dropping the
stick and using both hands to glove loose pucks.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said the great goalie era took hold in the late 1980s,
when Patrick Roy, now with the Colorado Avalanche, led the Montreal
Canadiens to the Stanley Cup, prompting the best young athletes in
French-speaking Canada to choose his position _ players like the
Devils' Brodeur and the Rangers' Dan Cloutier. Brodeur said the
goalie used to be the kid who skated poorly, but no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said, ``I would pay to see a goalie like Dominik Hasek.''
But, when asked if a great save was as exciting as a great goal, he
replied: ``Is a great save as exciting as seeing an end-to-end rush
by Pavel Bure? I guess, probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bure, a speedy, opportunistic attacker with tricky moves and a
great shot, rejoined the league last week after forcing a trade
from the Vancouver Canucks to the Florida Panthers. He scored three
goals in his first two games, including one on a breakaway against
Richter in a victory over the Rangers on Thursday night. Even
Richter was impressed. ``I want to see guys make a play like Pavel
Bure, come across the line, get that breakaway pass,'' Richter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe, the Latvian goalie playing for Carolina and for the World
All-Stars, said the new rules had made goalie equipment smaller,
but it was still so protective that goalies felt confident blocking
even the hardest shots. He said goalies work out harder than they
used to. Although new rules give better flow to the games, Irbe
said that goal-scoring ``comes and goes like fashion'' in clothing
styles, as hard to alter as an ocean wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it has gone away,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: ONE CASUALTY IN ABORTION'S GUERRILLA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Melinda DuBois has had recurring dreams about
Dr. Barnett Slepian, the slain mainstay of the abortion clinic she
helps run _ dreams in which he is very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   In one dream, the slight, unassuming doctor had fled to Canada
and had sent her an indistinct e-mail message. In another, the two
are chatting and she says to him, ``How weird it is that you're not
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are just dreams, for it is clear not only in her
waking mind but also by the repeated crises of staffing at her
clinic, Buffalo GYN Womenservices, that Slepian has been dead for
three months now. In recent weeks, when 60 inches of snow buried
Buffalo and its airport, the clinic has had to scramble to bring in
one of the handful of out-of-town doctors who have volunteered to
take his place.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after Slepian's murder on Oct. 23, four workers _ a
fourth of the clinic's staff _ quit, with some saying their
families could no longer endure the threat of violence and others
explaining they were simply too overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very close to Dr. Slepian, and they couldn't deal with
the fact that he wasn't going to be here,'' said Ms. DuBois, the
assistant director of the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure there is a competent staff in place every day is
crucial since the clinic's poor and working-class patients cannot
wait long. The clinic performs abortions only up to the 19th week
of pregnancy. Marilynn Buckham, the clinic's executive director,
said that not all the volunteer doctors have been capable or
congenial. ``We've had the good, the bad and the ugly here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been catastrophic in many ways,'' said Ms. Buckham, who
also has been haunted by Slepian's death. ``I've had to work here
nonstop since he was shot, trying to qualify physicians, flying
them in, wondering how good they are and how responsible. It's been
a nightmare, an absolute nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous of all, perhaps, is that the names of Ms. Buckham
and Ms. DuBois have been added to an Internet site known as the
Nuremberg Files that lists abortion providers as if they were
wanted fugitives. Slepian's name was on that list, and ad a line
was crossed through it the day after he was slain.
</P>
<P>
   So worried is Ms. Buckham about her colleagues' safety that she
will not disclose the number of doctors who work with her or where
they come from.
</P>
<P>
   There are two things about the clinic that have not changed
much. One is the daily clutch of sidewalk demonstrators who shout
exhortations at the women who enter. On Tuesday, four demonstrators
with bluntly worded signs draped around their hooded parkas were
pacing among the snow ranges of Main Street even though a freezing
wind was biting into them at 35 miles an hour and they had to stamp
their feet to keep warm. One protester, Hetty Pasco, is 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please let your baby live,'' screamed Mrs. Pasco, at a car
pulling into the clinic driveway. ``Don't kill your baby. In the
name of Jesus Christ, let your baby live.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that has not changed is the crowd in the clinic
waiting room, because Slepian's death has not curtailed the demand
for abortions. At any time, the room is filled with a dozen women,
white and black and mostly young, who wait with their boyfriends or
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Some prattle nervously as if they were about to undergo a
procedure no more momentous than filling a cavity. Others wring
their hands in what seems like intense inner agony. Every once in a
while a nurse opens the door and calls out the first name of a
young woman, who stands, often with an embarrassed grin since
everyone in the room knows what she is here for.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who was not a crusader but asked only to be allowed to
perform the full spectrum of gynecological procedures, was shot by
a sniper firing from behind the Slepians' home in suburban Amherst.
The 52-year-old doctor bled to death on the kitchen floor in front
of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has issued a warrant for the arrest as a ``material
witness'' of James Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion soldier who
has spent recent years wandering the country from demonstration to
demonstration and, taking the nickname ``Atomic Dog,'' growing
increasingly militant.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that seems to have drained out of the clinic is the
gallows humor. Glenn Edward Murray, a friend of Slepian and the
lawyer for the Slepian family and the clinic, remembered how in
July he helped Slepian draft his will in the family's kitchen. At
one point, Slepian turned to his wife, Lynne, and with mock bravado
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They take me out and it's all yours.''
</P>
<P>
   As his mind recaptured the picture of his friend, Murray smiled,
his eyes moist.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Slepian has busied herself trying to sell Slepian's
private practice, earn income as a civilian escort for female
suspects arrested by the Amherst police, and maintain as much
normality as possible by chauffeuring her four sons to their
after-school practices (a job Slepian used to help with).
</P>
<P>
   ``She puts up a good front,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend.
``When she's out in public, she's amazing. I'm sure she does a lot
of emotional release when nobody is around.''
</P>
<P>
   What rankles the community that once surrounded Slepian is that
the enemies of abortion are slowly achieving through the bullet
what they could not through political means. GYN Womenservices is
the only clinic left in this city of 350,000 and now it has again
become the focus of abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a national group, Operation Rescue, is planning a
reprise of two-week protests it held outside Buffalo clinics in
1992. The rallies, called the Spring of Life, led to 600 arrests
and stirred up those abortion antagonists who see their movement as
something of a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can eliminate access, with rare exceptions, there will
be no safe and legal abortion in Buffalo,'' Murray said. ``The
affluent will go elsewhere. The indigent will face the choice of
having an unwanted child or an abortion that is self-induced or
amateurish.''

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 AN EFFORT TO BRING THE STONE PONY IN NEW JERSEY BACK TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. _ It was home to Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon
Jovi and Southside Johnny, not to mention an album's worth of
not-so-famous Garden State Tchaikovskys, but the only sound at the
Stone Pony these days is the solemn bass line of the ocean breakers
slapping at the nearby shore.
</P>
<P>
   After serving more than 20 years as the mecca of New Jersey
rock-and-roll, the legendary bar went out of business in September.
And as if silence were not the ultimate affront, the club that gave
birth to the rude guitar riffs of Bruce Springsteen's ``Hungry
Heart'' and ``Born to Run'' was instantly reopened as a swanky
disco called Vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a new round of musical chairs has started. A few
months ago, Vinyl, too, closed, and a move is now afoot to bring
the old Stone Pony back to life. Led by one of the nightclub's
former booking agents, a group of investors is discussing a plan to
buy the shuttered building and restore live rock-and-roll acts to
its darkened stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring the tradition back and continue as a rock
club,'' said Kyle Brendle, a booking agent who is leading the
effort. ``We might try to put up a variety of shows, but even if we
do, there will definitely only be a single dance night.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the Stone Pony was the one place that garage
bands and basement rockers across New Jersey dreamed of playing. It
was gritty. It hung with folds of week-old cigarette smoke. It drew
a crowd of hundreds every weekend for shows by national and local
acts.
</P>
<P>
   But fans no longer drop in for a shot of bourbon or a
Springsteen cover tune. The building's windows have been painted
black, and its ``WE ARE OPEN'' sign has been reduced to a cheerless
jumble that reads ``AR OPE.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendle has drawn support from several investors, including
former workers at the bar, and expects to raise enough money to
bring the Stone Pony back to a semblance of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a weird way, the failure of the last project may lead to
the club being brought back to something decent,'' he said. ``The
possibility is real. I mean, the building is sitting there
completely empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Springsteen legend surrounding the club, most
musicians said they doubted that Brendle would succeed in reviving
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could actually resurrect the two former owners, they
might be able to bring back the old days,'' Lee Mrowicki, the Stone
Pony's manager and disk jocky from 1978 to 1991, said. The club's
original owners, Butch Pielka and Jack Roig, declared bankruptcy in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that would be hard to do these days,'' Mrowicki continued.
``People are older. I mean, I have a wife and kids. Springsteen has
three kids. Look, we really don't go out much anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asbury Park has long been famous for its journeyman musicians,
hard-working rock-and-rollers who produced an earnest, bluesy type
of music that perfectly matched the noisy, summertime rhythms of
the local boardwalk. When the Stone Pony first opened here in 1974,
it was no more than another roadhouse in a town that teemed with
jukebox bars. But within three years, the club became ground zero
for a blend of rhythm and blues and denim-jacket rock that was
known as the Jersey Shore sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbury Park is surrounded by the Atlantic and two lakes, so
it's kind of an island unto itself,'' said Mrowicki, who was the
Stone Pony's manager and disk jockey from 1978 to 1991. ``Back in
the day, New York had punk. Philly had the disco stuff. But we were
more interested in R &AMP; B, soul, funk and reggae.''
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, the city degenerated from a vibrant shore
community to a blighted stretch of beachfront plots, and the Stone
Pony suffered with it. When the bar's original owners, Pielka and
Roig, declared bankruptcy Mrowicki tried to buy the club. He lost
his bid to a local businessman named Steven Nasar, who retained the
tavern's name while trying to drum up business by introducing a
vastly different style of music.
</P>
<P>
   When that, too, failed, said Brendle, Nasar tried his hand at
Vinyl, a dance lounge with dim lights and a full-time disk jockey
that tried to attract a Manhattanesque martini scene. It closed so
quickly, Brendle and others said, because the vision of the club
went against the rock-and-roll heritage of Asbury Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would come from all over Europe, Japan to see the Stone
Pony,'' said Louie Appel, a drummer for a band called John Eddie
that started playing at the club in 1976. ``For a bar owner to take
the Stone Pony with all its history and change it into a dance
club? How stupid is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the strangeness of Vinyl's momentary presence on the
music scene is that Nasar has not been seen by anyone who used to
work at the dance club since it closed last fall, and despite
several attempts, he could not be reached by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brendle, who managed the Stone Pony for Nasar, said he
was perplexed by his former boss' disappearance, he said that he
would rather concentrate on overcoming the obstacles to reopening
the club.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest seems to be attracting a core following that has
aged over the years. Instead of the flocks of Springsteen fans in
tight blue jeans and biker jackets who packed the nightclub's
concrete floor in the late 1970s, the crowd a decade later was
somewhat more sedate in their baseball caps and flannel shirts,
musicians said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd look out and mostly see people in their 30s who may have
listened to Springsteen in high school but were still going out to
bars because they weren't married yet,'' said Mike Stanzilis, a
bass player who started performing at the club in 1989.

FOX LOGO DIMS ESPN AMERICA'S CUP DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an America's Cup outcome quite easy to imagine: the New
York Yacht Club's sailing syndicate prevails against 14 other
challengers in the cup trials. Its sailboat ends up racing New
Zealand's defender next February in a match for yachting's oldest
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, the sports cable network, broadcasts the ocean races for
U.S. television from Auckland, New Zealand. The camera lens fills
the screen with a view of the two 75-foot yachts and their
billowing sails: Team New Zealand and New York's Young America.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with this pretty picture?
</P>
<P>
   A lot, if you're a producer for ESPN. That's because the New
York boat's hull and sails are plastered with huge logos of Fox
Sports Net. The division of Fox Television surfaced last week as
Young America's biggest cash sponsor. The network also happens to
be ESPN's most serious cable competitor worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has set itself up as a thorn that won't be easily plucked
from ESPN's side. The deal has also angered sailors, who blame the
New York Yacht Club for jeopardizing television rights, which
ultimately pay for the America's Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking the high ground,'' John Kolius, skipper for the
Aloha Syndicate of Hawaii said. ``We're all in sponsor hell. But we
decided that asking Fox for money was not where we wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   New York organizers, on the other hand, don't see it as a
compromise. ``Fox will not be doing any broadcasting that will be
poaching on what ESPN is doing,'' said John Marshall, president of
the Young America team. ``It's in ESPN's best interest to have an
event sponsored by companies that step forward with good
communication skills, and are activists in promoting the America's
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN could pull out of its television deal in protest. Its
agreement is not yet signed. ``This is obviously a serious
situation and we're in the process of reviewing all our options,''
Geoffrey Mason, executive producer of ESPN's America's Cup
coverage, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Barry Frank, the agent for America's Cup
television rights, that probably won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fox sponsorship certainly doesn't make our task any
easier,'' said Frank, senior group vice president for International
Management Group, the sports marketing firm that negotiated ESPN's
$4 million America's Cup cable contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox hasn't done anything to break any rules or regulations,''
Frank said. ``But will there be a rule against this happening in
the future? Probably. This is a classic case of ambush marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the hardball side of television sport, the push to gain as
much exposure as possible out of a single event. But when it comes
to the actual programming, the effort by one cable network to gain
name recognition for coverage of an event ends up, more often than
not, becoming a trade-off with another network.
</P>
<P>
   A sideboard at an ice hockey rink carries ESPN signs, but the
event is sometimes telecast on Fox. On the flip side, a baseball
game involving the Los Angeles Dodgers, a team owned by Fox, plays
on an ESPN telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The America's Cup format, however, is different. ESPN faces a
three-hour race with one or two yachts often filling the screen for
long periods, sail logos and all. ``I don't think ESPN will be
exactly rooting for Young America,'' Frank said in understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Wladika, a senior vice president at Fox Sports, disagrees.
``I fail to see why ESPN would be bent out of shape,'' Wladika said
last week. ``This kind of thing happens every day on sports
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was apparently interested in the 80 hours of U.S. television
rights that ESPN negotiated, but saw it as too costly a deal.
Wladika calls it a ``pre-emptive $4 million,'' referring to the
figure ESPN agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
   For ESPN, the America's Cup package is a matter of pride. The
network has a longstanding relationship with the event. Since its
first involvement in the 1983 competition off Newport, R.I., the
cable channel has enhanced its coverage with on-board cameras,
television graphics, and spectacular distance shots.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who tuned into the late-night coverage of the 1986-87
races feasted on up-close-and-personal America's Cup coverage in
the turquoise waters off Fremantle, Australia. It was the first
time in a century of cup matches that anyone on shore had had such
a bird's eye view of the action.
</P>
<P>
   But America's Cup for ESPN tends to be more of a signature piece
nurtured by in-house interest than a cash cow producing sizable
revenues. ``I think they consider it one of the seminal events in
their history,'' Frank said. ``When Dennis Conner won the cup off
Australia, people were staying up until 2 a.m. all over the country
watching.'' &QL;

WALTER DONALD KRING, 82, CLERGYMAN, WRITER, ARTIST AND MELVILLE
SCHOLAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ohio, Calif., Fla.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Donald Kring, a Unitarian clergyman, author,
ceramic artist and sleuth into the secrets of Herman Melville's
private life, died on Jan. 15 at his home in East Brookfield, Mass.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years, Kring was minister of All Souls Unitarian Church
in New York, retiring in 1978. He then led the Eliot Church in
Natick, Mass., retiring from that position in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Unitarian Universalist movement,'' said his successor
at All Souls, the Rev. Forrest Church, ``few ministers over the
past 60 years have served with such steadiness and distinction,
both in terms of theological perceptiveness and institutional
devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kring wrote a three-volume history of All Souls, which started
as the First Congregational Church in 1819, the year Melville, a
future member, was born a few blocks away. The first volume,
``Liberals Among the Orthodox: Unitarian Beginnings in New York
City, 1819-1839'' (Beacon, 1974), also traced the denomination's
local roots.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other books were ``Henry Whitney Bellows'' (1979) and
``Herman Melville's Religious Journey'' (Pentland, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Kring did not start out as a scholar of Melville, the author of
``Moby-Dick.'' There had been rumors of a darker side to the
writer's character, but scholars mostly set them aside as 20th
century gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1975, Kring discovered evidence that touched off
arguments among academics that continue today: was Melville a wife
beater and child abuser, and should the answer affect the way his
writing is perceived now?
</P>
<P>
   Researching his biography of Henry Bellows, a 19th-century
pastor at All Souls, Kring came upon some letters in Bellows' boxed
papers that seemed to confirm the rumors. One 1867 letter from
Samuel Shaw, the half-brother of Melville's wife, Lizzie, even
proposed that they fake a kidnapping to rescue her from Melville's
sporadic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kring then pursued Melville studies and provided insights into
the writer's religious concerns, which had been discussed for a
century without much previous indication that Melville might have
had Unitarian rather than Calvinist leanings.
</P>
<P>
   The Melville Society elected Kring its first nonacademic
president in 1979. He also was a past president of the Beacon Press
of Boston, secretary of the American Unitarian Association and
president of the Harvard Divinity School Alumni Association and the
Unitarian-Universalist Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lakewood, Ohio, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1937 and from Harvard Divinity
School in 1940. He served in combat as a Navy chaplain in the
Pacific in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Kring is survived by his wife, Mary-Sage Mackay Kring; three
daughters, Beverly C. Dobbin of Homosassa, Fla., Suzanne E. Shapiro
of Tampa, Fla., and Katheryn Ann Topole of Apalachin, N.Y.; nine
grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Kring also created ceramic art. In 1958 the American Craftsmen's
Council sent an example of his ceramic art, a large oxblood bowl,
to be shown at the Brussels World Fair, where it won a silver
medal.
</P>
<P>
   He did not work alone. ``My wife and I developed this as a
cooperative project,'' he said. ``She does the designing, and I do
the execution.''

BUZZ KULIK, 76, WHO DIRECTED `BRIAN'S SONG' AND OTHER FILMS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz Kulik, a director whose made-for-television movie ``Brian's
Song'' attained such popular success that it was released
theatrically, died on Jan. 13 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. He was 76 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story about the friendship between two Chicago
Bears football players, Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo, in the face
of Piccolo's struggle with terminal cancer, ``Brian's Song'' was
shown on ABC in December 1971. The film, which starred James Caan
as Piccolo and Billy Dee Williams as Sayers, generated such
enthusiasm that it was released to a movie house in Chicago the
next month and nationally shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Its victory in the outstanding single program category at the
Emmy Awards that year was greeted with cheers by the audience
attending the Emmy ceremony at the Hollywood Palladium.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Kulik served in the Army during World War
II and after his discharge worked in the mail room at J. Walter
Thompson, the advertising agency, where he noticed a posting
seeking directors for a new medium called television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Kulik began directing cameras at Yankee Stadium and

EDGAR NOLLNER, 94, DOGSLEDDING HERO IN ALASKAN DIPHTHERIA EPIDEMIC 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Mo.)  By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the great cliffhangers of the 20th century, one
that held a nation in thrall for more than a week in 1925 as the
world wondered whether a supply of life-saving serum would make it
to icebound Nome, Alaska, in time to save the town's 1,429
residents from a raging diphtheria epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The tale has often been told, but when Edgar Nollner died on
Monday at his home in Galena, Alaska, it seemed time to tell it
once more: Nollner, who was 94, was the last of the 20 intrepid
mushers and more than 150 dogs who became national heroes when they
made their way in relays through raging storms over 674 forbidding
miles to save a town and carve a legend in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The race against death, as it was called, inspired statues and
speeches and eventually the annual Iditarod dog sled race, but to
Nollner it was simply a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Missouri man who came over the Chilkoot Pass for
the 1890s gold rush, Nollner, whose mother was an Athabascan
Indian, was born 10 miles upriver in Old Village, but from the age
of 15 he made his home and his living in the Yukon River town of
Galena.
</P>
<P>
   He was 20 when the call went out for the territory's best dog
sledders to form a relay from the railhead at Nenana to Nome. Like
the others, he was an experienced musher who carried the mail and
other supplies by dog sled, raced and used his sled to haul wood
and carry home the area's abundant game.
</P>
<P>
   It was on Jan. 21 that the first ominous Morse code message from
Dr. Curtis Welch, Nome's only physician and the head of the Public
Health Service's most remote outpost, clacked out over
radiotelegraph to ``Ouside,'' as Alaskans called the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting several cases of diphtheria, a highly contagious and
often fatal respiratory ailment, and two deaths, Dr. Welch, who was
rapidly using up Nome's 7,500 units of six-year-old antitoxin,
issued an urgent appeal for more of the serum, the only hope, he
warned, of averting a full-scale epidemic in a community whose
large Eskimo population had proved vulnerable to alien diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A supply of 300,000 units, enough to cure about 100 patients or
treat perhaps 300 exposed to the disease, was swiftly traced to the
Anchorage Railroad Hospital, but the question was how to get it the
1,000 miles to Nome.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery by air seemed the obvious answer, but with Alaska's
only two airplanes, both open-cockpit models, crated for the
winter, the territorial governor, Scot C. Bone, knew such an effort
would be futile _ and in the frigid, windy weather almost certainly
fatal. He was willing enough to let pilots risk their lives, but he
would not risk the serum.
</P>
<P>
   So, turning to a more reliable, 19th-century technology, he
ordered the serum sent by rail from Anchorage to Nenana, 298 miles
to the north. From there, it would be a matter of men and their
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The train arrived at Nenana at 10:30 p.m. on the 27th, and the
fur-wrapped 20-pound cylinder was handed over to Wild Bill Shannon,
who lashed it to his sled, called out to his malamutes and set off
down the frozen Tanana River into history.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Nome received almost all of its winter supplies
by dog sled, it normally took a musher 15 to 20 days to make the
trip over the old Iditarod Trail, and never less than 9. But with
20 different mushers and dog teams dividing the trek into short
sprints, the serum flew across the territory, arriving in Nome on
Feb. 2 in a record 5 days and 7 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nollner, who had the 10th leg, had been scheduled to take a
42-mile run, but when his married younger brother, George, asked
for a role, he let him drive the last 18 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Nollner, who ran his leg at night, covering the 24
miles from Whiskey Point to Galena in three hours, reported so much
blowing snow that he could not see his dogs but really did not need
to. The dogs, led by his trusty Dixie, knew the trail and never
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Nollner's friend Charlie Evans did not fare as well. On his
30-mile run from Bishop Mountain to Nulato, Evans' two lead dogs
froze to death in harness, so he did the obvious thing _ he took
their place and pulled along with his other dogs on the final miles
of the run.
</P>
<P>
   Within days after the serum arrived in Nome (frozen but quickly
thawed), the epidemic, which claimed five lives, had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   For all the acclaim it received, the serum run marked the end of
an era. Before the year was over, Alaska's scheduled air service
and the proliferation of snow machines brought an end to mushing as
an essential north country occupation. The Iditarod, a network of
interconnecting trails extending for more than 2,000 miles, was
soon abandoned until parts of it were revived in 1973 for the
annual race. If the threat of diphtheria now seems quaint, it is
only because the serum run brought an end to the disease as a
health menace in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1925, ``the black death'' struck some 200,000 Americans a
year and claimed 20,000 lives, many of them children. The serum run
had such an immediate and dramatic impact on public attitudes
toward inoculations that by the end of the year the introduction of
mass immunization programs had all but eliminated the disease. In
1997, five cases were reported in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To Nollner, a treasured fixture at the modern Iditarod race,
greeting the mushers as they came through Galena, the serum run was
just part of a lifetime in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   A man who recalled when caribou, beavers, foxes and wolverines
abounded, and the springtime skies would be so black with migrating
geese that a single shot could feed a family for a month, he
continued to live the outdoor life. A gregarious sort who was
widely admired, he was always the life of the party at the great
north country potlatch celebrations, and he liked dancing almost as
much as he did hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he married twice and fathered two dozen children,
20 of whom survive, along with what some of them insist are more
than 200 grandchildren and no telling how many great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the dog sled era, Nollner did not abandon his
dogs and sleds right away. Nor did he abandon saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1953, while gathering wood with his dog team, he
heard an Air Force plane crash. Finding two wounded officers on the
verge of freezing to death in temperatures 54 degrees below zero,
he built a fire and called his friend Charlie Evans to help him get
them to town. A quarter-century later when one of the officers,
Lionel Levin, tracked him down, Nollner told him it had simply been
a day's work.

AILING ASIAN COMPANIES UNLOAD THEIR HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Hawaii, Ill., Mass., N.Y., CANADA)  (js) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Japan Airlines bought the Essex House, a grand Art
Deco hotel on Central Park South, 15 years ago and turned it into a
flagship for its Nikko hotel chain in a city where real estate
always seems like a good bet for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the airline is struggling with declining profits in a
turbulent Asian economy, it is selling the Essex House to a U.S.
company, Strategic Hotel Capital, for about $250 million, real
estate executives say. Eight blocks away, the Lai Sun Group of Hong
Kong is selling the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, as well as the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Asian companies that have poured billions of dollars
into U.S. real estate, particularly trophy hotels in New York,
California and Hawaii, are now selling out. With the hotel market
booming in the United States, some foreign companies are making
huge profits. Others, like Japan Airlines, are breaking even, or
even losing money. But there is no question that the Asian shopping
spree is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Asian companies are trying to liquidate assets and
convert them to cash because of problems at home,'' said Arthur
Adler, a partner at Sonnenblick-Goldman Co., a real estate
investment bank. ``And the timing's not bad, because there's a
feeling that the market is peaking.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of buyers. At the Essex House auction,
Laurence S. Geller, chairman of Strategic Hotel Capital, which owns
26 hotels including the Marriott East Side in Manhattan and the
Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in California, had to fend off rivals
like Marriott, Intercontinental Hotels and the Blackstone Group's
Savoy Hotels. Strategic signed a contract earlier this month to buy
the Essex House and is set to close the deal in late February or
March.
</P>
<P>
   Geller said Strategic would be spending money to ``upgrade the
hotel and position it at a higher level than it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essex House will be one of our flagship hotels in the
United States,'' he said Friday. ``We believe that lodging in
Manhattan is rock solid. It's one of the few great world tourist
destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that the market for hotels reached a high
point last summer, but that hotels will remain very profitable in
cities like New York because business remains so strong. Even
without the latest round of hotel sales, room rates have been
rising swiftly. During most of the year, it is almost impossible to
find an available room in New York City. As a result, the average
room rate in Manhattan has jumped 36.9 percent to $213.83 since
January 1996, according to PKF Consulting, a hotel consulting
company. And rates are expected to rise 7 percent this year in New
York, and 5 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see an increase in room rates in 1999, but it's a factor
of demand, not the purchase price of the hotel,'' said John Fox, a
principal at PKF Consulting. ``The profits in this industry are
still very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The sales mark the end of what was actually the second wave of
Asian investment in U.S. real estate. Between 1985 and 1992,
Japanese companies spent $77 billion on real estate in the United
States, buying everything from the former Exxon Building to
Rockefeller Center. No price was too high for the Japanese, who
were confident of the long-term value of the office buildings,
hotels, golf courses and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   But they took a beating during the recession in the early 1990s.
Since 1992, the Japanese have sold about one-third of those
properties for a little more than half the original purchase
prices, according to the E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group.
</P>
<P>
   As the Japanese retreated, a second wave of investors from Hong
Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Brunei and South Korea swept
into the United States between 1993 and 1996, snapping up $6.3
billion worth of real estate, most of it hotels, at bargain prices.
But even as real estate prices started skyrocketing in New York and
California in 1997, the Asian economy began falling apart. Faced
with steep debts and falling sales at home, many of the new
investors decided to sell at what turned out to be the top of the
market in the United States. During the first six months of 1998,
Asians bought only $160 million worth of real estate, but sold
nearly $1 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the Japanese who made long-term investments in prestige
properties, the Asians were opportunistic,'' said Dale Strickland,
a senior manager at E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal, in Los Angeles. ``We
didn't expect them to hold onto it. But the problems in Asia are
probably accelerating the sell-off.''

<P>
   According to hotel and real estate executives who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, Strategic is betting that it can raise room
rates at the 597-room Essex House and take advantage of a better
reservations system. Strategic, in turn, has hired Westin hotels to
manage the Essex House. Westin, which is owned by Starwood Hotels
and Resorts, already runs the nearby Westin Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines had lots of company on its trip to the auction
block.
</P>
<P>
   Taisei Corp. of Japan sold the Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines in
La Jolla, Calif., last month for $82.5 million to Hilton Hotels,
which promptly renamed it the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   A troubled Hong Kong company, Paliburg Holdings Ltd., is selling
its stake in Regal Hotels, a chain that has 13 properties in the
United States and Canada, including the U.N. Plaza in New York, the
Biltmore in Los Angeles, the Knickerbocker in Chicago and the Regal
Bostonian in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a company controlled by Ong Beng Seng, the Singapore
billionaire, sold its 40 percent stake in the Pennsylvania Hotel,
across Seventh Avenue from Madison Square Garden. And Sinar Mas
Group, the second-largest conglomerate in Indonesia, sold a real
estate portfolio that included the Pasadena Hilton in California
and the Melrose Hotel in Dallas to pay off mounting debts.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Nippon Life Insurance Co. is close to selling
the Century Plaza Hotel and Tower, the luxury hotel that was known
as the Western White House when President Ronald Reagan was a
frequent guest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lai Sun Group will reap the benefits of the boom in recent
years. The company paid $190 million two years ago for the Four
Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street, one of the most lavish hotels in
the world, and is now selling it for about $260 million, a
relatively quick profit of $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines is not so lucky. The company bought the Essex
House in 1985 for $190 million, closed it for two years and spent
$100 million more on renovations. The rooms at the Essex House are
usually full, and it has two highly rated restaurants, but the
hotel has never been an economic powerhouse for the airline,
according to hotel executives. Under pressure in Japan, the company
is now being forced to sell many of its hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essex House is a large hotel in a prime location,'' said
Fox, of PKF Consulting. ``It's a significant addition to anybody's
roster.''

 &HT;    O'Leary pads running game with commitments
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary closed the week with
commitments from a pair of running backs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets got commitments from William Glover of
Tampa's Jesuit High and Jermaine Hatch of Cathoic High in Baton
Rouge, La. Georgia Tech, which also got linebacker Ather Brown of
Jones County this week, now has 25 commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, a 5-foot-10, 190-pounder, rushed for 1,585 yards and 20
touchdowns as a senior, adding 38 receptions for 520 yards and
seven scores. Glover also was recruited by Michigan, LSU and Miami.
Hatch, a 6-2, 190-pounder, missed his junior season because of a
knee injury, but he recovered to draw interest from Northwestern,
Miami and Memphis as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are down to a handful of prized prospects,
including quarterback Willie Simmons of Quincy, Fla., wideout
DeAndre Green of Prichard, Ala., offensive lineman Alex Jackson of
Quincy, Fla., and linebacker Recardo Wimbush of Blakely, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Watson switches
</P>
<P>
   Running back Derek Watson, South Carolina's Mr. Football, has
jilted new Gamecocks coach Lou Holtz for national champion
Tennessee. Watson, a 6-foot-1, 205-pounder from Williamston's
Palmetto High, committed to South Carolina earlier this month.
After taking an unofficial visit to Knoxville last week, however,
Watson committed to Vols coach Phillip Fulmer late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who rushed for 2,573 yards and 44 touchdowns as a
senior, is the third highly regarded recruit from South Carolina to
choose the Vols. Defensive linemen Albert Haynesworth and Terriea
Smalls also committed to Tennessee. Two others, wideout Durrell
Robinson of Duncan and offensive lineman Kevin Breedlove of
Clemson, have narrowed their lists to Georgia and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer also pulled off the unthinkable Friday _ grabbing a top
prospect out of FSU coach Bobby Bowden's backyard. Defensive end
Constantin Ritzmann of Tallahassee's North Florida Christian High,
a first-year foreign exchange student from Berlin, Germany, chose
the Vols over the Seminoles. Ritzmann, dubbed ``The Germanator'' by
teammates, had a school-record 26 sacks and 150 tackles in 14 games
last year.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The push to investigate allegations of
corruption in previous Olympic bids lost momentum Saturday as
Olympic officials struggled to cope with the expanding scandal
involving the next two host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Top Olympics officials, who came here this weekend hoping to get
a handle on the Salt Lake City scandal, now are being consumed by
revelations that Sydney bidders may have bought the votes of IOC
members to win the right to host the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to go back into previous bids now,''
said Kevan Gosper, the senior IOC member from Australia and a
member of the committee's executive board. ``There's no real point
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials say they will investigate any evidence of
wrongdoing related to previous Games, but they say none has been
brought to them. And for now, the beleaguered committee has its
hands full with the largest scandal in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the IOC executive board is expected to discuss the
Sydney bid to determine whether a special investigative commission
should be formed to assess the new information.
</P>
<P>
   An Australia Olympics official on Friday admitted he offered
$70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the night before
Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes. John Coates, the president
of the Australian Olympic Committee, said that he offered $35,000
each to the National Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through
their respective IOC members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, one of the leaders of the Sydney bid, said he offered
the money in the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members
to vote for Sydney. ``I thought it was necessary for us to show our
commitment to those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,''
Coates said. ``My view was that it might encourage them to consider
their votes for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Saturday, Gosper defended Coates' actions,
saying he was only working aggressively to secure the votes he
needed until the last minute. Sydney won the Games in 1993 by
narrowly defeating closest rival Beijing by a 45-43 vote on the
final ballot the day after Coates made the offer. Because the vote
is taken in a secret ballot, it is impossible to determine how the
members actually voted.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the inducements were an extension of a legitimate
assistance program for African athletes. Even though the money was
offered contingent on Sydney's winning the IOC vote, Gosper denied
that Coates' actions amounted to vote buying.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gosper had said that he was concerned that Coates had
apparently offered the inducements to buy votes and raised the
prospect of demands to strip the Games from Sydney. However, on
Saturday he said his view was changed after he spoke to Coates
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in position with more information to clarify what
happened,'' Gosper said. ``I have no reason to believe that was
bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Under tight security at IOC headquarters on the banks of Lake
Geneva, six IOC members accused in the Salt Lake City scandal
appeared before a special investigative panel to respond to
allegations that they acted improperly in the bid for the 2002
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed security guards and barriers kept back scores of
reporters, while IOC members were driven into an underground
parking lot or entered the building through a private entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen IOC members have been implicated over cash payments,
scholarships, free medical care and other favors accepted from Salt
Lake bidders. Two have resigned and five have submitted written
responses to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission, led by Canadian IOC member Dick Pound,
worked late into the night Saturday. IOC Director General Francois
Carrard cancelled a scheduled appearance at an evening news
briefing as the deliberations continued.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is to make its final report to the executive
board on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said as many as seven
others face the possibility of expulsion. The full IOC will hold a
special session in March to address the scandal and perhaps expel
any of the accused members who refuse to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day,'' said Jacques Rogge, a Belgian member of
the inquiry panel. ``There are cases among them that are just
unacceptable, brutal corruption, when simply money was asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive board member Chiharu Igaya, a member from Japan,
called for strong measures against his accused colleagues.
``President Samaranch should clean the house, that's the first and
most important thing he should do.''

Catholic Church and its 61 million members struggle harder than

have grown up in the church but drifted. Priest shortages are
rampant and the number choosing religious life dwindles. Crowds of
youth will come to see the pope, but dismiss his moral mandates. As
the aged pope nears the end of his papacy, the future of the church
lies in their hands. Will they accept church law which Jean Paul
has declared ``immutable'' on issues such as celibacy of priests,
birth control, abortion, homosexuality, and women in the pulpit? A

after a wall poster declared him to be a ``criminal''? It was 1957,
and Chen's father had just been denounced by Mao's communists as a
``bourgeois rightist.'' A respected Chinese journalist with proven
communist revolutionary credentials, he was shipped off to one of
China's first forced labor camps. Now, after four decades, the
Communist Party is finally debating behind closed doors whether to
expunge Mao's verdict against the ``rightists'' as a historic

   CUBA-ECONOMY _ HAVANA _ At a crowded farmer's market in Old

be doing everything it can to stop the spread of private
entrepreneurship on this socialist island. On Jan. 1, Cubans
celebrated the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. But
there's little to celebrate. The economy is a mess. In recent
months, the government appears to have back-peddled on economic
reforms that were so highly touted only a year ago. Spurring the
government on is economic turmoil in Asia, Brazil, and other parts
of the world, ``proof'' that capitalism doesn't work, at least
according to Castro. (Emling, Cox News Service)

topics are top priorities on the legislative wish lists compiled by
the capitol's biggest business lobbies, which range from the
upstart National Federation of Independent Business to the old
familiar U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In Wednesday's Billion-Byte
March, the chamber and NFIB also helped fund the first big email

   DEATHROW _ ATLANTA _ As the Georgia Supreme Court opens its
January term on Monday (Jan. 25), there's one important case
pending that it apparently does not want to consider: whether to
allow death-row inmates the right to have appointed lawyers during
their post-conviction appeals. The issue is a thorny one for the
court because it doesn't want to require the Legislature to pay for
death-row lawyers, but it is also aware that about two-thirds of
all death-row convictions are ultimately reversed. And there are
dozens of former death-row inmates who have been found to be
innocent, including a couple in Georgia, and they obtained their
relief in the courts through habeas corpus petitions. Their claims
would never have gone anywhere without competent counsel to
represent them. The case before the Georgia Supreme Court involves
Exzavious Gibson, who is without a doubt guilty of stabbing
repeatedly a grocer during an armed robbery. But Gibson, who has an
IQ of 76, had to represent himself during his post-conviction
hearing, the procedure of which has been described as complicated
as any in the legal system. Georgia is one of only two states in
the country (Wyoming being the other) that does not appoint counsel
for death-row inmates filing habeas corpus petitions. (Rankin,

   CHILD _ ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Day care for American children is, in
general, ``fair'' - neither outstanding nor terrible, say
researchers conducting the nation's most comprehensive study on
early child care. The latest findings from the ongoing research
backs up results from several smaller studies and what many parents
already know from their own experiences: That the better the
quality of care provided a young child, the better off the child
will be socially and linguistically. In presenting their findings
Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the researchers pointed out that the
federally-funded study, which has followed 1,300 families and their
children nationwide since 1991, was spurred by the rapid increase
in the use of day care in the United States in the past two
decades. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    Study shows improvements could be made to American child care
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Day care for American children is, in general,
``fair'' - neither outstanding nor terrible, say researchers
conducting the nation's most comprehensive study on early child
care.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings from the ongoing research backs up results
from several smaller studies and what many parents already know
from their own experiences: That the better the quality of care
provided a young child, the better off the child will be socially
and linguistically.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting their findings Saturday at the annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the
researchers pointed out that the federally-funded study, which has
followed 1,300 families and their children nationwide since 1991,
was spurred by the rapid increase in the use of day care in the
United States in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, nearly 40 percent of mothers with children under age 6
worked outside the home; today, 64 percent of mothers do. As a
result, more than half the babies under age 1 are being cared for
on a routine basis by someone other than their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many families, then, day care is an absolute necessity,''
said one of the researchers, Cathryn L. Booth of the University of
Washington. ''That's why this research is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other researchers from 13 other universities found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents have an important influence on their children's
development regardless of how much outside-the-home care the
children experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Factors such as family income, mothers' psychological
well-being and motherly behavior have more of an influence on
children's social competence at age 2 and 3 than does the
children's day care program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children benefit from being cared for in a group with others
their age: they have fewer behavior problems at both ages 2 and 3
years old than those not part of a group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children who are in several day care arrangements tend to have
more behavior problems than children who are in a consistent day
care program.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also suggested possible ways for improving the
nation's child care: by having at least one caregiver for about
every three children, by increasing the caregivers' levels of
education, and increasing the safety and intellectual stimulation
of children in day care programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is funded by the National Institute of Child
Health and Development, may be expanded to include
elementary-school age children to determine the impacts of early
day care on their development.

 &HT;    OLYMPIC PRESIDENT STEADFAST, BUT LEGACY AT STAKE IN MIDST OF
CURRENT SCANDAL
 &HT;    With IOC-MEETING-0124.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Late Friday night, tired and worried
International Olympic Committee members streamed in and out of Juan
Antonio Samaranch's suite at the elegant old Lausanne Palace Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   News was breaking of a new bidding scandal out of Sydney: An
Australian Olympic official reportedly offered $70,000 in
inducements to sway the votes of two African IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the IOC president, was furious. Sydney was to be the
final Olympic Games of the Samaranch era, a triumphant close to a
20-year career at the top of the Olympic world. Now, Samaranch, 78,
who already was wrestling with the nasty implications of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal, suddenly faced a potentially more
damaging controversy over the Games for which he has had so much
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, IOC members who visited him described him as a man who,
while clearly upset, was nevertheless in control and moving quickly
to get ahead of the new crisis before daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an iron man,'' said Alex Gilady, an IOC member from
Israel since 1994. ``Could you imagine a man of his age in a
position such as this? It's quite amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls for Samaranch's head as the bidding scandal has
unfolded, the IOC president, if anything, seems to have
strengthened his grip on power. While IOC members are pointing
fingers at one another, none has yet broken ranks with Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear belief bordering on faith among IOC members
here that only Samaranch with his experience and command of the
Olympic institution is capable
</P>
<P>
   of steering the committee safely through this storm.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss IOC member Mark Hodler, the strongest advocate for
expelling members found guilty of corruption, strongly defended
Samaranch. ``If all the honest people go away, then what remains of
the IOC?'' he asked reporters Saturday in the lobby of the Lausanne
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, the influential Australian IOC member, also
defended Samaranch, saying he had the full support of the IOC
leadership and rank-in-file membership. ``You don't look at a
president who has brought you through so many tough times and done
so much for the Olympic movement and tell him to leave,'' Gosper
said. ``If ever we needed a good president, we need it now. He will
come out of this even better and stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Samaranch's hold over the IOC stems from the simple fact
that 92 of the 113 members were elected during his presidency, each
with his personal blessings. Only 21 members predate Samaranch's
election to the presidency in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, they owe their much-coveted positions to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is built on patronage, and a patronage that depends on
his creation of IOC members,'' said Sir Bob Scott, who headed two
unsuccessful bids for Manchester, England. ``I don't think he's
under any pressure to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate Samaranch's standing in the Olympic
world. Bidding cities treat him as royalty, providing him with the
finest suites in the finest hotels their cities have to offer. He
has the ability to call personally on heads of state -- including
presidents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He is paid no salary, but Samaranch is a wealthy man with a
number of lucrative business interests, primarily in his native
Spain. He doesn't vote in the IOC, but as Canadian IOC member Dick
Pound puts it: ``It's the loudest non-vote imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took office in 1980, the Olympics were on the verge of
going broke.
</P>
<P>
   The 1976 Montreal Games were considered a financial disaster and
the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games -- an event that
Samaranch remembers with considerable bitterness directed at the
United States -- threatened to issue the death blow.
</P>
<P>
   In those dark days, only Los Angeles bid for the 1984 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The LA organizers, free to experiment by a weakened IOC,
reinvented Olympic commercialism and generated a $235 million
surplus. Los Angeles Games chief Peter Ueberroth, refused to share
with the struggling IOC, a humbling experience that left a deep
mark on Samaranch. ``The Los Angeles Olympics gave the IOC a little
lesson in commercialism,'' he said years later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson he took to heart, leading the financial revival
of the Olympics by careful marketing and lucrative television
deals. Each Games under his presidency has turned a profit, and the
IOC has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, through it all, he has been the object of scorn, the
lightening rod for accusations that the IOC was a pampered,
self-interested band of elitists whose members care more about
retaining their perks than the sports or ideals they are supposed
to represent.
</P>
<P>
   He has been criticized most harshly and personally for his
association with former Spanish dictator Franco. Samaranch says his
role under Franco is no secret, but he describes it as modest --
first as director-general of sports and later as a parliamentary
leader of Franco's Falangist movement. In 1977, two years after the
dictator's death, he became Spain's first ambassador to Moscow
since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the Olympics through the bad financial years, the
boycotts and near warfare between North and South Korea, but now he
faces the challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy now is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is most important to him,'' said Manchester's Scott said.
``And until all this, if he had retired after Atlanta, he would
have been remembered as the man who presided over the great revival
of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he must fear that he may be remembered for presiding over
its demise.''

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Late Friday night, tired and worried
International Olympic Committee members streamed in and out of Juan
Antonio Samaranch's suite at the elegant old Lausanne Palace Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   News was breaking of a new bidding scandal out of Sydney: An
Australian Olympic official reportedly offered $70,000 in
inducements to sway the votes of two African IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the IOC president, was furious. Sydney was to be the
final Olympic Games of the Samaranch era, a triumphant close to a
20-year career at the top of the Olympic world. Now, Samaranch, 78,
who already was wrestling with the nasty implications of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal, suddenly faced a potentially more
damaging controversy over the Games for which he has had so much
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, IOC members who visited him described him as a man who,
while clearly upset, was nevertheless in control and moving quickly
to get ahead of the new crisis before daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an iron man,'' said Alex Gilady, an IOC member from
Israel since 1994. ``Could you imagine a man of his age in a
position such as this? It's quite amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls for Samaranch's head as the bidding scandal has
unfolded, the IOC president, if anything, seems to have
strengthened his grip on power. While IOC members are pointing
fingers at one another, none has yet broken ranks with Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear belief bordering on faith among IOC members
here that only Samaranch with his experience and command of the
Olympic institution is capable
</P>
<P>
   of steering the committee safely through this storm.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss IOC member Mark Hodler, the strongest advocate for
expelling members found guilty of corruption, strongly defended
Samaranch. ``If all the honest people go away, then what remains of
the IOC?'' he asked reporters Saturday in the lobby of the Lausanne
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, the influential Australian IOC member, also
defended Samaranch, saying he had the full support of the IOC
leadership and rank-in-file membership. ``You don't look at a
president who has brought you through so many tough times and done
so much for the Olympic movement and tell him to leave,'' Gosper
said. ``If ever we needed a good president, we need it now. He will
come out of this even better and stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Samaranch's hold over the IOC stems from the simple fact
that 92 of the 113 members were elected during his presidency, each
with his personal blessings. Only 21 members predate Samaranch's
election to the presidency in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, they owe their much-coveted positions to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is built on patronage, and a patronage that depends on
his creation of IOC members,'' said Sir Bob Scott, who headed two
unsuccessful bids for Manchester, England. ``I don't think he's
under any pressure to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate Samaranch's standing in the Olympic
world. Bidding cities treat him as royalty, providing him with the
finest suites in the finest hotels their cities have to offer. He
has the ability to call personally on heads of state -- including
presidents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He is paid no salary, but Samaranch is a wealthy man with a
number of lucrative business interests, primarily in his native
Spain. He doesn't vote in the IOC, but as Canadian IOC member Dick
Pound puts it: ``It's the loudest non-vote imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took office in 1980, the Olympics were on the verge of
going broke.
</P>
<P>
   The 1976 Montreal Games were considered a financial disaster and
the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games -- an event that
Samaranch remembers with considerable bitterness directed at the
United States -- threatened to issue the death blow.
</P>
<P>
   In those dark days, only Los Angeles bid for the 1984 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The LA organizers, free to experiment by a weakened IOC,
reinvented Olympic commercialism and generated a $235 million
surplus. Los Angeles Games chief Peter Ueberroth, refused to share
with the struggling IOC, a humbling experience that left a deep
mark on Samaranch. ``The Los Angeles Olympics gave the IOC a little
lesson in commercialism,'' he said years later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson he took to heart, leading the financial revival
of the Olympics by careful marketing and lucrative television
deals. Each Games under his presidency has turned a profit, and the
IOC has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, through it all, he has been the object of scorn, the
lightening rod for accusations that the IOC was a pampered,
self-interested band of elitists whose members care more about
retaining their perks than the sports or ideals they are supposed
to represent.
</P>
<P>
   He has been criticized most harshly and personally for his
association with former Spanish dictator Franco. Samaranch says his
role under Franco is no secret, but he describes it as modest --
first as director-general of sports and later as a parliamentary
leader of Franco's Falangist movement. In 1977, two years after the
dictator's death, he became Spain's first ambassador to Moscow
since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the Olympics through the bad financial years, the
boycotts and near warfare between North and South Korea, but now he
faces the challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy now is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is most important to him,'' said Manchester's Scott said.
``And until all this, if he had retired after Atlanta, he would
have been remembered as the man who presided over the great revival
of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he must fear that he may be remembered for presiding over
its demise.''

JUDGE ORDERS LEWINSKY TO SUBMIT TO QUESTIONING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite with new reporting, including more
details on the judge's ruling and the pending session with
Lewinsky. Expands by 200 words.) (Eds: See also IMPEACH-REPUBS, IMPEACH-FITZGERALD,

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ordered Monica Lewinsky Saturday to
submit to questioning from the House Republicans prosecuting
President Clinton or from the independent counsel's office, drawing
a bitter White House attack on the prosecutors' effort to force Ms.
Lewinsky's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, issued
moments before senators resumed a second day of interrogation in
the impeachment trial, ignited a furious question-and-answer
session on the Senate floor and left unclear how _ or how soon _
the trial would be brought to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the fairness of the House prosecutors' using
the authority of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to compel
Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation, while Republicans demanded to know how
the Senate could untangle important conflicting testimony without
hearing from witnesses like her.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling came in response to a request from Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, after Ms. Lewinsky rejected a
request to meet with the House prosecutors last week.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson ordered Ms. Lewinsky to ``allow herself to be
debriefed'' by House prosecutors or, if she preferred, by Starr's
lawyers, or forfeit her protections under her immunity deal with
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr's aides question Ms. Lewinsky, the House prosecutors
said they would be able to attend the meetings and feed questions
to the independent counsel's staff.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial reconvened Saturday, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.,
one of the 13 House prosecutors, or managers, explained that they
merely wanted a routine meeting with Ms. Lewinsky before deciding
whether to ask the Senate to take a deposition from her.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, ridiculed a claim by
the House prosecutors that they were seeking an innocent
get-together to discuss the case. ``Can you imagine what that
little conversation is going to look like, held in the independent
counsel's office, with the people there who have the capacity to
put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors had no right under Ms. Lewinsky's immunity
deal with Starr to force her to submit to their questioning. But in
her brief one-page decision, Judge Johnson ruled that the
independent counsel could compel Ms. Lewinsky to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers have balked at allowing her to meet with
the House managers, arguing that it would cast her in ``a partisan
light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to trail along with the House managers struck us as
wrong,'' Jacob Stein, a lawyer for Ms. Lewinsky, said in a
telephone interview Saturday. Stein said it was unlikely that Ms.
Lewinsky would appeal Judge Johnson's order, and he did not know
when the interview might take place.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the House managers said they had been told that
Ms. Lewinsky was en route to Washington from Los Angeles, and that
discussions between her lawyers and the prosecutors would probably
ensue on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky would face intense questioning from Starr's lawyers
or the House prosecutors. It was unclear Saturday night which
questioners she would choose.
</P>
<P>
   One of the House prosecutors, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said he
would oppose having the independent counsel's staff in the same
interview room, if that would intimidate Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought would be to sit down and talk to her like I would
anyone else,'' Bryant said. ``I would not want any possibility that
she would feel intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors believe that her answers could be pivotal
as the Senate decides early next week whether to call witnesses or
to decide Clinton's fate without witnesses, the managers say.
``She's certainly at the core of all this,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important than it
is now,'' Paul McNulty, chief spokesman for the House managers,
said in a statement. ``In the last four days, the White House has
challenged the reliability of her testimony in a number of key
instances relating to her conversations with the president'' and
Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures adopted by the Senate, senators would have
to vote separately on whether to depose witnesses and then whether
to call any to testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Ms.
Lewinsky was interviewed extensively by grand jurors and Starr's
prosecutors, and her testimony about her relationship with the
president was the basis for much of Starr's case against him. The
House managers relied heavily on her testimony to show that Clinton
lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several managers emphasized Saturday that although it might seem
that Ms. Lewinsky had already been asked every conceivable
question, they felt it was essential to meet with her themselves,
face to face, to present their best case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes between the House managers and the White House
counsel spilled over to Senate Republicans and Democrats during
recesses of the trial Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 45 Senate Democrats signed a letter to Hyde
Saturday, urging him to drop his request to interview Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions by the managers,'' the letter says, ``undertaken
without notice to the Senate or the president's counsel, raise
profound questions of fundamental fairness and undermine the
ability of this body to control the discovery procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democratic senator not to sign the letter was Robert
Byrd of West Virginia, a senior Democrat who is a guardian of
Senate traditions and who issued his own statement on the matter.
Byrd angrily criticized the House managers in his statement for
compelling Ms. Lewinsky to cooperate: ``This is clearly an attempt
by the House managers to pre-empt the coming vote by the Senate on
whether or not to depose witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans said the House managers were merely
exercising the same rights to interview a potential witness that
the White House surely has with witnesses friendly to its side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with that,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska. ``The defense has all kinds of access to the people in
question, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and so forth. There's a procedure
under way that the court has determined to be quite appropriate,
and we'll have to see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers entered the Senate chamber Saturday morning
well aware of the swirling talk among senators about ending the
trial, and of the pressure on the prosecutors to reverse that
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not on what individual senators may be saying,''
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said on CNN on Friday night. ``Our
focus is on trying to do our job and present this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the trial begins on Monday, when senators are
to begin debating whether to dismiss the case and whether to depose
witnesses. Votes on one or both motions could happen later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd shocked the Capitol on Friday when he announced that he
would introduce the motion to dismiss. Byrd, an 81-year-old dean of
the Senate, said he did not believe witnesses would add any
meaningful testimony and that the two-thirds vote required to
convict Clinton was not within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate on dismissal and witnesses takes place, in
open and closed sessions on the Senate floor, Democrats and
Republicans said Saturday that they expected an intensifying of the
flurry of private meetings and mini-negotiations over how best to
end the trial.

   ATLANTA _ Atlanta radio station WSTR-FM (Star 94) has found a
sure-fire method of securing celeb interviews _ promise listeners
Super Bowl tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the station began its ``Superstars for the Super
Bowl'' contest, guaranteeing tickets to the listener who can get
the biggest star to phone in during the ``Steve and Vikki in the
Morning'' show. The celebrities who have called in so far: former
First Lady Rosalynn Carter, ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd
Bridges, ``Partridge Family'' mom Shirley Jones, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, talk show host Maury Povich and Falcons quarterback Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Par-TEEEE....
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that150,000 people will show up for the Super Bowl
in Miami. Pro Player Stadium's capacity is 75,000, so many visitors
obviously are making the trip for reasons other than attending the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much going on,'' said Alex Munoz, executive
director of the South Florida Super Bowl Host Committee. ``You can
go to a Super Bowl, not go to the game and still have a great
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to go through life drunk, fat and stupid,''
said Jeff DeForrest, a local radio talk-show host and veteran of 12
Super Bowls. ``But if you do, Super Bowl week is the way to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ...But be careful
</P>
<P>
   The feds are warning ravelers headed for the Super Bowl to make
sure package tours include tickets to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department says that every year there are
people fooled by tours that appear to be a bargain, but then don't
include game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   If a travel agent or tour representative claims that a game
ticket is included, the buyer should demand that the ticket _ or a
written confirmation of a ticket _ be provided at the time of
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The department also suggests buyers pay with a credit card,
which affords some legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The view from here
</P>
<P>
   Denver Post writer Jim Armstrong, in today's paper, tells
Coloradans why Falcon Fever is a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers _ OK,
with no exceptions _ the Falcons have been the NFL's worst
franchise of this generation,'' writes Armstrong, on location in
Suwanee, Ga. ``When they were born, somebody should have slapped
the doctor. They used to have a bumper sticker in these parts that
read: `Go Braves ... And Take The Falcons With You.''' Ouch.

   Falcons defensive linemen Chuck Smith, Lester Archambeau, Travis
Hall, Shane Dronett and families in an upstairs, private dining
room at Maggiano's Little Italy in Buckhead. The players ordered
multiple plates of New York strips, linguini with red clam sauce,
stuffed clams, veal and shrimp. Said manager David Clark: ``They
kept our kitchen busy. Those guys can throw down some food!''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORESTBURGH, N.Y. _ Great wings outstretched, a bald eagle
soared over the open water of the Mongaup Reservoir, giving the
group of observers a brief, brilliant sighting before it rose
behind the tall white pines. The number of eagles wintering here in
the Upper Delaware watershed of Sullivan County has grown steadily
in recent years. So has the phenomenon of eagle watching.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen bundled and layered visitors, some of whom
traveled many miles for a glimpse of the eagles, took shelter from
the brisk January winds in a public viewing blind. Trained
volunteers were directing them in using telescopes to spot the
elusive birds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who make the trip do not consider themselves
avid bird watchers. Instead, they are drawn by the mystique of the
endangered bald eagle. And that is exactly what Sullivan County
officials are counting on _ that their natural resources, including
the largest wintering population of bald eagles in the Northeast,
can make their area an attractive destination for people from the
New York City region interested in a one-day or weekend excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists could provide a much needed economic boost for the
Catskill Mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Schmidt had seen bald eagles before, in Nova Scotia and
Alaska. Still, she chose to spend three hours driving here from
Long Island with her husband, her 15-month-old son, two nephews,
and her sister-in-law to see eagles in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more special to see them here, so close to your own back
yard. And I wanted them to see them,'' she said, referring to her
husband, Steven, and 6-year-old nephew, Kyle Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come back again when Steve Jr. is older,'' she said.
``Next time it would be nice to stay over.''
</P>
<P>
   The county manager, Jonathan Drapkin, said the county was trying
to overcome the loss of many resort hotels. ``So many people have a
fixed memory of the large, self-contained hotels as they were,'' he
said. ``We want people to know there's some of the best fly fishing
in the Northeast here; that you can canoe or raft the Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagles migrate here primarily from Canada. It is the sight
of open fresh water that attracts them.
</P>
<P>
   They can have their fill of fresh fish and then perch in the
pines among large tracts of undisturbed land, including 12,000
state-owned acres managed strictly for the eagles' protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general shifting and recognition by the county that
our natural resources are an economic resource,'' said Lori
Danuff-McKean, who works with the county as founder and volunteer
president of the nonprofit Eagle Institute, a year-old organization
dedicated to the protection of the bald eagle and other birds of
prey.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 15 institute-trained volunteers can be found each
weekend during prime viewing season _ January through March _
beside roads and rivers and in the Mongaup blind. They act as
guides for group field trips, like the one arranged by the Schmidt
family. They staff popular viewing locations, equipped with
binoculars and telescopes, where they help visitors who come
unguided and advise on proper etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   They are trained to monitor eagle activity and weather
conditions and to look for birds tagged and banded for
identification by the state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a beautiful day, we can expect to see 40 to 50 people who
have come on their own to a designated viewing area,'' Ms.
Danuff-McKean said.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-January, a record 179 bald eagles were counted in the
Upper Delaware watershed and its associated reservoirs. Peter Nye,
who heads the state's endangered species unit in Albany, said 89
adults and 90 immature birds were spotted from the air during the
annual midwinter count on Jan. 11.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many reservoirs are very low now, and there is not much ice-free
water, Nye said. ``But no matter how bad the conditions, this area
still provides some amount of suitable habitat for bald eagles, and
we've still recorded record numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mongaup Valley Wildlife Management Area, just below
Monticello, was created in 1990 when the state bought the 12,000
acres as a reserve for the bald eagle. It is the best place to see
eagles in New York state, Nye said. But the eagles are extremely
sensitive to the presence of humans, and that creates some
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that in five or seven years we will have the
habitat to support the numbers of breeding pairs,'' Nye said. ``The
new challenge is to identify enough suitable habitat, then manage
and protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lamoriello, president of the Sullivan County Visitors
Association, said that although the county was working to draw
visitors, ``We recognize that if you overwhelm a delicate balance,
you lose your attraction.''

REAL ESTATE: UPSCALE HOMES, FRESH FROM THE FACTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Pa., N.H.)  (lb) 
 By LISA PREVOST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John and Barbara Campbell aren't your conventional mansion
developers. A husband-and-wife team who generally buy and renovate
houses for resale, the Campbells made a foray into speculative
mansion construction last summer with an 8,900-square-foot
Georgian-style estate in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The white clapboard and stone mansion certainly possesses the
sort of luxuries one would expect in a property priced at nearly $5
million. The wine cellar is equipped with a tasting table and is
reached through a convenient hidden accessway in the upstairs bar.
The master suite includes a generous dressing room and walk-out
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   And among the house's many details are classical columns in the
main entry halls, mahogany paneling in the library and a
front-to-back hallway that affords a direct view of the rear
property from the front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic parts of this mansion went up much more quickly
than most. That's because the Campbells chose to order the house
from a factory, thereby shaving three months off their construction
time. The house was delivered last July as 23 separate boxes, whose
customized modules were carefully fitted into place with a crane.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell then set his contractors to work on the extensive labor
_ about 70 percent of the actual construction _ of adding all the
fine exterior and interior details that are too time-intensive for
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Such a project would have been unthinkable even a decade ago,
and Campbell acknowledges that initially his plans raised some
eyebrows at the historic estate next door.
</P>
<P>
   Though the modular mansion is still a rarity, its very existence
is indicative of the growing acceptance of modular building among
buyers of upscale homes throughout the metropolitan area. ``This is
not an inferior house, this is a superior house,'' said Campbell,
``because I was able to use what modular companies are good at:
framing.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed of construction is also a key factor, as demonstrated one
day last month when Westchester Modular Homes assembled a
four-bedroom colonial in Armonk, N.Y., in just seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 8:30 a.m., the first box, measuring about 16 by 46
feet, was hoisted off its trailer by a crane and fitted onto the
waiting foundation to form half of the first floor. A ground crew
held onto guide ropes at the box's corners, maneuvering it much
like a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Two more modules, one a family-room addition, were added to the
first floor. Another two formed the second story. Then, after the
boxes were nailed and secured, the crane lifted the attached,
hinged roof into place, finishing the job by 4 p.m. With the
remaining detail work nearly completed, the 3,450-square-foot house
with a three-car basement garage is on the market for $729,000.
</P>
<P>
   While exact statistics on the numbers of modular homes and their
share of the marketplace are lacking, builders talk of increasing
acceptance, especially in the construction of higher-priced homes.
Fred Hallahan, president of the Baltimore-based Hallahan
Associates, an industry consulting firm, said that ``an increasing
proportion of sales of modular homes in the New York metro area are
going toward second- and third-time buyers, as opposed to 15 years
ago, when it was mainly first-time buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a basic modular starter ranch is fancier than it used to
be. Many modular-home manufacturers have upgraded their design
capabilities to cater to individual customer preferences, and
expanded their offerings to include more styles and high-end
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started to do these things 18 or 20 years ago, they
didn't even have two-story models _ they were all one step above a
mobile home,'' said Michael Waldron, owner of LDM Homes, a northern
New Jersey builder who uses Excel modules, manufactured in
Liverpool, Pa. ``Now, the most popular house is a two-story house,
and the average size is 2,600 to 3,000 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   John Colucci, vice president of sales for Westchester Modular
Homes, which built the Campbell mansion at its factory in Wingdale,
N.Y., in Dutchess County, agreed. ``Four or five years ago, the
average colonial going out of here was 2,000 to 2,500 square
feet,'' he said. ``Today, I'm building more of the 3,000- to
3,300-square-foot colonials. About 60 percent of our production or
better is two-story colonials.''
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers also offer ranches, Cape Cods, split-levels
and contemporaries, usually in several different designs, and sell
their homes through authorized builders. Some will even work with
builders to duplicate stick-built designs for customers bearing
photos of their dream house.
</P>
<P>
   There are limitations on what can be done with modular
construction _ highly detailed homes and intricate floor plans are
sometimes too complicated _ but buyers who are willing to work
within the concept can often save considerable time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Builders estimated the average consumer savings on a modular
home over a comparable stick-built home at 10 percent to 15
percent, depending on land costs. The savings can be much greater
on more expensive houses, primarily from reduced labor costs, said
Steve West, chief executive of Homeworks Modular Homes in
Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acceptance of modulars has coincided with the explosion of
interest in larger, more expensive homes,'' said West, whose
company is a dealer for and builder of New Era Dwelling Systems, a
module manufacturer in Strattanville, Pa. ``I've been in the
business 14 years and I've not seen it like this ever since the
good times in the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   After a modest slump in the metropolitan area, modular housing
starts (about half of which are attached housing) have in fact
rebounded to the levels enjoyed in the '80s, hovering around 6
percent to 8 percent of all new housing units in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut, according to Hallahan. The difference now,
he said, is that modulars represent a more stable share of the
housing pie than they did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-driven advances in design flexibility are a key factor
in the industry's repositioning. But the appeal to higher-end
buyers has also been aided by a generational shift, suggested Don
Carlson, editor and publisher of Automated Builder, an industry
trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas older generations tend to associate modular housing with
the cheap-looking, bland construction that characterized the
earliest boxes to roll off the assembly line, Carlson said, younger
home buyers are less likely to carry such a preconception. In their
attempts to win over the high-end home buyer, manufacturers are
also using Web sites and factory tours to educate consumers about
the modular-building process.

SUPER BOWL MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The highlight films roll en masse this week, turning those
classic sports networks into so many Super Bowl Channels.
</P>
<P>
   From Max McGee's one-handed catch to Joe Namath's I-told-you-so
finger waving, the Super Bowl has given us sites and sounds and
scenes; heroes and anti-heroes football fans can practically see
with their eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   There's Garo Yepremian trying to throw a pass. And Scott Norwood
missing a field goal. And Jackie Smith dropping the would-be
touchdown pass. And Desmond Howard returning a kickoff 99 yards for
a touchdown. And Duane Thomas saying, ``if it's the ultimate game,
why do they play one every year.'' And Doug Williams leading the
Redskins to 35 points in one quarter. And Thurman Thomas looking
for his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bills and Vikings losing again.
</P>
<P>
   So as we count down to Super Bowl XXXIII next Sunday in Miami,
the NFL's final ultimate game of the 1990s and the last before the
clock turns 2000, here is a highlight reel of the great moments,
great plays and great games from the previous XXXII:
BEST GAMES
</P>
<P>
   1. Super Bowl XXV, New York Giants 20, Buffalo Bills 19
</P>
<P>
   For just the second time in Super Bowl history, the game was
decided on the final play. The Giants rallied from a 12-3
second-quarter deficit with a ball-control offense that accumulated
a Super Bowl record 40:33 in time of possession. Still, the Bills
had a chance to win in the end. Quarterback Jim Kelly no-huddled
his club breathlessly down the field for the game-winning kick. But
when Scott Norwood was wide right on a 47-yard field goal attempt,
the Giants had escaped with the victory. Giants running back O.J.
Anderson was named the game's MVP with 21 carries for 102 yards and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   2. Super Bowl XXIII, San Francisco 20, Cincinnati 16
</P>
<P>
   Joe Montana solidified his place as one of the best clutch
quarterbacks in league history with a heart-pounding, fourth
quarter drive to give his club its third world championship. Down
16-13 with a little more than five minutes to play, Montana drove
his team 92 yards in 11 plays for the victory. The drive culminated
with Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Taylor,
who beat Ken Horton on a short slant route in the end zone. Montana
wound up with a Super Bowl record 357 yards, but Jerry Rice was the
MVP with 11 catches for a Super Bowl record 215 yards.

<P>
   3. Super Bowl XIII, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31
</P>
<P>
   Both teams held seven-point leads in the game's first 30 minutes
before Pittsburgh got some breathing room with 14 points in a 19
second span of the fourth quarter. But no lead is safe when the
opposing quarterback is Roger Staubach. The Cowboys quarterback,
who made fourth-quarter comebacks fashionable while John Elway was
still in high school, led the Cowboys on two late touchdown drives
to get within four points. But the comeback fell short when
Steelers running back Rocky Bleier recovered an onsides kick with
17 seconds remaining as the Steelers became the first team to win
three Super Bowls. Super Bowl MVP Terry Bradshaw threw four
touchdown passes and was 17 of 30 for 318 yards.

   WORST GAMES
</P>
<P>
   1. Super Bowl XX, Chicago 46, New England 10
</P>
<P>
   This game was the best excuse to visit your in-laws. When the
Patriots upset the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game two
weeks earlier, the luster of this Super Bowl was truly lost, for
the Dolphins were the only team to have beaten the Bears all year.
The Bears had one of the most dominating defenses in history. The
Patriots, who made the Super Bowl as a wild card team, were
overmatched. But they tried to make a game of it, turning a fumble
into a field goal just 1:19 into the game. The opening score was
the quickest in Super Bowl history. But it would be a Bears Super
Bowl shuffle the rest of the way, as Chicago recorded seven sacks
and held the Patriots to seven yards rushing, a Super Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   2. Super Bowl XXIV, San Francisco 55, Denver 10
</P>
<P>
   You only watched the beginning of this game because you thought
the John Elway-led Broncos, who were competing in their third Super
Bowl in four years, would make a game of it. Hah. The 49ers scored
touchdowns on four of their six first half possessions in setting a
record for points and margin of victory. The 49ers domination
included first downs (28 to 12), total net yards (461 to 167) and
time of possession (39:31 to 20:29).
</P>
<P>
   3. Super Bowl V, Baltimore 16, Dallas 13
</P>
<P>
   OK, the game did go down to the wire and was decided by a
32-yard field goal with five seconds to play. But boy, before that,
what a stinker. The game featured 11 turnovers, a Super Bowl record
that still stands. The teams also combined for just 24 first downs,
also a Super Bowl record. The Cowboys punted a Super Bowl record
nine times, and committed 10 penalties for a Super Bowl record 133
yards. The Colts were equally offensive, with seven turnovers. BEST

driving force of that scoring spree was Washington quarterback Doug
Williams who threw four touchdown passes in the quarter, including
ones of 50 and 80 yards to Ricky Sanders. Williams reigned as the

 UNDATED: modular-building process.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The modules put together to form the homes are six-sided boxes
that are up to 95 percent complete by the time they go out the
factory doors. Modular homes must meet the building codes in the
states to which they're being delivered, so an independent
third-party inspection company approves them in the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Once the house is in place, the local building inspector checks
the electrical and plumbing tie-ins, as well as the connecting
bolts and girders, said Charles Saverine, building inspector for
Darien, Conn. ``Generally there's not a problem,'' he said.
``Basically, they're sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Because each box has both floor and ceiling beams, as opposed to
shared floor/ceiling beams between floors, modular homes tend to be
very sturdy and quiet. And because the boxes must withstand the
rigors of transport, Carlson said, modulars are ``the best house we
build in terms of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers attribute their comparatively lower price tags to
factory building techniques, a controlled process that eliminates
waste and has a predictable schedule. There are no last-minute cost
additions or delays _ a typical house generally takes one or two
weeks of factory work.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody shows up every day _ you have all the carpenters, all
the plumbers, all the sheetrockers, and the house just goes up,
like a car on the assembly line,'' said Michael Buzzeo, president
of Modular &AMP; More, a Stamford (Conn.)-based dealer/builder of New
England Homes, which are made in Greenland, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Modular-home manufacturers are also working more closely with
their vendors to use just-in-time inventory techniques and
bulk-buying power to offer customers the cherry cabinets, Corian
counter tops, Jacuzzi tubs and gabled roofs they're looking for at
lower prices. Home buyers can maximize their savings by choosing
from among factory-stocked amenities rather than special-ordering
such items.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn and Paul Bova knew enough about modular homes to know they
wanted one, but they were still surprised by how much house they
got for their money. With two children and a third on the way, the
family had outgrown their three-bedroom ranch in Stamford, Conn.,
and began looking around for land. Born and reared in Stamford,
Mrs. Bova was determined to stay close to family and friends even
though affordable lots were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, when Mrs. Bova saw a New England Homes sign
advertising a quarter-acre lot just off High Ridge Road, she called
immediately. And last month, just one week before the baby was
born, the Bovas moved into their new four-bedroom colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Sold through Modular &AMP; More for $300,000, the house came with a
two-car garage, 9-foot ceilings, a solid oak kitchen, deck and
walk-out basement. The quarter-acre lot cost $50,000. Mrs. Bova
said she looked at comparable stick-built houses in Stamford priced
closer to $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have been able to buy a house like this for
this price,'' said Mrs. Bova, who is co-owner of a dance studio.
``I have friends who are buying in this town who are spending well
into the $400s and then they have to gut the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for the Bovas was a less-than-prime location, as
High Ridge Road is heavily traveled. But Edward Sandor Jr., vice
president of Modular &AMP; More, said there are plenty of buyers like
the Bovas out there. He estimated that he could sell two or three
houses a month in Stamford if he could find enough land.
</P>
<P>
   In Long Island, N.Y., the owners of Homeworks Modular Homes are
marketing their own line of ``designer'' custom homes on the
Internet. Through a partnership agreement, Homeworks sells homes
exclusively designed for them by Douglas Cutler, a
Connecticut-based architect, and manufactured by New Era Dwelling
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the company's Web site (www.modularcenter.com) can
browse through Cutler's home designs, which start at about 1,500
square feet, and request a referral to builders in their area.
Homeworks builds on Long Island, but also sells Cutler houses to
builders in other states. For a fee, Cutler will also work with
individual buyers to custom design their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism of modular homes early on was that they looked
modular _ sterile,'' said Cutler, of Wilton, Conn. ``We can design
a home that's equivalent in design and character to a stick-built
home.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, modular floor plans need not be limited by the
width of the boxes, Cutler said. Large open spaces can be achieved
through the use of engineered lumber strong enough to support
greater spans.

 UNDATED: greater spans.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One drawback to modular construction is that it doesn't allow
for on-site design changes. And while technical quality is high
among all companies that are doing a reasonably good business,
Hallahan said, some allow less customization and detail than
others. Buyers should shop around.
</P>
<P>
   And buyers should keep in mind that modular efficiencies only go
so far. Homes with extremely complicated roof lines or tricky floor
plans don't really lend themselves to modular design, noted Peter
Curto, president of Curto &AMP; Curto in Smithtown, N.Y. The houses his
company builds tend to be the old-fashioned shingle houses that are
so popular in the Hamptons, on Long Island, these days, with
elaborate staircases, lots of porches, and masonry chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason for modular is to save construction time
and cost, but with a fairly detailed home, you begin to lose the
cost-effectiveness,'' Curto said. ``I'm building a house now that
is 80 by 120 feet wide in one point. It's got varied roof lines and
a tower. I don't know how you'd do that on a modular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Campbell estimated that Westchester Modular Homes really
built only about 30 percent of the mansion in Greenwich. The
modular frame included insulation, sheetrocking, and rough plumbing
and electrical wiring, but all of the exterior and interior details
were added on-site. ``I hoped to save money and I think I saved a
little, but what I really saved is time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greater emphasis on work that can be done in advance in the
factory can result it greater savings. Jaime and Leslie Klein
figure their modular home in Cranbury, N.J., cost them as much as
50 percent less than a comparable stick-built home.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on six acres, the 5,300- square-foot colonial was
erected from six modules in just two days by LDM Homes. The Kleins
added some amenities, including granite in the two master baths,
commercial kitchen appliances, and cherry floors, as well as a
stick-built garage. But even after their additional investments,
Klein said, the house is worth considerably more than they've
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our home insurance company appraised it at $822,000, not
including the land and improvements,'' said Klein, an insurance
executive with Wharton/Lyon &AMP; Lyon in Livingston, N.J. ``We didn't
spend that much for the whole place. And I would think the market
value is in excess of $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Klein, a curtain designer, said they designed the home
themselves with the help of a computer program, and then relied on
factory engineers to fix any technical problems. Eventually, she
said, they hope to finish the third floor and add a module onto the
back as a sun room to give them a total of 7,800 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly a year since the couple moved in, and so far
they've found nothing to complain about. The construction is solid
and the walls are thick, Klein said. ``It's so quiet,'' he added,
``my wife and I can yell at each other from different rooms and not
hear each other.''

FAKE OR `REAL,' PRO WRESTLING IS SILLY AND SUCCESSFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas _ Walk into the Texas Indoor
Speedway Arena on any Friday night and cringe at the writing on the
dimly lit wall _ ``Wrasslin' Is Real!''
</P>
<P>
   Right off the mat let's get something straight: Not only is
professional wrestling not real, it's more fake than Marv Albert's
hair and Jimmy Johnson's retirement and Pamela Anderson's
television lifeguard character.
</P>
<P>
   As if there were any lingering doubts, the results are rigged
and the combat staged. It's not just coincidence that the seemingly
unconscious hero always rolls out of the way just before the
300-pound villain jumps on him from the turnbuckles. That every
referee somehow can't count to three on his first two tries, and
that he consistently misses the supposedly illegal 12-pound
lugwrench in the bad guy's bikini briefs. Or that no one in the
history of the sport has ever won a decision without moments before
being perilously close to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're pulling the wool over people's eyes,''
said a local wrestler who requested anonymity for fear of ostracism
from his peers. ``If we were really beating the crap out of each
other it would have been banned long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for those of you nodding ``a-men,'' there's one more small
detail about pro wrestling: Like it or not, it's the hottest thing
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's fixed. But apparently _ from the raucous local arena
to tomorrow night's sold-out WCW event at Reunion Arena, to the
spawning of a state governor, a local preacher and two wildly
popular television shows _ professional wrestling is fixed just
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't watch it because we think it's real, we watch because
it's fun and entertaining,'' said 17-year-old Country Day High
School student Jay Key, who maintains a wrestling web site on the
Internet between weekly visits to the 8,000-square-foot arena
opposite North Hills Mall. ``We know shows like Seinfeld and ER
aren't real either, but we watch them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This side of the Hare Krishnas, name something avidly and
obsessively consumed by millions while, at the same time,
completely ignored by the rest of the world. While at it, name
something since Beavis burped in the general direction of Butt-head
that's been so silly, yet so successful. And, name another
``sport'' that can't even prompt bet-driven Las Vegas to post odds
on it, or that has changed its competitive rules exactly as often
as The White House has changed colors.
</P>
<P>
   Either you get it, or you don't.
`IT'S JUST SO FUNNY'
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the perspective, professional wrestling is either a
gripping soap opera drama with the added allure of violence, or a
'90s Three Stooges with Moe again putting Curly's head in the vice
grips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so funny,'' said Lauren Cole, a recent Keller High
School graduate. ``It's all fake. It's so obvious. The people who
come here are basically trashy people who are easily entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after her seething critique of the sport and its
fans, Cole climbed into the ring and jumped into the arms of local
wrestler Kit Carson for a $5 photograph. And so is revealed
wrestling's dirty little _ and oh-so-real _ secret: The sport's
most positively tangible asset is its muscular bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s era of bluster, exaggeration and excess, Hulk Hogan
and Andre the Giant starred in Wrestlemania III in 1987 that set
the attendance record for an indoor event at 93,173 in the Pontiac
Silverdome. In May of '94, 32,123 turned out to watch wrestling at
Texas Stadium. Plano-based promoter Ken Taylor, who runs the weekly
card on Grapevine Highway, is convinced both records will fall
before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves it, from the forklift operator to the CEO,''
said Taylor. ``It's the same reason people love Jerry Springer and
Cops. Bottom line, we desperately want to be entertained. Say what
you will about our sport, we entertain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Boasting way-larger-than-life stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin
and Bill Goldberg, wrestling is pinning down outrageous television
ratings. Against the strong seasonal pulls of ABC's Monday Night
Football and Fox's Ally McBeal, combined viewers watching USA's WWF
RAW Is War and TNT's WCW Monday Nitro approached 10 million per
Monday, a 36-percent jump from last year.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF produces 12 hours of new programming each week, seven of
which consistently wind up in TV's top 10. Simply put, wrestling is
more popular among its target audience than The Simpsons or The
X-Files.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Kiss concert from the '70s, only more
interactive,'' said Carson. ``One guy thinks it's a great sport and
another think it's a freak show, but they're both watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July alone, fans bought $400,000 worth of Goldberg caps and
T-shirts. The WCW sponsored a car in NASCAR's Busch series. The WWF
is planning a casino in Vegas and a theme restaurant in Times
Square. NBC was considering showing wrestling instead of its
canceled NBA All-Star Game on Feb. 14, and wrestling reports that
its core business jumped from $24 million to $200 million in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hotter than ever,'' said Taylor, pointing to his Friday
night crowd of around 150 on Dec. 18 despite rain and temperatures
in the 30s. ``People can't get enough of it right now.''
VERY DIFFERENT NOW
</P>
<P>
   For those who thought pro wrestling died along with the Von
Erichs, Black Jack Mulligan, Fridays at Will Rogers, Saturdays at
The Sportatorium and Sundays with former masked Star-Telegram
``rasslin''' columnist Betty Ann Stout, this is not your father's
professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different now,'' said Mark Lowrance, who made the
peculiar ring-to-pulpit leap from Sportatorium announcer in 1980-90
to pastor at Ovilla United Methodist Church. ``Back then there was
a great sense of community, the regulars would come early and eat
together. But I think they've gone from regional communities to
national conglomerates. And somewhere in there they've lost the
allure of the wrestler's struggles imitating life's struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fan's daily hurdles rarely include a 360-pound behemoth
talking to a stick horse, another dousing three enemies with
gasoline and approaching with a blowtorch, a man apparently wetting
himself in terror, or a supposed psychopath rendering an opponent
unconscious with a sock so dirty and repulsive that only he can
stand its stench. On a recent Monday night, each happened on live
television.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the warring WWF and WCW employ 200 wrestlers, none
of whom would be mistaken for your neighbor, YMCA guidance
counselor or even political leader. A far cry from the days when
NFL hall-of-famer Bronko Nagurski held the heavyweight belt in '38,
today's ``heels'' (bad guys) are characters like
Hulk-turned-Hollywood Hogan, WWF president Vince McMahon and a
6-foot-10, 340-pounder named The Undertaker. The ``babyfaces''
(good guys) include Goldberg, who once played for the Atlanta
Falcons, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura and Stone Cold Steve Austin.
</P>
<P>
   You say America needs role models? From Victoria in South Texas,
the 33-year-old Austin has risen to the top with raunchy language
and an upturned middle finger. Reluctant to steal the ``Steve
Austin'' character from the 1970s bionic series The Six Million
Dollar Man, Austin _ born Steve Anderson _ added the Stone Cold to
his stage name after watching an HBO documentary about serial
killer Richard Kuklinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically just a redneck from Texas who worked his way up
from the loading docks,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has done more to hurl wrestling in the spotlight than
NBA stars Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone and, of course, the new
governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who shocked the nation when he won his state's race on
the Reform Party, gives unscripted speeches, promises $1,000
kick-backs to all taxpayers, is open to the idea of
government-controlled prostitution and showed up for last weekend's
NFC Championship Game at the Metrodome wearing a buckskin suit,
Jimi Hendrix T-shirt, bandana and a large hoop earring.
SKILLS ARE REAL
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, there is wrestling reality.
</P>
<P>
   First, prospective wrestlers must learn the fundamentals at a
three-month wrestling class in Dallas or at the Speedway Arena. The
most ambitious will then go to Atlanta's Power Plant, an intense,
three-day boot camp where participants pay $250 for a chance to be
discovered by the WWF and WCW. For most, however, the lifestyle is
akin to being a rodeo clown, traveling town to town, dressing up in
costume and putting on semi-dangerous shows for meager salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the local National Wrestling Alliance Southwest _ practicing
in America since '48 and currently the only weekly performance in
Texas _ the lifestyle is more Class A than Major League. Instead of
$5 million salaries like Hogan, there are $50-$150 checks at the
end of the night. Instead of a limo waiting to usher the wrestlers
to the airport and a flight to the next sold-out pay-per-view
extravaganza, there is a carpool driving across the street to
Hooters for dinner and a date the next night in Wichita Falls or
Glen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   On this dreary December night, fans have driven from Mesquite
and Weatherford to hold up signs and exchange obscenities with a
340-pound character named Bullman Downs. He wears a set of horns on
his head, a huge ring through his nose and couldn't be hurt by a
bulldozer, yet he somehow gets pinned by a clean-cut wrestler half
his size.
</P>
<P>
   There is a $10 admission, a dusty Foosball table in the corner,
real spit, real sweat, enough missed calls to make NFL referees
look competent, and, of course, wide-eyed fans believing every
second of it.
</P>
<P>
   One fan wears a Stars jersey and holds up a sign that reads
``Spare.'' Near the walkway leading to the curtained-off locker
room, an overweight fan waits for her attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey you ugly moose!'' the girl screams at Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so fat they probably made you buy two tickets,'' he
yells back.
</P>
<P>
   As the Patsy Cline music blares to signal intermission, the girl
high-fives her friend and rushes off for nachos before the night's
main event, a bout in which the loser will have to leave the arena
wearing a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you can release the fantasy,'' said 43-year-old
computer programmer William Jenkins of Colleyville. ``I know it's
silly, but I'm so calm and relaxed when I leave here. It's like a
another world where you can just drop your inhibitions. It just
gets your blood boiling. Not just the wrestling, but the sub-plots
when they grab the microphone and talk trash to each other. It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Taylor will continue to run his weekly shows in
relative obscurity while the big-ticket events stream through
Dallas. He said he envisions a day when he can bring 2,000 a night
to venues in Fort Worth and Dallas and increase his television
exposure from the 600,000 cable homes in seven cities he currently
boasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't like hearing it, but America wants
wrestling,'' Taylor said. ``My vision is to return to the glory
days of the '80s when it was about the hottest thing in town. I
think we can do it.''

 &HT;    Want scoring? All-Star Game usually has goals aplenty
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The average NHL team is scoring less than three
goals per game. The good news, for the league's panicking marketing
department, is scoring trends seldom hold for one of its showcase
events.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive season, the NHL All-Star Game will
pit U.S. and Canadian players against Europeans tonight at the Ice
Palace. But regardless of the format, goaltenders tend to come out
of this game with a nervous twitch.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen goals were scored in last year's All-Star Game in
Vancouver. Teams have combined for an average of 16.5 goals in the
eight games in the 1990s, including 22 in 1993, when the Wales
Conference defeated the Campbell Conference 16-6. One has to go
back to 1986 to find when there even was as few as seven goals
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season most teams play with four lines and each one
can do something different,'' said Boston defenseman Ray Bourque,
who is playing in his 16th game. ``Here, all four lines are the
same. They all have firepower. Don't ask these guys to check. It's
all about scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of players surveyed Saturday were against the idea
of the league changing more rules in an attempt to increase scoring
in the regular season.Ferrall on the bench
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Thrashers are talking with national sports radio
talkshow host Scott Ferrall about being a member of their broadcast
team, possibly as the play-by-play announcer. Ferrall now has a
late-night syndicated show. Ferrall never has done play-by-play but
would bring a certain celebrity status to the booth.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement watch
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky admits he has ``thought about the fact this could
be my last All-Star game,'' given the chance he may retire after
the season. But he quickly added, ``I wouldn't read too much into
that because I thought the same thing going into last year's
All-Star game in Vancouver.''

FUTILITY HELPS TITLE SNEAK UP ON ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ When the football cleared the crossbar, Mr.
Falcon froze.
</P>
<P>
   Here it was, the moment he had been waiting for, literally since
Day 1, and Tommy Nobis didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange, weird, awkward feeling,'' Nobis said.
``Like, what do I do? Do I cheer? Jump up and down? What?''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive his confusion. Nobis has spent the last 33 years with
the Atlanta Falcons, a franchise that has been a model of futility
throughout much of its existence. Indeed, to Atlanta, Nobis, the
first player in Falcons' history and a team executive since his
retirement in 1976, is still the most recognizable symbol of the
team _ which might not necessarily be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   So when Morten Andersen's field goal in overtime last Sunday
completed a remarkable upset of Minnesota that put the Falcons into
the Super Bowl for the first time, Nobis expected a flag, an
inadvertent whistle _ anything that would bring him back to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the stuff that's happening, where they bring the
trophy up and all that, and you're saying to yourself over and
over, `Those are our guys up there,' '' he said. ``It's a very
exciting time, but it's almost like you're waiting for someone to
come and take this away from us, or maybe someone's going to wake
me up. Reporters would come up and ask me for a comment, and I
didn't make any sense at all. I was just wondering, is this really
true?''
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it is to believe, the Atlanta Falcons, the team that
had an all-time winning percentage of .383 coming into this season,
a team that has hired the losingest coach in NFL history twice, is
going to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the Falcons going to the Super Bowl is akin to
Willie B., the famed gorilla at the local zoo, reciting
Shakespeare. Something so shocking, so ridiculous that it defies
the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't say, `The Falcons are going to the Super Bowl,'
without laughing,'' said Marc Roth, an Atlanta engineer and
self-described long-suffering Falcons fan. ``As I was driving home
after the game last week, I kept saying it over and over. I just
can't believe it.'' From the abyss In their 32 previous seasons,
the Falcons won a grand total of one division championship and
advanced to the playoffs only five times. Their greatest moment
came when they led the Cowboys by 14 points in the fourth quarter
of a 1980 divisional playoff game. One of their worst came that
same afternoon, when Danny White led the Cowboys to a 30-27
comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there weren't lowlights by the truckload. Once, in the
early days, a fistfight broke out in the Falcons' offensive huddle.
In a game in 1970, Jim ``Cannonball'' Butler, who the season before
was chosen the team's player of the year, set two club records _
yards rushing in a game (127) and fumbles (4).
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, team officials stopped the season's final game to honor
Dave Hampton when he became the first Falcon to crack 1,000 yards
rushing. On the next play, he lost six yards and finished the
season with 995. When the team threatened to move to Jacksonville
in the late '80s, fans were so disillusioned with the city's
then-woeful professional sports franchises that a popular bumper
sticker read, ``Go Falcons! And take the Braves with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point came in 1989, when the Falcons slogged to a 3-13
record and had to deal with the deaths of two teammates in traffic
accidents and the firing of coach Marion Campbell with four games
left. They finished with a seven-game losing streak capped by a
31-24 home loss to Detroit on Christmas Eve before an all-time low
crowd of 7,792.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly every decision backfired. The team's owners, insurance
executive Rankin Smith Sr. and his four children, were derided as
``The Clampetts,'' those naive hayseeds in ``The Beverly
Hillbillies''. Smith was notorious for bringing in ineffective
coaches _ he hired Campbell, who owns the lowest winning percentage
in NFL history for coaches with more than 60 games, in 1974 and
again in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to stay as positive as possible, and optimistic that
one day it'll happen,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who has
spent his entire 12-year career with the Falcons. ``My brother
would tease me all the time. `How can you be so positive? You guys
are terrible.' He'd always tell me the team's not ready, and I'd
always think, no, we're going to do it, we're going to do it. Then
we'd start losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. Just two seasons removed from their latest 3-13
debacle, the Falcons blew through the regular season at 14-2, the
best record in their history. They knocked San Francisco from its
customary perch atop the NFC West standings and beat the 49ers
again in the playoffs. And they roared back from a 10-point
fourth-quarter deficit on the road last week to upend the heavily
favored Vikings and win a trip to Miami to face defending champion
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just reaffirms my belief that anyone can win the
lottery,'' said Mike Kenn, a five-time Pro Bowl tackle who played
17 seasons in Atlanta. Bittersweet success But this isn't merely
luck. The Falcons are playing for the NFL title because on Jan. 20,
1997, Smith finally hired the right man, bringing in former Broncos
and Giants coach Dan Reeves as coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation did not happen immediately. Halfway through
his first season, Reeves' Falcons were 1-7 and floundering. But
that didn't last long. Atlanta won five of its last six to finish
at 7-9, and then took off this year. Since their horrid start in
'97, the Falcons have won 22 of their past 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy to this newfound success is that Smith, who was
awarded the expansion franchise for $8.5 million in 1966, didn't
live to see it. He died of heart complications at the age of 71 on
Oct. 26, 1997, hours before his team lost to Carolina to drop to
1-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Mr. Smith died, he came in to see me,'' Reeves said.
``We were 1-6 at the time. He walks in _ it's the first time I'd
seen him all season _ and I was apologetic about where we were. But
instead of agreeing that I needed to apologize, he talked about how
happy he was about the direction we were going and how we had a
chance in every one of those games and how competitive we'd been
and how he knew we were going to turn it around. That was the last
time I saw him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant an awful lot to have an owner come in and tell you
he feels you're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans, however, weren't so quick on the uptake. Jaded by
years of disappointment, they had abandoned the team long before,
and a strong finish in '97 wasn't enough to bring them back. Only
42,866 showed up for the '97 home finale and as late as Nov. 1,
only 37,996 attended a victory over St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   When the 71,229-seat Georgia Dome at last sold out for a
first-place showdown with San Francisco two weeks later, it marked
the Falcons' first sellout in three years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the fans are surely getting it. Some 4,000 met the
team at Hartsfield International Airport when it returned from
Minneapolis last Sunday, and an equal number were turned away by
officials for safety reasons. When the players arrived at the
team's facility in Suwanee, thousands more were waiting. Each day,
they crowd the entrance to the complex before and after practice,
hoping a player will stop on the way out to sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an amazing difference,'' defensive tackle Travis
Hall said. ``There's this grocery store I go to almost every day,
and once in awhile someone might recognize me or say something. The
other day I went in there and all of a sudden 15 people want my
autograph. Before, I never had anyone ask me for tickets during the
season, but by the end of the year I had people calling me up, `Can
you get me tickets?' for sold out games. Because we never had that
problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tuggle: ``We knew once we started winning, the fans would
get behind us, and, oh, my God, they're really behind us. It's just
crazy here. But this is the kind of craziness we've all been
waiting for.''

 &HT;    Western Conference notes: The first domino
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Vancouver general manager Brian Burke has traded Pavel
Bure, don't be surprised if coach Mike Keenan is the next big name
to be shipped out. Burke had said he would not hold Keenan
``exclusively responsible'' for the Canucks' problems as long as
Bure was holding out. It wouldn't seem that Burke gave Keenan much
of a short-term boost with the package from Florida. Only
defenseman Ed Jovanovski will provide immediate help. Dave Gagner
is too old (34), Mike Brown is too young (19) and goalie Kevin
Weekes is unsigned. But Burke already is turning up the pressure on
Keenan. ``I do think this is a playoff team,'' he said. ``I think
healthy we're a playoff team without the trade, and I think with
the trade we're clearly a playoff team.'' The Canucks beat Dallas
5-3 the day after the trade but then lost to Nashville 4-1. ``The
Nashville game was not a little bit of a disappointment,'' Burke
said. ``It was a total disappointment. Based on the first game
after the trade, we should have been able to ride this out a little
bit. But based on (the Nashville game), I have no comfort in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet of Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles coach Larry Robinson, who earlier this season
rejected a contract extension, now is questioning his abilities as
a coach after seeing his team lose three in a row after a brief
turnaround. ``I often question whether I'm a good coach _ a good
head coach. There are certain qualities to being a great head
coach. There are a lot of things I think about, and I don't know if
I communicate them properly.'' As to how he feels he needs to
improve, Robinson said, ``Reading people's personalities, being
able to take a guy aside and tell him exactly how I feel and maybe
the things he should be doing. My problem is maybe I care too much
about hurting a guy's feelings or telling a guy really what he's
playing like or what he should be doing. I try to put myself in the
same situation and how I'd like to be treated. Maybe one of the
qualities of being a great coach is being (a jerk). There are quite
a few of them around. . . . (Detroit's) Scotty Bowman is probably
the greatest coach of all time, and (former Montreal Canadiens
coach) Toe Blake was great, too. But I've heard stories about them
that would make your hair stand up. I can't treat people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Burke on Bure's old No. 10 jersey: ``The first player to ask for
it can have it.'' . . . Burke on comments by New York general
manager Mike Smith that he ``deserved a phone call'' from Burke to
tell him that a deal with Florida, and not the Rangers, was
imminent: ``He can whine all he wants.'' . . . Edmonton is
considering shipping Andre Kovalenko to Philadelphia for Alexander
Daigle. . . . Detroit is an astoundingly low 8-for-84 (9.5 percent)
on the power play in the last 17 games. . . . The Red Wings'
Brendan Shanahan has gone 14 games without a goal. . . .
Nashville's biggest problem in its expansion season is that it has
had to play games against Eastern Conference teams. The Predators
are 2-11-2 vs. the East and 14-14-2 against the West. . . . Dallas
is 2-4-1 in its last seven after starting the year 25-5-6, leaving
coach Ken Hitchcock concerned despite the best record at the
All-Star break. ``From the overall perspective, you want to be in
first place. But from where our game is right now, I think we've
got a lot of room to improve.''

(RE)-INTRODUCING THE ROOKIE CLASS OF 1999
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't know the loopholes in illegal defense, or how much to
tip, or that crossing referee Steve Javie could severely reduce
their walking-around scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, they are...the rookie class of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not all stuck in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in the seeming eternity since they were embraced by the
NBA with a handshake from David Stern and a baseball cap, you may
have forgotten who they are.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a remedy, an examination of which newcomers may join
the sign-and-trade, catch-and-release free agents in shaping a new
NBA. We're not offering a comprehensive list, just a roll call of
those rookies who may provide the most intrigue:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams: Here's a relatively short (6-foot-1) white point
guard who was kicked off the Florida team last year. Williams
received the `violation of team rules` sentence, but was acquitted
of the charge that he didn't shoot enough.
</P>
<P>
   Did this cause him to drop in the draft? Absolutely, all the way
to No. 7, where the new-look (as opposed to no-look) Sacramento
Kings made him their own. So ... is he the juvie-hall edition of
Pete Maravich, or a not-exactly ground-bound version John Stockton?
</P>
<P>
   Robert `Tractor` Traylor: This guy was landed by Dallas with the
sixth pick, then air-lifted to Milwaukee. At 6-8, 300 pounds, the
ex-Michigan post monster was a risky acquisition. But he's
misplaced a lot of weight and is prepared to make Bucks fans forget
about Jamie Feick.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki: He was imported from Germany by Milwaukee with
the ninth pick, then presented to Don Nelson and the Mavericks in
the Traylor deal. This 6-11 20-year-old has skills that suggest
he's the love child of Toni Kukoc and a relative of Detlef
Schrempf. Since Kukoc couldn't guard a lawn jockey, Dallas goalie
Shawn Bradley may be busy.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Benjamin: This Fontana kid was drafted by the Bulls with
the final pick in the first round. He's 6-6 and capable of banging
dunks, which should make him the favorite of those Chicago fans who
bother to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In his second (and final) season at Oregon State, Benjamin
improved his scoring average by five points per game, and his
field-goal percentage rose from 43 to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter: The ex-Tar Heel was drafted by Golden State with
the fifth pick, then sent to Toronto in exchange for Carolina crony
Antawn Jamison. He has enough talent and flair to at least star as
Michael Jordan in a made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   subhead Snake eyes for McDyess?
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess and Nick Van Exel are buds, which is the popular
explanation for why Antonio signed with Denver instead of
re-signing for more money with a better team (Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Van Exel was in L.A. while McDyess was shooting 47 percent
from the field during his first two seasons with the Nuggets. But
he also wasn't in Phoenix last season when McDyess made 53 percent
of his field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in these high-quality, percentage-boosting dimes is
Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Not ready for prime Tim
</P>
<P>
   With freshman forward Quentin Richardson and his young DePaul
entourage maturing at a rapid rate, the Bulls may have gone from
the best hoop team on Earth to the second best in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At least they have a young genius in new coach Tim Floyd. But
aside from the notion of Randy Brown in the starting lineup, Bulls
are concerned about something else: if Floyd is such a wonderful
coach, why did only one of his teams reach the NCAA Tournament's
Sweet Sixteen in his 10-plus seasons?
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Point forward Scottie Pippen should feel comfy with the Rockets,
who - like the Bulls - haven't had a point guard in years. ... When
his ego is considered, it looks doubtful that the melon of Chicago
GM Jerry Krause will ever have enough cap room. ... You'll want to
be in D.C. on Feb. 25 for the return of new Sacramento King Chris
Webber. ... The pre-draft buzz indicates that European prospects
will add little depth to the already shallow 1999 pool. What a
shame. ... Spike Lee, No. 1 fan of the New York Knicks and director
of the hit hoop joint `He Got Game,` is expected to direct a film
on the life and crimes of new Knick Latrell Sprewell. The working
title is `He Got Away With It.` According to sources beyond our
control, Sprewell recently turned down the opportunity to provide
his voice for a role in Eddie Murphy's claymation sitcom `The PJs.`

 &HT;    Eastern Conference notes: I'm fired
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After firing himself as coach for the second time in two years,
New York Islanders general manager Mike Milbury at least could be
comforted by one thing. ``I didn't get any applause for it (from
the players),'' he said ``But they might do that later.'' They
should. Milbury, who has more than four years remaining on a
contract that pays him $750,000 annually, resigned just a few hours
before the Isles won in Pittsburgh for new coach Bill Stewart.
Stewart went into the All-Star break with a 1-0 record, after New
York had gone 0-10-1 in the previous 11 under Milbury. But he
should not count on much job security. Stewart is the team's fifth
coach in six seasons, following Al Arbour, Lorne Henning, Milbury,
Rick Bowness and Milbury again. Milbury took over as general
manager in 1995. His record as an Islanders coach is 56-111-24.
Fans in Nassau Coliseum recently had taken to chanting, ``Mike must
go.'' Truth is, he tried to go before the season, shopping himself
as a candidate for the Thrashers general manager's position. But he
never was interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Closeout sale
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay general manager and coach Jacques Demers is asking new
owner Art Williams to be patient, but the Lightning's turnaround
will be slow in coming. Demers is in the middle of a housecleaning.
He traded forward Craig Janney to the New York Islanders for the
marked-down price of a sixth-round draft pick. He is expected to
complete another deal this week, probably involving either goalie
Bill Ranford or forward Stephane Richer. At 11-30-4 and in the
Southeast Division basement, Demers is kissing off the rest of the
season, even if he doesn't quite put it in those words. ``I'm
trying to stockpile some draft picks,'' Demers said, ``and if I can
reduce the payroll a little we can go after some free agents next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Scandal sheet
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a great season by Ottawa, Senators captain
Alexei Yashin finds himself in the middle of a mess. Yashin
committed $1 million over five years to the National Arts Centre
but closed his checkbook after his first annual $200,000 payment.
Why? Yashin said he had a side deal with former arts center chief
John Cripton that mandated the center pay his parents $85,000
through Tatiana Entertainment Inc. Other officials knew nothing
about the deal and never made the payment. Cripton recently lost
his position. Ottawa lawyer David Scott said he thinks the
agreement is ``illegal, unenforceable and could not possibly be
honored by the NAC.'' Yashin's parents were to provide some
undefined services for the annual payments, but Scott said, ``It is
now recognized that the intent was that such payments would not be
dependent upon the actual delivery of services.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.:
</P>
<P>
   Forward Peter Nedved got off to a fast start after the Rangers
signed him _ eight goals and 13 assists in 16 games _ but has only
one goal and one assist in the last 10. ``He's been dried out for
how many games?'' coach John Muckler asked. ``That's where the
goals have to come from.'' . . . Philadelphia is 12-1-5 in its last
18 and 19-4-6 in the last 29, outscoring opponents 100-52 in that
span. . . . Tampa rookie Vincent Lecavalier is a plus-three in his
last 22 games on a horrendous team, evidence of his improvement
since early in the season.

POPE OFFERS VISION OF THE FUTURE FOR AMERICAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Inside one of Roman Catholicism's holiest shrines,
Pope John Paul II unveiled a sweeping vision Saturday for the
church's next century in America, exhorting it to minister to the
needs of poor and rich alike and to follow Jesus by championing a
society free of torture, drugs, and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Giving parts of his homily in Spanish, English, French, and
Portuguese, the 78-year-old pontiff called on Catholics to make
America a ``continent of life. This is our cry: life with dignity
for all!''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all who have been conceived in their mother's womb, for
street children, for indigenous peoples and Afro-Americans, for
immigrants and refugees, for the young deprived of opportunity, for
the old, for those who suffer any kind of poverty or
marginalization,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing a 24-page document on the most important day of his
six-day tour of Mexico and the United States, the pontiff balanced
criticism of capitalism and financial speculation with a call for
the church not to ignore the movers and shakers of society.
</P>
<P>
   His guideline for the church in the Americas also touched on
pressing regional issues such as rights, foreign debt, narcotics
trafficking, political corruption, and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years, the church in Latin America has been
guided by a ``preferential option for the poor,'' John Paul said _
a philosophy the pope believes had certain Marxist undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in part because of an approach to the pastoral care of
the poor marked by a certain exclusiveness that the pastoral care
for the leading sectors of society has been neglected and many
people have thus been estranged from the church,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this evangelization of the leadership sector is neglected,
it not should come as a surprise that many who are a part of it
will be guided by criteria alien to the Gospel and at times openly
contrary to it,'' the pope added.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers here saw that comment as an attempt to bury any
more debate of liberation theology, the ideology used for 30 years
among some Latin American clergy and nuns to challenge economic
inequities and oppressive goverments.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff made public his landmark document at a special Mass
inside the massive Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the site
where the church says a dark-skinned Virgin Mary appeared to a
peasant boy in 1531 and became the spark for Catholicism to take
root in the new world.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sacred place the shrine occupies in church
history, it was perhaps a fitting arena for John Paul to offer a
comprehensive blueprint designed to re-energize the church in the
Americas, home to half the world's 1 billion Catholics and crucial
to the future of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this moment in her history, the church in America is called
to respond to the fundamental task of evangelization,'' John Paul
said on the second day of his four-day visit to this city, where he
has been welcomed by millions of adoring people. ``A fresh
encounter with Jesus Christ will make all the members of the church
in America aware that they are called to continue the Redeemer's
mission in their lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope said the drive for social and economic justice must be
balanced with clear spiritual direction, or the church will
continue to lose Catholics to other denominations that place great
importance on the life of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church can in no way be confused with the political
community nor tied to any political system,'' he warned during the
liturgy. It was broadcast on two giant screens erected outside the
basilica, which was surrounded by thousands of people, some of whom
had camped out overnight to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Looking rested and energized, John Paul began the morning with a
ride to the basilica on the northern fringes of the city, where
inside he prayed to the Virgin Mary's image. Along the way millions
of people greeted the pope with the kind of ardor that has endeared
John Paul to Mexico _ a country surpassed only by Brazil in the
number of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the basilica, Adriana Saldana, 39, cried as she
described how the pope waved in her direction. ``He is Christ's
representative on earth,'' Saldana said, her hands shaking.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope's vision for the Americas did not break major new
theological ground, it probably will provoke intense debate within
the church, and it may serve as a statement for local Catholic
churches throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the statement will be received in the United
States, where there is a wide gulf between lay people and the
church hierarchy. The document is the end result of a conclave of
bishops of the Americas held in Rome in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some theologians who studied the documents that emerged from the
1997 synod said they were not impressed with the ideas put forth
then. Many of them were incorporated into Saturday's papal
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The synod papers ``did not excite the imagination, inspire
enthusiasm or encourage hope,'' the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Vatican
scholar, wrote in the Jesuit magazine America.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is also being examined closely by the Mexican
government and its critics, who have castigated attempts to put
down indigenous uprisings, particularly in the southern state of
Chiapas. Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, John Paul met privately with the Mexican
president, Ernesto Zedillo, who expelled six priests from Chiapas
and accused them of fomenting rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The apostolic exhortation, as John Paul's statement is
officially called, broadly reflected the criticisms the pope has
long held about a Western society _ strongly influenced by the
United States _ that he believes devalues life, worships money, and
denigrates religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays in America a model of society appeares to be emerging
in which the powerful predominate, setting aside and even
eliminating the powerless,'' the pope said. ``This model of society
bears the stamp of the culture of death, and is therefore in
opposition to the Gospel message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americas, he said, are facing ``social sins which cry out to
heaven'' and are the consequence of a ``deep crisis caused by the
loss of a sense of God and the absence of those moral principles
which should guide the life of every person. In the absence of
moral points of reference, an ubridled greed for wealth and power
takes over, obscuring any Gospel-based vision of social reality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul urged faithful lay Catholics to assume active
leadership roles in society and not to be afraid to be guided by
religious principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is urgent to train men and women who can influence public
life and direct it to the common good,'' he said. ``A deeper
knowledge of Christian ethical principles and moral values will
enable them to be exponents of these in their own particular
setting, proclaiming them even where appeals are made to the
so-called `neutrality of the state.' ''

   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy stood in his office,
waiting for the ritual. When reporters burst through the door,
Kennedy smoothed his jacket, ready to deliver what by now might be
called The Impeachment Statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's a general sense that this doesn't rise to
the constitutional standard,'' he began, responding to a question
about the day's proceedings. ``I think it becomes clearer and
clearer that this, as reprehensible personal conduct as this
represents, it's personal conduct, and not conduct that undermines
the Constitution.''

specifics. No hints about bipartisan negotiations. No opinion on
the details of the trial, no outrage at the latest comments by
Republicans. Nothing but the vagueness of a senator who can get
away with saying nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kennedy, too, might have reason to be frustrated. He has
been repeating himself for weeks, and he knew where he stood on
President Clinton's impeachment well before charts and videos were
dragged in.
</P>
<P>
   His doubts are, to a degree, shared by Senator John F. Kerry.
Despite their differences, both Massachusetts senators have felt
that the facts were there, and that they could be judged without
the proceedings that have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   But each has constructed his own justification for why the trial
should end, and the reasons differ. Kerry refuses to say whether he
would convict Clinton on the two counts of impeachment, only that
he thinks the facts are sufficient to take a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a former prosecutor,'' Kerry said last week. ``I've read
about it ahead of time, read up on it, and I came to the issue with
a strong interpretation of the facts as I saw them. Before the
trial started, before we ever sat down at our desks, I'd been
reading about this for a year, almost to the day . . . And I came
to the conclusion . . . that we had a very extensive record in a
case that is not particularly complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, led by the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, have argued the opposite. They have
maintained that the factual details of the case require a full
hearing as well as witnesses to sort out discrepancies. In three
days, the 13 House ``managers'' also laid out arguments that
Clinton's alleged offenses _ perjury and obstruction of justice _
are ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that meet the standard for his
removal.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy disagrees. But rather than deal with the details of the
prosecution _ where Clinton touched Lewinsky, what exactly the
president said to his secretary Betty Currie _ Kennedy has
concentrated on the second part of the case, the standards of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment case made its way through the House of
Representatives, Kennedy favored censuring the president, and
hoped, aides said, that the ordeal would end quickly with a censure
motion.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear in December that it would not, Kennedy
gathered up books on impeachment _ ``Grand Inquests,'' by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, and another on the 1868 impeachment
of President Andrew Johnson _ and brought them home for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that, Kennedy said, he had reached the conclusion
the House had no case. ``This is sort of a feeling you get,'' he
said in an interview. But, unlike Kerry, Kennedy said it was not
the factual disputes that troubled him most.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in the end of these two years, Mr. Starr feels there
ought'' to be a criminal trial, ``this ought to be reviewed,''
Kennedy said. ``That's always out there. That's not what we're
deciding here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy has been the constitutional historian, Kerry has
thought more like a defense attorney. He talks like a textbook
about the perjury charge. Perjury requires that several criteria be
met, and, Kerry said, ``there are serious questions on specific
intent and materiality that leap out at you by virtue of the White
House case.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also says that there is a weak criminal case against
Clinton, and that the House would have needed to prove these
charges were true, and would hold up in a court of law, ``beyond a
reasonable doubt,'' before they could be used as a basis for
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry declined to point to specific flaws in their legal
argument, saying he would wait until the case is finished to speak
for the record.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``Since they have specifically marketed these as
felonies, and the president shouldn't stay in office because he's
committed a felony, we must find out first whether or not he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the senators' attitudes might seem obvious: Both
are Democrats, and both represent the state that gave Clinton his
highest margin of support in the 1996 election. Both have tried to
play a role in the politics of the trial, helping to guide the
Democratic position.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Kennedy joined a longtime adversary, Republican
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, in forging a bipartisan agreement on
the impeachment rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kerry said he would like to see an early vote on the
articles of impeachment. This prompted a flurry of discussion about
whether witnesses needed to be called.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, their efforts are at the mercy of the Republican
majority. But any political maneuverings they manage to achieve are
likely to be their legacy from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that will work its way through the processes
of discussions,'' Kerry said. ``Hopefully, the Senate will work in
its special way here to sort of pull together and bring this to an
end.''

 &HT;    Service remembers the best of Price
 &HT;    By Emily Morris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKWOOD, Texas _ Katrina Price knew how to pack a house.
</P>
<P>
   In life, her fans rallied around her at Ladyjack games where she
made a name for herself as Stephen F. Austin's leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   In death, she left behind a legacy that will long be remembered
by fans both near and far.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest church in Oakwood, Texas was overflowing Saturday
with the family, friends and fans of Ms. Price.
</P>
<P>
   With her family to the left of her casket and her teammates to
the right, the people who loved her the most said their goodbyes
during a tearful two-hour funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price committed suicide last Monday at her sister's
apartment in Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from areas across the state offered condolences during
the ceremony, but it was her sister who offered what might have
been regarded as the most meaningful words of all.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Price was the only witness to the tragedy that resulted in
Katrina's death.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded with mourners Saturday to remember her sister not
for the way she died, but for the way she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katrina knew how to pack a house,'' Lucy said as she looked
out over the crowd. ``I've thought about what I was going to say
today, and I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that I mean
all of it. Katrina will always be my big sister, and she will
always be my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   With her family by her side at the podium, Lucy Price remembered
when her mother used to dress her two youngest daughters like
twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we got older, Katrina grew into her own person, and I grew
into mine,'' Lucy said. ``She showed us all the person she was when
she played basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy said she never minded following in the shadow of Katrina,
and she was always proud to be Katrina's sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her last week how proud I was of her,'' Lucy said.
``She was sitting on the edge of my bed at my house, and I told her
I never minded being the sister of Katrina Price.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy said one of the ways she expressed her pride in Katrina was
by writing about her for The Pine Log, a student publication of
SFA.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to commemorate the 75th anniversary of SFA,
Lucy was given the assignment of writing a story in honor of the
occasion. When she was short on ideas, her professor suggested
writing a story about Katrina.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy agreed to do so and decided to interview her sister
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought her battles, and she fought mine,'' Lucy said. ``I've
lived her life. She was my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy said the story she wrote was the easiest assignment she
ever completed for school.
</P>
<P>
   During the one-on-one interview, Katrina told Lucy she wouldn't
have played basketball for any school but SFA, which inspired Lucy
to interview the women's basketball coach, Royce Chadwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had heard all about the girl from LaVega, (where
Katrina attended high school,) and that she was just like the girl
next door. And she could play,'' Lucy said. ``When Katrina read my
story, her eyes kept going back to that one sentence. She just had
this smile on her face, and she asked me if he really said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy said another quote from Chadwick has replayed itself over
and over in her mind since Katrina's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that in years to come, Ladyjack faithfuls will still
be talking about Katrina Price,'' Lucy said. ``She was a loving,
caring person. She was the most excellent, outstanding example of
what a young lady should be. It's not about how she died; it's
about how she lived. That's what people need to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy told the mourners to laugh with the people they love and
cry with them, because there's no assurance of tomorrow for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   SFA President Dr. Dan Angel offered remarks next.
</P>
<P>
   ``SFA knew Katrina Price, and we loved her,'' he said. ``I can
think of many vignettes of Katrina, and I remember the night we had
a special stand set up to record the points she scored, becuase she
was about to become the highest scorer we ever had. There was a
packed house that night, and the crowd celebrated every point with
her. She was a very special person both on and off the court. She
was a very special person in our minds and in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina's high school basketball coach spoke next and told the
family what a rare and wonderful opportunity it was to coach a
person like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was, but she had it,'' he said. ``On
behalf of LaVega, I extend my sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministers and speakers offered their condolences and sympathy,
and resolutions were read in honor of Katrina and her family.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from Houston, Waco, Clifton, Mineola, Oakwood,
Fairfield, Lufkin and Nacogdoches introduced themselves
individually, and members of the Ladyjacks basketball team were
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina's life was documented in a six-page program handed out
before the funeral, and pictures illustrated her life from her
childhood through the time she was a star player at SFA.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina attended Oakwood Public Schools through the fifth grade,
then LaVega Public Schools. She received a basketball scholarship
to SFA, and graduated cum laude with a degree in kinesiology in
May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While at SFA, Katrina was an All-American basketball player,
SFA's all-time leading scorer, a GTE Academic All-American (1st
team), and on the dean's list every semester.
</P>
<P>
   She was the seventh overall draft pick of the American
Basketball League, and played for the Philadelphia Rage.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina was working on a master's degree in kinesiology and was
employed by Nacogdoches ISD at the time of her death.

MOVES ON LEWINSKY UPSET SENATE BIPARTISANSHIP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In party caucuses and private meetings, the Senate
struggled Saturday to revive the bipartisanship that many members
said gave dignity to the unpleasant task of sorting through
President Clinton's liaison with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to be a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Just when many senators believed the Clinton trial was calmly
reaching its final stage, anger erupted over news that Lewinsky had
arrived in Washington after House prosecutors secretly won a court
order to compel her to answer more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats do not want witnesses to appear at the trial, and the
House move was a reminder that their effort to end the trial
quickly must overcome the desire of many Republicans for a
lengthier trial that includes witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been heading into calm water,'' said Senator Robert
Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. But the House prosecutors' approach
to Lewinsky made it unlikely that the trial will conclude swifty
and without rancor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a judicial act of terrorism that has left everyone
befuddled,'' Kerrey said. ``An explosion has gone off, and
everyone's ears are ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a climate, a feeling that we maybe could find a way
to conclude this,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat from
North Dakota. But that feeling is slipping away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said Democrats are ``all
in a lather'' about the House prosecutors' move. But he dismissed
their complaints, saying the Senate prerogative to call or not call
Lewinsky or other witnesses was intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a technical diversion that doesn't amount to a gnat,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Senator Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who is
respected by both parties, announced that he would introduce a
motion as early as  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  to dismiss the charges against
Clinton and end the trial. Democrats said they hoped Byrd's motion
would draw support from the six Republicans they need for a
majority among the 55 Senate Republicans and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the revived partisanship Saturday, some Democrats began
talking up a proposal they called ``motion to dismiss plus,'' which
would combine Byrd's proposal with language censuring Clinton in an
attempt to draw Republican votes. The motion might cite the
president for bringing ``shame and dishonor'' to his office, said
Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a properly worded motion to dismiss can garner enough
votes to pass,'' Breaux said in an interview in the Capitol
basement, where a subway whisks lawmakers from the House and Senate
chambers to their offices nearby. Some Republicans want to end the
trial, he said, but they would only vote to do it if they could
also show their disapproval of the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But if there were signs of movement Saturday, the movement was
away from a quick end to the trial. Only Friday, Senator Orrin
Hatch, Republican of Utah, raised hopes of a speedy finish by
proposing that the Senate should halt the trial if it was clear the
constitutionally required two-thirds margin to convict the
president did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, however, Hatch said his proposal always included the
caveat that the trial not end until both sides have ``a full chance
to present their case,'' which might require the Senate to move
beyond depositions and take time to hear witness testimony in the
well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans opposed a ``motion to dismiss plus'' outright.
Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, said the idea would
deprive him of the right to vote on the articles of impeachment.
``I want the opportunity to stand up and face my state, and 99
other senators, and say where I stand on whether to remove or not
remove'' the president, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rancorous feelings also rose Saturday as Democrats
complained that Lott, the Repubican leader, was aiming to shorten
the trial by eliminating a proposed debate among senators on the
motion to dismiss, which could have lasted as long as 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion was to be held behind closed doors, but it would
have been the first chance for debate among the senators, who must
remain silent in the Senate chamber during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Lott's motion would not only deprive them of a
chance for debate, but that the debate in fact should be held in
public. Lott sidestepped questions about whether debate would occur
in private, in public, or even at all.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, summed up his
colleagues' frustration with the Republican display of muscle:
``They have fractured a sense of fair-dealing,'' he said. ``I just
think they've left people with a bad taste in their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators met twice in private Saturday, but there
were no signs that either Lott's proposal or a ``motion to dismiss
plus'' had enough votes to succeed. ``We're discussing
everything,'' Lott said after emerging from a lunch meeting with
his GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat, said that one thing was sure:
New proposals on how to end the trial would emerge soon. ``In
weather terms, there are a lot of fronts moving,'' he said. ``The
weather in any one spot is variable.''

 &HT;    Commissioner non-committal on Olympics question
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ One month after saying television coverage would
be the single greatest determining factor in whether the NHL
participates in the 2002 Winter Olympics, league commissioner Gary
Bettman waffled on the subject Saturday night, saying ''a whole
host of issues'' will determine the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, meeting with the media on the eve of the NHL All-Star
game, denied he was backing off previous comments. But it was the
strongest indication yet that the NHL has not and will not receive
any assurances by NBC as to how high of a priority men's hockey
will rate in its coverage from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not backing off on it,'' Bettman said. ''I'm just choosing
not to be specific as to where the discussions are at this time.
Television is important. (But) I'm more comfortable not discussing
what NBC has or hasn't indicated to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman last month said, ''The threshold issue is what kind of
television coverage we get in the U.S.'' NBC spokesman Ed Markey
subsequently told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ''We're not
close to making any programming decisions for Salt Lake City. We're
still working on Sydney (2000 Summer Olympics).''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, who met with the league's owners earlier in the day,
reiterated that a decision likely would come in late February. But
he made a point of saying that the ''overwhelming sentiment'' from
players is that they want to participate in the Games. He also
happened to mention that ''fan polls'' indicate they want the NHL
to return to the Olympics, despite the fact the league's maiden
voyage in Nagano was disastrous: Neither the U.S. nor Canada
medaled, and a few American players trashed two dorm rooms in the
Olympic Village hours after being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, who will be retired by 2002, said the league
should participate in Salt Lake City regardless of the TV coverage,
saying, ''It's still an opportunity to get some great exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Brendan Shanahan said that if NBC decides against
slotting hockey in prime time, ''I think they'll be sorry when it's
over. Team USA in hockey will be one of the most publicized teams
going into the Olympics, whether it's for good reasons or bad
reasons. Women's figure skating got its big boost from a beating
(the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga). So maybe men's hockey will
get its boost from a room trashing.''
</P>
<P>
   The players involved in the room trashings never stepped
forward. The league suspects three players but decided against
disciplining them because it had no proof.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't care whether they stepped forward or not,'' said
Shanahan, who is Canadian. ''There's all these people stepping
forward in America today. I admire their silence. These guys really
should be working for (Bill) Clinton. He wouldn't be in the trouble
he is today if Team USA was working for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said the majority of the league owners want to
participate in the Games ''if it makes sense.'' He said revelations
of corruption by the IOC and Salt Lake City organizing committee
would not impact the NHL. If the Games are moved, he said, ''We'd
have to look at that. But I think they'll get their house in
order.''

DOUGLAS STILL A POSSIBILITY FOR CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT _ The eyes of a nation remain focused on Washington,
where the contentious relationship between Rod Strickland and the
Wizards (well, his agent, David Falk, and their owner, Abe Pollin)
may be keeping the engine of Sherman Douglas on idle.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, New Jersey's free-agent point guard, still may end up
as the No.1 floor leader in Washington if Strickland is moved.
Meanwhile, the Nets have hired Eric Murdock to take Douglas' place
as insurance for Sam Cassell, and the Clippers _ a leading player
in the Sherman Sweepstakes _ re-signed incumbent Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't guarantee that Douglas won't become a Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, that window hasn't closed. The
Clippers still have $3.2 million in beneath-the-salary-cap booty,
which should be more than enough for a 32-year-old reserve point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But the cap room could be saved and used to facilitate a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kandi'' gram: While the official liberation date of top draft
pick Michael Olowokandi remains Feb. 15, the Clippers are hoping
the 7-foot-1 rookie can be sprung a bit sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, whose contract with Italy's Kinder Bologna has an
escape clause, may be able to break out after a game on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder may go a bit more gently on this issue because Olowokandi
could be replaced by Sean Marks, a 6-foot-10 rookie from Cal.
Marks, like Olowokandi, is represented by agent Bill Duffy, who
still couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Juaquin in place: Former Lynwood High and Long Beach State
forward Juaquin Hawkins is one of five free agents in camp. The
6-foot-7 lefty has been going places since finishing his college
career in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary: Lakers camp, seven months in Taiwan, four months
in China, a season with the Long Island Surf of the USBL and... a
tour with the Harlem Globetrotters. Hawkins, who brings a
reputation for defense, was traveling with the Globetrotters when
the Clippers called.
</P>
<P>
   With NBA teams allowed to keep 14 players for the season's first
two weeks, Hawkins likes his chances to stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really optimistic,'' he said. ``There are a lot of good
players here, but I feel like I'm a good player, too. I'm just
thankful that they (Clippers) were nice enough to invite me.''
</P>
<P>
   Free hoops: The Clippers' public scrimmage will be held from 7
to 9 p.m., Feb. 2 at the Sports Arena. Admission and parking are
free. The Clippers Spirit dance team will be dancing and an
interactive fun zone will be open.

FROST HELPS OUT THE BEST OF 'EM

   Jane Frost put the winter behind her last week when she went to
Florida, but she got more than warm weather once she arrived in
Orlando. She also spent some time with LPGA legend Nancy Lopez, and
when you have committed your life to teaching this great game, it
doesn't get much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had met before, last year, when I was named to the advisory
board of her equipment line,'' said Frost, who was back at the
Holly Ridge Golf Course pro shop in Sandwich just a few days after
giving lessons to arguably the finest player in LPGA history.
``Apparently she must have liked what I was saying because she
asked for some putting help in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of the LPGA season's first event, the
HealthSound Inaugural, Frost spent the better part of two days
watching Lopez putt and offering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't try to change my stroke,'' said Lopez, citing a
fear that prevents many players from seeking out instructors. ``She
just helped me get into my routine.''
</P>
<P>
   That Lopez would seek out Frost is an honor for the local pro,
but it should not come as a surprise. Frost's resume speaks
volumes. In 1994, she was named LPGA Teacher of the Year, and just
recently she was cited by Golf Magazine as one of America's Top 100
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way she teaches,'' said Lopez, who, as a Hall of
Fame player, is a creditable source.
</P>
<P>
   What defines Frost's personality, though, is her passion for
teaching, whether the student is a three-time major winner who has
earned more than $5 million or a youngster who gets her kicks by
beating her father in contests at the Holly Ridge putting green.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that days after the thrill of giving lessons to Lopez,
Frost was equally proud to hear the news about Brittany Weddell.
Playing at Holly Ridge last Sunday, Weddell scored a hole-in-one at
the 113-yard fourth hole, a memorable shot to say the least, but
even more so if you are just 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Frost has watched Weddell the past few years and gets a charge
out of the girl's enthusiasm for the game. It will be fun to watch
her grow and compete, said Frost, who devotes a lot of her time to
junior golf _ so much, in fact, that in 1997 she was honored by the
LPGA with the Budget Service Award in recognition to her work with
children just learning the game. She has been seen on The Golf
Channel's ``Academy Live,'' talking about junior golf, and her
approach is to keep it simple and enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   It must work, too, for even legends want in on the teachings.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Life in the fast lane
</P>
<P>
   On the range, he found himself hitting balls next to Curtis
Strange and Tom Watson and fought to maintain his composure. On the
course, he found some bad spots with his driver and battled to make
some putts. Welcome to the PGA Tour, Geoff Sisk. The 32-year-old
Marshfield golfer missed the cut in his Tour debut at the Sony Open
at Hawaii, shooting 77-72, though he felt he hit it better than
that. ``But I had two penalty shots with my driver (in the first
round) and I can't remember the last time that happened,'' he said.
``I usually drive it straight.'' Sisk opened the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic Wednesday with a 2-under 70 (on the PGA West Arnold Palmer
Course) but wasn't especially pleased. ``I bogeyed the last hole, a
par-5. I chipped in for a birdie on my first hole and hit a lot of
good golf shots but just didn't convert. And you can't do that
against this type of competition.'' . . . Sisk showed his rookie
stripes when he got to the first tee at the Hope Wednesday and did
not know his amateur partner. It was Richard Ferris, who, as
chairman of the PGA Tour Policy Board, is a rather important person
in pro golf circles. ``I said, `Oh, my God,' '' said Sisk. ``I
should be up to date with this stuff. But he couldn't have been
nicer. It's what golf is all about, meeting people like that.'' . .
. Unheralded Cameron Beckman was leading the Sony Open until he
made a 9 at the par-4 15th in the second round. Ouch. He finished
in a tie for 24th at 2-under 278; had he parred that 15th, he would
have tied for second at 273 . . . Serves them right for going so
low. When players got to Waialae CC in Honolulu for the Sony Open,
they found the rough up and the par dropped to 70, a direct result
of the assault led last year by John Huston's Tour-record 28-under
finish. Last year, 4 under missed the cut; this year, 2 over made
the cut and Jeff Sluman's winning score was 9 under . . . Sluman's
tidy little two-week trip to Hawaii for the Mercedes and Sony
yielded these numbers: 73-67-72-72, 69-70-66-66, good for $531,050.
In his 42-year PGA Tour career, Sam Snead earned $620,126 in prize
money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How they stack up
</P>
<P>
   We're not quite at the stretch run, but a glance at the US Ryder
Cup standings offers a good dose of the expected (David Duval, Mark
O'Meara, Jim Furyk, Tiger Woods, Davis Love are Nos. 1-5 and figure
to be the heart of the team), with a pinch of the unexpected: Billy
Mayfair (No. 8), Sluman (10th), Fred Funk (11th), and Hal Sutton
(16th) in strong contention. With Top 10 finishes worth more than
they were in 1998, the real jockeying for position will take place
over the next few months, with particular interest in the four
majors, where points are doubled. There has been much talk about
players cutting back their schedules with the addition of three
World Golf Championship events, but it would seem to make sense for
people such as Payne Stewart, Mark Calcavecchia, Huston, Scott
Hoch, Tom Lehman (recovering from shoulder surgery, but due back
soon), and Paul Azinger to keep a busy dance card and chase
valuable points for that trip to Brookline in September. Keep in
mind, points are for Top 10 finishes only, not for money earned . .
. The Kemper Open is not one of the elite tournaments, and it drew
a rough date this year _ squeezed between popular stops (Colonial,
Memorial) and two weeks before the US Open. Fearful of not drawing
stars, officials at the Kemper came up with a novel approach that
involves that always popular word: Money. In addition to bumping
the purse to $2.5 million, Kemper officials will attempt to sign
the tournament winner to a logo contract, a deal that could be
worth $200,000 if that player wins a major . . . Arnold Palmer took
part in this week's Hope. Back before pleated pants, titanium
drivers, and the Sam 2000, Palmer owned this event. He won it five
times, including the inaugural in 1960, and it was his final
triumph on Tour in 1973. Palmer said last week that he would play
in the Masters but did not know about his own Bay Hill event (March
18-21) . . . Whenever she stepped into the spotlight, Lopez would
give credit to her father. Now she is paying tribute in a unique
way _ by naming a new wedge after him. The Domingo Wedge, part of
the Nancy Lopez Golf line, will make its debut at next weekend's
PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando . . . The announcement that Jane
Welch was named to the LPGA Board of Directors should have a
familiar ring because her husband Jack, the CEO of General
Electric, is an independent director on the PGA Tour Policy Board .
. . US Amateur champion Hank Kuehne (Southern Methodist) has
committed to the upcoming AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, but
fellow collegiate star Matt Kuchar (Georgia Tech) declined . . . A
round of double bogeys, if you will, for tennis star Pete Sampras.
He was too fatigued to play in the Australian Open (that's a major,
Pete), but he mustered up enough strength to play in the Hope. Way
to give back to your sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I'm 64
</P>
<P>
   He was never in the hunt to win, but by finishing in a tie for
29th at last week's Sony Open, Craig Stadler moved to 64th in the
world rankings. Ho hum? Well, yes, except being 64th _ for good or
bad _ means something now. The first event of the World Golf
Championships _ the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship _
will be limited to the Top 64 as of Feb. 15. If the event were to
start  &UR; today &LR; , Stadler would have a shot at earning $1 million. The
bad news: He would face the world's No. 1, Woods, right off the bat
. . . Another year, another quick exit for Chip Beck. He shot 75-74
and missed the cut at the Sony . . . Lennie Clements's opening
round at the Hope: two triples, a double, no birdies, an 84, then a
WD . . . The talent is getting younger and deeper every year.
Proof: Brittany Straza, a standout golfer at Lehigh High School in
Fort Myers, Fla., was given one of two sponsor's exemptions into
this week's LPGA Memorial in nearby Naples; and Beth Bauer, the
superb freshman at Duke, rolled to an eight-shot victory in the
recent Harder Hall Invitational in Sebring, Fla., which serves as
the traditional kickoff to the women's amateur championship season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day at the Beach
</P>
<P>
   A round at Pebble Beach figures to be memorable, all the more so
if it happens to be while you are winning a tournament. And if you
throw in a hole-in-one, well, you have yourself quite a week. That
was the case last week for the Dever brothers _ Jack and Thomas of
Danvers, and James of Plaistow, N.H. _ along with Kevin Camell of
Wilmington as they won the Cadillac Invitational National Kidney
Foundation event. In a scramble format, the group shot 62 at Pebble
Beach, 61 at Spanish Bay, then 60 at Del Monte as they roared from
five shots back for a two-stroke victory. For Jack, a 6-handicapper
who plays out of Sagamore Springs, it was a trip made more
memorable by his second career ace, coming at the 202-yard 12th
with a 5-iron. There were 110 teams entered, said Jack Dever, and
``you don't go out there to win.'' The golfers did not get to play
the much-talked-about par-3 fifth, which was redesigned by Jack
Nicklaus and has been praised mightily. It will play about 160
yards and is right along the water, but won't make its official
debut until the AT&AMP;T . . . Kenny Lewis of South Dennis is 16th in
the latest GolfWeek/Titleist amateur rankings . . . A historical
note the Massachusetts Golf Association can take pride in: In 1927,
the first group to represent the US in the Ryder Cup included five
golfers who had won, or would win, the Mass. Open: Walter Hagen
(1915), Johnny Farrell (1927), Leo Diegel (1928), Joe Turnesa
(1930), and Gene Sarazen (1935). In addition, alternate Mike Brady
was a three-time State Open winner.

ENERGY IN ATLANTA IS SUPERCHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The wind was not gone from the corner of Peachtree and
10th streets, not far from downtown Atlanta. That pesky wind was
blowing strongly from the vague direction of Alabama, as storm
after storm ventured from deeper in Dixie. No, the wind was not
gone.
</P>
<P>
   One lonely house sits at the corner of 10th and Peachtree.
Traffic whizzed by in all directions, making the 19th century house
seem all the more out of place, out of time, almost out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   But that one lonely house is a must-see for many visitors to
Atlanta, the home that author Margaret Mitchell called ``The
Dump,'' the place where she struggled for years in the 1930s to
write ``Gone with the Wind.'' Which, of course, captured Atlanta as
Atlantans for so long wished it to be captured.
</P>
<P>
   A sports bar is across the street from Mitchell's home. Such a
juxtaposition, such a perfect juxtaposition for the Atlanta of
1999. Inside that sports bar, there was a supreme mix of happiness
and joy that Atlanta's Falcons _ to the surprise of all _ were
going to the Super Bowl. But there was also an undercurrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were you when the Falcons were real bad?'' asked one fan
to another. ``You're just jumping on the bandwagon now. I was there
for it all, I went to see 'em play when they were bad. I didn't
just become a Falcons fan last Sunday when they went to Minnesota.
I've been there. I've suffered through it all.''
</P>
<P>
   All through Georgia, the same words could be heard. Such joy,
the truly innocent emotion when a football team makes its first
trip to a Super Bowl, but joy mixed with disdain by the true
believers for the newly converted. It is human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Back across the street, at Margaret Mitchell's home, the wind
still was not gone. That famous line from ``Gone with the Wind''
could almost be heard in the swirling wind: ``Frankly, my dear, I
don't give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Atlanta. That was how Atlanta felt toward its wretched
Falcons. But Mitchell's Atlanta was a long-ago Atlanta, just as
Atlanta's disdain for its football team was long ago _ as far back
in time as two or three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, my dear, everybody gives a damn about the Falcons now.
They're a mania in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Disturbing the peace
</P>
<P>
   On a beautiful hill on the opposite side of Atlanta is a huge
complex, with a library, museum, and other buildings. It is the
Jimmy Carter Center, and when visitors enter the complex, they are
told of the former president's role in attempting to make peace
between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure all of Georgia is going to want to be in Miami,''
said Ezra Slocum, a visitor to the Carter Center. ``After the
football players themselves and those guys who draw up the X's and
O's and the guys with the Gatorade, I think one person has to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   ``The President. There's going to be some peace-making needed to
be done down there. Coach (Dan) Reeves and that coach in Denver
seem ready to do some strangling of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders might feel that the uproar surrounding the
Patriots' last visit to the Super Bowl might never be topped. When
the long-simmering rift between Bill Parcells and Bob Kraft
exploded into the open during Super Bowl week, it caused a circus.
</P>
<P>
   This year's circus is already tromping toward Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say things in a coaches meeting as far as critiquing a
player that you would never say to a player,'' Reeves said last
week at the Falcons' practice facility. ``If John (Elway) ever got
any bad feelings about something I said, it was never done
publicly. It had to be something coming from a staff meeting. Now,
does that mean Mike (Shanahan) did it? I have no proof of it.
Nothing. But I did what I felt was best for our football team. It
wasn't an easy decision because I knew he was a great football
coach. But I didn't think he had my best interest at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, Reeves's former offensive coordinator in Denver,
reacted angrily when he heard Reeves publicly say what had been
privately whispered six years ago: that Shanahan was so allied with
Elway that he repeated to the quarterback what Reeves had said
about Elway in private meetings. This only inflamed the tense
feelings between Elway and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has been saying this for years, said Shanahan. ``For him
to bring this up now, and never address it to me, ever, and then
address it in the press, is something that I've lost a lost of
respect for,'' said Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves fired Shanahan in Denver. Broncos owner Pat Bowlen soon
fired Reeves. And this unhappy triangle _ Reeves, Shanahan, and
Elway _ is heading to Miami for a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where (Carter) is now,'' said Slocum. ``But he
ought to be thinking of going to Miami. He used to go to Braves
games and do the (Tomahawk) Chop. He needs to do some peace-making
before these coaches chop each other up.''
</P>
<P>
   A time for dreams
</P>
<P>
   On the same side of Atlanta, and not far from the Carter
complex, is the Ebenezer Baptist Church and the Martin Luther King
complex, a Visitor Center, King's gravesite, and a memorial. King's
uplifting speech _ ``I have a dream'' _ permeates the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   This may be Atlanta's true shrine. Visitors from around the
world, make a point to stop here for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams also accompany those Atlantans who pass along Auburn
Avenue day by day, dreams as lofty as those that ooze from the
neighborhood or more mundane ones. But in this area, as throughout
the city, there is one dream that few, if any, can truthfully say
they had six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, no way, thought this was going to happen,'' said Jack
Fuller. ``Even two weeks ago, nobody dared think of this. I think
if you're an honest person, and you answer honestly, no way there's
anybody in Atlanta who can say they'd thought of this. That's what
makes it sweet. It's happening _ and nobody thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   Rallying around
</P>
<P>
   Far across the city is the Buckhead section, and the other night
the flare of Falcon frenzy burned hot. A night spot held a rally
for the Falcons, the streets were filled with dancers doing the
Dirty Bird, and Gov. Roy Barnes did what few governors are ever
allowed to do _ he incited a mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win,'' the governor shouted to the mob, which
got rowdier. The Broncos are ``going to be sorry,'' Barnes went on,
``and thank God they sent us Dan Reeves.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, the same euphoria was present. Wide
receiver Terance Mathis, an Atlanta native, returned to his high
school to wild cheers and adulation. The birth of a baby to Diane
Chandler, wife of quarterback Chris Chandler, was greeted as if the
Chandlers were a royal couple. The statistics for the new daughter
_ 6 pounds 10 ounces, and 20 inches long _ may be as well known in
Atlanta as Greg Maddux's earned run average used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves?'' shouted George Brown, 28. ``They never win the
big ones. Now we've got the Falcons. Look what they did in
Minnesota. The Falcons win.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, strange times in Atlanta.

COURT ORDER ON LEWINSKY RILES SENATE DEMOCRATS

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political firestorm erupted in President
Clinton's impeachment trial Saturday, as his accusers stunned the
White House by obtaining a court order to question Monica S.
Lewinsky, and the Senate's bipartisan approach to the trial rapidly
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate lurching toward a showdown this week over
whether to end the historic proceedings, Democrats attacked the
House impeachment managers over their secret attempt to compel
Lewinsky to submit to questioning without the Senate's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The House effort, in tandem with independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr, succeeded when a federal judge ruled Saturday that Starr
could force Lewinsky to answer questions from his staff in the
presence of the House managers. Starr had granted Lewinsky immunity
from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky made no comment Saturday when she was swarmed by
reporters Saturdayas she arrived in Washington after a flight from
Los Angeles. She is expected to be questioned Sunday by Starr's
aides in a meeting with House managers on Capitol Hill. The
questions will probably involve the areas where her earlier
testimony conflicts with the White House account, such as how gifts
from Clinton were returned and the exact nature of her relations
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's return unfolded as momentum grew against prolonging
the trial with a lengthy witness phase, to the dismay of the House
managers and some conservative senators. The trend prompted a
flurry of private negotiations and public posturing, as members of
both parties stepped up searches for a plan to end the process
``with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fray, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the Senate
would send written questions about the impeachment charges to
Clinton by tomorrow. The move was seen as an alternative to
inviting Clinton to testify, which House managers and some Senate
Republicans have advocated as a way to resolve contradictions in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to hear what the president has to say about some of
these inconsistencies,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House quickly responded that Clinton will invoke
his rights not to answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bipartisan blueprint for the trial, the Senate had
deferred until this week votes on whether to call witnesses or
dismiss the two articles of impeachment against Clinton. The
articles allege that Clinton lied under oath to a federal grand
jury and obstructed justice to cover up his sexual affair in the
White House with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamental breach of the letter of the law and the
spirit of the agreement,'' Senator John F. Kerry said of the
House's pursuit of Lewinsky. ``It's (an) inappropriate interference
into the proceedings of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the Senate's Republican majority, which effectively
controls the trial procedures, ``put themselves squarely on the hot
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry was more restrained than many other Senate Democrats,
who variously denounced the House move as ``arrogant,''
``desperate,'' and ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also criticized the move by the House managers.
``To sit down with her this weekend is a circumvention of the
agreement among 100 senators,'' said Senator John W. Warner, a
Virginia Republican. ``We laid down a procedure, and I think we
should follow the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 House managers, all Republicans, issued a statement
defending their effort to seek the interview with Lewinsky. They
said ``any good lawyer would talk to a witness before deciding to
put her on the witness stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers added, ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been
more important than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers disagreed and criticized the format for the
interview, with prosecutors from Starr's office posing the
questions. ``Can you imagine what that little conversation is going
to look like, held in the independent counsel's office, with the
people there who have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?''
said Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also came under intense fire, with some Democrats calling
on him to recuse himself because of his lack of independence in the
case. ``He is a cheerleader for impeachment,'' said Senator Patrick
J. Leahy of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a brief statement, said, ``As I see it, we are duty
bound to assist the House managers in the constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the dispute, Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, appealed
to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the trial's presiding
officer, to prohibit the House managers from interviewing Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, citing the Senate's ``sole power to try impeachment''
under the Constitution, said, ``It is up to the Senate, not the
independent counsel'' or federal judge, to determine which
witnesses the House managers and Clinton's lawyers may interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, who spent six hours Saturday presiding over
proceedings dominated by the latest Lewinsky controversy, did not
issue an immediate decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyers also planned to appeal the federal judge's
ruling, in a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, with their hope of a full-scale trial
imperiled, used the final hours of a two-day, question-and-answer
period with senators to appeal for permission to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The lead manager, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, delivered an emotional plea for senators not to ``sell
out'' and cut short the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal justice under the law is what moves me and animates and
consumes me, and I am willing to lose my seat any day of the week
rather than sell out on those issues,'' Hyde said. ``Despite all
the polls and hostile editorials, America is hungry for people who
believe in something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may disagree with us,'' Hyde told the senators. ``But we
believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous unanimous agreement, Clinton's lawyers and
the House managers each are scheduled to have one hour each to
debate a motion to dismiss the impeachment charges, as early as
tomorrow. Both sides would then equally divide six hours of debate
on motions to take depositions from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Each senator was to have 10 minutes to debate each motion before
voting, but Lott Saturday canceled the debate period, calling it an
unnecessary use of time.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators, decrying Lott's move as ``a gag rule,''
portrayed the initiative as a blast by Lott at Senator Robert C.
Byrd's surprise decision the day before to rally support for the
motion to dismiss the charges. The move by Byrd, a West Virginia
Democrat who is influential in both parties, fueled the momentum
against a lengthy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd Saturdaylashed out at the House managers Saturday for
trying to compel Lewinsky's testimony, depicting the move as ``a
desperate attempt to preempt'' the votes on calling witnesses and
dismissing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of the country, this political jockeying has got
to stop,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Lott said Republicans were ``remarkably united''
against dismissing the charges this week. ``There is a strong sense
in the Republican conference that the Byrd dismissal would be
tantamount to an abortion of justice,'' said Lott's spokesman, John
T. Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was less harsh in his appraisal, although he also predicted
the motion to dismiss would be defeated. ``I think it would be a
big mistake if the Senate voted to dismiss,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   If the dismissal motion fails along party lines in the
GOP-controlled Senate, Democrats are poised to portray Republicans
as dragging out an impeachment process that, polls show, the public
wants to end quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have an opportunity to conclude this process,''
Senator Edward M. Kennedy said, ``and the American people are going
to see who wants to continue to beat this dead horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is whether Democrats can muster the 51 votes they
need to block witnesses, which would effectively force the Senate
to end the proceedings by voting on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is required to convict
the president. And members of both parties said Clinton is all but
certain to avoid conviction on both charges. Republicans outnumber
Democrats, 55-45, in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's conviction apparently impossible, one of the
leading plans to emerge from Senate Democrats called for beefing up
a motion to dismiss the charges with language that would censure
the president. Rank-and-file Republicans showed little interest in
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry, who met briefly with Lott after Saturday's session,
said it is ``entirely possible'' that GOP leaders would propose a
plan by tomorrow to restore a bipartisan approach to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really going to have to find some way to resolve
this, because they have threatened the bipartisanship and the
process itself,'' Kerry said. ``Unless they find a way to resolve
it, they will really be inviting serious consequences.''

OK NBA, ALMOST ALL IS FORGIVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're back, and I'm glad.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, hey, I was a paid-up member of the ``Bleep All Those Guys''
Club while the lockout was going on. I won't deny that. But now
it's late January and I'm ready for some NBA basketball, even if it
hasn't all been up to my artistic standards the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter what I think. It only matters what vox
populi thinks. Fans will determine the success of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the lockout, it was very chic, even for
people who professed to love the sport, to say how little they
missed the game and how the league could keep the players out until
the Twelfth of Never for all they cared. That was easy to say in
October, November, or December. Now, in the dead of winter, it is
clearly time for some basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a very forgiving mood,'' says Peter Shankman. ``I'd
probably be in an even better mood if the Celtics had a center.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankman has had Celtics season tickets since 1975. He started
off in the balcony, was moved to splendiferous seats in the old
Garden press box via lottery and now occupies a nice center-court
seat for which he pays $72 a pop. He is someone the Celtics would
not wish to offend.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, that is. He's a little too old to worry about
actually relating to the players in a personal sense. As long as
they shut up occasionally and play ball, that will be just fine
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can listen to Kenny Anderson say whatever it is he is
supposed to have said to that kid and say whatever he says he was
kidding about on the subject of selling one of his luxury cars, and
it doesn't make any difference to me,'' observes Shankman. ``I
don't have to like these people. I didn't know Larry Bird, either,
and that had nothing to do with the fact that I loved watching him
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankman is excited and intrigued for the same reason I find
myself excited and intrigued. The Celtics aren't contenders in any
sense, but they aren't a bag o' doughnuts, either. In fact, they
might prove to be one of the most entertaining teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The most important news that came out of Celticland in the late
stages of the lockout was Anderson's declaration that his
oft-ailing knees felt good. That got my pulse rate up, because as
Kenny Anderson goes, so goes the Celtics' offense.
</P>
<P>
   You all recall how it went last year; I'm sure. Anderson
arrived, and the offense took flight. Everyone began getting easier
shots, most notably Antoine Walker. When Anderson's knees kept him
out of the lineup, the team's offense sagged. There really isn't
another true point guard on the roster, and even if there were, he
wouldn't have the offensive creativity of Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson directing an offense that has Walker, Ron Mercer,
Paul Pierce, and, let's not forget, himself, the Celtics will be
one of the more potent offensive teams in the league. (I am, of
course, assuming that Pierce will be an instant player.) If they
are running, then Walter McCarty becomes an offensive threat, and
there is always Dana Barros.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to the product known as NBA basketball, and this,
reminds Shankman, is something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never understand people who say they like college ball
but don't like the NBA,'' says Shankman. ``These are the best
college players, the ones who were good enough to go on and play in
this league. And college ball really doesn't get good until March
Madness. Oh, and don't forget the zones.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, Shankman admits the lockout
wasn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been the best thing that could have happened,'' he
says. ``I saved a lot of money. First of all, I didn't have to pay
for exhibition games, which mean nothing. This year, the exhibition
game is free, which is the way it should always be. I mean, come
on. Seventy-two dollars for a meaningless exhibition game?''
</P>
<P>
   Shankman would have preferred a better home schedule, but what
are you going to do? Have you checked out the six Western
Conference teams? Shankman has. ``We get Denver, Sacramento,
Vancouver, Portland, the Clippers, and Minnesota,'' he points out.
``We don't get Houston, Seattle, Phoenix, San Antonio, the Lakers,
and Utah. I suppose the good thing is that we'll have a better
chance of beating the teams that are coming in here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one argument Shankman doesn't want to hear, and that's
the one that says the 1999 title won't matter because Michael
Jordan will be out on a golf course somewhere while the NBA
playoffs are taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the matter with people?'' he inquires. ``That would be
like saying that the 1970 title didn't matter because Bill Russell
was no longer playing. They miss the point. You have a career and
then you retire. That's the point. Bill Russell had his time and
then Larry and Magic had their time, and now Michael has had his
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankman isn't foolish enough to ask for another Russell or
Bird, but he thinks he has realistic ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another era,'' he says. ``A run of five or six years where you
have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably too much to ask that every fan be this
enlightened. But it's something to strive for.

KHRISTICH ADAPTATION A GOOD STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the Bruins' leading scorer at the All-Star break, having
hit the 20-goal plateau for the sixth time in his nine-year career.
He is an All-Star for the second time and will play for the World
Team in this Sunday's annual salute to the NHL's best and brightest
at Tampa's Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Dmitri Khristich's hockey gifts, the 29-year-old
winger remains something of an enigma. He arrived in Boston on Aug.
29, 1997, along with goalie Byron Dafoe in a deal that sent Jozef
Stumpel, Sandy Moger, and a fourth-round choice to the Los Angeles
Kings. The Bruins knew they were acquiring a talented forward with
a knack for scoring on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of personality, Khristich is nearly impossible to read.
If Ray Bourque is stately and Dafoe is ebullient and Rob DiMaio is
blunt and Joe Thornton is down to earth and Jason Allison is funny
. . . well, how would one describe Khristich?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an introverted guy,'' said Bruins president/general
manager Harry Sinden. ``It's difficult for me to talk to Dmitri.
It's difficult for (coach Pat Burns) to talk to him. It's been
difficult for anybody on any team in his career to talk to him.
It's the cultural change he's had to go through. I don't know how
outgoing I would be if I had to live in Hungary or somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well known as a pretty talented player around the league.
There was a question about his work ethic and his commitment to the
team that he played for. But we haven't really noticed anything
that has bothered us very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden believes Khristich's reserved manner is a product of his
roots in Kiev, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's quite sure of himself as a person living in
a society like this,'' Sinden said. ``It's hard to know. With
players, I try to put myself in their place and wonder how I'd
react. When you get a guy like Dmitri, he's never been like Pavel
Bure, who just takes North America like, `This is great, let's have
a good time.' He has never been able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from the Ukraine, he probably came from an
agricultural-type, rural background and in the Ukraine, he'd
probably have some inhibitions. To come to a country like the
United States, I would think that would be really difficult to cope
with. He's a kid that seems to want to talk but can't bring himself
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden thinks part of the problem is that Khristich is easy to
misunderstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up here the other day to make sure his arrangements
were in order to go to the All-Star Game, and I happened to be here
and I congratulated him,'' said Sinden. ``I said, `Is this your
first game?' I didn't realize he'd been there once before. You know
what his answer was? He said, `No, I've been there once before.' It
wasn't like an American kid or a Canadian kid who would've said,
`Yeah, I'm really excited. This is going to be great.' I think he
felt that way but he just didn't communicate it. If you're not
careful, you take that as he's not interested in talking to you or
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' boss has given a great deal of thought to Khristich
not only as a hockey player but as a person, and he said a
substantial amount of consideration should be given to the
individual's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what must happen to these kids when they leave
their homeland,'' he said. ``It's a tremendous change. I couldn't
do it. I would completely withdraw. The younger they are, perhaps,
the better. Sergei (Samsonov) brings his family with him so that
connection remains and it helps a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look and talk to Dmitri, I wish the communication was
better with him and with the coach and with me and the (media) and
with his teammates, and maybe it's not bad with his teammates. I
understand why it possibly isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Khristich's discomfort, already evident when he
arrived, could have been exacerbated by last summer's arbitration
hearing. At the time, there was rampant speculation that if they
agreed to pay Khristich the $1.95 million he was awareded, which
they did, that he would then be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to arbitration, it's not a nice experience for
the player or for management,'' Sinden said. ``You're trying to win
a case even though perhaps you don't believe it. We said a few
things that were tough on him right in front of him. I don't know
whether that hardened him more. I hated to say it because there
wasn't that rapport to begin with and now you were breaking it down
even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's producing, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the roles Khristich has played that hasn't been discussed
much is mentor to Samsonov. It has appeared to be more of a passive
role than an active one, although when Samsonov was going through a
slump at the end of last month, Khristich stepped to the
youngster's defense and fended off media questions about comments
made by the coach. Sinden said he didn't predict that Khristich
would take Samsonov under his wing but he is happy to see that he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were that smart,'' said Sinden. ``It probably
would've been good thinking on our part to say, `Let's get somebody
who speaks the language and who has been in the league for a while
to show him the ropes,' and Khristich could be the guy, but it just
happened coincidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, as good as it has been for Samsonov, it might even
be better for Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few of those players, European players, who are
handed that responsibility throughout the league,'' said Sinden,
referring to leadership or motivation assignments. ``I doubt if
(Jaromir) Jagr plays that role at all in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khristich's role perhaps evolved, not to lead the team, but
what a neat responsibility of maybe helping out the team by
mentoring one of the top choices if not one of the top prospects.
So he came upon that responsibility probably by accident or
coincidentally, but he perhaps relishes it and it may be something
where we need to give the opportunity to more of these Europeans to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau in his prime
</P>
<P>
   To say that Carolina captain Keith Primeau doesn't miss his days
in Detroit is an understatement. Primeau, who was taken in the
first round (third overall) in the 1990 entry draft by the Red
Wings, faced a lot of pressure in the Motor City. Eventually, he
asked to be dealt, which he was in October 1996, and he has 22
goals and 16 assists in 45 games this season. ``I've grown as a
player and I've grown as a person,'' said Primeau. ``And sometimes
it takes a move to get the chance to do that. I would say the Red
Wings expected too much from me too soon. I was expected to score
like Jimmy Carson and fight like Bob Probert, as an 18-year-old. I
understood their expectations in one respect because I led the
Ontario League in scoring as an 18-year-old. But I would say it was
unfair of them to expect so much from me at such a young age.
Detroit was never a happy place for me. I enjoy the game so much
more now than three years ago.'' . . . Edmonton defenseman Boris
Mironov made a splash last week when he aired his grievances with
general manager Glen Sather in public. Mironov, who wants to
renegotiate his contract, feels unappreciated. ``I have played for
the Edmonton Oilers 5 1/2 years,'' Mironov said. ``I never hear
from (Sather) that I'm a good player. He always says I play bad.
Maybe I'm not going to the All-Star Game because I'm looking for a
new deal for the last three months. Maybe it's more Slats's
decision that I'm not going. Maybe he's playing some game. I'm not
sure.'' Mironov had threatened a holdout and got in Sather's
doghouse when he was over his playing weight by about 10 pounds
during a recent weigh-in, and he hasn't always adhered to team
rules on the road. ``Players forget they're getting paid a hell of
a lot of money and they have to perform up to everyone's
expectations to get a new deal,'' said Sather. ``He's got to grow
up and play hockey. Maybe by getting mad at me he'll start playing
well.'' . . . Former Canadiens goalie Jocelyn Thibault, who beat
his former teammates Thursday night, 3-0, for Chicago said the
reason he asked for a trade out of Montreal in November had nothing
to do with the pressure of playing in the hockey-mad town. ``I
didn't see any alternative,'' said Thibault. ``There was a
combination of factors that went into my decision. But in the back
of my mind, there was always this feeling that the team didn't want
me. They didn't have confidence in me. They said one thing and then
they went looking for another goaltender. I knew there was no way I
was going to win their confidence. You don't think there was
pressure when I first came to Montreal and replaced Patrick Roy? I
thought I played well that season. I thought I handled the
pressure. I was 20 years old and I was replacing a legend. In the
three years I was there, I had some good memories. I regret that I
couldn't take the team further in the playoffs. But I'm proud of
what I accomplished in Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends
</P>
<P>
   Kings forward Eric Lacroix picked up his first point of the
season when he had an assist against his former team, the
Avalanche, Tuesday night. It was his first game against his
ex-mates since Lacroix's father, Colorado GM Pierre Lacroix, traded
him to the Kings Oct. 29. ``Whenever you play against your old team
for the first time, it's a weird feeling,'' said Lacroix. ``I was
nervous. It helps that it's been a while. It would have been
tougher if I had to play them right away after the trade. I didn't
leave behind 25 enemies. I left behind 25 friends.'' Kings coach
Larry Robinson said it was hard on Lacroix, who missed nine games
with a fractured sternum. ``He's a great kid,'' said Robinson.
``Even when he's not playing well, he's not a disruption. Maybe
he's just a disruption to himself.'' . . . Twice within six weeks,
Detroit goalie Norm Maracle has been struck in the throat by a
puck. It's possible that Maracle will add a throat protector,
similar to one worn by Roy. ``That could potentially be a
life-threatening situation,'' said trainer John Wharton. ``I think
he needs to protect that area a little better.'' . . . Needham
native Robbie Ftorek, coaching the New Jersey Devils, was out in
his old haunt last week, Los Angeles. The former Kings coach said
it was strange. During his time there in the late '80s, Ftorek
dealt with the pressure by strolling on the beach. ``I'd walk the
beach at night, more than I probably should have,'' said Ftorek.
``It was relaxing. One night after a game, all I wanted to do was
take my shoes off and walk in some grass. But do you think I could
find grass? I ended up walking down the 14-inch strips of grass at
the Residence Inn.'' . . . The trade of Bure from Vancouver to
Florida has met with mixed reviews, but Canucks forward Alexander
Mogilny, for one, is relieved. ``It's good for us and for Pavel to
get back playing again,'' said Mogilny. ``It was a long wait for
him. It's tough to lose a friend, but he wasn't happy here. I can
understand a change of scenery. The same thing happened to me in
Buffalo. I don't think it was a distraction. How can you be
distracted when you're below .500?''

BOURQUE STILL ENJOYS ALL-STAR SALUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ He has been a fixture on the All-Star scene for almost
his entire 20-year career. This Sunday, when Bruins captain Ray
Bourque takes the ice with his North American teammates for this
year's contest against the World team in the annual showcase of
hockey's greatest talent, Bourque will be a starter for a record
12th time and a participant for the 17th. He was the most valuable
player in the 1996 game at the FleetCenter, in which he scored the
winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   For the 38-year-old defenseman, it's still an honor to be voted
as a favorite by the fans, still an honor to be recognized _ and
rightfully so _ as one of the best at his position, but Bourque's
perspective on the experience has clearly changed.
</P>
<P>
   He's no longer bright-eyed and wonder-struck. However, his three
children are, and it's through their eyes that Bourque sees this
weekend. He and his wife, Christiane, relish the time they spend
with Melissa, Christopher, and Ryan, and that, more than anything,
is what Bourque looks forward to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what it was the first couple of times you go, but you
go there with a positive attitude and you try to enjoy the
festivities,'' said Bourque. ``It's a pretty hectic weekend but now
I try to kind of live it through my kids' eyes and I bring them
along and they really enjoy it. I know it's a big thrill for them.
It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he's looked upon as an elder statesman at the
event and possibly a good-will ambassador of sorts, Bourque
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' he said, a wry smile spreading across his lips.
``I think they'll be looking at (Paul) Kariya, (Teemu) Selanne,
(Peter) Forsberg, and (Eric) Lindros and those guys because those
are the guys who are going to be lighting them up. I'll probably be
pulling a few pucks out of the net. It's not really a game made for
defensemen or goalies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, it's not much of a game at all. It's a
reward for individual greatness, which Bourque certainly possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not put him in the class of athletes that is only
reserved for the very, very special?,'' mused Bruins
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``The only reason you
hesitate to do it is because he hasn't won a championship _ like he
wins the championship. It's because he hasn't been on a team that
won a championship. If Babe Ruth hadn't won a World Series, then he
would've been nothing? That's just the way America is. If you can't
all alone lead the team to a championship, then you're not worthy
of recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, whose fitness and durability are as remarkable as his
on-ice skill and smarts, could be the Ernie Banks of hockey. But as
Sinden points out, he wouldn't be the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the greatest players in this league _ Brad Park is one
_ never won a Stanley Cup,'' said Sinden. ``It means nothing to my
estimation of Raymond, it should not mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it's in his favor that he can do this and continue to
do this without being on a championship team. He's never had the
advantage of being on the very best team in the league, though he's
come close a couple of times, which would've promoted his status a
thousand times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the status he's got without it, I think, is
incredible. Maybe we should turn it around and say, `How can you
play this well on teams that can't win championships?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A Stanley Cup is about the only thing Bourque hasn't been
rewarded with. He's a five-time Norris Trophy winner as the
league's top defenseman, he's third on the NHL's all-time assist
list (and gaining on No. 2 Paul Coffey), and he's the Bruins'
all-time leading scorer. He never loses his enthusiasm for the
sport he loves, and he's even looking forward to the thankless task
of trying to prevent goals in a showcase designed to highlight
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a pretty interesting game,'' said Bourque of the
North Americans' 8-7 victory. ``I think this year should be a good
game again. You're never going to have a rock 'em, sock 'em kind of
game. There's a lot of skill out there and you're going to see a
lot of goals no matter how they break it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives it a little bit of a rivalry in terms of all the
Europeans playing against the North Americans, so it worked out
pretty good last year. It's fun to still be there.''

ANDERSON A FOCAL POINT AT GUARD SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antoine Walker has his new deal, his captaincy, and a ton of
responsibility on his broad shoulders. Ron Mercer already is
showing signs of being a keeper; and Paul Pierce has the resume, if
not the results.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the three building blocks for the future of the Boston
Celtics. Rick Pitino and Chris Wallace say so. The three are young,
gifted, athletic and, presumably, will improve with experience.
Considering the new rules governing player salaries, there is
legitimate hope that they will be around for a while to help turn
things around in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, perhaps even more important to the team's success in
1999 and the foreseeable future is Kenny Anderson. The 28-year-old
point guard may not be adept at public relations, but he is
indispensable to this team.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see much of Anderson last season, but what we saw was
enough to tease us. He appeared in just 16 games, two of which were
in-and-outers because of his left knee bruise. If you go by the
other 14 games, you have to be excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can play like last year, we've got something,'' Wallace
said. ``We need him. He needs us. He's enthusiastic. He's prepared
himself. Those three young guys are our building blocks, but we
hope Kenny comes along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson reasonably healthy _ he hurt the knee in his first
game as a Celtic _ Boston was 7-7. That's not particularly
eye-opening, but look at what he did for the offense in general and
Walker in particular:
</P>
<P>
   Team Walker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FG% Pts. FG%Record &QL; 
With Anderson 47.7 102.7 .503 7-7 &QL; 
Without Anderson 42.5 91.4 .407 29-39 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the schedule had some bearing. Anderson joined the
team on the tail end of its February Western swing and then came
home to face such behemoths as Sacramento, Golden State, and
Washington. But there also were games against Utah, Indiana,
Houston, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The big unknowns about Anderson this year are his health and his
ability to stay on the court. He played all 82 games in 1996-97 for
the Trail Blazers, but last year's 61 games represented the fewest
since his second year, when he fractured a wrist. Right now,
Anderson looks as though he has bulked up, particularly in the
upper body. He said his knee is fine.
</P>
<P>
   If he stays healthy, he can average 38-40 minutes a game and the
Celtics will score points and be entertaining. They will be hard to
beat because of their many weapons. Walker will benefit. And it's
not like we're talking Pervis Ellison here; Anderson is a gamer.
But we're not talking A.C. Green either; of his seven seasons, only
twice has he played in more than 72 games.
</P>
<P>
   The health concerns are amplified by the defensive
responsibilities Anderson will have to assume. Pitino was reluctant
to press last year with Anderson; that cannot be the case this
season. (Wallace said the team did a study that revealed the
Celtics pressed only 28 percent of the time last year; that will
happen when you shoot 43 percent.) Anderson has never been known
for his defense and, despite his added girth, he still is only 6
feet 1 inch. And, as of now, he's basically all they have at what
may be the most important position.
</P>
<P>
   The depth chart at point guard consists of Anderson and Dana
Barros, although the latter doesn't think of himself as a point
guard. That's about it. Tyus Edney, who we all know was the truest,
pre-Anderson point guard on the team, is not around. Rookie free
agent Marlon Garnett is a combination project/insurance. (We can
assume the Celtics will conjure up some debilitating ailment for
him when rosters are cut to 12 two weeks into the season. Until
that time, teams can carry 14 players.) Anderson, Barros, and
Mercer are the only true veteran guards on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   It's all there for Anderson, and he must relish the opportunity
and run with it. He has been in an All-Star Game (1994) and in the
playoffs (three times), but in many ways has been an underachiever
as a pro. He's a career 41.4 percent shooter, his teams are 2-9 in
postseason play, and this is his fourth NBA stop in seven seasons,
fifth if you include his brief stay with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He is at the stage of his career where he has security (four
years left after this) and the coach's blessing, and he should have
the desire to make a statement to all non-believers. He has an
exciting collection of eager, young pups with which to play. He is
a grizzled veteran on this young team. He also is in an enviable
spot. It's one he has always wanted and one that will test him to
the max. It may not be fair to put the fate of the team solely on
him, but how he does will affect this team as much as, if not more
than, any other player.
</P>
<P>
   Close call
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell is now with the Knicks, but the team he almost
ended up with was . . . the Warriors. When Golden State general
manager Garry St. Jean asked for final offers for Mr. Warmth, he
was astounded at how bad they were. Miami wouldn't part with P.J.
Brown and even took Jamal Mashburn off the table, tossing out Dan
Majerle, Terry Mills, and Brent Barry. Once Indiana realized Brown
wasn't in the mix, it lost interest. St. Jean, to his credit,
extracted John Starks instead of Chris Childs to go along with
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. But it was strictly a salvage
operation at that point. All summer St. Jean had been fielding
inquiries, but when it came time to make a deal, he had only one
legit offer: the one he took from the Knicks. It would not be
inaccurate to state that the thought of Sprewell's return caused
some trepidation and even panic at Golden State. The bottom line is
that there was, as usual, more talk than action and when it came
time for sealed bids, there was, as Gertrude Stein might say, not a
lot of there there . . . Speaking of Spree, the Knicks in general
and Madison Square Garden honcho Dave Checketts in particular are
taking some heat for the trade. Checketts was reminded of a
statement he made a few years back when he said he'd seek only
solid citizens for the Knicks (Larry Johnson must have slipped
through the cracks). Checketts told reporters in a conference call
that his prior remarks were ``pretty judgmental and almost
self-righteous. I regret having said those things. It's not fair
for me to judge what people have gone through. A lot has happened
to my thinking in the last 48 hours or so.'' . . . While we're on
the topic, Pitino went on the radio Friday and said emphatically
that he would not trade Pierce. (Hope Pierce's landlord wasn't
listening.) That was after he had seen him in a couple practices.
Pierce was discussed in a four-way deal that would have had him
going to Cleveland. The Celtics would have ended up with Mashburn
and Vitaly Potapenko, a pretty good match, given Boston's trouble
in the middle. Mash is a proven scorer and Potapenko is the full
slab . . . Speaking of slabs, Stanley Roberts showed up in Greece
two weeks ago expecting to sign a contract. Instead, his weight,
conservatively listed at 330, was too much and he was sent back
home, reportedly with sciatica. Dicky Simpkins, of the team
formerly known as the Chicago Bulls (they became Vancouver East in
a hurry, didn't they), also is exploring Greece . . . The Bulls'
official network the last eight years, NBC, dropped them like a
radioactive dish. Chicago will make no appearances on NBC this
season, just another reminder that while the league may be
interested in rebuilding the ``team'' concept, television wants
entertainers and personalities. Now, if Dennis Rodman ends up back
there . . . Nah, just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Knight life
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt among those who had even a casual contact with
the Celtics last year that Travis Knight was miserable. But Knight
took the high road last week when asked about it. ``It was hard,''
he said. ``The whole experience was hard. But I knew what I was
getting into. I asked about (Pitino). I don't think I got into
something I wasn't prepared for.'' Knight also said he thought
Pitino improved his work habits and he wasn't bothered by the
coach's intensity or yelling. ``I learned to adjust and live with
it,'' he said. ``I learned a lot. I really did. And we made some
great strides.'' However, in an interview with the Hartford Courant
at the end of last season, Knight said, ``I sold myself to the
Devil. For money.'' He also added, ``With coach (Jim) Calhoun, I
knew he cared about me as a person, not just a basketball player.
Even though he would yell, I always knew where I stood with him.
Maybe I knew coach Calhoun better. Maybe that's why (Pitino's
yelling) doesn't bother the Kentucky guys. He yells at them and
they're fine the next day. It's a fine line between motivation and
insult. A very fine line.'' Asked about those comments, Knight said
he'd prefer not to discuss them . . . Michael Stewart's decision to
sign with Toronto also was about the money. (Cliff Robinson
basically did the same thing last year with the Suns and apparently
has a long-term deal waiting for him.) The Raptors will have plenty
of cap room this summer and can re-sign Stewart for more than the
capped-out Celtics could offer. What's more interesting is the way
Stewart was cast aside by the Kings for Vlade Divac. That means
either the Kings are just being the Kings or they feel Stewart is
limited and the soon-to-be 31-year-old Divac is a better fit. As it
stands, the Kings have a front line of Divac, Chris Webber (who
skipped the first day of camp but then showed up), Corliss
Williamson (re-signed for one year at $500,000), and promising
newcomer Predrag Stojakovic, who can float between small forward
and big guard . . . The Knight-Battie deal was historic in that the
Celtics and Lakers, the two most successful franchises in league
history, almost never do business with one another. Using both
teams' media guides as sources, it looks as if the Knight-Battie
trade is only the second between the clubs since 1960, when the
Lakers moved to LA. The other came on Dec. 27, 1977, when Boston
sent Charlie Scott to the Lakers for Don Chaney, Kermit Washington,
and a first-round pick in 1978. That first-round pick turned out to
be No. 8 overall and was huge in that it gave Red Auerbach a
cushion to ``risk'' the No. 6 pick on a junior-eligible then
playing at Indiana State. Need we say more? Oh, yes, and the eighth
pick was expended on Freeman Williams, who never played for the
Celtics. He was sent to San Diego in the infamous franchise swap of
1978 between Irv Levin and John Y. Brown.

GRANT'S APPEAL: HE'S UNLIKE MIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Grant knows what he is. In the eyes of many, he is the
anti-Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is not only the leading prospect in the heavyweight
division at the moment but is also a soft-spoken, self-effacing,
religious knockout artist who seems the polar opposite of the
angry, violent, often foul-mouthed Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Tyson is Grant is not _ except a punisher of
opponents _ and this has created a groundswell of interest in his
future, a future that had been on hold until Saturday night when he
takes on a former sparring partner named Ahmad Abdin on HBO's
``Boxing After Dark'' after a five-month layoff resulting from a
battle with hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Grant (28-0, 20 KOs) had not been in the ring since he
dismantled Obed Sullivan last May 30 in nine rounds, yet interest
in him has continued to grow for an assortment of reasons. First,
he is a massive man who looks more like a tight end or a power
forward than a heavyweight boxer. Second, he can do great damage
with either hand and frequently does. Third, he is trained by Don
Turner, the man who was in Evander Holyfield's corner the two times
he dominated Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But a different reason may be the most important one: simply,
that he is not Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I accept that role, I live it,'' Grant said.
``That's who I am. I'm about being straight up, a stand-up guy. I'm
not hard to figure out. I'm clean-living, humble, teachable, and
looking to prevail. You won't see me involved with crookedness,
wrongdoing, unrighteousness. What I want to generate is to give
people some hope. I feel no pressure from that. I'm just living who
I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm one of the guys who can help market the heavyweight
division more. I'm looking to do for it like Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire did for baseball. But I didn't do this to try and impress
anyone. God has a plan for me. I don't know what it is, but it's in
the making.''
</P>
<P>
   What Turner and many others in boxing believe is that the plan
is for Grant to become heavyweight champion sooner rather than
later. With his size, athleticism, and power, they see someone who
could be champion for years, but to do that he must get by
Holyfield, his stablemate, role model, and the World Boxing
Association-International Boxing Federation champion.
</P>
<P>
   If that is a requirement for stardom, Michael Grant says he'll
just wait until later, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are not interested in fighting each other,'' Grant
said. ``Evander doesn't want to fight me and I don't want to fight
him. People are willing to throw money in my face but money can't
overcome a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander is a well-respected guy. When I was coming up I looked
at him and how he lived his life professionally and how he
respected the game. There's a great deal of respect there when
we're around each other. So that fight will never happen. As long
as I've got control of it, it won't happen. He's pretty much said
he's going to retire from boxing anyway and I'm not in a big rush
for this thing. I have youth on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   In growing numbers, he also has fans on his side, a fact that
could turn a future date with Tyson into a pay-per-view
extravaganza. It would be a fight that could sell on many levels.
It would be size vs. power, youth vs. age, inexperience vs.
experience and, yes, good vs. evil.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a promoter's dream if Grant continues to grow as a
draw as well as a contender and Tyson gets back some of the allure
he's lost, even in the eyes of a fellow fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pay any attention to it,'' Grant said of Tyson's
return against Frans Botha last weekend. ``I didn't watch the
fight. I've accepted he's a man looking to get back into the
business. He's drawing, but who is he drawing? I don't look at him
as a fighter no more. I look at him as an entertainer.''
</P>
<P>
   And the boxing world looks at Grant as a savior. It is he who is
supposed to pick up the torch Holyfield now holds and run with it.
He is the future, as surely as Holyfield is the present and Tyson
was the past.
</P>
<P>
   That can be a withering kind of pressure, but Grant seems not to
have noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only pressure if I let it be,'' Grant said. ``Boxing is
about hard work and having good people around you. I have that so I
don't worry about the pressure. When the fight comes, you've
prepared yourself for war in the time of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a time Michael Grant enjoys best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   Although Showtime was claiming it got 750,000 pay-per-view buys
at $49.95 for the Tyson-Botha fight, industry insiders claim the
number was closer to 650,000, which would be a financial disaster.
That may explain why the cable network had a national conference
call set up with Tyson's new trainer, Tommy Brooks, less than a
week after the fight. During it, Brooks conceded, ``I was a little
worried the first couple of rounds. He was the Mike Tyson who came
out and fought Evander Holyfield, not the Mike Tyson that I had
worked with the last couple of months.'' Brooks went on to say
Tyson readjusted in the fight and began using his jab. If he did,
it must have been to jab the referee. Brooks added that Tyson still
``has to re-instill the confidence in himself and his ability. I
don't think Tyson realizes how hard he hits. He just taps me and it
hurts through and through. Once he realizes the power he has and
reestablishes the confidence in putting his punches together,
you'll see a difference. Everything depends on Tyson. I can talk to
the guy until I'm blue in the face. I just show him what to do and
how to do it. It's all on him. The fighter makes the trainer.'' . .
. The first opportunity to see the difference after one fight will
come April 24, with Axel Schulz still the most likely victim. But
several other names were added to the Tyson Sweepstakes last week,
including Shannon Briggs, Vaughn Bean, and, of all people, Razor
Ruddock. Ruddock continued his comeback with a win last week over
club fighter Tony LaRosa in Marksville, La., and is now 3-0 since
returning to boxing last year under the direction of promoter Mike
Acri . . . Asked to grade Botha's performance, Brooks said, ``I
give Botha an A for effort and an F for getting hit.'' . . . Here's
another assessment of  &UR; today &LR; 's Tyson. ``Once you get past four
rounds, Mike Tyson is done,'' said former pound-for-pound champion
Pernell Whitaker, a longtime friend of Holyfield who is also
trained by Brooks. ``He's not Mike Tyson no more. He's so frantic.
He's set on two or three rounds. He can't crack the code. But Tyson
is the Eighth Wonder of the World. The kid done been knocked out
twice and still gets $25 million a fight. If you love watching
knockouts, you love Mike Tyson.'' . . . Although Briggs's decision
to pull out of a March 6 fight with Lou Savarese caused HBO
problems, it apparently did not cost Savarese a payday. He is
likely to fight Lance Whitaker that night on the undercard of
Olympic gold medalist David Reid's first title shot, a challenge of
154-pound champion Laurent Boudouani. Those scheduling changes also
resulted in HBO's decision to televise World Boxing Council
lightweight champion Cesar Bazan's (34-2-1, 23 KOs) rematch with
the man he took the title from, Stevie Johnston (25-1, 14 KOs),
Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Here's Holyfield's view of Tyson: ``Tyson looked like Tyson. I
wasn't surprised by the result, but he looked the same to me. Botha
refused to back down and that was the key. He had courage to stand
in there. Anybody has a chance to win if they have courage.''. . .
You may read from time to time that the George Foreman-Larry Holmes
fight has been rescheduled for late March at the Astrodome. Don't
believe it. Promoter/con man Roger Leavitt says he will raise the
$9 million he owes Foreman and the $3.6 million he owes Holmes by
then. Sure he will. If he robs a bank. Foreman has said the fight
is off, and until he says otherwise, the fight is off. Thankfully,
I might add . . . Scott Woodwirth, Terry Norris's manager, says
Norris is officially retired after losing a title shot to Boudouani
recently. Norris's balance is gone and he is completely shot, but
after losing to Dana Rosenblatt, he and his father demanded one
more fight. They were the only dissenting votes among those
privately urging him to retire. The father stopped the Boudouani
fight. Woodwirth said, ``I think that's how it had to end for
Terry. Now there's no dissent.'' . . . IBF middleweight champion
Bernard Hopkins is still smarting from the way his first fight with
No. 1 challenger Robert Allen ended. Allen (22-2, 18 KOs) was
clutching and grabbing him for four rounds, and when the two
refused to break, referee Mills Lane pushed them so hard that
Hopkins fell out of the ring and injured his ankle. The fight was
declared a no contest and will be decided Feb. 6 in Washington.
Hopkins (34-2-1, 26 KOs) promised, ``This won't be no encore of
WrestleMania.'' He will be making his ninth title defense . . .
Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is leading a fight to reform boxing,
told the National Association of Attorneys General at a hearing on
boxing reform in New York last week, ``Many aspects of the
professional boxing industry are far less admirable than the
courage and sportsmanship that most boxers bring into the ring . .
. Business practices which would be stricken as exploitative and
indefensible restraints of trade in any other sport are considered
standard operating procedure in boxing . . . The active and
sustained involvement of state attorneys general will help reform
boxing's unacceptable status quo.''

   Fast-rising New Bedford junior featherweight Jason Pires defends
his US Boxing Association junior featherweight title Friday in Bay
St. Louis, Miss., vs. Arturo Estrada. Pires (13-0) is ranked eighth
in the world by the IBF as he enters the rematch with Estrada, whom
he unanimously defeated in their first confrontation. The fight
will be shown delayed on Fox New England . . . Rosenblatt (33-1)
also fights Super Bowl weekend, at Foxwoods vs. tough Aaron Davis
(45-6) . . . A week ago, former World Boxing Organization super
middleweight champion Steve Collins held a press conference in
London to announce an April 17 comeback fight against Roy Jones Jr.
That was news to Jones and to HBO. Although there have been
discussions, no deal has been struck, and no negotiations either
with Jones's promoter, Murad Muhammad, or HBO have begun . . . Word
is Chelsea heavyweight John Ruiz will fight Canadian champion Shane
Sutcliffe March 13 on the Holyfield-Lennox Lewis undercard.
Sutcliffe is also scheduled to fight 45-year-old Trevor Berbick
Feb. 3 in Montreal for the Canadian heavyweight title. Things must
be kind of slow in Canadian gyms these days.

A CASE OF OLYMPIC ROYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The best job in the world, International
Olympic Committee vice president Richard Pound is fond of saying,
is to be a hotel chambermaid after the Lords of the Rings have left
town.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci handbags, silk scarves, cut-glass ornaments, framed
watercolors, coffee-table books, boxes of chocolates, bottles of
vintage wine, overflowing fruit baskets _ anything the IOC members
can't crate up or carry with them _ get left in their rooms for the
cleanup crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Birmingham (where the vote for the 1998 Winter Games site
was held), there was a gift in our room every day,'' says Robert
Helmick, an Iowa attorney and former US member of the IOC. ``The
IOC opened up a parcel-post office so the members could pack them
up and send them home.''
</P>
<P>
   What many of the members took with them from other meetings _
mink coats, diamond brooches, personal computers, VCRs _ was part
of a culture of excess and access that has led to the worst scandal
in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   That culture evolved over the the last two decades from a
cornucopia of lavish banquets and expensive mementos to
prostitutes, resort vacations, shopping sprees for IOC members'
wives, jobs and tuition payments for their children, medical care
(including cosmetic surgery), sweetheart land deals, and cash
payoffs up to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has been a profound embarrassment to the august IOC,
which has always insisted that its 115 members are above
corruption. Each one takes an oath promising to ``keep myself free
from any political or commercial influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet 16 of them have been accused of taking payoffs and gifts
worth nearly $800,000 from the Salt Lake City organizers before and
after the Utah capital was awarded the 2002 Winter Games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases that are just unacceptable, brutal corruption
where simply money was asked for,'' Jacques Rogge of Belgium, a
member of the IOC's special inquiry panel, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two members, Finland's Pirjo Haeggman and Libya's Bashir Mohamed
Attarabulsi, stepped down last week and the IOC's executive board
is expected to demand the resignation of at least seven more and as
many as a dozen after it meets Sunday at the lakeside Chateau de
Vidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC will act very decisively to make sure all of its
members adhere strictly to the rules and to the oath they all swore
to,'' board member Kevan Gosper of Australia said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has also promised to reform the bidding process, banning
individual members from visiting candidate cities and possibly
having its 11-member board, and not the full body, choose future
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system we have today is not working,'' conceded Juan
Antonio Samaranch, who has been the IOC's president since 1980 and
the chief architect, both for better and worse, of the modern
Olympics. ``We have to change the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater challenge will be to change the lavish culture of
entitlement that has helped create the most shameful chapter in the
IOC's 105 years. It is a culture of first-class air travel and
five-star hotels and chauffeured limousines, the culture of a
self-elected, self-perpetuating body that answers to nobody but
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC not only decides which countries (200 as of June)
compete in the Games, it decides which countries are countries. The
IOC did not allow East Germany to compete on its own until 1968 and
let Taiwan compete as China until 1980. Even after the Soviet Union
broke apart, the IOC kept it together as the Unified Team for the
1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis posted ``Dogs and Jews not allowed'' signs
outside stadium restrooms at the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin, the
IOC told Adolf Hitler to have them taken down. ``When the Olympic
flag rises, this is no longer Germany,'' Hitler was informed. ``It
is Olympia, and we are masters there.'' Hitler complied.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC members are not delegates ``from'' countries but
delegates ``to'' countries. They serve until they reach 80 years
old and those elected before 1966 are members for life. Though the
membership has expanded and diversified dramatically over the last
two decades, the IOC still has a healthy sprinkling of the royalty
that decades ago got its members labeled the ``Lords of the
Rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Samaranch, a Spanish marquis, the roster includes
Princess Anne of Great Britain, Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia,
Prince Albert of Monaco, Princess Nora of Liechtenstein, the Duke
of Luxembourg, Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, and Sheik
Al-Sabah of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the Frenchman who revived the
Olympics more than a century ago, stocked the IOC with dukes and
barons and princes because he wanted the members to be above
political and financial influence. But after the IOC was criticized
during the 1970s as an exclusive club for rich, elderly, white,
European men with one foot in the 19th century, Samaranch moved to
expand and diversify the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two of the members now are from Asia, 20 from Africa, 14
from Latin America. Nearly a dozen are women. Two of the four vice
presidents (Keba Mbaye of Senegal and Anita DeFrantz of the US) are
black and two of the board members (Chiharu Igaya of Japan and Kim
Un-Yong of South Korea) are Asian.
</P>
<P>
   But as the IOC has broadened itself, it has also broadened the
financial and philosophical range of its members. Many are now
middle-class and many come from countries where a quid pro quo, if
not an outright bribe, is considered a normal part of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done nothing wrong,'' IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo told French radio earlier this month. Ganga,
who allegedly took $50,000 in cash from Salt Lake, made another
$60,000 on a land deal and also accepted free medical care for
himself and his mother. ``I will not become rich because I voted
for Salt Lake City. That is why I am so serene.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, bribery was a non-issue with the IOC, both
because its members paid their own way to meetings and events and
because nobody was bribing. After Montreal lost a billion dollars
on the 1976 Summer Games, which were marred by an African walkout
before the opening ceremonies, the Olympics were considered
radioactive. Los Angeles, which had most of the facilities already
in place, was the only bidder for the 1984 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   But when Los Angeles turned a $215 million profit despite a
Soviet-bloc boycott, the Games quickly became a hot property.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1992 Olympics went up for bid in 1986, six cities were
clamoring for the Summer Games and seven for the Winter, and the
culture of excess began in earnest. IOC members were entertained at
lavish receptions, treated to free trips and expensive gifts, and
even provided with call girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had these new members and simultaneously all this money,''
says Helmick.
</P>
<P>
   Before Denver landed the 1976 Winter Games, which it later
conceded to Innsbruck over environmental issues, it handed out
paperweights to IOC voters. But by 1986, Barcelona was spending an
estimated $7 million, much of it pampering IOC members, to outbid
Paris for the 1992 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began with Barcelona and Paris,'' says Helmick. ``It was
taken to a new height with Atlanta (in 1996) and Nagano (in
1998).''
</P>
<P>
   During the bidding for the 1996 Summer Games, Athens fed IOC
members a lavish banquet at the foot of the Acropolis and took them
on tours of the Greek isles. Atlanta treated members to rounds of
golf at Augusta and even provided a pet bulldog to the Cuban member
who'd been enthralled with the University of Georgia mascot.
Melbourne agreed to let the daughter of an IOC member play a solo
with its symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, which couldn't match Salt Lake's overall bid package for
the 1998 Winter Games, spent $22,000 in ``negotiation fees'' on
each of the five dozen IOC members who visited the Japanese city,
including trips to hot springs resorts and helicopter tours. ``We
were handing out salt water taffy,'' said a Salt Lake bid official,
after Nagano had prevailed by four votes. ``They were handing out
Toyotas.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Nagano handed out is unknown. Its organizing
committee burned the records in 1992, six years before the games.
</P>
<P>
   The next time, Salt Lake City apparently handed out whatever it
took to whoever was asking. ``They meticulously played by the rules
the first time,'' says Helmick. ``When they lost to Nagano, they
became discouraged and began playing by the unwritten rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwritten rules involved five-figure payoffs, often arranged
by middlemen who promised blocs of votes, usually from Africa.
``There had always been rumors of payoffs, but it was far more
subtle,'' says Helmick. ``You let people know what you desired and
things would be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1991, when the '98 Games were awarded, the requests were
direct, brazen and specific. After Salt Lake complained to the IOC
about middlemen and nothing was done, the Utahns played the bidding
game as they understood it.
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, did Sydney. The night before Sydney edged
Beijing by two votes for the 2000 Games, John Coates, head of
Australia's Olympic committee offered $35,000 apiece to IOC members
from Kenya and Uganda for sports development in their countries,
contingent on Sydney winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is entitled to work right up until the last minute,
and sometimes a result comes in the last minute, just like a result
comes in the last meters of a race,'' Gosper said Saturday. ``But
I'm not saying that anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the IOC executive board will propose changes to a
bidding process that escalated from paperweights to payoffs in
three decades. More than likely, members say, it will ban
individual members from visiting candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of IOC members never traveled,'' says DeFrantz. ``A lot
of them didn't like having host cities visit them. It was an
imposition. I think it will be easier if we just say, `none of the
above.' ''

AN INCENTIVE OR PAYOFF? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Australia's senior International Olympic
Committee member Saturday defended an apparent payoff by the Sydney
organizers seven years ago as a proper ``incentive scheme'' to help
the city land the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual in any bid process for encouragements,
incentives, to be part of the bid as long as they are out in the
open,'' said Kevan Gosper, adding that he would ask his colleagues
on the IOC's executive board Sunday to reaffirm their support for
both Sydney and Salt Lake City, the 2002 Winter Games site that is
at the center of the widening bribery scandal. ``I'm comfortable
with this behavior, but the executive board may want to discuss it
further on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, which had promised a ``clean, green'' Games, delivered
the latest blow to the embattled Olympic movement Friday when the
head of Australia's Olympic committee revealed that he had offered
to pay IOC members from Kenya and Uganda $35,000 apiece for sports
development in their countries if Sydney won the bid. Sydney
defeated Beijing by two votes the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned that night before the vote,'' committee
chief John Coates told reporters in Sydney Saturday. ``I just felt
an unease, I knew these guys, and I just didn't think the next day
I was going to be able to count on them to vote for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, which had promised to spend $37 million to help
countries bring athletes and equipment to the Games, said it was
merely trying to match inducements by Beijing and Manchester,
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw our votes being eaten away,'' Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gosper originally said that the payments might cause
Sydney to lose the Games, he maintained Saturday that the maneuver
had been public knowledge at the time and there was nothing
sinister about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the facts I have, I have no reason to believe that was
bribery,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC's special inquiry panel Saturday grilled six
of the 13 members who allegedly took nearly $800,000 in payoffs and
gifts from the Salt Lake City organizers before and after the Utah
capital landed the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC would not reveal their names, citing due process,
Lamine Keita of Mali was seen entering the committee's barricaded
headquarters at the lakeside Chateau de Vidy and David Sikhulumi
Sibandze of Swaziland reportedly was in town. Keita allegedly was
provided with college tuition assistance by Salt Lake; Sibandze's
son allegedly received a job with the city's development office.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry panel, chaired by IOC vice president Richard Pound
of Canada, worked into the night Saturday to finish its report. The
11-member executive board, which includes five members of the
panel, is expected to demand at least seven resignations Sunday.
Pirjo Haeggman of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya
stepped down last week.

SION, TURIN SCORE WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The Swiss resort of Sion and the Italian
city of Turin, as expected, emerged as the front-runners for the
2006 Winter Games Saturday when the International Olympic
Committee's site-evaluation commission made its detailed report
here.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commission pointedly avoided ranking the six
candidate cities, Sion and Turin clearly received the best
technical grades for aspects ranging from venues to technology to
transportation to accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Helsinki (Finland) and Klagenfurt (Austria) face serious
barriers because they are proposing joint bids involving other
countries. Helsinki is paired with Lillehammer (Norway), which
hosted the 1994 Games. Klagenfurt is bidding with nearby towns from
Italy and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is interesting, but we have to deal with different
languages, different legal aspects,'' said IOC member Chiharu Igaya
of Japan, chair of the commission, which includes US Olympic
Committee vice president Paul George, a Wellesley attorney. ``This
is a big challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakopane (Poland) and Poprad-Tatry (Slovakia) are considered
long shots.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC, in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal,
bans its members from visiting the bid cities before the June vote,
Sion would have a decided advantage, since it bid for the 2002
Games and is a familiar site. Turin is a first-time candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the members cannot come we will have to use another kind of
communication,'' shrugged Turin committee president Evelina
Christillin. ``We will use the art of arrangiarsi (making impromptu
arrangements). We Italians are masters of arrangiarsi.''
</P>
<P>
   What might have been
</P>
<P>
   Had the executive board chosen the site, odds are Beijing would
have landed the 2000 Games instead of Sydney, says Phil Coles, one
of Australia's three IOC members. ``I know of three or four of the
executive board before the decision was made who were committed to
China,'' said Coles, ``so if the decision were left to them, my
guess is that Sydney would not have won it.'' As it was, Sydney won
by only two votes (45-43) after IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch made it plain he favored Beijing. Had the board done the
choosing for the 1998 Winter Games, Salt Lake City (which had the
best technical package), also might have won instead of Nagano . .
. Salt Lake City isn't the only Olympic site with headaches.
Sydney, which is spending $3.7 billion on the 2000 Summer Games,
will be billing Australian taxpayers an extra $441 million to make
up a revenue shortfall that may exceed $1 billion. Which is one
reason why Sydney is hoping that sponsors don't start bailing out
in the wake of the IOC bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Americans on track
</P>
<P>
   Decent showing by the US long-track speedskaters, who earned
five spots for next month's world all-around championships in
Norway at the recent regional qualifier against the Canadians.
Besides Jennifer Rodriguez, the former in-liner from Miami who won
all four races, the Americans will send Sarah Shapiro, Catherine
Raney, KC Boutiette, and Derek Parra. Rodriguez also will go to
next month's world sprint championships in Calgary, along with
Christine Witty, Becky Sundstrom, Amy Sannes, and Casey
FitzRandolph . . . Bad break for the US bobsledders, who lost top
pusher Paul Wise for the rest of the season with fractured
vertebrae. The Yanks, who missed an Olympic medal by .02 seconds at
Nagano, haven't made a World Cup podium since November . . . Rough
winter for Somerville luger Erin Warren, who failed to qualify for
the US team for next weekend's world championships in Germany after
posting the top women's finish at the Olympics. Warren, who set a
track record on the Salt Lake run last fall, never came out of her
early-season slump. The Americans announced a trim initial roster
(Adam Heidt and the doubles teams of Chris Thorpe-Gordy Sheer, Mark
Grimmette-Brian Martin, and Christian Niccum-Matt McClain), but
could add up to three women (including Westborough's Ashley Hayden)
and another man Monday . . . As expected, the rebuilding US
biathlon team is taking its lumps on the World Cup circuit.
Promising showing, though, by 21-year-old Rachel Steer, who placed
26th in the sprint at Ruhpolding . . . Half a dozen athletes from
New England schools grace the barebones US roster for the biennial
World University Games now under way in Slovakia _ Alpine skiers
J.J. Hanley (Williams), Brad Nichol (Williams), and Wendy Scipione
(UVM); biathlete Clarissa Werre (Dartmouth); and short-track
speedskaters Tracy Northup (Harvard) and Chris Needham
(Northeastern). Also on the squad are New England natives Elizabeth
Sherry (New London, N.H., University of Utah, Alpine skiing), Eric
Tremble (South Hero, Vt., St. Lawrence, biathlon), and Sarah Lang
(Arlington, University of Calgary, short-track). The Americans, who
have been downscaling their presence in the WUGs in recent years,
are sending only 26 athletes in three of the nine sports.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Stanford
</P>
<P>
   Looks like Stanford's twice-thwarted bid for the world outdoor
track and field championships could be delayed another decade.
After this summer's meet in Seville and the 2001 event in Edmonton,
the IAAF is considering a package deal that would award the
championships to Paris and London (in either order) in 2003 and
2005, Tokyo in 2007, and Berlin in 2009. 2011, anyone? . . . Why
won't Mary Decker Slaney be showing up for her IAAF arbitration
hearing in Monte Carlo this week? Because USA Track &AMP; Field has
already cleared her of the testosterone doping charge from the 1996
Olympic trials and Slaney figures the beef is between the
international federation and the USATF . . . The Lords of the Rings
may have banned androstenedione, Mark McGwire's pump-up steroidal
supplement, but they have no beef with creatine. ``Creatine is
food,'' declared Prince Alexandre de Merode, the IOC's medical
chairman. ``You can't prevent people from eating food.'' Though
creatine's long-term effects are unclear, superdoses of the amino
acid protein can cause cramping and dehydration. ``You can get ill
if you take too much creatine,'' shrugs de Merode. ``But if a
person stuffs himself with 30 eggs or a kilo of foie gras, he'll
damage his liver, too.'' . . . Eleven members of last year's World
Cup team (including half a dozen Olympians) have made the US
women's field hockey squad that will be trying to qualify for
Sydney this summer. Top veterans are 32-year-old Tracey Fuchs,
Kelli James, Antoinette Lucas, and Kris Fillat, who have nearly 500
caps among them. New head coach will be Tracey Belbin, who played
in two Olympics for Australia and won gold in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Come again?
</P>
<P>
   No more visual sightings to determine false starts in Olympic
sailing. The Swatch people will use the Differential Global
Positioning System in Sydney to tell whether boats cross the line
early. That means instant recalls and shorter delays . . . It's not
enough that triathlon and trampolining have been added to the
bulging Olympic program for 2000. Athens wants fin swimming (using
32-inch wide rubber-and-fiberglass monofins) and water skiing on
the 2004 program. The Greeks are also considering karate and
billiards (yes, as in pool). The IOC will decide in June.

WALKER'S STYLE IN SERIOUS NEED OF WIGGLE ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antoine Walker's employers just gave him a pay raise, effective
next year. That means that when Walker looks at his direct-deposit
slips in 2000, he will see about $7 million more than he saw in
1999. I do not claim to be a mathematician, but I'd say that's a
fair bump, wouldn't you? (Note to the people who operate this
newspaper: Call me anytime this morning to begin negotiations on
such a raise.)
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, the people who pay Walker, now want him to become
more serious. They want him to be a leader. They don't want him
screaming in the faces of officials, as he did to Derrick Stafford,
Billy Oakes, Eddie F. Rush, and others (although I fully support
screaming in the face of Steve Javie). And if he must scream, the
Celtics want Walker to know whom he is screaming at. He has been
known to say, ``Hey, Ref,'' when talking to officials. As you can
imagine, they don't like that. If Walker starts treating them
better, they will do the same with him. It's very simple.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's contract may change his court style. He may become more
focused and mature. He may make three-quarters of his free throws
and nearly half of his field goals. But I hope the money doesn't
change everything about his court demeanor. I hope the money
doesn't seep through his veins so much that he no longer allows his
body to quake like San Francisco, circa 1906, after a nice play.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. It's out. I can't stay underground any longer.
Back up. Clear the parquet. Call Don Cornelius. I'm a one-man
``Soul Train'' dance line. Give me some wiggle room because, well,
I dig the Walker Wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   If you watch the Celtics, chances are that you have debated the
necessity of The Wiggle. You know how some people ask you where you
live as a way to find out something about you? People do the same
thing with The Wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who like it supposedly don't love the game. We are
the reason basketball is now full of gimmicks, dunkers who can't
shoot, and 3-point shooters who can't dribble. We pro-Wigglers do
not understand that there was once a time in pro basketball when
players didn't dunk ferociously and creatively on breakaways
because they didn't want to appear to be showing up an opponent. We
obviously haven't seen the footage of Wilt Chamberlain, a giant of
his era, flipping in finger rolls when he could have easily been
throwing down self-important dunks.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that. But I don't know how anyone could be
anti-Wiggle. To be against the Wiggle is a little hypocritical, no?
There are fans who complain endlessly about pro sports being ruled
by pulseless automatons. There are stories about athletes who don't
love what they do, complaints about athletic mercenaries putting in
minimal effort before cashing their checks. So when someone cares
about the sport and wants to express himself after dunking on Kevin
Garnett, there's something wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that you have to love basketball to Wiggle because
it is a dance that requires plenty of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I have to admit that one of my fascinations with
Walker's ridiculous dance is that, simply, I don't know how to do
it. Yes, I tried. To do it the right way, it seems that you have to
have adjustable shoulders and hydraulic hips.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason I love it: It's an original, family composition.
We all watched Dan Duquette pushing his palms skyward when the Red
Sox secured a wild-card spot last fall. They call that dance
Raising the Roof. Everyone can do that. Now, try to imagine The
Duke doing the Walker Wiggle. No chance. Even Chris Canty, the
notorious Patriots dancer who also pretends to be a cornerback,
cannot Wiggle. I am sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Walker may not be doing it correctly. That's because,
like a good big brother, he stole the dance from one of his
sisters. His family watches all of his games, so the Wiggle is an
unmistakable, nonverbal ``hello'' to them. I think it is much more
effective than the nonverbal hello Utah's Jeff Hornacek gives to
his children. While at the free throw line, Hornacek rubs his ears
before shooting. We all have our preferences, but I'd rather watch
someone dance than watch someone pick at their ears. But that's
just me.
</P>
<P>
   The Wiggle can definitely be irritating if it happens at your
expense. Michael Jordan was so upset with the Wiggling Walker in
October 1997 that he refused to shake his hand after the game. If
you care about the Celtics, you have to like that.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan became a focused mystic when he was on the court. Nothing
got to him. He talked trash to disrupt the people guarding him, but
when they tried to do it to him, it didn't work. But a wiggling
Antoine Walker upset him. That's good.
</P>
<P>
   There were also stories last year about Walker not being liked
by opposing players. That's only partially true: They don't like
him when he's on the court. Once again, I say that is good. Do you
want your star player talking about dinner reservations with
players on a team thumping you by 20 points? Or do you want him
doing everything he can to give his team an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   There were times last season when Walker's teammates would yell
from the bench, ``Give them The Wiggle, 'Toine.'' And away he would
go. Even Rick Pitino is a Wiggle fan (he can't do it, either).
</P>
<P>
   I could say more. But I have to go. Time to wiggle. I'm going to
get it this time.

HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BRUINS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what about the Bruins? What is their place on the totem pole
of New England sports franchises?
</P>
<P>
   Are they truly worshipped by a silent majority of devout fans,
recipients of weak coverage by a local media that cares not about
hockey? Or are they practitioners of a third-world sport, ranking a
consensus fourth in the minds of Greater Boston's sports fans?
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable measure of this. What is beyond dispute is
the fact that the Bruins have a young, exciting team on the rise
with the most colorful, quotable coach in town _ and yet they rank
fourth with television news directors and newspaper sports editors.
And when it comes to that growing beast that is sports talk radio,
the local pro hockey team does not even exist.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president Harry Sinden says, ``I did resent it for a long
time, but I don't anymore because it hasn't hurt us. The only thing
that's hurt us is our performance and our prices. The Bruins get
hurt if they don't have a decent team and if their prices are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be candid. Hockey people are hockey people, and
they don't care whether there's anything in the paper or not. They
come to the games.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right about that. Since rolling back their prices (some
seats by as much as $21) after the 1997-98 season, the Bruins have
already filled the New Garden 11 times in the first half of this
season. There were only four sellouts all last year, a season that
came on the heels of the team's worst campaign in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It can be said that Boston has a hockey culture like few other
American cities. You may not talk Bruins around the water cooler,
but chances are you've got someone in your neighborhood getting up
at 6 a.m. to drive a kid to hockey practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden says, ``I've seen no indication of a dropoff in the
fandom. You can't talk to one person that doesn't know another
person that's involved in hockey. You can't say that about any
other sport around here. Ask your neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Shaughnessy neighborhood, there's a former Yale hockey
player, a former Harvard women's player, and a large handful of
kids getting squired around in vans seeking ice at all hours. And
there's ubiquitous street hockey during vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Game on.
</P>
<P>
   But it's rare that anyone asks me about the Bruins. What's the
problem? Not enough scoring? Bad on television? Not enough star
power? Too many Russians? A snobbish media, ignoring the
blue-collar hockey fandom?
</P>
<P>
   ``We get plenty of coverage,'' says Sinden. ``We don't get the
guys that count in the columns. We take that as an indication that
you don't care, or you're afraid that you might not know how to
write about it. But in terms of coverage, you can read about the
Bruins every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always on the third page of the sports page. Now we're
on the fourth. I don't care if we're on the fourth. I just don't
want it to disappear. Just keep us on the fourth because we've been
there forever and it doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record state that Harry is not going around complaining
about coverage of his team. He's merely answering questions about
the issue. Like most hockey people, Harry looks you in the eye and
tells you what he thinks no matter how dumb or offensive the
question might be.
</P>
<P>
   And where does Harry think the Bruins would rank if we could
accurately measure the core constituency of the four Boston pro
teams (sorry, Revolution)?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we come right below the Red Sox,'' he says. ``I think
we would be second to the Red Sox without a doubt. It may not show
up in what you guys write. Because, what's the order of the day?
There's an ego involved in the media and if I were a writer, I'd be
the same way. I'd want to write about what's important to the
nation. Big-time news. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   And how to account for the Bruins' invisibility on WEEI? Why are
there no calls? Could it be that Bruins fans have lives? Are the
Bruins people actually working during the day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally ignored,'' says Harry. ``We don't get any
callers and we don't get any comments from the people on the air.
But we've survived in spite of all that. It's not good in terms of
exposure. But we don't go up or down based on how often there are
discussions about us on WEEI. We are what we are because of how we
play, and that's about it. If we end up with the best team in the
NHL, you can't get in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went into their All-Star break with a record of
20-16-7. They are probably bound for the playoffs. Last year they
played well enough to beat the Washington Capitals in the first
round, then watched the Capitals go all the way to the Stanley Cup
finals. They resume their schedule Tuesday night on Long Island.
They probably are closer to winning their next championship than
any other Boston sports team.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you're interested.

AN AGREEABLY TOUGH COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took someone like Chris Palmer to put Bob Kraft and Bill
Parcells on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Palmer's appointment Thursday as the
coach of the Cleveland Browns, both Kraft and Parcells gave ringing
endorsements when owner Al Lerner and club president Carmen Policy
inquired about the former Patriots quarterback coach. It's one of
the few things they've agreed on since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strong measure of the man that Palmer is someone both
Kraft and Parcells could endorse, because it means he can be a
coach's coach and an owner's coach. To a lesser degree, he is also
a players' coach, but Palmer understands that he is their coach,
not their friend, a point he made years ago after taking over the
struggling program at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first acts at BU, Palmer cut the captain of the
team, feeling his attitude was a barrier to progress. That night he
got a call from BU president John Silber that he felt certain was
going to be a demand to reinstate the player, which in turn meant
he wouldn't be the head coach for long.
</P>
<P>
   But to Palmer's surprise, Silber congratulated him for the stand
he took. Thus began a process of leadership that has led to his
being handed the reins of one of the NFL's most storied franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the interviews were done, Mr. Lerner and Carmen excused
themselves around 3:30 p.m. and said they had to talk,'' Palmer
recalled. ``They were gone about an hour. I felt like I was a
kicker and they were trying to ice me with three timeouts. I'm
sitting in a dining room. There are no books to read. I called my
wife three times. I'm finally thinking, `Come on, fellas. Either
you like me or you don't.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they came back and offered me the job, and I asked if
there was anyone I needed to call and thank. They said Bill
Parcells and Robert Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   When the week began, Palmer was a long shot in Cleveland because
Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick was the hot
candidate. But after the Vikings were eliminated from the playoffs,
negotiations hit a snag when Billick said he wanted to talk with
the Ravens before deciding where he would go.
</P>
<P>
   Word in Cleveland is that Billick expressed reservations about
taking over an expansion team with no players, reservations Policy
took exception to, particularly since the other team Billick wanted
to visit was the team formerly known as the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Later Policy would say that Billick ``missed his opportunity to
put his thumbprint, his very DNA, on history.''
</P>
<P>
   As this was going on Monday, Palmer was driving from
Jacksonville, Fla., to Mobile, Ala., with Jaguars defensive
coordinator Dick Jauron, whose name also has been mentioned for
several head coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had interviewed in Cleveland the previous week but still
felt Billick and 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci were the leading
candidates. He also had interviewed with the Ravens and had an
interview scheduled with the Kansas City Chiefs Tuesday when he got
a message to call Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut the meeting with Kansas City short because they wanted
me to meet Mr. Lerner on Wednesday,'' Palmer recalled. ``This was
the job I wanted most. It was the one that fit me and my
personality. I was in the outside lane at the start of the race,
but I made the turn well.''
</P>
<P>
   He made it after a lengthy grilling from Lerner at MBNA
headquarters outside Cleveland during which he was asked ``about 10
questions that hit me between the eyes.'' One was to name the 10
best coaches and the common denominator among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity with which he asked a question is second to
none,'' Palmer said. ``It's no b.s., answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did, because he has the presence of a head coach backed
by the track record of a winner, whether rebuilding small college
programs or building up powerful pro offenses like the one he ran
in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cleveland were to get a young quarterback, he could not be
in a better situation,'' said Jacksonville quarterback Mark
Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Browns take Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch or
Texas's Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams, their
new coach will run whatever offense suits its star. That has been
Palmer's specialty, in the USFL, where he directed an attack with
Doug Flutie and Herschel Walker in the same backfield, and the NFL.
That is what Policy and Lerner were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a strong influence on our offense,'' said Palmer.
``My philosophy is you run to win and throw to score. If Ricky
Williams is our guy, we'll load up and pound the ball. If we decide
on Tim Couch, who I haven't really even seen yet, we'll get him
some receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns already have the first building block of a solid
franchise. They have themselves a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came through the Bill Parcells School,'' Palmer told a
packed press conference Thursday. ``Bill Parcells makes you tough.
Every day he made me a better coach. But my personality is
different. I hope you can see that. Bill Belichick (another
Parcells assistant and the last man to coach the Browns) was his
guy. I'm my guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants proof of that need only spend a moment in
Palmer's office, because in it is a plaque with a quote from the
greatest coach in Browns history, Paul Brown himself: ``I'm going
to do it my way . . . and I know it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, a man who has moved his wife and family 11 times
in 27 years to pursue the football coach's life was given his
chance. Don't bet against him.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bob Kraft and Bill Parcells can agree on that.
</P>
<P>
   It's payback time
</P>
<P>
   Following a whirlwind trip home to Jacksonville to pick up some
laundry, Palmer joked that one of his five brothers told him their
wives were all calling each other saying they married the wrong
Palmer. That's because most of them are plumbers, and as of Sunday
Chris is a $1 million-a-year NFL head coach. But it wasn't always
that way. ``When Donna and I first got married, I was a coach and
she was an X-ray technician,'' said Palmer. ``We'd been dating for
six years and she made more money than me. I told her one reason I
married her was I couldn't afford to pay her back what I owed
her.'' . . . After witnessing the animosity in Jacksonville after
Kevin Gilbride left to become head coach of the Chargers and took
assistant Nick Nicolau with him, Palmer agreed not to infiltrate
the staffs of the Jaguars or Parcells's Jets. ``I never want to
leave a place and have hard feelings,'' Palmer said. ``I wasn't
told I'd be denied permission to interview anyone but they said
they wished I wouldn't do it. When it's your friends, you honor
that.'' . . . Baltimore's signing of Billick will only intensify a
natural rivalry between the new Browns and the old ones . . .
Billick will offer old friend and former Patriot quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh the offensive coordinator's job. Cavanaugh was last seen
coordinating the Bears' offense . . . Atlanta head coach Dan Reeves
knew exactly what he was doing last week when he talked openly
about his feelings of betrayal that led him to fire his former
offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, in Denver. Reeves believed
Shanahan violated his trust by repeating critical comments Reeves
made in staff meetings about John Elway to the Broncos'
quarterback. Shanahan denied that, and Elway said he was
``flabbergasted'' that Reeves would make such a charge on the eve
of their Super Bowl confrontation. But Reeves made a masterful
psychological move that Shanahan and Elway will have to deal with
all week. He has the high ground on this after being fired despite
taking the Broncos to three Super Bowls; many believe it was Elway
who submarined him, with Shanahan's assistance. ``You say things in
a coaches meeting as far as critiquing a player that you would
never say to a player,'' Reeves said. ``If John ever got any bad
feelings about something I said, it was never done publicly. It had
to be something coming from a staff meeting. Now, does that mean
Mike did it? I have no proof of it. Nothing. But I did what I felt
was best for our football team. It wasn't an easy decision because
I knew he was a great football coach. But I didn't think he had my
best interest at heart.'' So Reeves fired Shanahan and later
charged him with insubordination. ``It's totally untrue,'' Shanahan
said. ``When I was there, Dan never said a word about it. Dan
wanted to run the offense and he wanted complete control and he
really didn't want somebody with my type of personality around.''
You don't think Elway and Shanahan will be asked about this a few
thousand times, do you? Distractions? What distractions?
</P>
<P>
   Running a reverse
</P>
<P>
   Interesting turn of events that led Paul Boudreau to take over
as the Miami offensive line coach. Boudreau is made a sacrificial
lamb in New England because the running game is less than
overpowering but he's hired within days by a coach, Jimmy Johnson,
who wants nothing more than to be able to run the ball. Meanwhile,
Johnson fires Larry Beightol to make room for Boudreau, and who
tries to hire Beightol? New England. I could not make this up.
Beightol, however, feared that Patriot coach Pete Carroll could be
a lame duck, so he signed instead with new Packers coach Ray Rhodes
. . . Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had an unusual hour-and-40-minute
interview with five reporters from the Dallas Morning News last
week. Jones raised an interesting point when asked about his
insistence on being the club's general manager, a post he's
basically held for most of the 10 years he's owned the team. ``Hey,
we're in good shape,'' Jones said. ``The decisions are being made
on the same principles they were made over the last 10 years. I've
been very up-front from the first day I got here. The reason I own
the team is to manage the team. As long as I own this team, I'll be
running the football. I understand the criticism, and respect that.
But the question I have is, `How many years before you become a
football guy in the NFL?' Is it 20? Is it 10? Is it 15? When is
it?' I take a lot of input. It's wrong to think I'm sitting there
reading some football magazines and that's how we're making the
decisions with the Dallas Cowboys.'' Good point . . . In a league
supposedly trying hard to promote black assistants, nearly a third
of the head coaching jobs opened up this winter, and not one was
filled by a new black face. In fact, 25 of the last 26 head
coaching vacancies have been filled by white coaches. Some may try
to say it's progress that the Packers' job went to a familiar black
face, Rhodes, who was hired there after being fired in
Philadelphia; but five assistant coaches with little or no head
coaching experience and a sixth who was 8-14 at Oregon State were
all hired ahead of Art Shell, who won 60 percent of his games as
the Raiders' head coach, and longtime Packers offensive coordinator
Sherman Lewis. Lewis has to be particularly frustrated. At 58, he
has seen two of the quarterback coaches who worked under him,
Mariucci and this year Andy Reid, get head jobs ahead of him even
though he was running the Green Bay offense along with Mike
Holmgren. Apparently it's going to take a lot more than a library
of videotaped interviews on file at the NFL offices in New York to
create equal opportunity in the NFL. The only way it will really be
done is clear in Green Bay, which could have the first staff in NFL
history with three blacks on top. If it goes as planned, Rhodes
will have Emmitt Thomas as his defensive coordinator, as he was in
Philadelphia, and Lewis will continue to run the offense. Most of
the time, friends hire their friends in business. Every business.
Including the football business. So until black coaches get into
positions with hiring authority, it will be difficult for many of
their peers to get the opportunity they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Very hot tickets
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pardon the sisters working at the Francis Heights
Senior Center in Denver if they ask for a little divine
intervention on behalf of the Broncos in the Super Bowl. Last week,
a Denver city councilman donated two tickets to the game for the
center to raffle off as it tries to raise $150,000 to repair its
pool. The sisters were hoping to sell 3,000 raffle tickets in three
days, but they sold out in three hours. A businessman had his jet
diverted to Denver so he could buy 20 raffle tickets . . . Things
are heating up again on the expansion front, with one of the Los
Angeles bidders adding a deep-pocketed ally in billionaire Eli
Broud. He joined Ed Roski's effort to refurbish the LA Coliseum,
and they plan to pitch the league's Finance Committee with a $1.1
billion proposal _ $750 million for the expansion team and another
$350 million to modernize the Coliseum. That puts them at odds with
a group headed by Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood mogul, and a group
in Houston that already has its financing and stadium plan ready.
All three groups will make another presentation next Thursday to
the Finance Committee in Miami. LA is still the favorite of some
owners, but Houston is looking so solid financially that it may be
difficult to deny . . . Don't be surprised if new Patriot receivers
coach Ivan Fears and Terry Glenn turn out to be oil and water.
There could not be two more opposite personalities . . . If I were
running the Patriots personnel department, I would focus my
attention and checkbook on the following free agent linemen:
tackles Orlando Brown (Baltimore) and Earl Dotson and guard Adam
Timmerman. Timmerman and Dotson are both 300-plus pounders who have
started regularly in Green Bay. As for receivers, I'd turn my
interest to Antonio Freeman, who caught 84 passes for 1,424 yards
and 14 touchdowns this season and could end up being named the
Packers' franchise player, or Arizona's Rob Moore. Moore is one of
the best receivers in the NFL but is lesser-known than most. He has
a 45-inch vertical leap and had two 1,000-yard seasons before just
missing (982) this time . . . The Jets have already restructured
the deals of Curtis Martin and Kevin Mawae to create salary cap
room. That's where the work of Needham native Mike Tannenbaum, the
Jets' capologist, pays off quietly for Parcells . . . New England
isn't the only place with a tough home crowd. Apparently, during
the AFC Championship game in Denver last Sunday, a fan hit the
sister of New York receiver Wayne Chrebet in the face for wearing
Jets gear . . . If you're a businessman, you might be interested to
know that Fox TV expects to haul in $142 million in ad revenue from
its seven-hour pregame show and telecast of the Super Bowl. If
you're like the rest of us, you'll be more interested to know that
an estimated $4 billion will be bet on the game, only $85 million
of it going down legally . . . After popping off two weeks ago
about the Dolphins after the Broncos pummeled them, Denver tight
end Shannon Sharpe does not expect to be received with open arms in
South Florida. ``I don't really think I'll be getting very many
free meals,'' Sharpe said . . . Anyone interested in getting into a
bidding war for Super Bowl tickets on the internet can bid online
on more than 60 tickets by contacting WWW.tickets.com. You also can
bid by calling 1-800-TICKETS . . . The Tennessee Titans have
interviewed fired Patriots wide receiver coach Steve Walters.

NHL At The Break 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the NHL heads into its midseason All-Star break, much has
changed from the start of the season. The Stars are right where
they had hoped they would be, but a surge in Phoenix, a slump in
Detroit and a (Russian) Rocket launching in Florida have the rest
of the league looking quite different.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the season, here are a few of the key
stories to keep an eye on:
STARRY START
</P>
<P>
   Already, fans in North Texas are beginning to look at the Stars
as the new Cowboys _ and that's scary. While players and coaches
can try to play down the pressure, fans are making plans for a
Stanley Cup parade, and many so-called experts around the league
are penciling in the Stars as the heavy favorites to take the
silverware home in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it,'' center Mike Modano said. ``We know every team is
out to beat us on any given night. But, I think we like the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, talk is heating up that the Stars need to swing a deal
to get a physical, goal-scoring left winger to patch the final hole
in their lineup. Already, talk is heating up that Ed Belfour might
not be the goalie to take them there. Already, the expectations are
so great that a team that loses only nine of its first 43 games is
being asked to give more and do more.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a good sign, but fans can't hope to win the Cup in
January or March.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means, the team, the front office, the coaching
staff and the fans have to remember to be patient. The next five
months could be the greatest in the history of the franchise, but
that doesn't mean the Stars have to try to live them in the span of
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that really bothers me about all this is we're
taking winning a little too lightly here,'' center Brian Skrudland
said. ``This is a good team that should be having a lot of fun
enjoying what is a great season. We can't lose sight of that while
we're trying to get to someplace that we want to go.''
FLY IN THE OINTMENT
</P>
<P>
   If Stars fans are Cup-starved, consider the pressure on the
Philadelphia Flyers. This is a team that has thought it was ``this
close'' in January for the previous eight seasons, only to have it
all fall apart in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers didn't even wait that long last season, getting
dispatched by the Buffalo Sabres in the first round of the
playoffs. That forced several changes, including new goaltender
John Vanbiesbrouck, handing more power to new coach Roger Neilson
and a public challenge by general manager Bobby Clarke to superstar
center Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke told Lindros in the summer that if he wanted to be paid
like a $10 million superstar, he'd better start acting like it _
which Lindros promptly did.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke also has made deals almost monthly to find the right
chemistry, acquiring Mikael Renberg, Keith Jones, Daymond Langkow
and Stephen Leach since the start of the season and dealing Chris
Gratton, Trent Klatt, Mike Maneluk, Shjon Podein, Mike Sillinger
and Petr Svoboda.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the season, the Flyers have put together a
15-game unbeaten streak and lead the Eastern Conference with 58
points. Yet if Clarke doesn't win the Stanley Cup this season, he
could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of puts things into perspective, huh?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Yashin obviously was concerned with money. The second
overall pick in the 1992 draft was peeved that he wasn't getting as
much as Ottawa Senators teammate Alexandre Daigle, the
underachieving winger taken first overall in 1993. But what really
hacked Yashin off was the fact he believed management had no clue
what it was doing.
</P>
<P>
   So Yashin held out in 1995 and told his owners that he wanted to
be traded to a team that wasn't quite so stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Brash move? Maybe. But the Senators fired GM Randy Sexton,
replaced two coaches and signed Yashin up to a long-term deal.
Today, Yashin is the team captain, and the Senators could be the
ultimate dark horse in the run for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just have so much talent,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``They're fast, they play hard and they're well-coached.
That's a team to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have found great success
moving from the West to the East this season and picking up
West-slaying goaltender Curtis Joseph in the process. With Joseph
in net and new coach Pat Quinn stressing offensive play, the Leafs
are looking for home-ice advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the other surprises?
</P>
<P>
   How 'bout the Phoenix Coyotes finally settling differences and
coming together as a team. The final proof is a long way off for
the injury-prone Coyotes, but at least the first step has been
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres continue to excel with Dominik Hasek in net and
appear to be more than just a fluke. And the Carolina Hurricanes
and Florida Panthers both would like to try the role of spoiler for
the playoffs. And with the Panthers winning two games since
acquiring enigmatic superstar Pavel Bure, who knows what other
surprises await.
DIDN'T YOU USED TO BE...
</P>
<P>
   Two Stanley Cups might not be near big enough to hold all the
tears of frustration and fear that are being cried in Detroit
through the season's first half.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings are
foundering, posting a 23-20-3 record at the break. This after being
one of the best teams in the NHL for the past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling,'' winger Brendan Shanahan said. ``It's not
just one area, we're all struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings aren't as physical as they were last season, they have
holes in their defense and they aren't getting the balanced scoring
they did last season. And yet, they are feared as a team that can
still put things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the defending champs,'' Hitchcock said. ``You have to
knock them out if you want them to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche might fall down a little easier. The
Avalanche likewise have fallen from the ranks of the mighty and
have been joined by the Washington Capitals (at 16-23-4 the worst
ever performance after a Finals appearance last season), the
Chicago Blackhawks (their 13 wins are second fewest in the NHL) and
the Montreal Canadiens (in jeopardy of missing the playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe the entire Western Conference is the league's real
disappointment as only four of the 13 teams have records above
.500. But can he balance a checkbook? The record of the Pittsburgh
Penguins is about the same as it was last season at 20-14-7, so why
should Kevin Constantine get your vote as coach of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Penguins should be at the bottom of the NHL. Not
only did Pittsburgh lose versatile captain Ron Francis to free
agency, they also filed for bankruptcy. And all you have to do is
ask Stars fans how difficult it is to play well when your ownership
is falling apart to know exactly what Constantine has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Give Constantine the lead for the Jack Adams coach of the year
award, but not without some great competition. The challengers in
order: Pat Quinn with the Maple Leafs, Jacques Martin with the
Senators and Jim Schoenfeld with the Coyotes.
BETTER THAN GOD?
</P>
<P>
   He is referred to as ``God'' in his native Czech Republic after
almost single-handedly winning the Olympic hockey gold medal for
his country last year. And Hasek is even better this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, the only goalie in history to win two Hart Trophies as
the league's most valuable player, is on his way to his third
consecutive trophy. Even after a recent slump, Hasek still has a
1.86 goals-against average and a league-best save percentage of
.939. He has eight shutouts and could challenge the modern era
season shutout record of 15.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some who are unconvinced that Hasek is the best
player in the NHL, and the fight for his trophy might be more
intense than in the two previous seasons. The list of potential
thieves: center Lindros in Philadelphia, center Yashin in Ottawa
and goalie Curtis Joseph in Toronto.
ALL-NHL
</P>
<P>
   With the season half over, several players have made their mark.
So here's Mike Heika's NHL All-Stars at the All-Star break:
</P>
<P>
   Center: Eric Lindros, Flyers _ Took challenge from Clarke and
shoved it back in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing: John LeClair, Flyers _ His penchant for goal-scoring
is baffling.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing: Theo Fleury, Flames _ To have 47 points and be a
plus player on the Flames is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Defense: Chris Pronger, Blues _ Most ice time in the league, and
he does the most with it.
</P>
<P>
   Defense: Larry Murphy, Red Wings _ Maybe it's time to admit he
really is pretty good for an old man.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie: Dominik Hasek, Sabres _ No player can affect a game the
way he does.

 &HT;    Demonstrators expect controversial legislation will pass in
TexasBy Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ About 500 people chanting ``Life yes, abortion
no'' marched to the Capitol Saturday in support of a proposed Texas
law requiring doctors to tell parents before performing an abortion
on their minor daughters.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the marchers believe, the divisive legislation will
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, the time for change has come,'' Dick Weinhold,
president of the Texas Christian Coaltion and the rally's main
speaker, told the crowd of young and old, whites, blacks and
Hispanics, who cheered and waved signs reading ``Restore Parent
Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The marchers had carried red, blue and white balloons in their
march to the Capitol. Members of anti-abortion groups such as the
Greater Austin Right to Life and Texans United for Life, they were
supporting Senate Bill 30 and House Bill 623, which are similar to
a proposed parental notification law that failed to pass in the
Legislature's last session in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Majek, 41, an Austin member of the Knights of Columbus
whose officials led the marchers, said he thought the law had a
better chance of passage this year because of support from Gov.
George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Austinite Donna Oberg, 70, who was passing out donation
envelopes to help defray the costs of the rally, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just do our work and our praying,'' Oberg said, ``God
will take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law did not sound so worthy on the other side of
the abortion debate, which has raged nationwide since a U.S.
Supreme Court decision legalized abortions 26 years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't improve family communication,'' said Margot Clarke,
public affairs director for Planned Parenthood of Austin, which
refers women to some of the six Austin abortion clinics listed in
Southwestern Bell's Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means that teens delay care, or seek unsafe care, or
force communication in an abusive family situation, then it's
clearly not in the young person's interest,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Since most minors already involve their parents in abortion
decisions, Clarke said, and only those who have difficulties with
their parents would be affected, she wondered if the law's true
intent was to reduce the number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, marcher Paula Lundgaard, 39, a mother of four children
who recently moved to Austin from New Mexico, said she'd marched
against abortion for 20 years and would continue to march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like not to have a reason to do this,'' Lundgaard said.
</P>
<P>

Texas.

Houston squanders lead, shot at road win
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ Seemingly on the verge of a rarity, the Houston
Cougars reverted to their earlier form Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Said UH's William Stringfellow, ``We could have made history.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cougars lost their 20th consecutive Conference USA
road game, an 89-84 loss to Tulane, which wiped out a 17-point
first-half UH lead and made the plays down the stretch that UH
failed to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't keep playing like we had when we were building the
lead,'' said disappointed coach Clyde Drexler, who calmly analyzed
the 7-11 Cougars' sixth loss in eight conference games this season.
``I was proud of the way they played after a terrible game before
this, but once again, we just didn't do what it takes to win
consistently enough. It was a very big missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering that after they saw their 38-21 margin at
4:39 before halftime quickly go down the drain, the Cougars
regained a 75-74 lead with 3:18 remaining. But the Green Wave then
scored seven straight points, including Dylan Osean's 3-pointer,
then his 18-foot banker for an 81-75 lead with 1:43 to play. UH
missed three point-blank shots during that span, pulled within
81-78 on Gee Gervin's trey with 50 seconds left but never got
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Winless in a conference road game since a victory at SMU on Feb.
28, 1996, the last year of the Southwest Conference, the Cougars
should have been in good shape late in the first half. Tulane, with
15 turnovers before halftime, was throwing the ball into the stands
at times as UH went on a 15-1 run with 12 points off Green Wave
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had three or four straight turnovers, they cut into
the lead, and they came out the second half and hit shots while we
didn't play with the same kind of intensity,'' Drexler said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Osean hit a pair of 3s and Byron Mouton and Wade
Mason made one each, Tulane (3-4 in C-USA, 9-7 overall) had a 56-50
lead six minutes into the second half. Osean's second trey finished
a 22-7 burst after halftime and an improbable 35-12 run in 10
minutes spanning the first and second halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many offensive rebounds at the wrong time, too many
mistakes when there really wasn't that much pressure on the ball,''
Drexler said. ``I counted six missed layups in the last four
minutes, and in a game like this, that gets you beat. That was part
of our downfall today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin, the game's high scorer with 26 points, again forced
things at times but passed off for four straight baskets midway
through the second half when the Cougars regained the lead. Their
momentum didn't last, however, with Tulane shooting 58 percent
after halftime and 50 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't the same defensive intensity as in the first
half,'' said UH junior forward Kenny Younger (19 points, 10
rebounds, four steals).
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better than the last game (a 17-point loss at
Southern Mississippi on Thursday) but we didn't carry it through
like we have to do.'' Gervin said, ``We missed early opportunities.
Coach kept telling us over and over that we have to play defense in
the second half like we did in the first. But we didn't have the
same fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars made their first 12 free throws, then missed seven
of their last 13. They also were outrebounded 40-33 and did things
like inbound the ball wildly under their own basket, leading to an
easy Tulane basket during the Wave's big run. Stringfellow scored a
career-high 17 points but drew his fourth personal with 17 minutes
to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Wave, coming off an 80-64 upset of National Division leader
Alabama-Birmingham on Thursday at Birmingham, nearly sank at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forcing shots and trying to make passes that weren't
there until we got calmed down,'' Tulane coach Perry Clark said.
``I was very fearful of this game. I thought Clyde did a
magnificent job of getting his guys ready to play today after their
last game. It was very critical for us to get their lead down to
nine (43-34) at the half.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Clark: ``I told Clyde that he coaches like a guy with a
lot of money because he doesn't get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because it doesn't show.

   JUDGE RULES LEWINSKY MUST TALK; SENATE ERUPTS OVER SURPRISE MOVE
BY STARR, HOUSE PROSECUTORS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial turned into a
highly partisan battleground Saturday after a federal judge ordered
Monica Lewinsky to cooperate with House prosecutors who want to
question her as a prelude to her possible testimony in the
historical Senate proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson issued her ruling
after independent counsel Kenneth Starr intervened in federal court
on behalf of the House Republican prosecution team, whose repeated
requests to interview the former White House intern had been denied
by her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the 13 House prosecutors to ask for help from
Starr in forcing Lewinsky's cooperation outraged Democratic
senators as well as Clinton's legal team, who charged the
prosecutors with attempting to circumvent the Senate's rules that
call for putting off all decisions on witnesses until sometime this
week.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment trial continued on the Senate floor with
senators asking questions of the prosecutors and lawyers for a
second day, Lewinsky arrived in Washington from her home in
California to undergo yet another round of questioning about her
illicit affair with the president, which led to the House filing
impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice against
him. Prosecutors said they would likely interview her today.
</P>
<P>
   Under hostile questioning from Democrats in Saturday's
proceeding, House prosecutors defended their decision to seek
Starr's help without informing the Senate as ``a normal'' procedure
that any prosecutor would undertake in an effort to ``prepare a
witness for testimony in a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., described their actions as simply an
effort ``to get to know'' Lewinsky, who has an immunity from
prosecution agreement with Starr, and to ``say hello'' before they
attempt to introduce her into the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As anybody knows, if you have a witness that you're going to
produce, you have a right to prepare that witness. It's as plain
and simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff put a different spin
on it, saying ``what we have here is (the prosecutors) using their
... institutional role to get the independent counsel to join with
them and use the authority that he has under the immunity agreement
to threaten Miss Lewinsky with jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the prosecution's move as much more than
wanting to have ``a friendly little conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The House action so angered Democrats that some suggested that
it was grounds for immediate dismissal of the impeachment charges
against Clinton. Several Democrats led by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
submitted a written motion to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who
is presiding over the impeachment trial, asking him to overturn
Johnson's order on grounds that she has no authority to determine
the procedures under which the House managers or White House
counsel may interview witnesses. Citing Supreme Court rulings in a
previous impeachment, Harkin said the justices ruled that the
Senate has sole authority over its proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on whether Rehnquist would act on
the request.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also charged that Starr's intervention had erased
any doubts about where he stands on the question of impeachment and
the removal of Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well provide a chair at the House prosecutors'
table for independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who has lost all
semblance of independence,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is turning into a three-ring circus. It's a spectacle,''
Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Starr shrugged off the charges, telling reporters
Saturday that he was ``duty bound'' to act on the prosecutors'
request for help because of the referral of evidence in the case
that he sent to them last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The events involving Starr and Lewinsky upset the bipartisan
spirit with which Democratic and Republican senators began two
weeks ago, when they agreed on the rules for conducting the first
impeachment trial of a president in nearly 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
that ``all bets are off,'' as one put it, unless he exercises some
control over the conduct of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This political jockeying has got to stop,'' warned Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., who plans to offer a motion on Monday to dismiss the
case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., also blasted the
House's lead prosecutor, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., for ignoring his admonition not to interview witnesses
until the Senate had voted ``to give you the authority to do so.''
He also requested that at the appropriate time, members of the
Senate be allowed to sit in on any preparatory interviews with
witnesses. Hyde said no to that request as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unwillingness to cooperate with the Senate ... is as
clear a demonstration of raw partisanship as I have seen,'' said
Daschle. He called the House actions a violation of Senate rules
and a ``clear indication that this case ought to be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., described the actions by Hyde and
Starr as ``a grandstand play'' aimed at trying to tip the scales
for conviction of the president in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned it had ``fractured everything,'' and that some
Republicans who were also angered by the move could end up
supporting Byrd's motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privately a lot of members _ Democrats and Republicans _ are
saying this is going nowhere ... and what the House (prosecutors)
did only makes things worse,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that things had gotten ``a little strange,''
Lott said that he was hopeful the trial would get back on track
Monday. He said there would be a motion to dismiss offered, but
indicated that it would likely fail unless the 45 Democrats are
able to pick up six Republicans to give them a majority of 51
votes.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pick up support, Byrd added language to his
motion that would serve to censure the president for bringing
``dishonor'' on his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it would be a big mistake if the Senate voted to
dismiss,'' Lott said. ``I don't believe the American people would
be satisfied if we just stopped in the middle of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would also be a vote on whether to subpoena
witnesses. Although most of the 55 Republicans in the Senate appear
to favor the idea of allowing some witnesses to testify, a number
of them have said publicly that they do not like the idea of
Lewinsky making an appearance on the Senate floor. That prospect
could help the Democrats pick up votes for their dismissal motion.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lott said that he had asked White House lawyers
if Clinton would be willing to respond to questions in writing,
rather than making an appearance in the Senate chamber. The
president's lawyers at first said they would consider it, but then
later indicated that they would answer on the president's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the political theater surrounding Lewinsky's return to
Washington dominated the day, the Senate carried on with questions
to prosecutors and Clinton lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ruff told the senators that they have an
obligation to consider more than just the facts in the case as they
struggle to reach a decision. He said, for example, the ``will of
the people'' ought to be taken into account as well.
</P>
<P>
   His comment drew an emotional response from Hyde, who told the
lawmakers that members of Congress ``are not sent here to weigh our
mail every day and then to vote accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elected to bring our experience and our consciences
with us here,'' Hyde said. ``Despite all the polls and the hostile
editorials, America is hungry for people who believe in something.
You may disagree with us, but we believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Time/CNN poll, 54 percent of those questioned said
they disapproved of the Republican's handling of the Senate trial.

BRUINS SLOW DOWN MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE _ UCLA coach Steve Lavin made his list, he checked it
twice, then he instructed UCLA to be anything but nice to
Louisville point guard Cameron Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin scribbled Murray's name on the locker-room chalkboard as
the latest challenge for his guards: the ``victims'' list, he
called it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arizona's Jason Terry, Arizona State's Eddie House, Cal's
Geno Carlisle and Stanford's Art Lee, Murray is the vortex of
Louisville's attack. When he plays well, so do the Cardinals. When
he struggles, so do the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he did not play well, and neither did they.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA guards Baron Davis, Earl Watson and Ray Young hounded
Murray into one of his worst performances of the season. He made 6
of 16 shots, committed seven turnovers and lost his composure
several times in the Bruins' 82-70 victory Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guards did a great job overall,'' said Murray, the
former USC player whose brother, Tracy, played for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to (Young). When he was in the game, his job
obviously was to keep me from getting the ball. He frustrated me,
he pushed me, he tired me out. He did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   With their floor leader struggling, the Cardinals committed 16
turnovers in the second half and never found their offensive
rhythm, making 10 of 29 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Murray's seven turnovers came in the second half, with
Young defending him most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear him getting frustrated,'' said Young, who
played a career-high 34 minutes. ``He was asking for fouls to be
called. When you get a player crying to the refs and asking for
fouls, you've got him right where you want him.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a senior, finishes his college career winless against
UCLA in six games.
</P>
<P>
   How they stand: UCLA was the latest top-25 opponent for
Louisville, which has faced North Carolina, Kentucky and
Cincinnati. The Bearcats defeated Louisville 81-55 Thursday night,
holding Murray scoreless and forcing him into four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bruins) definitely could hold their own,'' Louisville
center Alex Sanders said. ``Cincinnati is bigger and stronger than
they are, but UCLA's guards are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fright flight: The Bruins experienced severe turbulence on the
final portion of their flight from L.A. to Memphis on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Their Northwest Airlines plane banked hard and felt like it was
dropping out of the sky. Lightning was visible outside both sides
of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman JaRon Rush was so shaken, he refused to get on the
connecting flight to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst flight I've ever had,'' Rush said. ``The wind
was banging us so hard, I thought we going to die. I was not
getting on that second plane. They couldn't do anything. I wasn't
getting on that plane.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rush and several UCLA officials made the six-hour drive from
Memphis to Louisville, arriving at 4 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the game _ he scored eight points and grabbed nine
rebounds _ Rush said he planned to board UCLA's flight home
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be all right, but my palms might be sweaty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over or not: Louisville coach Denny Crum said it was UCLA's
decision to end the home-and-home series, which began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they have schedule problems,'' he said. ``But they
want to renew it after two years. This stop is just temporary.''

   OXNARD, Calif. -- Coroner's officials positively identified the
body found floating in a bed of kelp off Channel Islands Harbor in
Southern California's Ventura County as that of canoeist Scott
Sullenger, who was lost early this month when he swam away from his
fellow crew members after their craft capsized.

   The recovery of the Oxnard man's body on Friday brings closure

<P>
   ``You can begin to heal if you know something is over,'' Arlene
Sullenger, Scott's mother, said Saturday. ``It's when you don't
know, you keep hoping. Every time the phone rings, you feel like it
might be someone saying it might be him alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, we'll have him home, and we will be able to properly
bury him, and we'll know at last that he's at peace and he's not
going to come back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene said that despite being told that the chances of finding
Scott Sullenger alive were remote, family and friends have gone out
on boats several times to deserted islands on the chance that he
made it to one and was stranded.
</P>
<P>
   They even checked homeless shelters and missions around the
area, believing the 36-year-old may not have been able to get to
them or remember what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Coroner's Investigator Craig Stevens said the body was
found at about 3:15 p.m. Friday by a commercial fishing boat,
tangled in kelp about seven miles southwest of Channel Islands
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of The Capture called the Coast Guard, which then
recovered the body.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said there had been little doubt that the body found
near Anacapa Island was Sullenger's, based on the description of
the clothes he was wearing when he disappeared and the personal
items found with the body.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements had not yet been made by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sullenger was one of six men who set out on a seven-mile
excursion in a 40-foot outrigger canoe from Channel Islands Harbor
on Jan. 3. About midmorning, 6-foot swells and offshore winds
gusting to 40 mph caused the craft to capsize.
</P>
<P>
   The crew members, who were wearing shorts and T-shirts, were
able to hold on for a while, and one, Tino Rico, 38, took off
swimming. Sullenger swam off about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Rico eventually was rescued by a Harbor Patrol vessel, but
Sullenger disappeared and was presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Ben Taitai, 50, and crewmen Justin Heard and
Michael Davis were rescued after four hours by a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
   Another crew member, John Deblin, 50, died of hypothermia before
the group was found, but his body was kept aloft by his fellow
boaters and was recovered as well.

CALIFORNIA DENTAL FIRM POISED FOR SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Smiles have been getting noticeably
brighter lately at Dental Medical Diagnostic Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the launch of a new tooth-whitening system last fall,
the maker of high-technology dental equipment is expected in the
coming weeks to report record sales for the quarter and year. And
while to date little-followed by Wall Street, the company recently
attracted coverage by a second brokerage firm, which like the first
has rated its shares a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most promising, Dental Medical in early January
applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a
low-cost digital X-ray system that analysts say could greatly
expand the existing market for such devices. If approved, the
system could within a year double the firm's sales and, according
to one analyst, give it annual revenues of up to $150 million by
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some really substantial growth,'' said Dental
Medical Chief Executive Robert Gurevitch. ``But there's a long way
to go before we saturate the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow Dental Medical give Gurevitch the lion's share
of credit for putting the firm on the map and nurturing it over
three and a half years into an organization that may soon dominate
its market.
</P>
<P>
   And his success is not without precedent.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of New Image Industries, a company he founded
in the mid-1980s, Gurevitch grew the firm into the nation's top
supplier of intraoral cameras -- devices that dentists,
orthodontists and oral surgeons use to project close-up images of
teeth and gums onto a video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gurevitch's direction, New Image's revenues went from zero
to approximately $30 million per year -- on a product whose
technology he acquired for less than $1 million -- and the
company's share price zoomed from 60 cents to $22 before the firm
was bought by industry giant Dentsply International in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Bob Gurevitch at New Image Industries, saw what he did
at that firm, knew he was very competent and thought he'd repeat
the same process at this one,'' said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Eugene
Melnitchenko, who initiated coverage of Dental Medical in December.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. Though sales have tapered off sharply in the
past year due to market saturation, Dental Medical's own intraoral
camera had by 1997 become the segment's best seller, easing his
former company from the top spot. Now focusing on marketing the
firm's tooth-whitening device, a system called the Apollo 95 E,
Gurevitch is beginning to strike pay dirt in that realm as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like most in-office tooth-whitening systems, the Apollo uses a
hydrogen peroxide-based compound to bleach teeth. While similar
systems use a laser to activate the bleach, Apollo does so with
plasma, a high-energy state of matter that to the naked eye looks
like intense light. Because of its intensity, the plasma-based
system can accomplish in around 40 minutes what laser systems do in
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Dental Medical's system does not affect
surrounding tissue the way a misguided laser can, a dental
technician or assistant can perform the procedure, making it
cheaper for a dental office to operate. The device's $4,500 price
tag is about 50 percent less than most laser-based systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a $50-100 million market or more for them, and
they could see revenues of that magnitude within a three-year
horizon,'' said analyst Jeffrey Berg at M.H. Meyerson &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning FDA approval last October, Dental Medical has sold
about 1,800 units in the United States. In Europe, where it won
approval several months earlier, about 2,700 units have been sold,
the company said. Melnitchenko estimates a worldwide market for the
Apollo of 60,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gurevitch and Melnitchenko hold out equally high hopes for
Dental Medical's digital X-ray system, now under consideration by
government regulators. Like typical X-ray systems, the machine
takes still images of patients' teeth and jaw bones.
</P>
<P>
   But because of more acute -- and smaller -- sensors that a
patient bites on while being scanned, the machine requires a far
weaker X-ray dose to achieve resolution images superior to standard
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The machines have an anticipated price tag of around $7,000,
more than typical film-based X-ray systems, but less than
lower-resolution digital machines made by Dental Medical's
competitors. Because most dentists are expected to shift to digital
systems in the coming decade as their film-based systems wear out,
Melnitchenko and Berg believe Dental Medical could generate up to
$30 million within three years from sales of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high sales potential of Dental Medical's
products, both analysts also say the company's stock is
underpriced, with Melnitchenko projecting a 12-month target of
$14.40 a share, and Berg expecting a price in the $12 to $13 range.
</P>
<P>
   Gurevitch says he's confident investors will eventually wake up
to this. ``We've been so aggressive trying to build our market we
haven't spent a lot of time communicating with the public,'' he
said. ``But we also believe that following our (quarterly earnings
report) in February the market is going to be very pleased.''

 &HT;    Bush and Perry seek spiritual guidance from Austin minister
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's not the official state pastor, but he may
as well be.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas' top two political leaders seek spiritual guidance,
they go to Tarrytown United Methodist Church, the West Austin
church where the Rev. Jim Mayfield has been pastor for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush calls Mayfield ``a loyal member of the
flock.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said Mayfield is well known for his
commitment to social concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every Sunday there is a different ministry he directs
the flock towards,'' Perry said. ``He speaks to me every Sunday
morning. As I'm squirming in my seat I'm sure he's talking directly
to me and the governor,'' he added with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Bush, who are Republicans, consider Mayfield a
confidant, Perry added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will become even more so, both to the governor and
myself, and I would suggest that Jim certainly has our ear,'' said
Perry, who recently named Mayfield chaplain for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mayfield is expected to be elected president of Austin
Metropolitan Ministries, an interfaith group representing 22 faiths
that work to help the disadvantaged and empower clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, by all accounts, is quite a regular guy. He likes to
fish. He's a poet and woodcarver.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job in this congregation, based on whoever comes, is to by
the grace of God enable them to be the best person they can be,''
Mayfield said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He makes it a point never to publicly discuss his relationship
with Bush and Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My perception is when they walk in the door they walk in the
door as children of God. I'm real clear about what my job is. My
job is not to be their policy adviser. My job is to be their
pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, 62, was born in Austin but grew up in West Texas. He
has degrees from the University of Texas, Southern Methodist
University and Texas Christian University. He takes the most pride
in an honorary doctorate of divinity degree he received in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an honorary alum of Huston-Tillotson College,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield has held national and regional posts in the United
Methodist Church. Before coming to the Tarrytown church in 1988, he
was the Austin district superintendent for the United Methodist
Church. Austin Metropolitan Ministries is excited about Mayfield
heading its board of directors, said Patrick Flood, the
organization's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Mayfield is a great religious leader and has a strong
desire to enable the different segments of the faith community to
communicate with each other and work for the common good,'' Flood
said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mayfield said he plans to concentrate on raising
money for the organziation and hosting events that will allow
clergy of different faiths get to know each other better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to be a bridge and a place of
communication between the various religious bodies,'' Mayfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Mayfield has an easy-going personality
that makes it ``pretty easy to be comfortable around me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his strengths is also one of his weaknesses, Mayfield
said. ``I basically have a fairly high level of trust of people so
it's easy for me to delegate,'' he said. ``The weakness is
sometimes I'm disappointed or taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   A nameplate in his office flashes his sense of humor. It reads:
``God so loved the world that he didn't send a committee.''

 &HT;    Pastors try to focus on salvation, not politics
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pastors are trained to offer spiritual guidance,
comfort to the sick and a helping hand to the fallen, but divinity
school doesn't prepare them for politicians in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to tell anyone, politicians or otherwise, what I
think they might want to hear,'' said the Rev. Chuck Merrill,
pastor of University United Methodist Church, home to several
judges and Austin Mayor Kirk Watson.
</P>
<P>
   While most pastors say they minister to politicians in the same
way they do to other members of the flock, these preachers can find
themselves thrust under a media microscope and targeted for attack
by other religious leaders. Almost daily, President Clinton's
religious advisers are clubbed with criticisms by conservative
preachers who have labeled them spiritual enablers dispensing cheap
grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secretary remarked the other day, `Phil, you are developing
the hide of a rhinoceros,' '' said the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman,
pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington D.C., where
the Clintons attend church.
</P>
<P>
   Church attendance at Riverbend Church in Austin plummeted by 500
people after the church's pastor, Rev. Gerald Mann, prayed for and
comforted Clinton when the president apologized for his sexual
transgression with Monica Lewinsky at the National Prayer Breakfast
in September. ``We had one major contributor leave the church over
it,'' Mann said. ``He thought my standing there and praying by the
president was tantamount to approving of his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekly church attendance is back up to 4,000, he added. Mann,
who serves as chaplain for the Texas House of Representatives,
continues to counsel Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Graham, who has counseled numerous presidents,
including Lyndon Baines Johnson and George Bush, has taken his
share of hits over the years. His close association with Richard
Nixon, a Quaker, who resigned the presidency after the Watergate
scandal, drew the ire of many. Graham urged Gerald Ford to pardon
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Just As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy Graham,''
the evangelist talks about the harsh criticism he received from
conservative Christians for offering the inauguration prayer for
Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Graham writes in the book, released before Clinton's sexual
entanglement became public, that ``no president stands outside the
need for God's constant help and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one reason I have always agreed to lead prayers on
such occasions when asked,'' Graham continued. ``Furthermore, the
Scripture commands us to pray `for kings and all those in authority
that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and
holiness. This is good and pleases God our Savior.' (1 Timothy
2:2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one person who tried to dissuade me, `Are you saying
you don't think Mr. Clinton needs our prayers, or that we shouldn't
pray for him?' '' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also prayed at Clinton's 1996 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may appear that some ministers spend more time with
their celebrity politicians than with others in the pews, Mayfield
points out that every pastor spends more time with those in need.
</P>
<P>
   A pastor is like the parent of a large family, Mayfield said.
``When you're a parent, you know your energy goes to the child that
needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   And your sermons need to hit home, Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in public service, you have to be reminded that
God's word is about mercy and justice. If you don't want to hear
that, you need to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes political figures do that. Bob and Elizabeth Dole
bolted from Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., in
1995 after political columnists began scrutinizing the church and
Wogaman during the last presidential campaign. What interested the
media was that Clinton, a Southern Baptist, and his wife, Hillary,
a Methodist, attend the same church.
</P>
<P>
   The church is a ``reconciling'' congregation, the label given
Methodist congregations that openly welcome gays and lesbians to
worship. Wogaman's sermons were picked apart, with some
conservative political pundits branding him a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have resolutely declined to reveal what my party affiliation
is,'' Wogaman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you think is the right thing and let the chips
fall where they will. Given enough time, everybody becomes
anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman has written a book, ``From the Eye of the Storm: A
Pastor to the President Speaks Out,'' that deals with the spiritual
state of the nation and Clinton. The book, released last month,
paints a picture of a nation at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, love and law are not necessarily inconsistent or
incompatible,'' Wogaman writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it matters, perhaps a whole lot, which of the two is
understood to be the foundation of our life together as a people.
If law comes first, then love is subordinated. If love comes first,
then law is there to serve community . . . It should be no secret
that I am among those who place the greater emphasis upon community
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ralph Smith, pastor emeritus of Hyde Park Baptist
Church in Austin, said the way he sees it is he thinks the country
has gotten so far away from morality that an immoral act seems
normal. ``It's a commentary on our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was fortunate when former Texas Gov. Mark White
attended his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, you occasionally had disruptions,'' he said.
``Mostly, people who wanted to be in church when the governor was
in church. One demented woman always wanted to sit next to him. He
would let her come up and sit by him.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest hassle, Smith said, was the telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the phone calls from people that want the governor to
do something they want done or for some favor they want,'' Smith
recalled. ``You have to say: `Look, I have nothing to do with that.
I told the governor I wouldn't try to be the governor, and he told
me he wouldn't try to preach for me.' I referred them all to the
governor's office. I had the number memorized.''

LOS ANGELES COSTLY PLACE TO DO BUSINESS, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX, RICK ORLOV AND PATRICIA FARELL AIDEM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite pledges to make Los Angeles more business
friendly, the city remains one of California's most expensive
places to conduct commerce, according to a comprehensive study to
be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two incorporated cities adjacent to the suburban San
Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, Santa Clarita and Westlake
Village, are among 10 jurisdictions in Southern California ranked
among the best at courting business, said the report from Los
Angeles-based Kosmont &AMP; Associates, a commercial real estate
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   They make life easier for businesses by offering incentives and
tax breaks as relocation lures, said Larry J. Kosmont, the report's
author and consultant on such projects as Beverly Hills-based
Regent Properties' recently proposed $55 million hotel, retail and
commercial complex in suburban Burbank, Calif. The survey covered
200 communities in California and 12 cities in neighboring states
that compete for business.
</P>
<P>
   It found that California is making headway in shedding the
anti-business label it wore through the early part of this decade.
For the second consecutive year, there were more high-cost cities
in neighboring states than in California.
</P>
<P>
   For example, four California cities received a high-cost ranking
from Kosmont vs. five in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings run directly contrary to the widespread belief
that California is a high-cost state in which to do business,''
Kosmont said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth study by Kosmont's company and Los Angeles
received a ``high cost'' designation in each one. This year's
report concluded Los Angeles is the second most expensive place for
businesses behind San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Los Angeles, its size is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with L.A. is that the (permit) process traverses
too many departments. There are too many decisions involved. It is
too much of a cooperative effort between divisions right now,''
Kosmont said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Efforts are under way to streamline a cumbersome business tax
system. Mayor Richard Riordan has proposed winnowing more than 60
business tax categories down to eight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, Kosmont said, and shows that Los Angeles is
doing better on the competitive front. But the Riordan plan won't
do much for costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make (Los Angeles) more competitive with other
high-cost cities such as Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver
City,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of Riordan's program could bring a slight reduction in
taxes but neighboring cities are also holding the line on taxes and
not increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan did not dispute the study's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot but we still have to do more,'' he said.
``The tax reform is essential. So are continuing to have
public-private partnerships. That's the key to keeping business
here and attracting new ones.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Kosmont's study concludes that public-private partnerships are
especially critical now that Proposition 218, approved by voters
last year, requires voter approval of any new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So the best way for cities to generate more revenue is by
attracting new businesses and reaping the benefits from the boost
to business, property and sales tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Kosmont gave Los Angeles high marks on this front. It was one of
10 Southern California areas that participated in 10 or more
public-private deals within the last 12 months or the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is doing a lot of deals to induce businesses to
come to Los Angeles or stay in the city,'' Kosmont said. ``L.A. is
still on the expensive side and will never be able to compete with
areas like Calabasas and Westlake and Thousand Oaks.''
</P>
<P>
   But approving the mayor's plan will send an important message to
the business community, he said, and the city should consider
reviewing its business tax code every three years as well as
lowering taxes on small businesses. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Just making the permit process less cumbersome would satisfy
Victor Avakian, who has owned Casa Di Pizza in the San Fernando
Valley community of West Hills for 10 years. He wants to expand his
restaurant into an adjacent vacant building and install an arcade
with bumper cars and video games, making it a venue for birthday
parties and gatherings of various youth sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $50,000 project not made any cheaper by the city's permit
and license process, Avakian said.
</P>
<P>
   That could take up to six months and cost an additional $10,000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being fair with us. It's a two-way system, so you
have to follow the rules,'' Avakian said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., a nonprofit and nongovernmental agency, credits
Riordan with implementing business teams that are trained to help
businesses navigate the municipal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   This helps mitigate the cost issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing continued strong demand for businesses locating
in Los Angeles County,'' Kyser said. ``I think people recognize
that we have a healthy and growing economy and there are lots of
resources here. If you are going to play the (business) game you
have to be in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even being near Los Angeles helps. Westlake Village adopted a
``business friendly'' philosophy when it incorporated in 1981 and
it continues to pay off today, civic leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That transfers into a commitment not to establish business
license fees and other similar taxes,'' said City Manager Ray
Taylor.
</P>
<P>

PROSECUTORS SCURRY TO MEND THEIR CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three days of carving by President Clinton's
legal team, House prosecutors scrambled this weekend to repair
significant damage to their case for ending his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The best bandage for their impeachment drive, the House
Republicans say, would be to summon witnesses. And on Saturday, the
prosecutors won permission from a federal judge to interrogate
Monica Lewinsky as an initial step they hope will lead to her
testifying before the Senate about her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, House prosecutors quietly enlisted the aid of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's deputies to compel Lewinsky,
without Democratic senators or Clinton's defense team present, to
answer questions. Starr's office asked for U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson's help, and on Saturday she ordered the
25-year-old former intern to meet with House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she or any other witnesses will appear before the Senate
will not be decided until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, questions remain about whether fresh testimony from
the president's former paramour or anyone else would help make the
prosecution's case against Clinton whole again.
</P>
<P>
   Her sworn testimony from more than 20 sessions with a grand jury
and with Starr's investigators was turned over to the House in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important than it
is now,'' said Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the 13-member team of
House Republicans prosecuting the impeachment case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-day presentation to the Senate by Clinton's
legal team and two days of questioning from senators, legal experts
said, the House case against the president was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers have ``put the House managers very much
on the defensive, and to recover they will have to come forward,
not with more speculation, but with hard evidence to support their
case,'' said Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the College of
William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Without additional evidence, the debate over impeaching the 42nd
president will boil down to the context in which senators examine
the facts known for months about Clinton's effort to conceal his
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   During their Jan. 14-16 presentation, House prosecutors stressed
the need for senators to examine the case as a whole, each charge
in context, to see an ongoing effort by Clinton to lie under oath
and illegally hide evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Taken separately, as the president's lawyers did last week, some
of the allegations of wrongdoing may appear weak, the House
prosecutors cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team, which earlier had argued only that
the perjury and obstruction charges were not impeachable offenses,
last week offered a detailed rebuttal of the House Republicans'
version of the facts used to build their case.
</P>
<P>
   While the dissection by Clinton's lawyers revealed omissions,
contradictions and stretches in logic that make the House case far
less compelling, the new tack strengthened the resolve among some
Republican senators to accede to the House prosecutors' request to
summon witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start attacking the facts, it strengthens the
argument for bringing live witnesses to testify,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning witnesses introduces an element of uncertainty to the
trial, a risk the White House opposes but the House prosecutors see
as essential to helping counter the presentation by the president's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start getting witnesses, who knows where it is going to
lead?'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian and biographer
at Boston University. ``It is so hard to pin these things down.
Bringing witnesses before the Senate poses risks for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of public proceedings, Republican and Democratic
senators appear more in agreement than ever that they want a quick
resolution to the trial, which poses a danger to the hopes of House
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large element of credibility that is now quite
clearly on the table,'' said Ronald J. Allen, a law professor at
Northwestern University. ``If the House tries to rehabilitate its
case, witnesses would be very helpful. Whether that means the
Senate will agree to hear witnesses is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate is scheduled to begin considering motions,
including one to dismiss the charges and another to permit
witnesses to testify. Senate Republicans outnumber Democrats,
55-45, which means six Republicans would have to side with the
Democrats _ assuming they held firm _ to end the case.
</P>
<P>
   Outright dismissal is unlikely, according to several Republican
and Democratic senators. The outcome of a vote on calling
witnesses, even to provide depositions without televised testimony
from the well of the Senate, is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats might side with the GOP to not dismiss the
case and, perhaps, to summon witnesses, none has signaled that they
are willing to defect when it comes to a vote on conviction. There,
at least 12 Democrats would have to join all the Republicans to
provide the two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, needed to remove
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lewinsky, the most likely witnesses would be key
figures already questioned at length and under oath as part of
Starr's investigation of the president. Starr's report to Congress,
18 boxes' worth, provided the bulk of evidence used by the House to
impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses like Lewinsky, Clinton friend and confidant Vernon
Jordan and presidential secretary Betty Currie could be called to
help clarify ambiguous circumstances or unresolved disputes that
remain in the wake of the 30 hours of presentations by the
prosecutors and Clinton's defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose for calling any witnesses is that the
senators would get the opportunity to evaluate the witnesses'
testimony in person. There's nothing new that they will add,'' said
Robert Bloom, a professor at the Boston College Law School. ``The
House managers don't have a very strong case, legally. Will
witnesses help? It will create a spectacle. Live testimony isn't
going to enlighten anyone further.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidate to create a spectacle would be
Lewinsky if, as one House manager suggested, she is asked to verify
her earlier testimony about their sexual trysts, details the House
says would prove that Clinton lied to grand jurors when he denied
that he had touched her breasts and genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff last week argued that the
differences between Clinton's account and Lewinsky's detailed,
often lurid, testimony amount to ``her oath against his oath,''
which is not sufficient to warrant a criminal conviction, much less
removal of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican and one of the House
prosecutors, said: ``If you believe the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky, you can't believe the president.'' McCollum told senators
that if they had doubts about Lewinsky's credibility, they should
``bring her in here and let us examine her face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Also unexplained is the drive by Jordan, a high-powered
Washington lawyer and frequent Clinton golf partner, to find
Lewinsky a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers were unable to produce evidence that Clinton
conspired with Jordan to get her the job to keep her silent about
her affair with the president. While pointing out this flaw, the
president's lawyers were unable to provide an innocent explanation
for all the sudden interest in Lewinsky's employment prospects.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors also want to question Currie about the
presents she hid under her bed, a box of gifts given to Lewinsky by
Clinton. White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills explained that
Currie was a friend, almost like a mother, to Lewinsky and hid the
gifts as a favor. No evidence points directly to Clinton as
engineering the concealment of the presents, as the GOP prosecutors
surmised. Unresolved is who initiated Currie's trip to Lewinsky's
apartment to pick up the box of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also made much of the so-called ``coaching''
incident early last year, but the White House lawyers disputed its
legal significance. On Jan. 18, 1998, a day after testifying in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment case, Clinton called Currie to the
White House on a Sunday and asked her a series of leading questions
regarding his meetings with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is witness tampering, pure and simple,'' charged House
special counsel David Schippers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said the White House lawyers, since Currie was not yet a
witness and Clinton was not tampering. Jones' lawyers had not asked
to hear from Currie as a witness, and no one in the White House
then knew the Starr investigation was about to expand into the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors countered, however, by producing evidence that
Jones' lawyers added Currie to their witness list and subpoenaed
her within 48 hours of the Lewinsky controversy erupting in the
news media on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said in the end it did not matter because Clinton did not
know Currie would be called at the time of his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are multiple versions of various stories,'' said
Northwestern's Allen. ``And that's where calling live witnesses
could make a difference because the story that's going to most
likely be believed is the one told under oath, in person to the
Senate. Of course, it depends on what they say.''

REAL ESTATE: PLANS TO PRESERVE A BLACK BEACH ENCLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE TANNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. _ A Jacksonville banker who bought an
oceanfront lot in American Beach here last November plans to press
for a master plan to stave off encroachment of high-end resorts on
either side of an enclave that traces its special character back to
the days of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The banker, Tony T. Brown, a senior vice president at
Nationsbank Florida, is seeking to persuade other property owners
to create a community development district and a financing plan to
upgrade and preserve the neighborhood on the northernmost island
off Florida's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Land purchases for new projects are rare at American Beach,
which was developed in the '30s as a resort for blacks barred from
whites-only beach areas, and has retained a feeling of community
and cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads in its 78 acres are unpaved and the community
lacks basic sewer and water infrastructure. Still, the property is
coveted by high-end resorts to the north and south of it _ Amelia
Island Plantation and Summer Beach, which are rapidly using up the
last of their oceanfront property in the ongoing construction of
condominiums, homes and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   The 18.2-square-mile Amelia Island, of which American Beach is a
part, is a 35-minute drive across the Intracoastal Waterway from
Jacksonville International Airport. It was a sleepy blue-collar
community with a small quiet section of high-priced homes and
condominiums at its southern end until the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is dominated by upscale development. Private planes
frequently fly into the island's small airport, where expansion,
but not commercial service, is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Brown bought a 50-by-100-foot parcel on the waterfront from a
family trust, paying $89,500. He said he was holding off
construction of a vacation home for his family until modern
infrastructure is in place _ as are more than a dozen other
American Beach property owners.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he also planned to close this Friday on a second
lot, where he plans to construct a four-unit apartment building. In
addition, he said, he is working with longtime residents to create
a museum to preserve the enclave's black heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practitioner of redevelopment, I want to practice what I
preach,'' he said. At Nationsbank, now a subsidiary of BankAmerica
following a merger last year, he oversees the institution's
involvement in neighborhood revitalization in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Among other property owners pressing for a master plan is
Michael Stewart, a Bell South regional manager for corporate
affairs whose grandfather built a home in American Beach in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Frank Morgan Jr., a real estate professional whose
family owns more than an acre, joined Brown last month to discuss
capital improvements with local officials. ``For long-term
viability, infrastructure is a must,'' Stewart said. ``But it's not
the panacea.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Brown met with the American Beach Homeowners
Association. Of the enclave's 125 lots, about 80 have homes; only
20 have year-round residents.
</P>
<P>
   He found members of the homeowners association wary when he
tried to persuade them to endorse his draft proposals for
revitalizing the neighborhood. Ultimately such a plan would have to
go before the local commissioners of Nassau County, the island's
governing entity, for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's proposal offers several options to finance capital
improvements such as sewerage and water utilities. Among those
discussed have been property-tax increases directed back to the
neighborhood and issuance of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners are seeking more details and have invited Brown
back to give them. ``There are people who come along from time to
time like Brown who talk about developing American Beach,'' said
Annette Myers, head of the homeowners association. ``Sometimes you
don't know where these people are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Myers said that residents were concerned about property
values rising too high for elderly residents on fixed incomes,
about retaining a mix of affordable housing and about keeping a vi

SOONERS WOMEN CAN'T STOP LONGHORNS IN SECOND HALF

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said a Texas
second-half spurt at home is almost sure as a sunset over Mount
Bonnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were a second-half team,'' Coale said. ``We
prepared for it. And it still happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns erased a six-point halftime deficit with a 13-2
second-half start and held off a late surge to defeat the Sooners,
81-73, for their sixth consecutive victory at the Erwin Center. Big
second halves also keyed Big 12 home victories over Colorado, No.
23 Nebraska and Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather win the second half than the first,'' UT coach Jody
Conradt said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (10-7, 4-3) is unbeaten at home in conference play with
Kansas (14-6, 4-3) due in Wednesday fresh off handing No. 6 Texas
Tech (17-2, 6-1) its first Big 12 loss yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of our three losses on the road \RIowa State and Kansas
State\S were very disappointing,'' Conradt said. ``We said we had
to win all three games in this home stand to make up some ground.
We've won two of them. Every game is a big game for us now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns suffered in the first half when leading scorer
Edwina Brown and freshman spark Asha Hill got into early foul
trouble. They played only 16 combined minutes and scored eight
points. With them on the bench and senior Kim Lummus missing all
six shots, Texas lost an early 13-5 lead and trailed by as many as
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown scored 11 of her 17 points in the second half. Hill
chipped in nine of her 11. Lummus added 14 after the break. Texas
also got a solid game from freshman center Rashunda Johnson (15
points, nine rebounds). And with Brown and Hill on the floor,
Texas' increased defensive intensity resulted in nine second-half
steals (of 13) and 14 OU turnovers (of 22).
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out wanting to press, but it didn't happen that
way'' because of fouls, said Brown, who leads UT in five individual
categories. ``We went back to it in the second half and started
jumping them in the backcourt. That's when things started going our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown showed big late. She hit a free throw after OU closed to
66-65. She hit a follow shot to stretch a two-point lead to 71-67.
And she took an in-bounds pass coast-to-coast for a layup and a
74-69 lead with 1:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's definitely one of the best players in the league,''
Coale said.

POPE DESIGNATES DAY TO HONOR VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE

</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, her countenance may be better known than the pope's.
She adorns billboards, home windows and tiny makeshift chapels.
</P>
<P>
   She is the Virgin of Guadalupe, and Pope John Paul II on
Saturday set aside Dec. 12 as a religious feast day in her honor
throughout the Americas. In Mexico, the day already is widely
observed, with many people taking time off work to honor the
Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's action, taken as he celebrated Mass at the Basilica
of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, was an example of his
lifelong devotion to Mary, the mother of Jesus. It also testified
to the amazing staying power of a miracle said to have occurred
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 500 years ago, Roman Catholic faithful believe, the
Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on a hill to a poor Nahuatl Indian
named Juan Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance came just 10 years after the Spanish conquest of
Mexico. Life after the conquest was horrid for many Indians, with
disease and overwork taking many lives.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the Virgin brought hope to an oppressed people
and helped convert Mexico's Indian masses to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   According to the legend, a ``little Indian woman'' first
appeared to Juan Diego as he walked at daybreak near the foot of a
hill called Tepeyac. He heard birds singing, then noticed a white,
shining cloud and around it a rainbow of colors. He heard a woman
call his name. She told him that she wanted a church built on the
hill. There, she said, she would hear the weeping and prayers of
the people and bring them consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady he saw told him she was `the ever-Virgin Mary, Mother
of the true God by whom all live,' but she used the Aztec name
Tonantzin, or Mother of the Gods,'' Sally Cunneen writes in her
book In Search of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The apparition directed Juan Diego to ask the local bishop to
build the church. Diego tried but was rebuffed. On Dec. 12, 1531,
Diego found roses blooming in the dead of winter at Tepeyac. He
gathered them into his coarse cloak and hurried to the bishop's
house.
</P>
<P>
   En route, he met the lady again. She arranged the roses in his
cloak and directed him not to open the cloak to anyone but the
bishop.
</P>
<P>
   When Diego arrived at the bishop's home and opened his cloak,
the bishop fell to his knees. On the cloak was printed the
now-famous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, just as Diego had
described her. The cloak now hangs in the basilica in Mexico City
where the pope celebrated Mass on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Across Latin America and in the United States, the Virgin of
Guadalupe remains a potent symbol. Though some have criticized the
church's use of her image, others believe it symbolizes hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has become the unofficial,
private flag of Mexicans,'' Richard Rodriguez writes in the book
Goddess of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin appears everywhere in Mexico. On dashboards and on
calendars, on playing cards, on lampshades and cigar boxes; within
the loneliness and tattooed upon the very skin of Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor is the image of Guadalupe a diminishing mirage of the 16th
century, but she has become more vivid with time.''

FOR MANY MEXICAN CATHOLICS, JUST BEING NEAR POPE IS ALL THAT
MATTERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DUDLEY ALTHAUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Maria Trinidad Zarate and her friends sit happy in
a glaring late-morning sun, straining to see anything, hear
anything of Pope John Paul II's visit to the mystical essence of
Roman Catholic Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Zarate and the others had traveled all night by bus from their
home in Colima, in western Mexico, to be outside the Basilica of
Our Lady of Guadalupe for the chance to catch a glimpse of the
Roman Catholic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Now they stand crammed with hundreds of other faithful on a side
street behind the sprawling structure, the shrine of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, their view of the building impeded by a pedestrian
walkway filled with people, their access to it blocked by high
fences and cordons of security men.
</P>
<P>
   Liturgical music beats with a tinny murmur from distant
loudspeakers. Street vendors hawk John Paul trinkets, paper hats to
block the sun, snacks to fill bellies that didn't have time for
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, at a Mass for Catholic bishops from throughout the
Americas, John Paul is presenting the church's plan for the coming
millennium. He's calling for greater economic justice and an end to
racism, he's urging moderation of the capitalist system that rules
much of the world and has left so many without.
</P>
<P>
   Zarate and her friends haven't heard any of that message. They
haven't seen John Paul. And they won't see him. But they don't
mind. Being here, being near, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Catholic,'' Zarate says with a shrug when asked why she
bothers. ``The pope means everything to us. It's the presence of
God, the maximum authority in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of other people agree with Zarate. They
line the Mysteries Road, the broad street leading away from the
basilica that John Paul will take to the house in the southern end
of the city where he is staying on his five-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
   They have spent hours in the morning sun waiting to see the
pope. A few people start chants. ``John Paul, John Paul.'' One man
loudly whistles Beethoven's Ode to Joy. Thousands upon thousands of
people stand quietly, fanning themselves. Shading their eyes.
Shifting from foot to foot. Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if we are far away from him, we feel him,''
Juanita Huitron, a 50-year-old housewife, says of John Paul. ``The
last time he was here in Mexico, I felt his blessing, I felt his
hands upon my shoulders. We are all in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic faithful believe that the Virgin Mary, mother of
Jesus, appeared to a poor Indian farmer on the site of the basilica
in 1531, a decade after the conquest of the Aztec Empire by the
Spaniards. The so-called Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to give hope
to the conquered Indians. She was copper-skinned like they were.
She was Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   In the centuries since, the Virgin had become the purest
expression of Catholicism for many, if not most, Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope knows this Virgin is suffering for how we are
suffering,'' Huitron says as she shoulders her way toward the front
of the waiting crowd. ``Mexico is being consumed, so many problems.
(The pope) has come to help this Virgin unite us, to rescue us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope wants peace, the pope wants justice, the pope wants
there to be no more poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The service in the basilica over, John Paul whisks down the
Mysteries Road in a glass-sided bus, eyes fixed on the floor, not
even looking at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As the aging pontiff passes, Isabel Estrada lifts a tray laden
with rosaries, small statues of saints, images of the Virgin of
Guadalupe that she has brought for his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Does John Paul bless Estrada's icons? Does he see them? Does his
proximity confer grace?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to believe that it does,'' Estrada, 64, says as she
and her friend, Remedios Garduno, turn with satisfied smiles toward
their house that fronts the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much, maybe,'' Estrada says, ``but it's the best we
can do. It's a blessing.''

 &HT;    Longhorns get it in gear, speed past OU
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale told her Sooners all
week that the Texas women's basketball team was a second-half squad
that would rather speed up and down the court than sit back in a
half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   And she reminded the Sooners again at halftime Saturday as they
gathered in the locker room at the Erwin Center to discuss their
37-31 lead and how they had held UT to a mostly half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let them in the open court,'' Coale cautioned. ``You
can't let them explode like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Coale said, ``We prepared for it, and it still
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the Longhorns all of 4 minutes, 7 seconds in the second
half to erase Oklahoma's lead on their way to an 81-73 victory in
front of 5,803 vocal UT fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, UT remained unbeaten at home this season in
Big 12 play. The Longhorns (10-7, 4-3) are tied for fourth place in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Coale was correct in reminding her team about UT's late heroics,
especially at home. The Longhorns were clinging to a one-point lead
over Oklahoma State on Wednesday, but went on to win 75-53. UT was
ahead of Colorado by six points before winning by 18. Against
Nebraska, the Longhorns turned a four-point lead at intermission
into a five-point upset.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma was able to take a halftime lead mainly because UT had
three starters _ guards Edwina Brown and Asha Hill, and post Tracy
Cook _ in brief foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, UT's statistical leader in every major category, played
nine minutes in the first half, scoring only six points. Hill, who
started her second straight game at point guard, played seven
minutes and scored two points in the first half. She didn't have a
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Lummus, UT's most consistent perimeter weapon, was troubled
with early shooting problems, missing all of her six first-half
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a whole lot of teams who can sit down three
starters and stay close,'' said UT Coach Jody Conradt. ``It causes
you to be really stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our depth was the key. I feel really comfortable
playing a rotation of nine to 10 players. This is a pretty
versatile team.''
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, Oklahoma was the team with foul problems, as
starters Desiree Taylor, LaNeisha Caufield and key reserve Michele
Workman fouled out. Stacy Dales led both teams with 21 points. But
all-conference performer Phylesha Whaley had a quiet 18; she went
the first 14 minutes of the second half without scoring a point.
</P>
<P>
   Brown missed out on her fourth straight double-double
performance but still managed a workmanlike game, scoring 17 points
with six assists and six rebounds. Lummus made four of her seven
second-half shots to score 14 points for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill made it to double figures with 12 points. And center
Rashunda Johnson, who has been struggling all season, had 15 points
and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   UT forced Oklahoma into 14 second-half turnovers _ 22 for the
game _ and turned the Sooners' miscues into 31 points, 19 in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   OU got to within 66-65 with 3:28 to play, but the Longhorns
denied the Sooners the comeback, in part, by making nine of 11
free-throw attempts.

RODMAN'S ACT GETTING OLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Jay Leno tried to coax a sexy pout out of Mira
Sorvino, his first guest Friday on ``The Tonight Show.'' No luck
there. But then Dennis Rodman rambled to the rescue and without
even trying he showed the actress how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   The pout part, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's pose throughout the live taping was much more sullen
than sexy, the shades of his behavior illuminating the difference
between being a bad boy and a just plain rude one.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was a rebounding phenomenon when he was reborn a few
years ago as a pop culture curiosity. With his outrageous garb and
gauche gab Rodman leaped into the public consciousness and elevated
his popularity to heights that his jumping ability under the basket
never could have carried him.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't skipping practices for professional wrestling
matches, Rodman, 37, remained a hustling, hard-working hulk on the
hardwood. And if you managed to shuck pretense from personality,
you'd find a likable guy.
</P>
<P>
   But why be decent when you can be filthy rich? If not for the
off-court persona that the once (and future?) Chicago Bulls forward
has cunningly crafted, few people would have cared about the
marital or playing status of the ``goofball.'' That was how Leno
described Rodman while kibitzing onstage with the studio audience a
few minutes before Friday's taping, which aired the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of Rodman's name triggered a buzz that traveled
through the crowd like an electric current. Tieniequie Simon's
squeals punctured the din, making it clear to the entire assembly
who she had stood in the snaking line outside NBC Studios most of
the afternoon to see.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: It wasn't Jay.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman can be as unpredictable as next week, which is what
Simon, a sophomore at Cal Poly Pomona, had always found so
intoxicating. When at last he was introduced, Simon and 321 other
people (323 if you count Sorvino and Leno on the stage) shifted
forward in their seats, as though they were about to be let in on
some scintillating secret.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there would be no meaty disclosures, just the uncovering
of a man whose act has worn thinner than a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman strolled onstage wearing a black pinstriped suit,
platform shoes that belonged in the back of Elton John's closet, a
black felt hat that was pulled all the way down to his eyebrows and
a barely concealed insolence.
</P>
<P>
   Leno tried to get Rodman to doff either the hat or the shades,
lest he forgot who it was he was talking to, and lapsed into a
series of questions about ``The Sopranos,'' the new HBO series
about a mob family.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman wouldn't budge. The hat, the shades and the insolence
stayed. It was enough to make you squirm, watching Rodman mumble
through his interview with Leno, who gamely persisted in trying to
draw out the voice of Dennis the Mummer.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, it was obvious why Rodman wasn't wearing
any socks underneath his shoes; he had stuffed them in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It was no small feat for Leno to get Rodman to admit he had
talked to Lakers owner Jerry Buss but that he didn't think the team
could afford his salary under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Shaquille O'Neal wasn't somebody he'd care to hang out
with but he'd have no problem playing alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   Or that he had to borrow a ring for his spur-of-the-moment
wedding to actress Carmen Electra in Las Vegas, one he arranged by
rousing her out of bed at 6:30 a.m. with the romantic .jZ9eaty,
``Get the hell out of bed and let's go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interview dragged on, Simon, the Cal Poly Pomona student,
sat back in her seat, stone-faced, with her arms crossed at her
chest. Her body language spoke a lot louder and clearer than did
Rodman. The only time he was really animated was during commercial
breaks, when he engaged Sorvino in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights came up and the cameras started filming, Rodman
returned to his shell. He refused to leave his seat and stand off
to the side with Sorvino and Leno as Sheryl Crow sang a cut from
her latest album. Nor did he stand up and offer Crow his seat next
to Leno after she had finished.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman doesn't care one whit what we think. That much was
obvious when he blamed the media for last week's confusing events
that had everyone wondering whether the free agent was retiring,
taking a year off or coming back.
</P>
<P>
   But in case he's interested, we weren't the only ones who left
the studio sadly surmising that Rodman no longer is an entertainer
but a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a lot of respect for him today,'' Simon said, the
disappointment catching in her throat. ``He was very disrespectful
up there. You can be different. You don't have to go with the
crowd. But you still should have common courtesy. When he couldn't
even stand up for Sheryl Crow's song, that was the last straw as
far as I was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the lukewarm enthusiasm the crowd mustered for
Rodman's exit, we'd venture to say Crow's choice of songs probably
struck a chord with many of the people who arrived for the taping
as admirers of Rodman and left ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Its refrain?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't bring me anything but down.'' &QL;

FUNK REMAINS THE LEADER, BUT OTHERS FOLLOW CLOSELY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Fred Funk left the course Saturday as the
leader of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, but he did not leave very
happy. After building a three-stroke lead, Funk bogeyed two of his
final five holes. So instead of heading into Sunday's final round
with a cushion, Funk will have a one-stroke edge and a host of
competitors in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a three-under-par 69 at Bermuda Dunes Country Club,
Funk stood at 20 under par for the tournament (268), one stroke
ahead of Steve Pate, who shot a 69 Saturday at Tamarisk Country
Club, one of the tournament's four course locations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two players lifted themselves into a third-place tie
at 18 under par _ John Huston, who shot a 63 at Tamarisk, and Skip
Kendall, who shot a 64 at Indian Wells Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The field will play Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Private Course
at PGA West as one of the PGA Tour's rare 90-hole events concludes.
Four players will start the final round within two strokes of the
lead and the $540,000 first-place check. Funk was upset that he had
added to the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from having a pretty good lead to having a shootout,''
said Funk, who has played well early this season with 5th- and
12th-place finishes so far. ``I've made a lot of mistakes this
week, but I'm still in the lead, which is pretty amazing. And I can
still win the tournament. That's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the final day for the amateurs and, as usual, they
spent more time laughing than playing. The gallery got its final
glimpse of Michael Jordan, who spent four days playing with Charles
Barkley, the former professional football player Roy Green and four
different golf pros. Jordan's team finished at 46 under par. An
amateur team that included the former Mets outfielder Vince Coleman
won with a score of 55 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who will have surgery next week to repair a torn tendon
in his right index finger, signed autographs for fans waiting near
the clubhouse, but he did not stop for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, however, said it would be tough going back to his day
job _ trying to help the Houston Rockets win a National Basketball
Association title. ``I had a great time,'' said Barkley, who made
sure everyone in his foursome had a good time as well. ``I don't
know if I'd want to go back if I could do this every day. I've had
a great time. It's time for me to get serious, though. Mike wanted
me to play with him, and I'm glad I played with him. This is every
man's fantasy. But it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's golf game never improved during his four days of play,
however. Asked if he was glad that nobody in the gallery was struck
by one of his shots, Barkley said, ``The way I was hitting, it
wouldn't have hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent players hurt their chances in the tournament
Saturday. John Daly, who started just two strokes off the lead,
shot a 73 at the Palmer Course and fell into a tie for eighth, six
strokes off the lead. David Duval, who has won 8 of his last 27
starts, shot a 70 at the Palmer Course, leaving him seven strokes
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball pretty well, but I just couldn't make any
putts,'' he said. ``It's a shame. I could've gotten a lot closer.''
Duval did not sound optimistic about his chance to win. ``Even a 62
might not do it,'' he said. ``But we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston, however, had a bogey-free round that included nine
birdies. When Huston starts making birdies, they often come in
bunches.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm just happy to come in with a good score and get back closer
to the lead,'' he said. ``Anything can happen tomorrow. It's the
kind of course where you can shoot really low, or where you can
have a bad day. So it should be an interesting day.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer missed the cut at 284, shooting a four-round total
of 305. Palmer was greeted with a huge ovation as he approached the
18th green. Palmer, who is 69, said he was not sure if he would
play the Hope next year, although tournament officials want him to
return. ``This one has been very special to me,'' Palmer said,
``and there's a certain feeling about it that keeps me coming
back.'' He added that he was inspired to keep playing by his fans.
``When I walk down and I don't hear a sound, and there's no one
asking for autographs, I won't be there.''

Falcons find late-blooming formula under Reeves
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor Smith arrived at Falcons training camp this summer,
he knew this season would be different.
</P>
<P>
   He had been to every training camp since the first one in 1966,
but the summer of 1998 was his first both as Falcons president and
chairman of the board. It would be a tough year, the first since
his father Rankin Smith Sr. _ the only owner the Falcons had ever
known _ had passed away. Suddenly, this was his team, all the pain
to endure, any glory to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   And though he'd had inklings _ the Falcons had gone 6-2 over the
second half of last year _ he couldn't have known how different the
season would be.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are going to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Those long familiar with the Falcons franchise never thought
they'd see the day come. After all, this was a team that had
managed only seven winning seasons in 32 years. It was a team with
only one previous division title, earned after going 12-4 in 1980.
And as had become all too typical, that 1980 season came crashing
to a halt. The Falcons took a 24-10 lead into the fourth quarter of
a playoff game against Dallas. A capacity crowd of more than 60,000
watched as the Cowboys then scored 20 points for a 30-27 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody playing on this level is competitive,'' said former
linebacker Tommy Nobis, who played for Atlanta from 1966-76, only
twice experiencing winning seasons. ``Anytime you are competitive
and you get beat and beat often, it's not much fun. The credibility
and respect, the lack of, when losing, comes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had won only one playoff game since (a 27-20 victory
over New Orleans in 1991) before this season began.
</P>
<P>
   But what has made the Falcons stand out is the losing seasons.
The Falcons weren't just bad, they were horrible. They've had 12
seasons in which they've won four games or fewer. They've had eight
seasons begin with an 0-3 mark. They've had eight different head
coaches (not counting interim). And in a classic move that proved
he didn't learn from his mistakes, Smith rehired one coach more
than a decade after he'd been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Norb Hecker was Atlanta's first coach. In slightly more than two
seasons, he won only four games, lost 26 and tied one. Norm Van
Brocklin was brought in as the replacement in 1968 after the
Falcons started 0-3. The Falcons finished that season 2-12.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchman led Atlanta to a 9-5 season in 1973, his fifth full
year at the helm. But when they started 2-6 the following season,
he, too, was fired. Marion Campbell took over and the Falcons would
lose 19 of 25 under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in 1975 (as the No. 1 pick), they had zero
respectability and a really bad football team,'' quarterback Steve
Bartkowski (1975-85) told the Palm Beach Post last year. ``I think
my college team (California) could have taken them to the mat.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were looking up when Smith hired Leeman Bennett in 1977.
A 4-10 team became a .500 team that year. His second year, Atlanta
won a wild-card spot, going 9-7. Two years later came the first
divisional title, and Bennett still holds the distinction of being
the only Falcons coach until Dan Reeves to have a winning record.
But after losing a playoff game in Minnesota during the
strike-shortened 1982 season, Bennett was fired and Dan Henning was
hired to be coach No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons finished in last place in Henning's first three
seasons, going 22-41-1 overall. And when the Falcons lost to the
0-13 Colts at home near the end of 1986, the search began for coach
No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   After their first couple of choices fell through, Smith decided
to let history repeat itself and rehired Campbell. His previous
6-19 reign proved no fluke. This time, Campbell went 11-32 until
being ousted with four games remaining in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immensely proud of bringing the Falcons to Atlanta and
keeping the team in Atlanta,'' Taylor Smith said of his father. ``I
think he was very disappointed that he didn't have more success
than he did while he was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The quirky Jerry Glanville entered the picture in 1990, but even
Elvis didn't show up to collect his free tickets during Atlanta's
only winning season (10-6 wild-card team in 1991) out of four under
the former Oilers coach.
</P>
<P>
   June Jones tried his hand for three seasons. He took the Falcons
back to the wild-card game in '95 with a 9-7 mark. But after going
3-13 the next year, he too was sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Glanville, the Falcons had fun _ off the field, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said we'd have a Breathalyzer at the door, and whoever
wasn't drunk couldn't come home,'' former Falcons linebacker Tim
Green told the Palm Beach Post. ``We thought he was kidding, but he
wasn't. It was the closest thing to living in the old West. It
sounds juvenile, but it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But fun took over and football got shoved way down on the
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our fun and didn't concentrate that much on football,''
Green said. ``When you're in a hot city like Atlanta, (stuff)
happens. If we did some good things on the field, we could win, but
if things turned against us, that was it. The word on the Falcons
was they'll give you a good minute, but if you get them down,
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was more of a disciplinarian and let the players know it.
When defensive end Chuck Smith spoke out about his desire for a
more defensive-minded coach (Jones was known for his run-and-shoot
offense), he found himself suspended for a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been through so many negative things,'' said
Smith, now in his seventh season with the Falcons. ``I got
suspended for saying what I believed in. But we fought for what we
believed in, and along with some other veterans and coach Reeves,
we turned things around. I'm really glad we got a defensive-minded
coach in.''
</P>
<P>
   With Reeves, the Falcons got a coach they could respect. This
was a guy with eight Super Bowls of experience as a player and
coach. This was a guy who played for Tom Landry, who coached the
Denver Broncos to three Super Bowls and who turned the New York
Giants into a division winner. But most of all, this was a coach
who still remembered how it was to be a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Dan the `Gotti' of the football team,'' said
cornerback Ray Buchanan, in his second year with the Falcons. ``He
keeps everything clean. He treats us as professionals as long as we
act professional. Dan doesn't care if you party, just don't be a
(jerk) about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a franchise riddled with bad decisions, and the
coaching was only one part, albeit a large one, of the poor
choices. Bad drafts, bad trades and missed opportunities also dot
the franchise's history, the most significant being the Brett Favre
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time league MVP was Atlanta's second-round pick in
1991. Glanville reportedly didn't like Favre's potential, and he
was traded to Green Bay in 1992 for a first-round pick. The Falcons
eventually took running back Tony Smith with that pick. He was with
the Falcons only three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Falcons traded three draft picks, including their
'94 and '95 first-round picks, to the Indianapolis Colts for
quarterback Jeff George, whom they had selected with their No. 1
pick four years earlier, then traded to Indianapolis. George had a
much-publicized sideline fight with Jones and was suspended, then
later released with no compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get better without gaining impact players in the
draft, and the Falcons had no first-round picks from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons couldn't keep high-profile multi-sport athletes
Brian Jordan or Deion Sanders. The two baseball/football stars went
separate ways, Jordan turning to baseball after the Falcons
wouldn't meet his salary demands, Sanders turning down more money
in Atlanta to sign with a winning franchise, the 49ers. Jordan, a
longtime St. Louis Cardinal, is now back in Atlanta with the
Braves. Sanders, who played in the World Series with the Braves,
owns Super Bowl rings from his time in San Francisco and now
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Again, enter Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the winningest active coach in the NFL want to come to
a franchise with such a pitiful history? The Smith family was
willing to relinquish control. Reeves came in not only as head
coach but as executive vice president of football operations as
well. What that fancy title means is he makes the football
decisions, from the draft to the contract negotiations to the play
calling.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing he did was execute the trade that brought the
franchise extra draft picks in 1997. He obtained cornerback Michael
Booker, running back Byron Hanspard, tight end O.J. Santiago and
linebacker Henri Crockett with those picks. All but Hanspard will
start in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the big coup that year was the trade with Houston that
brought quarterback Chris Chandler to the Falcons. The Oilers got a
fourth-and sixth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Starting safety Eugene Robinson (1998), starting cornerback Ray
Buchanan (1997), starting fullback Bob Christian (1997, now on
injured reserve), fullback Brian Kozlowski (1997, starting for
Christian), starting safety William White (1997) and starting
cornerback Ronnie Bradford (1997) were all free agents Reeves
managed to lure.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 39 players on the 53-man roster have come aboard since
Reeves took control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sum up (what's been wrong all these years),'' said
Nobis, who is now the Falcons' vice president of corporate
development. ``Each coach has been in a different situation, but
what is obvious is that we've never had a coach here with the
credentials of Dan. And he influences everything. He brought a way
of managing these players and a system that's proven to be a
winning system.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Reeves admits he never expected a Super Bowl run. After
all, he took over a team that went 3-13 two years ago. Despite a
6-2 streak at the end of last season, it was still a Falcons team
that began 1-7 and once again dashed fans' hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible when you think about it, coming from 1-7
halfway through our first year,'' Reeves said. ``All my life, every
football coach I ever played for preached the same things that we
try to, and when you have a football team that believes in those
things and executes them I couldn't be prouder.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Smith family, once much-maligned in Atlanta.
Average in-house attendance last year was only 40,000, and
Falcon-haters became so prominent that in Rankin Smith's final
years, he couldn't go out in public without being heckled. When he
died in October of 1997, the Falcons' record was 1-6. That same
day, they lost to the Carolina Panthers to fall to 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling he's enjoying the success,'' Taylor Smith
said, ``looking down and kind of saying, `If you needed me to get
out of the way, then I guess it was great. I hope everybody is
having fun down there.'''
</P>
<P>
   They are for now. Continuing to do so is the bigger challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a lot of work to do here,'' Nobis said.
``With what's happened in our past, we've got to have some
consistency. There were fans who jumped on the bandwagon (in the
past), only to be disappointed. It's been a roller-coaster ride, a
yo-yo, up-and-down thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will wait. They don't want to see just a year,
year and a half of winning. They want to see consistency. We know
nobody is going to go to the Super Bowl every year, but we need to
win more games than we lose. When we have that consistency for a
while, they'll come back.''

POPE CALLS ON FAITHFUL TO ``BUILD A BETTER AMERICA''
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RICHARD VARA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With the revered gold-framed image of the Virgin
of Guadalupe as a backdrop, Pope John Paul II won roaring applause
Saturday as he called for the end of violence, discrimination and
other social abuses in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to banish once and for all from the
(American) continent every attack against life,'' the pope said.
``No more violence, terrorism and drug trafficking! No more torture
or other forms of abuse! There must be an end to the unnecessary
recourse to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more exploitation of the weak, racial discrimination or
ghettoes of poverty,'' the pontiff exhorted. ``Never again!''
</P>
<P>
   The forceful words brought hearty applause from the estimated
10,000 invited worshipers _ including hundreds of Roman Catholic
bishops, priests and lay leaders from throughout Mexico and the
Americas _ at a Mass celebrated inside the Basilica of Our Lady of
Guadalupe here. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The pope's sermon underscored the goals of a final report of
the Synod of Bishops for America, which was held at the Vatican in
late 1997. Bishops at the assembly focused on the massive spiritual
and social problems facing the church in North and South America in
the new millennium. They made several recommendations to define the
church's role.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the bishops, John Paul traveled to Mexico City
to formally conclude the synod and accept its report at the
basilica Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff's sermon reflected the impassioned call for social
justice through spiritual renewal and evangelization in the final
30-page synod document.
</P>
<P>
   The pope called for men and women to become aware of their
spiritual responsibilities through the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will inspire them to build a better America,'' the pope
said.
</P>
<P>
   Applause from the congregation repeatedly interrupted his
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at an evening visit with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo and foreign ambassadors, John Paul renewed his criticism of
unfettered capitalism, corruption and ``excessive individualism''
on a global scale
</P>
<P>
   The pope warned that even though the modern economy holds great
promise for human progress, its emphasis on markets poses grave
risks to freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human history cannot direct itself against humanity,'' John
Paul told the dignitaries. ``That would be the same as directing
itself against God.
</P>
<P>
   ``This continent can be the continent of hope if its human
communities and its leadership classes make a common ethical
foundation their own,'' the pope said. ``I hope that in the near
future, respect for life, for truth and for the dignity of every
human being prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking to the diplomats, the pope met privately with
Zedillo for 40 minutes _ twice as long as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Problems such as corruption, poor government administration, a
lack of human rights and other ills have long plagued Latin
America. Countries in the region are struggling to develop
political, social and cultural strategies in the face of
crisis-plagued economies, persistent unemployment and burgeoning
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Norbeto Rivera of Mexico, in his welcoming remarks to
the pope in the basilica, said the world is undergoing ``an absurd
time of hopelessness and injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America _ the continent of hope _ finds itself among
corruption and violence, and we are anguished,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope did not read the synod report, which was formally
released to the public, in the basilica. The document reflected
John Paul's view that America should be seen as one entity rather
than be divided into north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems addressed by the report was economic
globalization. ``If globalization is ruled merely by the laws of
the market applied to suit the powerful, the consequences cannot
but be negative,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the synod praised globalization for bringing
different peoples together and for efficient and increased
production.
</P>
<P>
   The synod stopped short of a call for lending nations to forgive
the debt of poorer, developing countries. But it criticized high
interest rates and blamed ``the irresponsibility of people in
government who, in incurring debt, have given too little thought to
the real possibility of repaying it.'' It recommended new studies
of foreign debt problems and criticized corrupt officials for
pocketing money intended for national development.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged greater involvement of morally conscious
Christian laity to eradicate corruption, an endemic problem in
Latin America. It called for church and government leaders to
cooperate in developing economic projects to lessen dependence on
drug crops as a source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The report called drug trafficking ``one of the most urgent
challenges which many nations need to address.'' The narcotics
trade, it went on, ``is, in fact, a challenge which threatens many
features of the human progress achieved in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive issue of the church's role in helping the poor,
the document reiterated the necessity for a spiritual commitment to
help the needy. The document warned, however, that it should not be
an exclusive focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In loving the poor, the Christian imitates the attitude of the
Lord, who during his earthly life devoted himself with special
compassion to all those in spiritual and material need.''
</P>
<P>
   It urged that all work by priests and lay leaders with the poor
be directed to a spiritual encounter with Christ. Many activist
priests and bishops, especially those with leanings toward
liberation theology, have encouraged social activism, if not
outright rebellion, to undo social and economic repression.
</P>
<P>
   The document rejected discrimination against women, a sensitive
issue in many male-dominated Latin American countries. It
encouraged women to take leadership roles in American society and
church life.
</P>
<P>
   The synod report will be the foundation for various American
churches to work together in new evangelization and outreach
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The intense emotional bond between the Mexican people and the
frail spiritual leader of the Catholic Church was evident on the
second day of the pope's five-day visit to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people lined the papal procession route
to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, where the pontiff
celebrated the first publicly broadcast Mass of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva el papa!'' or ``Long live the pope,'' thundered through
the massive semi-circular basilica when the 78-year old pontiff
entered. The basilica houses the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe,
which, the faithful say, mysteriously appeared on a cloak about 500
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is especially devoted to the Virgin of Guadalupe and
announced that the feast of the Virgin, Dec. 12, will be officially
celebrated in both North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the pope spent several minutes alone in private
prayer, standing at eye-level with the Virgin's image.
</P>
<P>

UCLA WINS BY TKO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE _ Baron Davis threw the first punch, an uppercut from
his left kidney that ended wildly, finding nothing but air. So did
the next punch, an aimless right cross, and the next, a
limped-wristed left.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was his intent. Davis wasn't swinging at anyone.
He was making a statement.
</P>
<P>
   After a first half in which Louisville was the aggressor, after
a halftime in which UCLA coach Steve Lavin challenged his team's
desire and after his dazzling, anti-gravity reverse layup gave UCLA
a lead it would relinquish just once _ and very briefly _ Davis'
exultant punches foretold a knockout performance by UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the turning point in the game,'' Davis said. ``We
caught them on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals never recovered. Stunned and staggered, they
watched UCLA take command with its most impressive half of the
season _ mixing patient offense and sound defense to defeat
Louisville 82-70 on Saturday afternoon in front of 19,987 at
Freedom Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' Davis continued. ``If we can just carry out the
way we played today for the rest of the season, the sky's the limit
for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, the NCAA Tournament. The victory came without
starting center Dan Gadzuric (sprained ankle) and improved UCLA's
record to 14-4. Now, it seems, only a collapse will prevent the
Bruins from accruing the 18 or 19 victories needed for an at-large
berth. The more wins they get in January, the greater their margin
for error in the final month _ when they make the rugged Bay Area
and Arizona road trips.
</P>
<P>
   But there were temporal effects, as the Bruins were quick to
note in their cramped cube of a locker room in Freedom Hall. The
second half _ in which UCLA outscored the Cardinals 51-32 and
outshot them 66.7 percent to 34.5 percent _ provided a paradigm for
the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   To survive next week at Washington, or in three weeks at
Stanford, the Bruins must recreate the poise and precision they
showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, they were the more patient team, the more
relaxed team and the better conditioned team. (Ray Young, Jerome
Moiso and Earl Watson played every minute as Lavin, spotting their
rhythm and confidence, instantly whittled his rotation.) Their
gambling, lunging defense was replaced by thinking and footwork.
The wasted motion and scattered play of recent weeks was compressed
into taut execution _ no bad shots, no poor passes, no silly fouls.
</P>
<P>
   And after a 20-minute absence, their energy returned, courtesy
of the season's most productive halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I don't mind the air balls or drop-kicking
the ball into the fifth row, seat six, as long as they play with
fight,'' Lavin said. ``If you're going to make mistakes, make
aggressive mistakes. If you're going to lose, go down swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Davis did after his dazzling layup with
18:30 remaining. It gave the Bruins a 39-38 lead _ their first
since midway through the first half _ and sparked a game-changing
11-2 surge.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, UCLA had a 53-44 lead and the reeling
Cardinals called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came out in the second half, they were a whole new
team,'' Louisville guard Cameron Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would finish with 25 points, a career high, and six
assists. But unlike the Oregon win _ when he often was one man
against five _ he had solid support. Not every Bruin played well,
but no one played poorly. Even Watson's nine turnovers were
harmless, since most came in the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Without Gadzuric, his frontcourt partner, Moiso started
passively and gained aggression as the second half unfurled. He
made 1 of 7 shots in the first half and 7 of 8 in the second,
finishing with 17 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Forward JaRon Rush, again struggling from the perimeter, had
three steals and nine rebounds. And Young, who started in
Gadzuric's place, played harrowing defense and rattled Murray into
many of his seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made this such a tremendous win is (without Gadzuric) we
had to have people help with the rebounding and the defense,''
Lavin said. ``That's a sign of a team starting to mature....
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we were quicker. We beat them to the
punch.''

Texas A&AMP;M beats Baylor at buzzer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ It was only fitting that the battle to escape the cellar in
the Big 12 would come down to a shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M guard Chris Clayton made a 22-foot jumper as time
expired to give the Aggies a 57-56 victory over Baylor on Saturday,
stunning the crowd of 3,431 at the Ferrell Center.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 54 when Baylor center Kish Lewis was
fouled by A&AMP;M's Joe White as Lewis attempted a baseline turnaround
shot. Lewis, who had 10 points and eight rebounds, went to the line
with 2.5 seconds remaining and made both free throws to put Baylor
up 56-54.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had any timeouts left, so White took the ball on
the baseline and heaved a full-court pass. The Hail Mary throw
landed in the lane, where a group of players leaped for the ball,
but A&AMP;M's Jerald Brown managed to tip it outside to Clayton on the
left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton let the ball fly and swished a 3-pointer as the buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that our victory play,'' Clayton said. ``Joe got the
ball down to Jerald, who is supposed to tip it to either side. We
do it in practice all the time. My man went inside to Joe's pass,
so I got a good look and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor forward Jamie Kendrick, who led the Bears with 13 points,
thought his team deserved a better outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just real tough when you play your heart out and
something like that happens in the last second,'' Kendrick said.
``I saw it go in, and I couldn't believe it. It was like a
flashback to Valparaiso's victory in the NCAA Tournament last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Valparaiso guard Bryce Drew, now a rookie with the Rockets, made
a similar shot to defeat Mississippi in a NCAA Tournament game last
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about Valparaiso, but a lot of teams use that
play,'' Aggies coach Melvin Watkins said. ``Cincinnati used it to
beat Duke this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it on our last timeout, and the kids executed
it perfectly. But I know it takes some luck to make a play like
that. We do it in practice until we make it, and the percentages
are not good. Sometimes we have to run it five or six times.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory for the Aggies (8-8 overall, 1-5 Big 12) ends a
seven-game losing streak this season but a much longer drought in
conference road games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the first road victory for A&AMP;M in a league game
since March 4, 1995, when the Aggies defeated the Bears 87-78 in a
Southwest Conference game. A&AMP;M had lost 25 consecutive conference
road games until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets the monkey off our backs,'' said A&AMP;M guard Clifton
Cook, who had 15 points and a career-high 11 rebounds for his sixth
double-double. ``Now we can go to practice with a positive attitude
instead of having our heads down. We have to keep this going.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (6-14, 0-7) just hopes it can get something going after
such a heart-breaking loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not easy,'' Baylor coach Harry Miller said. ``Our guys
were completely silent in the locker room. It's a very
disappointing and emotional loss for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he would have handled the last play differently had
Baylor been able to call a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had another timeout, we would had put someone on the
inbounds passer to make him throw it in the backcourt,'' Miller
said. ``But who knows. Someone might have hit a half-court shot had
we done that. It's one of those things that happens, but it's very
disappointing for our team.''

Local heroes' enshrinement will enhance gem in Waco
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ Four prominent Houston sports figures _ Roger Clemens, Larry
Dierker, Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon _ will become official
state icons Wednesday when they are enshrined in the Texas Sports
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   They will join Judy Rankin and three posthumous inductees _
Sandra Meadows, Bill Foster and Rube Foster _ to give the exclusive
club an entry list many believe to be the best in the history of
the prestigious establishment.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago when the opportunity to salute the
sports heroes of the state was a thing of the past. From 1987
through 1992, the public had about as much access to the Texas
Sports Hall of Fame as people crossing the Atlantic have to the
Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   After 35 years on display in Grand Prairie, the facility had
gone into exile. It was nothing more than a warehouse of boxes
filled with plaques and memorabilia of Texas legends.
</P>
<P>
   This hibernation of honor included some of the biggest names in
sports history _ baseball great Tris Speaker, Texas A&AMP;M running
back John David Crow, University of Texas and Oilers running back
Earl Campbell, four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt, and
Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And few people seemed to care. The Grand Prairie facility was a
bust and shut down in 1986, so something had to change if a museum
of sports accomplishments was going to be reborn in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent members of the Waco community, including
former Waco Mayor Bob Sheehy and Baylor president Herbert Reynolds,
created a plan in 1990 to have the facility moved to Waco. That
difficult task became a reality in April 1993 when the Texas Sports
Hall of Fame had its grand opening in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The patience and hard work of dozens of community leaders has
paid off, because the facility turned a profit in 1998 for the
first time. Executive director Steve Fallon, who took over the job
three years ago, said attendance was up 18 percent last year and
revenue increased 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sports fans in Texas are starting to appreciate the
importance of the facility and its impressive members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times in the past when inductees didn't want
to go to the ceremony,'' Fallon said. ``They didn't know anything
about the Hall and didn't think it was something they needed to
show up for.
</P>
<P>
   ``When George Foreman was given a tribute room in 1994, he
didn't want to come up here. Once he got here and saw it and the
facility, he stood up at the banquet and apologized to everyone for
being so nonchalant about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thing has happened several times in recent years
when inductees come to Waco for the first time and see a building
that has become one of the finest hall of fame facilities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   One of the changes that brought increased attention and success
to the facility was the plan to bring together all the hall of fame
organizations in Texas. Charlie McCleary, founder of the Texas
Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum, was instrumental in combining all
the sports organizations into one location when the Hall moved to
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The TSHF, which was established by the Texas Sportswriters
Association in 1951, now houses the Texas High School Football Hall
of Fame, the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame, the Texas
Baseball Hall of Fame and the Texas Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Each organization has separate rules and procedures for
nominating people for induction, but all the members now are
showcased at the Waco facility.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Waco and Baylor University were instrumental in
getting the TSHF moved to Central Texas. Baylor agreed to a land
swap with the city so the building could be constructed just east
of Interstate 35 near the Brazos River and close to the Texas
Ranger Hall of Fame. The city issued certificates of obligation for
$1 million to begin the construction.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors to the 15,000-square-foot facility has
grown each year, with more than 50,000 patrons passing through the
TSHF in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the people in charge realized visitors are not enough to
allow the project to grow and prosper. For the TSHF to be
successful, new ideas would be needed to bring in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a nonprofit entity like this, you have to come up
with creative ideas to generate funds,'' Fallon said. ``People are
encouraged to join our Good Sport Club, which is a booster
organization with special opportunities for the members. We also
have been successful in renting out the facility to various groups
for parties and receptions.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be quite a party Wednesday with so many well-known
sports names being inducted. Fallon said they are expecting their
biggest crowd ever for the induction banquet and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem each year is trying to pick a date when
all the inductees can attend,'' Fallon said. ``The NBA lockout
messed things up this year because we had picked a day when the
Rockets were off, but it changed to Hakeem having to miss part of
the team's training camp. (Rockets coach) Rudy Tomjanovich really
helped us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich decided to call off the team's late workout
Wednesday so he and team vice president Carroll Dawson could attend
the induction ceremony for Olajuwon and Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon also had to pick a day when the University of Houston
didn't have a basketball game so Drexler, the UH coach, could
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde was a little hesitant about it,'' Fallon said. ``But
(former UH coach) Guy Lewis (a 1994 inductee) talked to him and is
coming up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing was much easier to work out for Clemens and Dierker,
who don't head for spring training until next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out great for Larry because he will be on the Astros
Caravan tour,'' Fallon said. ``They will be in Temple the day
before the banquet, then he will come up here with (Astros owner)
Drayton McLane and several players.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti will be two of the players who
will watch their manager inducted into the TSHF.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling conflicts kept two new inductees _ Dallas Cowboys
defensive back Mel Renfro and jockey Jerry Bailey _ from being
enshrined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro has a commitment at the Super Bowl activities in Miami
and Bailey will ride Kentucky Derby prospect Answer Lively at
Gulfstream Park, but both will be inducted in June, along with
former Oilers head coach Bum Phillips, after the TSHF's annual golf
tournament.

FUNK STAYS IN FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA -- Fred Funk was breezing along with a four-stroke
lead in Saturday's fourth round of the $3 million Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic when he went into, well, a funk.
</P>
<P>
   A sizeable advantage soon was reduced to one shot and set up
what promises to be a final-round scramble for the $540,000 first
prize today at PGA West's Arnold Palmer Course.
</P>
<P>
   Funk, a former University of Maryland golf coach, bogeyed two of
his final five holes and settled for a three-under 69 at Bermuda
Dunes Country Club to leave him at 20-under 268, one stroke ahead
of Steve Pate. At 18-under was John Huston, who had a nine-under 63
at Tamarisk Country Club, and Skip Kendall, who had a 64 at Indian
Wells. At 17-under was Bob Estes, after a 67 at Bermuda Dunes,
followed by Scott Verplank at 16-under and Gabriel Hjertstedt at
15-under.
</P>
<P>
   A group of five players at 14-under included John Daly, who
struggled to a one-over 73 at PGA West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of good things this week,'' Funk said, ``but
I've also made a lot of mistakes. I've gone from having a pretty
good lead to a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still win the tournament. That's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk also has a less-than-impressive track record at the Hope to
think about. This is his 10th appearance in the tournament, and he
has missed the cut five times. He tied for 43rd a year ago, and his
best-ever finish was a tie for 14th in 1994, when he won $19,250.
</P>
<P>
   But Funk does sound a little more confident this year,
especially after rounds of 65-68-66-69.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got a little uptight in the past, he said, ``knowing
you have to shoot 5-, 6- or 7-under every day. But this year, I
came in here playing really good, and I'm just going to let it
happen tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he would take a similar approach. He has been close
before -- he finished second in last year's Buick Invitational and
was 10th in the PGA Championship -- and hoped he learned a few
lessons from those near-misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get there, he said. ``Hopefully, one of
these times it will go my way.''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely went Huston's way Saturday. Huston, who set a
72-hole tour record for strokes under par when he went 28-under in
winning last year's Hawaiian Open, did not have a bogey. His
longest birdie putt was a 25-footer on the par-3, 199-yard fifth
hole, and twice he two-putted for birdies on par fives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good day,'' Huston said. ``I drove the ball really
well, and I hit a lot of greens, so I kept giving myself chances.
Then I made a lot of really good putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too hard. I didn't feel like I had to take any
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Verplank, the tour's Comeback Player of the Year in 1998, has
started the '99 season strongly. He closed out 1998 by finished
third in Las Vegas and tied for fifth in the Tour Championship.
David Duval played his 11th consecutive round below par Saturday,
but his 70 at PGA West left him seven shots behind.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was at four-under 284, and a number of recognizable
figures didn't make it. They included Paul Azinger, Andrew Magee
(who had a 10-over 82 on Thursday), Mark Calcavecchia, Tom Kite,
Steve Jones, 1997 Hope champion John Cook and Fuzzy Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer was last at 17-over 305, but he did close his 75
on Saturday did feature a birdie on his final hole, the par-5,
532-yard 18th hole.

UMASS COMES CLOSE BUT FIZZLES IN END

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Temple's matchup zone was hardly a problem. Few
teams walk away from a game against the Owls saying that, but the
University of Massachusetts could Saturday. And that is what
bothered Minuteman coach Bruiser Flint most about his team's 65-57
Atlantic 10 defeat to its heated rival.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:27 left, the Minutemen trailed, 54-50, having weathered a
raucous Apollo crowd of 9,246 and just about everything the Owls
threw at them. At some moments it even frustrated a Temple offense
that played without starting point guard Pepe Sanchez (knee
injury). His absence was evident with 2:57 left, when a stiff UMass
defensive stand forced Temple to call time out with five seconds on
the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, UMass, which rallied from a 7-point deficit to
lead by as many as 5 in the first half, appeared poised to make
another dramatic run. Then came the unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, Temple guard Rasheed Brokenborough split the
defense to haul in an inbounds pass and scored as the shot clock
expired. On UMass's ensuing possession, forward Chris Kirkland
threw a low-post pass to center Kitwana Rhymer, who had his back
turned when the ball sailed past him and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   A free throw by center Kevin Lyde gave the Owls a 57-50 lead,
and a mixup in the backcourt on UMass's next possession led to
Temple guard Quincy Wadley stepping in front of a
Kirkland-to-Rafael Cruz pass and scoring on a breakaway layup,
giving Temple a 9-point lead with 2:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   Checkmate. Even with two minutes left, it was evident the
Minutemen would not recover. Coupled with 3-of-6 shooting from the
foul line over the last 9:34, the Minutemen blew one of their best
opportunities to capture an impressive road victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question,'' said Flint, whose Minutemen (8-9, 4-2)
have reduced their already low margin of error even further. Having
dropped below .500 again, the Minutemen can ill afford to lose many
of their remaining 11 games. That's what made Saturday so crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was the best we've ever played against the
zone,'' Flint said. ``We got everything pretty much we wanted. We
got the ball inside. We got open looks on the 3-point shot. We got
penetration to the basket. I thought we got whatever we wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the first half, when we got turnovers, we got them
because they were knocking the ball out of our hands, not because
the zone was gobbling us up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UMass had more problems with Temple freshman forward
Mark Karcher's offense (21 points) than the Owls defense. His
output included 11 points during a 5:24 stretch that gave Temple a
53-46 lead with 5:25 to go. Lamont Barnes and Wadley added 15
points each for the Owls (13-6, 7-0), who won despite being
outrebounded, 43-32. Temple coach John Chaney said although it was
difficult without Sanchez, his team finished with just five
turnovers, including one in the second half, and none from his
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Pepe, it could have been disaster,'' said Chaney, who
beat UMass in Amherst without Sanchez last season. ``It should have
been. We shouldn't have won this game. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass guard Monty Mack finished with one of his best outputs of
the season, posting team highs in points (27) and rebounds (nine).
Yet after draining a trey with 10:04 left to cut Temple's lead to
43-41, Mack didn't score again until 5:08 mark, when he hit two
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Minuteman to score in double figures was
Kirkland, who finished with 10 points and played 35 minutes despite
cutting the palm of his right hand with about 4 minutes left. He
required six stitches. With no other go-to guy and poor foul
shooting, UMass was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing together well. We just can't play any lower
than this, and we can't let our confidence get any lower,'' said
Mack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go out there and play our game.''

JACOBSEN ENJOYS TIME WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA -- There was plenty of crowd noise, sometimes during
his backswing, but Peter Jacobsen still said he had a great time
playing with Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan in Saturday's
fourth round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time,'' he said. ``People screamed for
autographs during my backswing a few times, but you have to expect
that, playing with guys like that. Michael plays well. I've played
a lot of golf with him. Roy (Green, another of his playing
partners) is a good player. Charles ... had a couple of good
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen even resorted to strumming the guitar while Barkley
prepared to hit from the tee on the par-3, 130-yard 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just singing the Barkley blues,'' said Jacobsen, who
also has made a name for himself as a member of his musical group
``Jake Trout and the Flounders,'' which features several members of
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan joked that Barkley needed the music to help with the
rhythm of his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dancing with his feet all day,'' he told ABC's Jimmy
Roberts. ``He might as well do it to some music.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's practice swing looks good, but hitting a ball in front
of him is another matter. He pauses on his downswing, which often
results in errant shots. One almost hit Jordan on the par-4,
439-yard seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, asked to put Barkley's swing into words, took a long
pause before responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's unnerving,'' Jacobsen said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's group finished a net 46-under par. The Houston Rockets
forward -- he signed his new contract on the 10th tee at Tamarisk
Country Club during Thursday's second round -- said he would like
to play more, but there's a little matter of professional
basketball getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do this every day,'' Barkley said. ``But it's time for
me to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is every man's fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples finished 72-75-72-71--290 and became the second
consecutive defending champion to miss the four-round cut. John
Cook, who won in 1997, was a casualty of last year's final round.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kelly made the first double-eagle of the year when he
holed his second shot on the par-5, 483-yard 14th hole at Indian
Wells CC. The tour's last double-eagle was made by Woody Austin at
last year's Kemper Open.

NORSTROM ENTERS NHL'S CHINA SHOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though it's dressed up as a North America vs. the
World grudge match, the NHL All-Star Game has the soul of a talent
show. It's about scorers, skaters and goalies showing off, as much
a ballet audition as serious sport. Tooth-cracking combat will be
no more welcome tonight on the indoor ice of Tampa, Fla., than on
Swan Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Which could be a problem for Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   If the Swedish-born Kings defenseman has a spectacular skill to
display, it's not his wrist shot but his knack for the
well-measured check. His statistics at midweek showed one goal and
122 ``hits'' this season, the former making him an unlikely
All-Star but the latter ranking him second among NHL players at his
position.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, bruising body blows are something of an All-Star
taboo, and they certainly weren't part of the Saturday-night skills
competition. So, what's a defensive defenseman to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the question I had, too,'' Norstrom said with a laugh
the other night at the Forum as he prepared to join Kings teammates
Rob Blake and Luc Robitaille on a Friday-morning flight to Florida.
``Normally you go to the All-Star Game to show off your
stick-handling, your passing. That's not going to fit me, really.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Norstrom, 27, feels undeserving of his first All-Star
trip, he shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time a low-scoring defenseman was honored _ the first
since Detroit's Mike Ramsey in the '80s _ and Norstrom was the
right man for it.
</P>
<P>
   What his dull numbers _ the three assists to go with the one
goal scored in an early-season tie with Colorado _ don't show is
that Norstrom is the workhorse of the Kings defense, a
well-conditioned, 6-foot-2, 201-pound presence who rarely makes
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When Blake won the Norris Trophy last season as the league's
outstanding defenseman, some of the credit went to Norstrom, whose
reliability allowed his partner to take chances, scoring 23 goals.
</P>
<P>
   And although he'll play along with the joke that he's going to
the All-Star Game as unskilled labor, Norstrom is a surprisingly
nimble skater for a player his size. Such mobility is something
that can't be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Checking, apparently, can be taught. It wasn't part of
Norstrom's game when the New York Rangers brought him to the United
States in '93 from the spacious rinks of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The told me if I was going to play on this team, this was the
kind of defenseman we'll need you to be,'' he said. He went to
Binghampton of the AHL and learned to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Norstrom never had a chance in New York, getting into 43
games over three seasons. In a meeting he remembers well,
management told him to be patient. Four weeks later, he was traded
with Ray Ferraro, Ian Laperriere Nathan LaFayette and a draft
choice to the Kings for Marty McSorley, Jari Kurri and Shane
Churla.
</P>
<P>
   That was March '96. Norstrom has played in all but 11 Kings
games since then, and played for Sweden in the Nagano Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this season, his NHL totals were just four goals and
40 assists. The All-Star Game? ``I never thought it would happen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom expected to spend the All-Star break with his wife,
Kristin. Maybe he'd take one of his two Harley Davidsons for a spin
on PCH.
</P>
<P>
   What King wouldn't want a break after a half-season in which the
injury-wracked team opened 6-17-3, went on a 9-4-0 run to get back
in playoff range, then slipped back in the last week?
</P>
<P>
   ``One step forward, two steps back,'' Norstrom said wearily. ``I
was looking forward to a couple of days with the wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, brightening, ``I'd do this any day.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star call didn't come until Wednesday, when the New York
Islanders' Kenny Jonsson was injured and Norstrom was picked off
the top of the league general managers' list of alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, second in the league with 25 goals, also got to
Tampa as an alternate, after Detroit's Steve Yzerman broke his nose
Thursday night. That gave the Kings three All-Stars, as many as any
of the division leaders except Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Strange. But wonderful for Norstrom, who seems amused by the
turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what's going to happen,'' he said,
expecting other players to ``look at me kind of weird'' if he threw
a serious shoulder tonight. ``Maybe I'll just skate around out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he should throw off his defenseman's shackles and join
the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may just surprise himself,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson
said. ``Maybe he'll come back as a goal scorer.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial was thrown
into turmoil Saturday, after a federal judge ordered Monica
Lewinsky to submit to questioning from House Republican prosecutors
or the independent counsel's office, and Senate Republicans said
they would query the president in writing.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lewinsky arrived here from Los Angeles, her lawyers were
working out the details of when and where she would meet with the
prosecutors. House aides said the meeting would likely happen on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's anxious and she wants to get this over with,'' said an
associate of Ms. Lewinsky. ``This has been a one-year nightmare,
and she wants to get on with her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the Senate wrapped up a second day of questions
and answers on the floor, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, was
quick to seize upon a comment by a White House counsel, Gregory
Craig, who had said in answering a question about the possibility
of an interrogatory that the White House would ``get responses to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott told reporters: ``We do expect to send a letter or some
questions down to the White House with the president, I believe by
Monday. We'd like to see what the president has to say about some
of the inconsistencies in the testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman, James Kennedy, later clarified Craig's
remarks, saying that Clinton's lawyers, but not the president,
would answer any additional queries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in particular expressed outrage at the day's events.
In a last-ditch effort to block Ms. Lewinsky's interview, Sen. Tom
Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, appealed to Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who is presiding over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Permitting the prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky at this
stage would violate the Senate's constitutional authority to try
impeachments, Harkin argued in a letter that he hand-delivered to
Rehnquist's clerk. But congressional lawyers said that Rehnquist
had no standing to overrule the order.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's uproar and extraordinary political theater came after
eight days of plodding civility, as the House prosecutors then the
White House lawyers presented their arguments, and then senators
posed written questions to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   While the imminent questioning of the president and Ms.
Lewinsky, the central figures in the yearlong scandal, promised
fresh drama, it was unsure what new information they might add to
volumes of depositions already delivered. But even the way answers
are provided could have an impact. When Clinton responded to
questions from the House, many House Republicans said they were
offended by the brusque and legalistic tone of the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Senators had a hard time keeping up with the fast-paced events.
``It's confusing and complicated,'' said Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode
Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil Saturday was triggered by the decision from Chief
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, moments before the Senate convened,
ordering Ms. Lewinsky to ``allow herself to be debriefed'' by House
prosecutors or, if she preferred, by Starr's lawyers. If she
refused, the judge wrote, she would forfeit her protections under
her immunity deal with the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling came in response to a request from Starr on
behalf of Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the lead prosecutor, after
Ms. Lewinsky rejected a request to meet with the House prosecutors
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Starr reached an agreement last July giving her
immunity from prosecution, provided that she answer questions
truthfully before grand juries ``and in any other executive,
military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' In her one-page
decision, Judge Johnson of federal district court ruled that the
independent counsel could compel Ms. Lewinsky to answer questions
in a briefing with the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specifies that such briefings will be conducted by
Starr's office and before ``attorneys, law-enforcement agents and
representatives of any other institutions'' as his office requires.
The House managers represent the full House, and qualify as an
``other institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Starr's aides question Ms. Lewinsky, as is expected,
they will act largely as conduits for questions from the House
prosecutors, who will be able to attend the meetings, said House
aides and officials familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky would face intense questioning either way. The
prosecutors believe that her answers could be pivotal as the Senate
decides whether to call question witnesses or to decide Clinton's
fate without them, the managers say.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have never met her face to face, and they
think they may be able to glean new information from the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The managers have always put Ms. Lewinsky at the top of their
proposed witness list. And if the Senate agrees, Ms. Lewinsky could
be subpoenaed to provide a sworn deposition.
</P>
<P>
   But as early as Monday, the managers will have to persuade a
majority of senators to depose Ms. Lewinsky. So the prosecutors
want to interview her before then in order to give senators their
best assessment of how Ms. Lewinsky could help untangle of the
conflicting testimony.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important than it
is now,'' Paul McNulty, the chief spokesman for the House managers,
said in a statement. ``In the last four days, the White House has
challenged the reliability of her testimony in a number of key
instances relating to her conversations with the president'' and
Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Ms. Lewinsky testified three times _ twice
before a federal grand jury and once in a sworn deposition. An
associate of Ms. Lewinsky said she testified truthfully then, and
would give the same testimony to the House managers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Starr, Charles Bakaly, dismissed accusations
from Democrats that the independent counsel's office had secretly
gone to federal court on behalf of the House managers to force Ms.
Lewinsky's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the White House could also question Ms. Lewinsky,
but he said his office had not received such a request from the
president's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the White House would participate in the
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky, Kennedy said, ``There are no such
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We, unlike the House managers,'' Kennedy said, are respecting
the Senate and the procedures adopted by the Senate, and we have no
intention of violating those procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers had balked at allowing her to meet with
the House managers, arguing that it would cast her in ``a partisan
light.`` But they appeared ready to comply with Judge Johnson's
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the independent counsel to trail along with the House
managers struck us as wrong,'' Jacob Stein, a lawyer for Ms.
Lewinsky, said in a telephone interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Saturday, Democrats assailed the fairness of
the House prosecutors' using Starr's authority to compel Ms.
Lewinsky's cooperation, while Republicans demanded to know how the
Senate could resolve important conflicting testimony without
hearing from witnesses like her.
</P>
<P>
   Honoring 19th-century impeachment rules, senators submitted
written questions to Rehnquist, who read them aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, one of the 13 House prosecutors, explained
that the managers merely wanted a routine meeting with Ms. Lewinsky
before deciding whether to ask the Senate to depose her.
</P>
<P>
   But White House Counsel Charles Ruff ridiculed that claim. ``Can
you imagine what that little conversation is going to look like,
held in the independent counsel's office, with the people there who
have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes spilled over to Senate Republicans and Democrats, at
the trial recesses Saturday. All but one of the 45 Senate Democrats
signed a letter to Hyde Saturday, urging the Illinois Republican to
drop his request to interview Ms. Lewinsky. Hyde responded in a
letter that the Senate rules and procedures did not require him to
gain the Senate's permission to talk to possible witnesses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only Democratic senator not to sign the letter was Robert
Byrd of West Virginia, a respected guardian of Senate tradition,
who issued his own statement on the matter. ``This is clearly an
attempt by the House managers to pre-empt the coming vote by the
Senate on whether or not to depose witnesses,'' Byrd said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans said the House managers were merely
exercising the same rights to interview a potential witness, as the
White House surely has with witnesses friendly to its side.

BC WOMEN HIT NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College women's basketball coach Cathy Inglese told her
players to expect a loud, frenzied crowd at Saturday's game, and
she told them to be ready for a fast, full-court pressing game by
the University of Connecticut, the No. 2 team in the country. Above
all, she told them that they didn't have to play over their heads,
that if they simply did ``what we do well, and with consistency, we
could win.''
</P>
<P>
   They proved her right.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles defeated UConn, 78-66, at Conte Forum, handing the
Huskies their third loss in two weeks. UConn is 16-3 overall, 9-1
in the Big East. BC improved to 15-3, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The full-house crowd of 8,606 _ half of whom, judging from the
cheers when UConn scored, seemed to be from Connecticut _ was
excited by the stepped-up Big East rivalry. The teams have met 35
times since 1981, and before Saturday UConn had won 16 straight.
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure what to expect Saturday, with both teams
carrying key players on the disabled list. BC has been playing
without guard Cal Bouchard (anterior cruciate ligament), and UConn
has four players sitting out because of injuries. So each team had
three freshmen on the court at the start of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each had to step up individually, just a little bit,'' said
BC junior Alissa Murphy, who stepped up more than just a little as
she poured in a game-high 32 points. Murphy was filling in for
Bouchard at point guard, with freshman Nicole Conway taking over
Murphy's spot at forward.
</P>
<P>
   UConn wasn't so lucky with its fill-ins. Freshman Tamika
Williams had team highs of 20 points and 11 rebounds, but after she
scored the game's first basket with three seconds gone, the Huskies
would never again take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   BC, which crowded under the basket to keep UConn from getting
second shots, limited the Huskies to just 28 first-half points
while racking up 46 of its own. That statistic is especially
amazing considering that in 11 of its 18 previous games, UConn had
scored 100 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed only fitting that as the buzzer sounded at the end of
the half, one of Murphy's two 3-pointers was falling through the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   UConn tried to regroup in the second half. The Huskies came out
after intyermission and started pressing BC, leading to an 11-2
run. UConn came within 9 points, at 66-57, and the visitors' fans
started making more noise.
</P>
<P>
   The more the Huskies pushed, though, the more the Eagles pushed
back. They forced UConn to commit 23 turnovers and 24 personal
fouls, and held the Huskies to two 3-pointers on 19 attempts. Coach
Geno Auriemma kept sending in new players, but no combination
worked for UConn. Freshman starter Kiersten Walters had no points
and no assists, while starting guard Svetlana Abrosimova was held
to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did all the things that you need to do to win, and we
didn't do anything,'' Auriemma said. ``All the credit goes to them;
they played us about as good as you can play us. They didn't put us
on the free throw line much, which is a big key. We gave them some
confidence, and they took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   BC freshman Brianne Stepherson, who had 8 points and 5 assists,
credited her team with keeping the tempo up. ``We had our game face
on and were totally focued on 40 minutes of basketball, 40 minutes
of pure heart, because we know how big it would be if we beat
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepherson and Murphy played all 40 minutes of the game;
freshman Becky Gottstein played 38 and had 14 points. Conway had 11
and senior Whitney Steele scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese said that the triumph was another step forward for her
team, which last month scored a significant victory over Notre
Dame. ``Now, this one is a major springboard for us as far as
getting some respect back, and that people know we're a good
team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite getting a flat tire on the way to shootaround this
morning, this day has worked out really well.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least.

MURPHY WAS RIGHT ON TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a basketball player, there are games you dream about.
Saturday, Alissa Murphy had one of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going out,'' declared Murphy, a Boston College junior
guard/forward from San Diego, tossing back her ponytail and beaming
a smile the size of her home state. ``I don't go out often, but I
am going to go out tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   Even her vanquished foes weren't disputing Murphy's right to
celebrate after she had led the Eagles to a gigantic 78-66 win over
the University of Connecticut, the No. 2 team in the country,
Saturday afternoon. ``She probably had the game of her life,'' said
UConn forward Tamika Williams. ``It felt like she scored about 40
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost. In her fourth game since shifting to the backcourt to
fill in for the injured Cal Bouchard, Murphy scored 32, a career
high (by 12) that included 8 straight midway through the second
half. She shot 11 for 18 from the floor, 8 for 9 from the free
throw line, and pulled down a team-leading nine rebounds in 40
glorious minutes of fearlessly driving the lane whenever she wasn't
popping 'em in from outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's called playing out of your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``She plays like that in practice all the time,'' shrugged
Bouchard, her roommate, who is out with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament. ``We all knew she could do it, and to come out against
UConn was just a tribute to her confidence and her skills.''
</P>
<P>
   If beating the No. 2 team in the nation is exciting, beating the
No. 2 team in the country that just three seasons ago crushed your
team, 76-38, in your BC debut is nothing short of sublime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got humiliated in our first collegiate game,'' said
Bouchard, Murphy nodding in agreement next to her. ``And since then
they've dominated us. It was just sweet redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   For Murphy, it was redemption built on last summer's renewed
determination to come back to school in the best condition of her
life. ``I shot more jump shots than I ever shot in my life,'' she
recalled of her ``vacation'' spent practicing on her own, working
at basketball camps back in San Diego, and touring with a Big East
all-star team in Europe. ``I worked hard in the weight room. I
played almost every day, shot extra shots, just dedicated myself to
coming back in shape, coming back as a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Redemption was also built on quiet consistency. Fifth on the
team in scoring (averaging 5.5 points per game) as a freshman, the
player whom coach Cathy Inglese calls her most underrated was third
as a sophomore (9.1) and this year led the team at 14.6 going into
Saturday's game. Her previous career high, 20 points, came in a
Jan. 5 win over Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the 21-year-old economics major was anything but quiet.
Right from the pregame shootaround, when she couldn't miss, Murphy
knew it was going to be a good day. By the time she hit a 3-point
buzzer-beater to end the half, she was beginning to realize just
how good it would be, both for her and for her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad job by me; I didn't realize the time,'' said Murphy,
recalling her buzzer-beater. ``I could hear Coach _ I don't know
how I heard her with that crowd _ but I heard her voice coming
through and as I looked up I saw and I just'' _ and here Murphy
gasps _ ``threw it up, one-handed runner, and then it was sealed.
It was definitely going to be a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she'd called her family back home with the good news,
Murphy laughed. ``I tried to but the phone was busy,'' she said.
``We don't have call waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   When that's the only thing that doesn't go right on a day you're
playing the No. 2 team in the country, you are indeed having a good
day.

STOP TRAFFIC WINS AT SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- The first time trainer Richard Mandella saw Stop
Traffic, the filly was on sale and nursing a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday he saw the 6-year-old mare again -- in the winner's
circle after she cruised to victory in the $200,000 Grade I Santa
Monica Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice way to start the year,'' Mandella said. ``Stop
Traffic just keeps carrying the banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop Traffic paid $9.80, $4.20 and $4.60. Belle's Flag, an
entry, finished second and paid $3.40 and $3.20. The other half of
the entry, Closed Entry, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing fourth was Seeking the Pearl. The horse drew a swarm
of media from Japan documenting celebrity jockey Yutaka Take's trip
to the states for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Hideyuki Mori, who trained Seeking the Pearl, said the horse
handled her first dirt race well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will return to Japan and consider other races for her
overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Traffic's win came in spite of the fact she was blocked
behind other horses at the quarter pole. She broke through at
midstretch and made her move on Belle's Flag, who led at the top of
the stretch. The seven furlong race was run in a tepid 1:22.17, but
Mandella wasn't unhappy with the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it was running long,'' he said. ``But (Jockey)
Corey (Black) had her in a real nice spot waiting to commit
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stop Traffic ran in last year's Santa Monica, she
didn't do as well then, finishing in seventh, 14 1/2 lengths out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know what got into her that day, that's the only
bad day she ever had for me,'' Mandella said. ``She ran about 100
yards and just quit. I never figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella bought the horse for $300,000 from Gerald Ford, a
Dallas, Texas banker. She was on the block as a 3-year-old at the
annual Keeneland Breeder's sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was laid up with a tibial stress fracture,'' Mandella
said. ``We checked her out. I bought her, brought her home and put
her in training and never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   For Black, the trip aboard Stop Traffic was his first Grade I
winner since taking the 1994 Hollywood Turf Cup aboard Frenchpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on her game obviously,'' Black said. ``(Mandella) had
been singing her praises all week telling me she's been training
unbelievably well.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: On this day in 1974 Jockey Chris McCarron rode in his
first race. He finished last aboard Most Active at the Bowie
Racecourse. ... Alex Solis, who's recently had a hot hand remains
Santa Anita's leading jockey through Friday. So far Solis has had
120 mounts and ridden 26 of those to the winners circle. His horses
have been in the money 49 percent of the time. Bob Baffert leads
all trainers at the meet with nine wins. His horses have been in
the money 54 percent of the time. ...
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trainers, Lisa Lewis saddled her first winner,
Capsized, in the sixth race Friday. ... In his quest for an elusive
6,000th win, Eddie Delahoussaye remained winless Saturday. He is
still six wins short of the goal achieved by just 13 other jockeys.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES  &UR; -- &LR;  The first step to Hollywood glory often begins
in unglamorous locales like comedy clubs in strip malls with the
faint hope that an agent, talent scout or producer might drop by.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decade of playing that game  &UR; -- &LR;  performing
thousands of sets in clubs, acting on TV and hammering out scripts
 &UR; -- &LR;  Bill Kalmenson got tired of waiting. The key moment came in
early 1992, when his girlfriend dumped him to go to work on Jerry
Brown's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was part two of a one-two punch; already, club bookings were
drying up as the recession took hold. ``I knew my life was no big
deal in the overall scheme of things, but I also thought there was
a movie I could squeeze out of myself,'' said Kalmenson, a 1974
graduate of Taft High in the suburban Los Angeles community of
Woodland Hills in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   So he became a Hollywood do-it-yourselfer, writing, directing,
starring in and promoting his own full-length movie. While industry
veterans say the odds of Kalmenson's success are painfully small,
he took advantage of several trends (increased acceptance of
nonstudio films, foreign demand for American movies, using the
Internet as a promotional tool) to keep hope afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Kalmenson began by writing a script for a romantic comedy about
his life coming unraveled; he found a producer; he raised funds
from friends (``less than $1 &UR;  &LR; million'') and created Buffalo Jump
Productions; and wound up directing ``The Souler Opposite'' during
a four-week shoot in late 1996, much of it in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In one key early scene, Kalmenson's character, Barry Singer,
antagonizes a pair of bikers during his set at the L.A. Cabaret
comedy club in the valley community of Encino. They complain to the
manager, who bars Singer from the premises. Then the bikers meet
him in the club's parking lot to say ``no hard feelings,'' but
sucker-punch him into unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   One of the club waitresses helps him come to, then gives him a
ride home via the valley's Ventura Boulevard; they discover he's
from nearby Tarzana and she's from Woodland Hills. ``I actually
went to El Camino (Real) High in Woodland Hills, but I'm not
telling you what year I graduated,'' said actress Janel Moloney,
who plays the female lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kalmenson completed post-production on the romantic comedy in
mid-1997 and lined up a foreign distributor to start making sales
in Europe and Latin America. ``I just got an e-mail from someone
who saw it on Chilean TV and wanted to buy the video,'' he said
this week. ``Foreign sales have kept us going.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could not find a domestic distributor despite receiving
enthusiastic responses at film festivals. ``I begged all the
studios, and I think it's a shame they won't back this movie,
because it's a little gem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Kalmenson launched his own distribution operation, using a
combination of computer technology, show-biz savvy and
old-fashioned hustle to make himself look like a full-fledged
studio with posters, press kits, an Internet site, trailers and a
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I had to come up with something at least as good
as a studio operation, and I think I've put together first-class
materials,'' Kalmenson said. ``That's why exhibitors finally are
dealing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Souler Opposite'' got its first domestic theatrical
release when it opened at the Laemmle Theaters in Santa Monica
three months ago. Reviewers were mostly enthusiastic, and the film
has now played at a dozen other locations for a week or two,
sometimes grossing better than $5,000 per weekend. Typical
distribution deals call for the exhibitors to keep half of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done pretty well, but it's hard because we only play in
one location at a time, so I can't really get the advertising
efficiencies you need to build an audience,'' Kalmenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he did when he was a comic, he promotes the film through
fliers, radio interviews and cable TV ads. ``I don't want to
embarrass myself and only sell $200 of tickets,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Kalmenson has mixed emotions about what he's achieved. ``I've
been feeling pretty beat up over not being able to get a
distribution deal, but I had some time to think about it over
Christmas and really feel like this has been a victory. I actually
did what I set out to do,'' he said. ``Of course, Hollywood is the
only place where victory feels like defeat, because you're always
supposed to want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Indy films like ``The Souler Opposite'' face massive obstacles,
according to Chris Lanier, president of the Motion Picture
Intelligencer consulting service. ``The odds are terrible,'' he
said. ``There are probably only 60 or 80 that get distribution each
year, and only 15 or 20 of those make any money. There are hundreds
of other films that just sit on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a film like ``The Full Monty'' hits a financial
home run; it took in $200 &UR;  &LR; million worldwide after costing a mere
$3 &UR;  &LR; million to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone focuses on the extremes like `Titanic' or `The Full
Monty' and says, Boy did they make a lot of money,'' Lanier
said.``If you're an exhibitor, and you have something that's
becoming a hit, you can make big bucks. That's why there are a lot
of films going through, and they're changing most of the bill each
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalmenson admits he'll need video and pay-TV deals to pay back
all the investors, but he insists ``The Souler Opposite'' could
have a long life, particularly if Moloney or co-stars Chris Meloni
and Timothy Busfield see their careers take off. As for himself,
Hollywood executives are now more likely to take meetings and
return his calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from there being absolutely no interest to there
being lukewarm interest,'' he quipped.

BRADLEY: WINNING IS HIS GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Shawn Bradley took inventory of his NBA career last
week, and admitted what many people have been whispering for quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go out and do the things necessary to make me a
better player, but also make me a better person,'' the Mavericks
center said. ``I know I can continue to improve, and I know I can
bring something to this team and help this team win games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Philadelphia 76ers thought when they made
Bradley the second pick of the 1993 NBA draft. Many NBA scouts said
Bradley was going to use his athleticism to revolutionize the game.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly six years later, Bradley is as much of an enigma as
he was then. Mavericks coach Don Nelson benched Bradley late last
season, and said he plans to bring him off the bench this season
behind starting center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's coming along fine,'' Nelson said. ``We like the
progress he's made, and we think he can help us coming off the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hinted he may retire when his contract, which will pay
him a team-high $6.75 million this season, expires in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have started a lovely family,'' he said. ``We
have four beautiful daughters, and there will come a time in the
next few years where I'll have to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love basketball and I love being out here, I
understand that there are other things in life, too. Right now
we're happy, I'm playing ball and I'm able to juggle my family life
_ which is extremely important to me _ with my basketball career,
and it's working out really good so far.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the NBA, Bradley said, he was saddled with too
many expectations. After all, the 7-foot-6 gentle giant played only
his freshman season at Brigham Young, where he averaged 14.8
points, 7.7 rebounds and an NCAA-high 5.21 blocks per game.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent the next two years completing his Mormon mission
in Sydney, Australia, where a basketball was as foreign to him as
that country. After that, Bradley signed a controversial
eight-year, $44.2 million contract with the Sixers, and the
pressure has been building since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got drafted high and signed a big contract, and that was
pressure out of this world,'' Bradley said. ``A lot of it was
unwarranted and a lot of it may have been warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets early in his
third pro season, and the Nets traded him to the Mavericks after he
wore their uniform a little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Newell, who has operated a camp during the summer for big
men for 22 years, said he could have helped Bradley immensely had
he enrolled in his camp before coming to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think initially when \R the Sixers\S drafted him and he'd
been away from the game for two years, that's when I thought he
could have come because we could have helped bridge the gap between
college and the NBA,'' Newell said. ``It's hard enough to come from
college to the NBA, but when he went on that mission, that took him
out of what basketball he could have been playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's a fine athlete, but he's not gifted with a lot of
natural strength and weight that a lot of the guys he plays against
have. But he has a good sense for the game, and he's a good shot
blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scoffs at the people who say he's short-changing himself
by not working hard during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know, and they don't understand,'' Bradley said.
``It's real easy to look at a big guy and say he doesn't work as
hard as the other guy, because he appears slower. Many times he is
slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the stigma that comes along with us
7-footers. But I can't worry about what other people think. I've
got to worry about what I think and how I feel about it, and go out
there and work harder and become better.''
</P>
<P>
   Newell has worked with big men such as Hakeem Olajuwon,
Shaquille O'Neal and Ralph Sampson. He would love to get his hands
on Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves these players, if they want to be the best they
can be, to work out in the summer,'' Newell said. ``I'm not saying
come to my camp, but they need to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you have a lot of players who want to just pick
up a paycheck and come to work, like some have done. They're never
going to take their game to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he hopes he doesn't fall in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting my sixth year and the best team I've been on only
won 30 games,'' he said. ``But there are still goals that I have
that I know I can achieve.''

SMALL MINDS SEEK THE BIGGSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime around midnight the telephone rang and a groggy Linda
Biggs shuffled across the room to answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a psychic,'' a woman on the line whispered.
</P>
<P>
   `'A what?'' Linda asked, half asleep.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, the Biggs family has been getting calls from
strangers at all hours of the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   People they've never met want to talk to them about the
disappearance of 11-year-old Mikelle, the girl who vanished from
the street near her home in Mesa on Jan. 2, and hasn't been seen
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some things to tell you about your missing daughter's
case,'' the clairvoyant told Linda. `'I've been getting some very
strong feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Linda said, her voice rising. ``Are you getting the
feeling that you're talking to the wrong Biggs family?''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, as Linda retells the story, she's still not sure the
woman believed her. And the calls keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Linda and her husband, Darrin, live in Mesa, only a couple of
miles from Mikelle's parents, Tracy and Michael ``Darien'' Biggs.
The missing girl's father is often referred to by his middle name.
Meantime, Darrin's name is in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Linda says, ``we've heard from our share of kooks.'' &QL; 
WELL-MEANING CALLERS
</P>
<P>
   Some callers are well-meaning. They ask if there's anything they
can do for the family. They want to pass along their own special
theory of the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, really,'' Linda says, ``how can even a nice person
believe it's OK to intrude into the lives of people whose daughter
is missing? What are they thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   They're thinking they're part of the family. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Since the day Mikelle Biggs went out for an ice cream cone and
didn't come back, her story, her parents, her face have appeared on
just about every television newscast and every newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   There are billboards. There are fliers posted everywhere. There
are benefit auctions. One family's loss becomes every family's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   People feel as if they know Mikelle and the Biggs family, as if
they're a part of it. What's a few late-night phone calls between
relatives?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikelle's parents, when I've seen them on TV, seem really
grateful for all the support they're getting,'' Linda says. ``But
if we're getting the number of crank calls we're getting, I can
only imagine what is happening to them. I would only ask people one
thing: Stop.'' &QL; 
PEOPLE FEEL ENTITLED
</P>
<P>
   Curious people could call the police, of course. Well-wishers
could send cards. Or simply say a prayer. That's not good enough
for some. In Jerry Springerville, which is every town in America,
people feel entitled to some small brush with fame.
</P>
<P>
   Getting on TV is the best. Talking to someone's who's been on TV
is close enough. Mikelle's parents have been on TV.
</P>
<P>
   A woman called the wrong Biggs household one day and got Darrin
on the telephone. He explained to her that his children were fine
and she was speaking to a different family.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the same woman called again, and again Darrin
answered. This time, she asked to speak to his wife. Darrin rolled
his eyes and handed the phone to Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid you're husband's in denial,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If getting hassled by people like this takes just a little bit
of the burden off the actual Biggs family, we're happy to do it,''
Linda says. ``I can't imagine how terrible this must be for that
mom and dad. All of us feel for them. We've all seen their story on
TV and the papers and everything. It would be really nice, though,
if people who want to contact them would stop, and think, and leave
them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, I tell Linda, but it won't happen, not here in
Springerville. She has the same strong feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The two of us, we're psychic about these things. &QL;

Rockets take opening steps in transition
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
There was no triangle offense, but there was a legendary center in
the low post. There was no meditation-preaching Zen proponent, but
a straight-talking coach with work to do. No Michael Jordan, but a
group of rookies taking their first professional steps less than
two weeks before at least a few will have to play.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen's first day as the center of attention served to
remind how much had changed, and how much must be done to make it
all feel as natural as all those years running with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   He said he enjoyed the change of pace, even if he seemed taken
aback by all the fuss, having for so long had Jordan to assume the
heat of the spotlight. He also got his first taste of the
transition he and the Rockets had assumed with the addition of
seven new faces among the 14 healthy players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Pippen said Saturday at Westside Tennis
Club. ``It's a change that's been coming for a long time. This
organization is different. Playing with a guy like Michael, who's
always been a superstar or a franchise, now to come somewhere to
see a team want you so much, is a little different. It's a good
position to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be fair to adjust to playing with such a dominant
center. Then I can feel my way and find my niche with this team.
This is a team that had a lot of success without Scottie Pippen. I
have to sort of feel my way in. I didn't come here to be
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as comfortable as he might find himself with the sudden wave
of appreciation, the offense is different and his style demands he
play instinctively, to use the offensive system without feeling
constrained to adhere to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have to think a lot more,'' Pippen said. ``I
can't say I can walk out here the first day in the system at ease.
It takes time to develop. I'm going to put in as much time as I can
to try to be at ease with this offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been used to running the triangle (offense) so it's a
little different having a dominant center inside and providing some
spacing. I'm having fun. Inside is the No. 1 option, they double
down, which may give you opportunities to spot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too difficult. It was a learning situation. There
was standing around for the most part, just trying to learn and
getting accustomed to what the coaching staff wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the coaching staff does not know how long it will take for a
rebuilt team to feel at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Though coaches are experienced with calculating how hard they
can push without pushing too hard, no one has much experience with
preparing in less than two weeks (interrupted by two exhibition
games and a public scrimmage) to sprint through a 50-game NBA
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to stretch how much we can do,'' Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``There is going to be a little
confusion on a lot of people's part. We have to get so much in in a
short amount of time. We're going to have to push that limit all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're a little bit behind here. We're adding so many
new players. I've never been big on excuses. We're going to go out
and do the best that we can. We're going to be all right. It's
going to be a gradual process. We have intelligent players. We're
going to get this thing worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   But such concerns did not drown out the obvious happiness with
returning to work. If the six-month lockout or the protracted
haggling to complete the collective-bargaining agreement did not
exhaust patience, the two days waiting for league approval, all
while the team waited at the practice facility to get to work, made
Saturday's start of an adjustment period welcome compared to the
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy,'' Tomjanovich sad. ``We had healthy bodies,
a lot of energy, a lot of positive feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (how long it will take for players to be
comfortable with the changes.) This is so different. It's crucial,
but we're going to do it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in some crazy situations before. That second
championship year (1994-95), that team didn't play together until
the first game of the playoffs. Somehow we got that chemistry
together.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first day taking on a similar process, Hakeem Olajuwon
said he had little concern about Pippen becoming comfortable with
the Rockets' style.
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen and the six other new Rockets _ centers John Coker
and Antoine Carr, forward Anthony ``Pig'' Miller and rookie guards
Michael Dickerson, Bryce Drew and Cuttino Mobley _ will not be
alone in the learning process.
</P>
<P>
   Even the veterans of the Rockets' system, Olajuwon said, must
adjust, with so many new parts added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie is so experienced. He's trying to find out what the
plays are so he knows how to execute,'' Olajuwon said. ``He's very
easy to work with, very positive, good leadership, good interaction
together, good chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to have confidence this is also his system.
The system is just to guide you. His game and his talents have to
show. He has to play his (style) to make his presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a whole different team. That's the attitude we have
to have. We have to learn how to play all the way from the
beginning. The same principle applies to me. I'm learning to play
from the beginning, even though the system is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought in new faces, athletes, young, energetic, looking
forward to play. Looking around I see all this talent, you gain
enthusiasm. The coaches are excited. It's good chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   With such good feelings, Pippen accepted the praise and
expectations and seemed almost as relieved to get to work to earn
them. Friday's celebration made it clear he is expected to bring
renewed championship contention. Friday, Tomjanovich called him
basketball's ``most complete player.'' Saturday, Pippen seemed to
have no doubt that that's what Tomjanovich would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just looking to fit in,'' Pippen said. ``Once I
feel much more comfortable with the system I'm looking to do more.
I'll develop myself into what Rudy wants.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the trial of President Clinton moved toward a
critical set of votes next week, the Senate's spirit of fragile
bipartisanship frayed nearly to the breaking point Saturday and a
party-line vote looked almost certain to kill a Democratic motion
to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the changed tone and party confrontation should
not have been unexpected. Two weeks ago, when all 100 senators met
in the ceremonial Old Senate Chamber and hammered out a bipartisan
trial plan, they reached agreement by simply putting off the hard
issues that divided them: whether to allow witnesses and whether to
continue the trial all the way through to an up-or-down vote on the
two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those are now the very questions that are to come before the
Senate for a vote as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, senators were left breathless Saturday by the speed
with which cooperation deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was left so unsettled that Sen.Trent Lott, the
majority leader, simply deflected questions about a statement made
by his press spokesman earlier in the day, that he was going to
block debate by the Senate on the two most critical motions, one to
dismiss the trial and the other on whether to allow witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to now say we are going to do it one
way or the other, all the way,'' Lott said. ``We will clarify as we
will go along. We will do that Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately objected to the prospect of not even being
allowed to debate the issues. ``To say to senators, `We're going to
deny you the right to speak about the motion to dismiss,' is
mind-boggling,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters about the duration of the trial, Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said, ``I notice a shift every half day
in terms of people thinking it will go on for months, or it's going
to be over in a few hours.'' Asked what he thought now, Feingold
said, ``I think it's going to go on for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has pulled back before from the brink of partisanship
and some of Saturday's Democratic complaints may well have been a
tactic, on the eve of critical votes, to scare Republicans, who
desperately do not want to appear as partisan as their colleagues
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the aisle, there were still Democrats and
Republicans who thought the Senate might yet cobble together a
majority next week against calling witnesses, or find some other
way to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment,
which would end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring about an end that makes sense,'' said
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. And Sen. John Breaux, D-La., was trying
to explore whether the motion to dismiss the case, to be presented
by Sen. Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, could somehow pass
if it were to include tough language condemning Clinton for
inappropriate behavior in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day at least the Senate seemed to be descending into
the same kind of bitterness as the House, spurred to some degree by
the House Republicans themselves, who had secretly approached the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, who Saturday won a court order
instructing Monica Lewinsky to cooperate with the House
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the former intern was back in Washington to be
questioned somewhere in the capital on Sunday. Daschle called the
House prosecutors' maneuver the most ``clear demonstration of raw
partisanship that I have ever seen,'' and 44 Democratic senators
urged the House not to go ahead with the questioning. Daschle also
asked, through Chief Justice William Rehnquist, whether the
prosecutors would permit two senators, a Republican and a Democrat,
to attend the questioning. The House Republicans refused.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Republicans defended the House move, saying that
since the prosecutors will have to submit a witness list on Monday
and justify it to the Senate, they needed the chance to see whether
Ms. Lewinsky could add to their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely appropriate,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
But another senior Republican, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, agreed
with the Democrats that the House Republicans had broken the spirit
of the bipartisan agreement on how to handle witnesses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans began the day with their own grievance. They saw
the surprise announcement on Friday that Byrd would be the one to
sponsor the motion to dismiss the case against Clinton as a sign
that the Democrats themselves were hardening into a party position.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd had been one of the Democrats who had early on held out the
possibility that he might vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So after a party caucus Saturday morning, senior Republicans
said they would oppose the motion, and they signaled that this
would be a party position. ``Frankly, it sets a constitutional
precedent that doesn't make any sense,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the majority whip. ``Every single impeachment trial in
the history of the United States Senate has had a resolution by
voting up or down on the articles.''
</P>
<P>
   And by day's end, Lott seized on a White House offer that was
quickly retracted, or at least clarified, and announced that
Republicans would send the president himself a list of questions
they wanted him to answer for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hostilities, there are still some ways the Senate
could bring the trial to a speedy conclusion. If all 45 Democrats
hold a united front on the second vote pending before the Senate _
on whether to allow witnesses _ they need to pick up only six
Republicans to assemble a 51-vote majority. (In the case of a 50-50
tie, Rehnquist can cast the decisive vote if he chooses.)
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have not yet indicated how many witnesses
they will seek to call. The list they submit and how they defend it
could also influence how the Senate votes. ``If they can make a
case for witnesses, I'll vote for them,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, ``but it has to be a strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are approved, Lott is looking for a way to
stringently control the length and scope of the questioning so that
the trial could end next month. ``The leaders' intention is to have
this not go beyond mid-February,'' said John Czwartacki, Lott's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are envisioning perhaps a week of taking depositions
in private _ and the possibility that the witnesses would then not
be called before the Senate itself. But it is far from clear
whether senators would really be able to control the process if
they voted to allow depositions of witnesses behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   And David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, warned the Senate
on Friday that if witnesses are summoned for deposition, the White
House would want to call witnesses itself, cross-examine witnesses
and subpoena documents for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear if Senate Democrats would help Republicans
bring about a controlled deposition process, so angry were they at
the House managers. Some have been arguing privately that they
should simply let the Republicans hurt themselves politically and
be blamed by the public for a long trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats were already demonstrating today how that
would work. ``Mr. Starr is now directly participating in the
impeachment trial process,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey, invoking the unpopular independent counsel. Torricelli said
the actions of Starr and of Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief House
prosecutor, ``undermine the Senate's exclusive authority and raise
serious constitutional questions about this proceeding.''
Torricelli sounded a lot like Democrats did in the House just a few
months ago.

JAY PRITZKER, 76, BILLIONAIRE WHO FOUNDED THE HYATT HOTEL CHAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Pritzker, whose hunch in the 1950s that America's restless
business executives would flock to hotels near airports prompted
him to build the Hyatt hotel chain, died on Saturday of cardiac
arrest at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Pritzker, who
had a history of heart trouble, was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a personal aversion to publicity, Pritzker and his
brother, Robert, were routinely celebrated on the world's financial
news pages for their business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   As two of the world's richest men, they built an enormous
business empire called Marmon Corp., which over the years had
interests in Braniff Airlines, McCall's magazine, Levitz Furniture
and Ticketmaster, as well as casinos in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and
Atlantic City. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated the brothers'
net worth at $13.5 billion, up from $6 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pritzker was a trustee of the University of Chicago, and in
1979 endowed the Pritzker Architectural Prize, sometimes called
architecture's Nobel Prize, which carries a $100,000 award. He also
founded the Nancy Friend Pritzker Laboratory for the study of
clinical depression at Stanford University. It is named for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and accountant by training, Pritzker began buying small
companies at 29, first timber mills, then a small metal-goods
company. But he was best known for the business deal he hatched in
1957 over a cup of coffee at a coffee shop called Fat Eddie's at
Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for a flight, Pritzker noticed that Fat Eddie's
seemed to be unusually busy for a coffee shop, and that the hotel
in which it was located did not have any vacancies. The hotel _
named after its owner, Hyatt Von Dehn _ was for sale, and Pritzker
decided on the spot to buy it and Fat Eddie's, writing his offer of
$2.2 million on a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Pritzker bet, correctly, that business executives like himself
would want to stay at a quality hotel near a large airport. The
Hyatt was ``simply the first first-class hotel that I had ever seen
at an airport,'' Pritzker later told the Chicago Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   After building a second Hyatt hotel in Burlingame, Calif., near
San Francisco International Airport, the brothers concentrated
their hotel properties near airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Seattle, then around the country and internationally. Hyatt
Hotels Corp., which last year had annual revenues of $3 billion,
has 182 hotels and 34 under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of guts,'' said Douglas G. Geoga, president of
the Hyatt Hotels subsidiary, recalling that Pritzker in 1967 bought
a half-finished hotel in Atlanta and turned it into the Hyatt
Regency. The first of the giant atrium hotels, the Hyatt Regency
Atlanta struck doubters as a white elephant, Geoga said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritzker, he recalled, said that some visitors actually worried
that the Regency's atrium was so towering that hot air would rise,
condense and then form a miniature rainstorm inside the hotel.
Pritzker liked to gently scoff that ``that sort of concern
reflected a degree of overeducation,'' Geoga said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pritzker was born on Aug. 26, 1922, to Fanny Doppelt and
Abram Nicholas Pritzker and was the grandson of Nicholas and Annie
Pritzker.
</P>
<P>
   Pritzker majored in accounting and received a bachelor's degree
from Northwestern University in 1941. His grandfather founded a
Chicago law firm, now called Pritzker &AMP; Pritzker, where Jay
Pritzker worked for a time after graduating from Northwestern
University Law School in 1947 and serving in World War II as a
naval aviator.
</P>
<P>
   Pritzker is survived by his wife, Marian, their four children,
and 13 grandchildren, and his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Pritzker's brother Donald and his oldest child, Nancy, died in
1972.

MCGINNIS IS `BACK FOR GOOD'  
 TURNS DOWN BEARS, RETURNS TO CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis told
friends in the Valley he wouldn't take the Chicago Bears' head
coaching job unless it was a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Phoenix Saturday night, saddened that his past
two days in Chicago had turned into ``Groundhog Day,'' but anxious
to return to work with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players and this organization that if it wasn't
right, I wasn't leaving Arizona,'' McGinnis said after arriving at
Sky Harbor Airport with his wife, Kim. ``Now, I'm back in Arizona,
and I'm back for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here. The organization has been good to me. It's a
win-win situation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis withdrew his name from consideration at the Bears
Saturday afternoon, 24 hours after the team called a news
conference to announce his hiring. He hadn't even accepted the job
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears wasted little time in naming a coach after McGinnis
pulled out. They hired Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick
Jauron.
</P>
<P>
   `My emotions are sad because it turned out like this and
probably didn't have to,'' McGinnis said. ``Obviously, we all
thought it would turn out very good, and it wound up very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis met with Bears officials for nearly four hours Saturday
morning to try to patch up their differences. But much of the
damage already had been done when the Bears announced the hiring
even though the two sides hadn't agreed on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it could be worked out,'' McGinnis said. ``But I was
shocked at the way it happened. It was very awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it wasn't like I was extremely wronged. Don't look at
me as a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears President Michael McCaskey called Friday's premature
announcement of the hiring an ``internal foul up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake on that,'' McCaskey said. ``We didn't intend
for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears first offer to McGinnis was a four-year deal worth
$3.3 million in which only the first two years were guaranteed. On
Saturday, they increased the offer to a five-year deal, but there
was a buy-out after the third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So after the second year, he would have felt as if he was on
the last year of his contract,'' a source close to McGinnis said.
``That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskey said the disagreement between the two sides had nothing
to do with money, the length of the contract or the structure of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care to go into it now and probably never will,''
McCaskey said. ``It's between me and Dave. These things happen.
Sometimes, they are a pathway to consideration of other things and
that's what happened in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that upset McGinnis is that he lost the services of
three assistants he hoped to hire during the confusion on Friday.
Leslie Frazier and Ron Rivera took positions as secondary coach and
linebacker coach, respectively at Philadelphia. Mike Martz, the St.
Louis Rams quarterback coach, was promoted to the Rams' offensive
coordinator instead of taking the same position with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Bears Vice President Mark Hatley, who conducted the first
interview with McGinnis 10 days ago in the Valley, said that if
McGinnis ``really wanted the job, he would have taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hat(ley) is outstanding, but he's an emotional guy,'' McGinnis
said. ``He wanted me to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskey acknowledged that the McGinnis affair has been a
public-relations black eye for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some repair work to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis said hoped to talk to Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin on
Saturday night. But he has been assured he will get his job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Kathy (Tobin),'' McGinnis said of the head coach's
wife. ``I told her we were coming back if there wasn't anyone in my
office.
</P>
<P>
   '`Now, all I'm going to worry about is making the opponents
(next season) punt.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskey got in touch with the remaining three candidates _
Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry, Green Bay offensive
coordinator Sherm Lewis and Jauron _ to fill the post of the fired
Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Jauron means the Jaguars have lost both of their
coordinators. Offensive coordinator Chris Palmer was hired last
week as the first coach of the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan said Jauron would be introduced as
the new coach at a news conference today. &QL;

REEVES' PRESS CONFERENCE IGNITES SMOL DERING RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What better venue for this lasting hostility than Miami, the
city of riots, point of entry for Fidel's finest exiled thugs, a
tourist mecca where crime takes no holiday, but where the
championship of pro football takes a backseat, initially, to an old
family feud?
</P>
<P>
   Located, as it is, just south of the Reeves-Shanahan Line, Miami
isn't much farther than a well-flung moonshine jug from Atlanta,
home of the Reeves clan.
</P>
<P>
   The clan leaders, Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan, once were like
kin, although there is no documentation that they ever went raccoon
hunting together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was probably one of my closest friends at one time,''
Shanahan said. ``Any time you end the way we did, there's always a
little bit on the inside of you that rubs each of us the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves affirmed, ``I couldn't have been closer to someone than I
was to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reeves believes that Shanahan came to view the essence of
their relationship as ``You scratch my back, and I'll stab yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Reeves held a public blood-letting Wednesday
in Atlanta, telling the world what he thought of his former
colleague. And it wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who now has the job that Reeves believes still should
be his, was highly indignant by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before they leave south Florida, it's a safe bet that each will
use a shotgun to help settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves got his forum after coaching the upstart Atlanta Falcons
to an upset over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC title game. His
sparring partner emerged when the Shanahan-coached Denver Broncos
came back to eliminate the New York Jets in the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XXXIII, it's the Falcons vs. the Broncos at Pro
Player Stadium next Sunday. &QL; 
Sideline showdown &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it's Reeves vs. Shanahan. Grab a good Cuban cigar,
sit back during Hype Week and watch an entertaining feud play out.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was coach of the Broncos from 1981 through 1992. During
his run, they went to three Super Bowls with John Elway as
quarterback. They lost them all but an almost-certain Hall of Fame
quarterback emerged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Reeves had rescued Elway from Baltimore. The Colts were
awful. Elway said he'd play professional baseball before he would
play for the Colts, who had drafted him in the first round. So
Reeves, considered one of the game's premier offensive coaches,
traded for Elway, viewed as the game's next great signal-caller. It
seemed a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Reeves gave Shanahan, a one-time assistant coach
at Northern Arizona University, his first NFL job as his receivers
coach. In 1985, Reeves promoted Shanahan to offensive coordinator.
Two years later, Shanahan, quickly making his mark as a bright
young coach, was hired as head coach of the Los Angeles Raiders.
Fired during his second season, Shanahan was brought back to the
Broncos by Reeves in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the storyline follows divergent paths.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said in his shocking diatribe Wednesday that Shanahan
became a Judas, a disloyal back-stabber who wanted Reeves' job and
undermined him to get it. Reeves accused Shanahan of taking
confidential coaching critiques of Elway's performances back to the
star quarterback, drawing Elway into a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan denied it, adding that Elway never really liked Reeves,
his suddenly conservative offense or his autocratic style of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say things in a coaches' meeting as far as critiquing play
that you would never say to the player,'' Reeves said. ``If John
ever got any bad feelings about something that I said, it had to be
something from a staff meeting. I knew they were really, really
good friends, and still are. Now, does that mean Mike did it?
You've got a lot of people on your staff. I have no proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Reeves open his mouth? Shanahan wondered
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to accuse someone of doing something, I'm at
least going to have some proof, something more than a strong
feeling,'' Shanahan said. ``In no way would I ever tell John Elway
or any other player something that was said in a meeting.'' &QL; 
Elway in the middle &QL; 
Reeves recalled hitting the roof in 1990 when Elway ripped him in a
Denver newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I had was if John Elway had a problem with
me and you're coaching his position, why did I not know that prior
to reading it in the paper?'' Reeves said. ``If you were a position
coach and you were that close to him, why didn't you say, `Sit down
and talk to him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said Reeves knew exactly where his relationship stood
with Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ifs, ands, or buts about that,'' Shanahan said. ``It was a
tough relationship from the first year. Everyone in this town
(Denver) knows that. Everything went downhill after that column.
Dan called me into his office the day it came out, he threw the
newspaper at me and he yelled, `How did this story get in there?' I
said, `Dan, I didn't give this story. Why are you yelling at me? I
had nothing to do with it. Why not talk to John?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went down to the weight room, and I got John. Then we
went back and I told both of them, `John, I'm getting tired of
this. Why don't you tell Dan why you don't like him, and Dan, you
tell John why you don't like him.' So they both told why they
didn't like each other, and that was it. After that day, except to
talk about football, Dan and I never talked again.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Reeves fired Shanahan. He said Wednesday he did it
because Shanahan was ``insubordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had my best interests in mind at the time,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney, Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had looked me in the eyes, man to man, and told me how
he felt, I could have respected that,'' Shanahan said. ``Instead,
Dan looked me in the eyes and said, `Mike, I want to call the
offense. You want to call the offense. So I've got to make a
change.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Reeves and Shanahan, and to a large degree Elway,
couldn't coexist because they all want control, they're all
stubborn, and they all believe they are masters of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, even Reeves acknowledged that ``Mike knew how to get
the best out of John.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen fires Reeves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Broncos dropped to 8-8 and club owner Pat Bowlen,
prodded by Elway, fired Reeves. Afterward, Elway, who on Sunday
will become the first quarterback to start in five Super Bowls for
the same team, said the final three years under Reeves ``were like
being in hell'' and that ``I would not have been back here if Dan
Reeves had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves expected to be replaced by Shanahan. Wade Phillips got
the assignment. He lasted two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan finally got the Denver head coaching job in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Shanahan and Elway did what Reeves and Elway hadn't
done. They won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said he thought they had put their differences behind.
He, Elway and Reeves played a round of golf together last year
during the Masters in Augusta, Ga. When Reeves underwent quadruple
bypass heart surgery six weeks ago, Shanahan and Elway were among
the first to send well wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop Wednesday, Reeves flung moonshine jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I'll ever get over, quote, the situation,''
Reeves said. ``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away.
You never forget those things. I had a lot of great times with
those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting it off his chest before the teams got to Miami might
have been Reeves' way of gaining closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you're fired and you've been in a place for
12 years you can't say it doesn't hurt you,'' Reeves said. ``It
changed an awful lot of people's lives just like me making a
decision about Mike changed people's lives. It caused a lot of pain
for my wife and children, and it wasn't like they deserved it
because we weren't successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in Denver for the rest of my career. I can't
tell you how many times Pat told me, `We'll finish our careers
together.' That's the way I personally saw it.'' &QL;

UCLA WOMEN ROUT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Against the backdrop of the UCLA women's
basketball team's 94-53 rout of USC on Saturday, the teams look at
themselves and answer questions that have become obvious at this
point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, the questions cause coach Kathy Olivier to dream for a
moment before bringing herself back to the present.
</P>
<P>
   She knows people wonder if this Bruins team (15-4, 7-0 Pac-10)
can become the school's first to go 18-0 in conference.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Philman, who scored seven points Saturday, emphatically
says she wants to be on the team that does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more experienced. We're more focused,'' she said. ``We
work on our weaknesses. The coaches prepare us. We're more
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivier smiles. This season has been something for Bruins fans
so far. The team ended Stanford's 63-game home win streak last
week. On Saturday, the Bruins won their eighth straight game in
front of 9,530 _ a Pauley Pavilion women's record crowd _ and
handed their rival its sixth-worst loss ever. It was UCLA's largest
margin of victory over the Women of Troy (6-10, 2-5) since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA shot 63 percent from the field and had five players score
in double figures, led by Maylana Martin's 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Martin continues to play well despite four weeks of recurring
headaches caused by a fluid leak in her spine. She said she will
meet with doctors again today.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier takes all this into account, then admits she tries to
stay focused. But she knows this team is capable of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take care of business off the court. They take care of
business on the court,'' Olivier said. ``They want to be good. They
want to go 18-0. That's their goal. As exciting as what we did
(Saturday) and against Stanford, we still have other things to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   For USC, Murphy's Law is in effect. The season just got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center Adrain Williams hurt her ankle while blocking a
Janae Hubbard shot just 2 minutes, 40 seconds into the game. The
extent of her injury is unknown, but coach Chris Gobrecht hopes
it's just a sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the last of a highly touted recruiting class of six
that never panned out because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   USC now has eight players, including three freshmen who started.
</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht's eyes were a little red when she met with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make me fight back tears,'' she said. ``Nobody should have
to go through it to that extent. I've never seen a team be put
through what this team has been put through.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was overmatched from the start, committing 24 turnovers and
trailing 49-20 at the half. The Women of Troy shot 30 percent from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Elmore, one of the freshman starters, led USC with 16
points, and sophomore Tashara Carter added 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've been better this year,'' Gobrecht said. ``We
didn't know they'd all go down. I'm hopeful for some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get better. They know their time will come. L.A.
was SC's town for a lot of years, and the sun will rise again. None
of these kids doubt it.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; HOW THE MIND WORKS &LR;  By Steven Pinker. Norton, $17. A psychology
professor argues that the mind is not a blank slate at birth, but
comes with specialized modules shaped by natural selection for
communication, perception and everyday tasks. In 1997 the New York
Times reviewer Mark Ridley called this ``witty popular science that
you enjoy reading for the writing as well as for the science.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MIRROR &LR;  By Lynn Freed. Ballantine, $11.95. The ambitious
heroine of this stylized historical novel leaves England after
World War I for a new life in South Africa, where she is hired as a
housekeeper by a wealthy Jewish family. After an affair with the
elderly head of the household results in a baby daughter, she
struggles to maintain her independence and control her romantic
destiny against imposing odds. ``Like so many of the best books,
`The Mirror' makes us laugh while packing, finally, a punch in
which life's sadness prevails over its consolatory moments of
humor,'' Brooke Allen wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ORDEAL OF INTEGRATION: PROGRESS AND RESENTMENT IN AMERICA'S
`RACIAL' CRISIS &LR;  By Orlando Patterson. Civitas/Counterpoint, $15.
Blacks have made remarkable gains over the last 40 years, an
African-American sociologist maintains, but extremists on both the
right and the left who deny those gains are impeding further
progress. In 1997 the Times reviewer James Q. Wilson called this
provocative analysis ``defiant, even angry, often right and
sometimes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOTES OF A NATIVE SON &LR;  By James Baldwin. Beacon, $13.
Originally published in 1955, this is a collection of essays on
such disparate subjects as protest novels, the movie ``Carmen
Jones'' and the death of the author's father. ``Few American
writers handle words more effectively in the essay form than James
Baldwin,'' Langston Hughes wrote in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUL ON ICE &LR;  By Eldridge Cleaver. Delta, $11.95. This is the
searing 1960s prison memoir of the former Black Panther, who died
last year at the age of 62. In it, he lashes out at what he calls a
sick country while recounting his own troubles with the law, which
began when he was 18 with a conviction for marijuana possession. In
1968 in the Times Book Review, Charlayne Hunter called this a
``highly readable and often witty'' book ``about the imprisonment
of men's souls by society.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PRITCHETT CENTURY &LR;  By V.S. Pritchett. Modern Library,
$14.95. Victor Sawdon Pritchett (1900-97) _ novelist, critic,
travel writer and all-round man of letters _ found plenty to write
about, from the Victorian class system to Salman Rushdie. The
result is ``a rich anthology'' by ``one of the most versatile and
consistently satisfying writers of the century,'' Alfred Kazin
wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACE OF A HERO &LR;  By Louis Falstein. Steerforth, $14. This 1950
autobiographical novel by an aerial gunner during World War II
revolves around the 10-man crew of a B-24 based in Italy, and the
flak and fear they encountered on harrowing bombing runs to Vienna,
Munich and the Po Valley, among other places. In his review Herbert
F. West called the story ``both exciting and important.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WALK IN THE SUN &LR;  By Harry Brown, University of Nebraska, $12.
This is the grunt-level tale of a platoon forced to regroup and
carry out its mission after losing its leaders during the Allied
landings at Salerno, Italy. ```A Walk in the Sun' is one of the
most honest books to come out of this war,'' Harvey Breit wrote in
1944. ``It is a small novel possessing dramatic tension'' and
``poetic and realistic speech.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARE YOU SOMEBODY? THE ACCIDENTAL MEMOIR OF A DUBLIN WOMAN &LR;  By
Nuala O'Faolain. Owl/Holt, $11.95. This candid, dignified account
by a columnist for The Irish Times features the booze, religious
repression, guilt and other mainstays of the modern Irish
narrative, but steers clear of its sentimentality and affectations.
``O'Faolain brings a spiky, independent intelligence that
vanquishes cliche,'' Zoe Heller wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SNAKE &LR;  By Kate Jennings. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12. This lean
novel, set in postwar Australia, is about a mismatched couple
living on a remote farm whose marriage is doomed from day one:
She's desperately unhappy and restless, while he's disappointed and
tormented by her shifting moods. ```Snake' is clearly the work of a
powerful imagination,'' Carol Shields wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PUSHKIN HOUSE &LR;  By Andrei Bitov. Translated by Susan
Brownsberger. Dalkey Archive, $13.95. This complex Russian novel
recounts the life, loves and drunken death of its upper-class hero
during and after Stalin's reign. In 1988 the reviewer Frank Kermode
admired the book's ``fiery intelligence,'' adding that ``the author
this work most vividly recalls when at its eloquent and weird best
is Dostoyevsky.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAITING FOR THE BARBARIANS &LR;  By Lewis H. Lapham. Verso, $15. The
editor of Harper's Magazine, in 25 cranky essays that are
nonpartisan in their vitriol, portrays an America where the art of
investing has overtaken the art of governing. Last year the
reviewer Johanna Berkman said ``these dour yet witty ruminations
spare no one and nothing.''
