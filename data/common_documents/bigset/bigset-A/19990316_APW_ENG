<HEADLINE> New Missile Makes Auspicious Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A souped-up version of the Patriot  
interceptor missile downed a target during a test over the 
south-central New Mexico desert, even though that wasn't exactly 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The $12 million test of the Pac-3 on Monday did just what it was  
supposed to do -- collect data and check its capability to detect, 
track and engage a target. 
</P>
<P>
	But the missile also nailed the target -- a Hera test missile  
that had been fired some 6 minutes earlier and about 175 miles to 
the northwest at Fort Wingate, near Gallup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary purpose of the test was not an intercept,'' said  
Cheryl Irwin, a Defense Department spokeswoman at the Pentagon. 
Added Army spokesman Dan O'Boyle, ``It was an added bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test flight from White Sands Missile Range was the first for  
the Pac-3's on-board radar seeker, which sights on a target and 
feeds information to an on-board processor that determines homing 
commands, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-3, unlike the previous Patriot version that was used  
during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, is a hit-to-kill missile. The 
old Patriot used a proximity warhead to destroy targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-3 is designed to protect U.S. troops and allies deployed  
overseas, said Irwin. The missile is designed to hit enemy 
ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft, she said.

<HEADLINE> No Consensus on NFL Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Pick a subject, and NFL owners are likely to be  
stalemated on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Expansion? Many of them want to add a 32nd team to begin play in  
2002. Many aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles or Houston? It will take a two-thirds majority (24  
votes) of the owners for one of those cities to be accepted once a 
recommendation comes from the expansion committee. On Monday, the 
committee couldn't even come up with a preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay? While it looks good for reinstatement for the  
first time since 1991, the debate on what kind of system would work 
best has been exhaustive. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites for Thanksgiving Day games? This might be the most  
contentious issue of all, with Detroit and Dallas desperately 
wanting to remain hosts, and several other clubs, citing 
competitive inequity, seeking a rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 31 owners,'' Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt  
said. ``That means 31 opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob McNair, head of the Houston expansion bid, has been a highly  
visible presence all week. His bid has a solid financial 
arrangement, including civic support, and an impressive stadium 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the two Los Angeles groups, headed by Michael Ovitz  
and Eli Broad, brought anywhere near as strong a presentation as 
Houston. The league is concerned about community commitment as well 
as uncertain stadium situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it appears the expansion committee is eager to find a way to  
recommend Los Angeles, the nation's No. 2 television market, which 
lost the Rams and Raiders in 1995. Thus the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have 24 votes to go to 32 teams, we don't have 24  
votes to go to Houston and we don't have 24 votes to go to Los 
Angeles,'' said Jerry Richardson of Carolina, chairman of the 
league's expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have 24 votes for Bob McNair, we don't 24 votes for  
Michael Ovitz and we don't 24 votes for Eli Broad. We don't have 24 
votes for Carson and we don't have 24 votes for the Coliseum,'' he 
added, referring to three of the prospective owners in the two 
cities and the two Los Angeles sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said it was ``conceivable but  
unlikely'' that no decision would be made on expansion at these 
meetings. He also made it clear there will be no ``win-win 
situation,'' as McNair mentioned on Sunday, by which both cities 
are awarded teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll choose one city for the 32nd and not expand to a  
33rd, that's clear,'' Tagliabue said. ``LA still involves two 
possible stadiums. Houston has no questions as to the stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideal situation would be for Los Angeles to unify itself  
and also have a strong participation of the community to reach out 
to all sectors of the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners wonder why not just remain with the status quo, even  
though it causes scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no clamor for a 32nd team. I think we're OK with 31,''  
Minnesota Vikings owner Red McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt is leading the charge to establish a rotation of home sites  
for Thanksgiving games, and is getting a bitter fight from Detroit, 
which has been host of a holiday game since the 1930s, and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we've raised for 15 years,'' Hunt said.  
``The two teams that are home each Thanksgiving have a competitive 
advantage over teams that travel in a short week. That is a major 
inequity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward DeBartolo Jr., already barred from running the San  
Francisco 49ers for his part in a Louisiana gambling scandal, will 
be fined $1 million today and formally suspended from the NFL for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge of  
failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by former Louisiana 
Gov. Edwin Edwards in connection with DeBartolo's bid for a 
riverboat gambling license. The judge imposed $2 million in fines.

<HEADLINE> Three Ring Wins Gulfstream Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Three Ring, the odds-on favorite,  
annihilated California invader Olympic Charmer, the 8-5 second 
choice, in the $200,000 Grade 2 Bonnie Miss Stakes for 3-year-old 
fillies as Gulfstream ended a 63-day meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring's performance was so impressive it could put her on  
the path toward the May 1 Kentucky Derby instead of the Kentucky 
Oaks at Churchill the day before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the Davona Dale Stakes by 14 3/4 lengths Feb. 21, she  
was entered against colts for the $250,000 Florida Derby last 
Saturday, but scratched after she drew a bad post -- 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by J.R. Velazquez, Three Ring ran a mile and a sixteenth  
in 1:43 3-5 and paid $3.60, $2.20 and $2.10. Olympic Charmer, who 
had won two in a row at Santa Anita by wide margins, paid $3 and 
$2.10. Marley Vale paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner carried 122 pounds, five more than Olympic Charmer.  
The latter took the lead leaving the gate, but Velazquez went right 
with her, staying second by half a length and biding his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Charmer managed to maintain a neck lead down the  
backstretch. Three Ring cruised by her at the quarter pole and drew 
out to win by 6 1/4 lengths. Olympic Charmer was easily second, three 
lengths ahead of Marley Vale. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, a Florida-bred daughter of Notebook owned by Barry  
K. Schwartz, has won five of eight starts with two seconds and a 
third. The four-time stakes winner has earned $753,440. She was 
third to Silverbulletday, a 2-year-old filly champion, by three 
lengths in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Plesa, Jr., Three Ring's trainer, said he was leaning  
toward running the filly in the Oaks, but added, ``She'll be 
nominated for the Derby. It's something to think about. But the 
(Kentucky) Derby will have a much stronger field than we would have 
run against in the Florida Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She showed me today she belonged in the race last Saturday.  
She'd have run if we'd drawn an inside post. But our aim is the 
(Kentucky) Oaks ... I don't believe we'll need a race before it. 
It's possible we might run her in the Derby, but our objective 
always has been the Oaks,'' Plesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Velazquez said Three Ring would have no problem going the mile  
and a quarter of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the California filly all the way,'' he said. ``I knew  
she'd have lots of speed coming off sprints, but there was never a 
doubt I could take her whenever I wanted to. My filly responded as 
soon as I asked her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris McCarron, rider of Olympic Charmer, said his filly ``just  
got outrun.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Urged Over Farm Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some farm-state Republicans are pushing GOP  
leaders to address the agricultural economy soon, arguing that 
delay could risk losing control of the issue to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., four GOP  
lawmakers proposed a series of steps to aid farmers, including an 
increase in price supports that could cost several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture has historically led the U.S. economy into and out  
of recession,'' the lawmakers warned. ``While the overall economy 
is generally good, inattention to the distress in the agricultural 
sector could prove disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Republicans proposed $4 billion in emergency farm  
spending but had to add nearly $2 billion after President Clinton 
vetoed their package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're better served to move now and put the groundwork there  
and establish ourselves as leaders on the issue,'' Rep. John Thune, 
R-S.D. said Tuesday. ``If we do it now, we do it on our own 
terms.'' He signed the letter along with Rick Hill of Montana, Wes 
Watkins of Oklahoma and Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, dated Monday, follows meetings the lawmakers  
recently had with Hastert and other members of the GOP leadership, 
including Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom Davis, 
R-Va., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of farm-state Democrats in the Senate recently proposed  
$6 billion in emergency farm spending this year, about the same 
amount Congress approved last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices fell sharply last year because of a worldwide  
glut of grain, and economists expect farm income to fall about 6 
percent this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on 
Tuesday called the farm sector ``one of the more notable soft 
spots'' in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to increasing price supports, an idea that many  
Republicans have opposed, the letter endorses two ideas opposed by 
the meatpacking industry: country-of-origin labels on meat, and 
mandatory reporting of the prices packers pay for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are things we've been out there advocating for quite  
some time, because we think they make common sense,'' said Tom 
Buis, director of governmental affairs for the National Farmers 
Union, traditionally aligned with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond Democrats and Republicans in the countryside,''  
Buis said. ``People want action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Agriculture Committee spokesman Chris Matthews said the  
panel is considering ways to help farmers, with a focus on 
improving federally subsidized crop insurance.

<HEADLINE> More Salmon Species Now Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nine species of salmon -- including one that swims  
in the heart of bustling Puget Sound -- came under federal 
protection today in a move that promises to have economic 
reverberations across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetically distinct species were listed as endangered or  
threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our greatest challenges is to restore the great salmon  
runs of the Pacific Northwest to sustainable levels,'' said Terry 
Garcia, assistant secretary of commerce. ``Healthy salmon resources 
are essential to the economic health and prosperity of the 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action by the National Marine Fisheries Service covers seven  
salmon runs in Washington and two in Oregon, in bodies of water 
from Washington's Puget Sound to Oregon's Willamette Valley, 300 
miles away. The stretch includes the Northwest's largest cities: 
Seattle and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The protection will likely be felt by all the region's  
residents, from foresters and farmers to homebuilders and 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything that requires a federal permit -- from grazing to  
logging to putting a dock on a river in a listed salmon habitat -- 
will require the permission of federal biologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewer bills and home prices in the Northwest may go up, roads  
may take longer to build and the government may tell people when 
and how often they can water their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone harming salmon or its habitat risks a felony charge. The  
species being added to the list must be released if caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the listing of the northern spotted owl, which triggered  
unpopular federally imposed cutbacks on logging on national 
forests, the salmon listings will give local, state, regional and 
tribal entities a chance to come up with solutions to saving the 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been widespread support for saving salmon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really amazing to see folks saying, `We're going to work  
together,''' said Mark Hubbard, spokesman for the EarthJustice 
Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest waterways, once full of salmon, are now surrounded by  
urban sprawl where industries pollute rivers, road culverts block 
spawning areas and even lawn fertilizers and soap used to wash cars 
seep into streams through storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to ask whether they want to be the last generation  
in the Northwest to have the privilege of marveling at these wild 
stocks of salmon,'' said Terry Garcia, assistant U.S. commerce 
secretary for oceans and atmosphere. ``You can choose to send these 
species along the path to extinction or choose to find a path that 
will allow you to take them with us into the next millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the new listings are expected to further slow an already  
depressed sport fishing industry. Local fishing regulations will 
have to change to protect the wild salmon, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Smitch, Gov. Gary Locke's advisor on salmon issues and a  
former regional official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
called the impact of the move on the human population 
``unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases -- the endangered falcon and cactus in Southern  
California, for example -- ``people have been able to set aside 
certain land areas to protect a species,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the threatened salmon live where we live, and  
they live in the water, which goes everywhere,'' Smitch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest restrictions will not take effect for about two  
months. In the meantime, local government officials intend to work 
with the federal government to determine how the new restrictions 
will be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	The salmon included in the announcement are the Puget Sound  
chinook, the Lower Columbia River chinook, Upper Columbia spring 
chinook, Lake Ozette sockeye, Hood Canal summer chum, Lower 
Columbia chum and the Mid-Columbia steelhead, and the steelhead and 
chinook in the Upper Willamette River. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other salmonid species in Washington have already been  
listed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fisheries service may take further action in other waterways  
in California and Oregon. Decisions on those will come within six 
months, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, we have little choice,'' said Will Stelle,  
Northwest regional director of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service. ``Saving salmon may well, at the end of the day, be saving 
ourselves. Because salmon and clean water are one in the same.''

<HEADLINE> Factories, Housing Show Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Single-family housing construction hit a  
20-year high and even the nation's beleaguered factories showed 
unexpected strength in February as the remarkable U.S. economy 
turned in another stellar performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic news cheered Wall Street investors, pushing  
the Dow Jones industrial average briefly through the historic 
10,000-mark shortly after trading opened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unstoppable U.S. economy just won't quit,'' said Bruce  
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that construction of  
single-family homes rose 1.1 percent in February to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units, the best showing since 
December 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, housing construction dipped 0.6 percent, reflecting a  
drop in apartment building, but the 1.80 million annual rate for 
total home building was down only slightly from a 12-year high of 
1.81 million units set in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that output at the  
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a better-than-expected 
0.2 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories, which have been hard-hit by a loss of export markets  
because of the spreading global economic crisis, managed a 0.2 
percent gain, led by a 1.8 percent surge in production of 
computers, computer chips and communications equipment. Output in 
these high-tech categories is up 26 percent over the past 12 
months, bucking a trend in the rest of manufacturing that has seen 
production cutbacks and job losses totaling 337,000 over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Output in the mining industry was up 0.4 percent as gains in  
coal mining offset weakness in oil and gas drilling. Output at the 
nation's utilities was down 0.6 percent, reflecting a 
warmer-than-usual February. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory output advance prompted some analysts to say the  
worst of the Asian crisis may be over for U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had words of hope  
for the other part of the economy that has suffered from the global 
turmoil -- farming. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the economy's overall performance ``impressive,''  
Greenspan told an audience in San Francisco that he believed 
farmers were weathering their current problems much better than the 
1980 farming crisis. He said they would be in good position to take 
advantage of rising world demand when the one-third of the world in 
recession does recover. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving above the 10,000 milestone in early trading, the  
Dow gave up those gains, ending the day at 9,930, down 28 from 
Monday's record close. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of manufacturing and farming, the U.S. economy has  
continued to forge ahead, powered by strong consumer demand. Most 
analysts had expected the total economy, as measured by the gross 
domestic product, to slow sharply from last year's 3.9 percent 
rate. But Steinberg said the recent strong economic reports were 
prompting him to revise his forecast upward to match last year's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy continues to walk its way through the  
mine fields,'' said Robert Dederick, economist at Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's factories operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in  
February, the lowest capacity utilization rate in 6 1/2 years. The 
absence of production bottlenecks is one reason inflation has 
remained well behaved. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom in housing has been credited to strong job growth and  
low inflation. The absence of inflationary pressures has allowed 
the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, which has 
translated into low mortgage rates for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mortgage rates have been rising for the past six weeks  
and now stand at a 10-month high of 7.11 percent for 30-year 
mortgages. But analysts said housing should remain strong for the 
first half of the year even with the slightly higher mortgage 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing report showed applications for building permits, a  
good indication of future trends, rose 2.7 percent for 
single-family homes to an annual rate of 1.31 million units, the 
highest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the biggest housing gain was posted in the Northeast,  
where construction shot up 35.7 percent in February. Starts also 
rose in the Midwest, by 8 percent, but they fell 15.9 percent in 
the West and were down 2.5 percent in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said the  
good economy was helping homeowners meet their mortgage payments. 
The mortgage delinquency rate fell to 4.24 percent during the final 
three months of 1998, the best showing since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Houston NFL Officials Still Upbeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Like fans agonizing through the final minutes of  
a tight game, Houston officials will watch Los Angeles with rapt 
attention now that NFL owners have given it has six months to put 
up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles' two high-powered ownership groups fail to draw  
up a suitable financing and stadium package, NFL owners decided 
Tuesday that Houston will get the 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed the NFL did not recognize the benefits of  
coming to Houston and awarding a franchise to this city outright,'' 
Mayor Lee Brown said Tuesday night. ``Houston certainly deserves an 
NFL team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting in Phonix, the league's 31 owners settled on a  
compromise solution to the expansion question after months of 
haggling. Los Angeles, with 5.5 million TV homes, always was a 
heavy favorite to outduel Houston, with 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither of Los Angeles' prospective ownership groups has  
cobbled together solid gameplans. Houston businessman Robert McNair 
is ready to move forward with a publicly financed stadium ready to 
be built. He also has guaranteed sellouts for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a feeling that Los Angeles was an advantageous  
location they couldn't ignore,'' McNair said in Phoenix. ``But they 
have six months. It's better than having an open-ended situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL hopes to get a new team kicked off by 2002.  
</P>
<P>
	The owners' apparent ultimatum to the Los Angeles groups was  
heartening to Houston officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it was a very positive message to LA that it's time  
to fish or cut bait,'' said Jack Rains, chairman of the Harris 
County-Houston Sports Authority. ``LA has waltzed around for three 
years saying `Trust us, we'll get it together.' Now, we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles finally comes through with the financial and  
facilities plan the NFL seeks, McNair has a Plan B: buy an existing 
team and move it to the Astrodome until a retractable roof stadium 
is built next door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles has had 14 months to organize its plan. There is  
no guarantee LA will be better organized six months from now,'' 
Brown said. ``We are still optimistic about receiving a new 
franichse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both cities lost their teams during a flurry of franchise  
movement in the mid-1990s. The Rams moved to St. Louis, the Raiders 
moved back to Oakland and the Houston Oilers moved to Nashville,

offers that Los Angeles and Houston did not match.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Wants Death Penalty in Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A Salvadoran man who was facing 30 years in prison  
on a terrorism charge now could be sentenced to death after the 
Cuban prosecutor upgraded his recommendation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Enrique Nunez Grillo said the evidence warranted  
execution by firing squad for Otto Rene Rodriguez Llerena, who 
confessed to placing a bomb in the lobby of the luxury Melia-Cohiba 
Hotel on Aug. 3, 1997, and brought more explosives to Cuba for 
additional attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a surprise move, especially because the bombing caused no  
injuries and only minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution had asked for the death penalty last week in a  
separate trial of another Salvadoran charged in a string of 1997 
hotel bombings that left one person dead and 11 others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnabout underscores just how seriously the bombings are  
being taken by Cuba, which says it is under increasing attack from 
both the U.S. government and the Miami-based exile community. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities have used the two trials to accuse the Cuban  
exiles of plotting violent actions to harm the communist government 
of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Llerena was arrested on July 10, 1998, at Havana's  
international airport as he tried to bring more than three pounds 
of explosives into Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate trial last week, prosecutors recommended the death  
penalty for Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, who admitted planting bombs in 
six tourist sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Both trials have featured Cuban agents who infiltrated exile  
groups, as well as people arrested in Cuba for receiving money from 
the organizations to undertake violence. 
</P>
<P>
	During this week's trial, Francisco Fernandez Gomez testified  
that he and his wife, Olga Alfonso Prada, infiltrated violent exile 
organizations in Miami beginning in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the groups he said he had contact with was Alpha 66, which  
supports the violent overthrow of the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said exiles arranged for him to receive explosives  
that were to be brought into Cuba by Rodriguez Llerena. The 
Salvadoran said he received the materials in El Salvador from a man 
who he knew as Ignacio Medina but who the Cuban government says was 
a shadowy exile named Luis Posada Carriles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has charged that Posada organized the bombings in both Cruz  
Leon's and Rodriguez Llerena's cases, and that a secret military 
wing of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation paid for 
the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation repeatedly has denied the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments in last week's trial, prosecutors showed a  
videotape in which Posada said Cruz Leon was contracted by members 
of the exile group. He later said he had lied about the 
foundation's involvement, but did not deny his own alleged role.

<HEADLINE> Two Face China Smuggling Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two men pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges they  
plotted to sell to China equipment vital to missile guidance 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Yao Yi, of Beijing, and Collin Xu, a  
naturalized Canadian citizen from Montreal, tried to buy fiber 
optic gyroscopes from a Massachusetts defense contractor and ship 
them to China, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Denner, an attorney for Yao, said his client was simply  
caught up in a series of misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a spy,'' Denner said. ``He's part of a new breed of  
Chinese entrepreneurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denner said the gyroscopes -- which are used in navigational  
systems for missiles and aircraft guidance systems -- were meant for 
a high-speed railway's navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say China has been trying to enhance the  
accuracy of its long-range weapons with high-tech American 
equipment. The export of such equipment is limited by the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu, who is also charged with conspiracy and money laundering,  
has been held without bail since his arrest Feb. 11 in Boston. Yao 
is being held pending a decision on his bail. He was arrested Feb. 
22 in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Post Gains / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures led grains higher Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation the government may put 
more land in a conservation set-aside program. 
</P>
<P>
        May soybeans rose to the highest level in almost a month, shaking  
off news that the dry weather in South America will continue at least 
through Wednesday, facilitating the harvest of large corn and soybean 
crops in Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat also surged higher near the close as talk of the possible  
acreage set-asides spread, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat had been mixed prior to the late surge as traders balanced  
news of strong export demand with forecasts for more rain in the hard 
red winter wheat belt. Corn also followed soybeans higher, but there 
was little news otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for May delivery was up 4 1/4 cents to $2.76 1/2 a bushel;  
May corn was up 3 3/4 cents to $2.23 3/4 a bushel; May oats were up 
3/4 cent to $1.10 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans were up 11 3/4 cents to 
$4.82 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Live cattle was mixed and feeder cattle rose on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, while lean hogs were mixed and pork bellies 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle futures rose 0.40 cent to 66.75 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle rose 0.40 cent to 71.97 cents per pound; April 
lean hogs fell 0.15 cent to 40.92 cents a pound; and May pork bellies 
rose 1.80 cent to 51.12 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Congressmen Arrested in NYC Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two congressmen and former Mayor David Dinkins  
were among 14 people arrested as they protested last month's fatal 
police shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Charles Rangel and Gregory Meeks, both Democrats, as well  
as the Rev. Al Sharpton and two members of the City Council, were 
arrested at police headquarters Monday and charged with criminal 
trespass. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators have demanded action against four police officers  
involved in the Feb. 4 shooting of Amadou Diallo, 22. Police fired 
at him 41 times; he was hit 19 times. The shooting is under 
investigation by a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the 14 arrested were given summonses and released  
after about two hours. One man was detained after police found an 
outstanding warrant against him from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the arrests a ``publicity stunt.''  
</P>
<P>
	According to a New York Times poll published today, fewer than  
25 percent of New York residents say they believe police treat 
blacks and whites equally. Nearly nine out of 10 blacks questioned 
said they thought police often engaged in brutality against blacks. 
</P>

week, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  Train-Truck Accident Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators examining the nation's  
worst train wreck since 1993 focused Tuesday on how a truck loaded 
with steel girders drove into the path of an Amtrak train even 
though crossing gates apparently were working properly. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 13 people were killed and 116 injured in Monday night's  
collision at a rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. Rescue 
crews used cranes to move mangled, smoldering pieces of metal as 
the search for more victims stretched into Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Four to six people were missing and feared dead. Forty-nine  
people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure there are no survivors and if that means  
taking the wreckage apart part by part, that's what we'll do,'' 
said Bourbonnais Fire Chief Mike Harshbarger. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, John R. Stokes, 58, told investigators that he  
didn't see the train as he approached the tracks and that warning 
lights started flashing after he had started driving across. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, charged that  
Stokes was trying to dodge the crossing gates, thinking the 
oncoming train was a slow-moving freight train instead of a faster 
passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
	``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the  
barriers down and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around 
it,'' Thompson said at a news conference in Madison, Wis. ``There 
was no way to avoid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also said Stokes was driving on a probationary  
license after receiving three speeding tickets within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered only minor injuries in the crash.  
</P>
<P>
	There were 217 people aboard Amtrak's City of New Orleans when  
it hit the tractor-trailer at a rural crossing near a steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
	John Goglia, an NTSB investigator, said the locomotive's ``black  
box'' revealed that the train was going 79 mph, the maximum speed 
allowed on the line, and that the engineer blew the whistle before 
the train hit the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will pursue this with vigor to determine if there is a  
signal problem or in fact we have a driver problem,'' Goglia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash sparked a fire that burned for more than five hours.  
The train's two engines and leading cars were scattered like burned 
and broken toys over a quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
	One engine punched through a double-deck sleeping car that had  
been three cars behind it before the train derailed and folded like 
an accordion. All of the dead were found in the sleeping car, where 
many passengers were settling in for the night when the 14-car 
train slammed into the truck at 9:47 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden everything just started crashing and  
catching on fire and people hollering and running,'' said Blanche 
Jones, a passenger from Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't get out, couldn't find a way out. That was the  
most devastating thing of all. By the grace of God, I just went 
down a stairway and found a way to get out and let everybody know 
how to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people were confirmed dead by a coroner, but National  
Transportation Safety Board officials reported 13 deaths and 
attributed the discrepancy to the horrible condition of the 
victims' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released the names of the victims. The  
Commercial Appeal in Memphis reported Wednesday that the victims 
included a woman and three children from Nesbit, Miss., who were 
returning from a doll show in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	June Bonnin, 47; her 12-year-old granddaughter, Jessica  
Whitaker; Rainy Lipscomb, 10; and Lacey Lipscomb, 8, were killed. 
Another girl, Bonnin's daughter, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was to be a dream trip for the little girls,'' said  
Bonnin's husband, Max. ``It turned out to be a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two gates at the crossing each block a single lane of the narrow  
two-lane road, which provides access to the nearby steel mill. The 
gates and lights at the crossing appear to have been functioning at 
the time of the crash, according to David Farrell, a spokesman for 
the Illinois Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver said he didn't see the train until he was  
already in the crossing and tried to get out of the way, according 
to Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National Transportation 
Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Gura described Stokes as ``very sad and upset. He felt he did  
whatever he thought he could do to clear the train track but he 
didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response at Stokes' home in the nearby town of  
Manteno on Tuesday, and neighbors said they had not seen him for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stead, head of rail safety at the ICC, said the gates were  
intact, and authorities have not been able to verify where the 
truck was at the time of impact or when the gates were lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensors turn on the lights and bells 26 seconds before a train  
reaches the crossing, and five seconds later the gates come down, 
Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrell said the crossing has a relatively good safety record,  
with three deaths in the last 35 years -- in 1964, 1968 and 1988. He 
said about 40 trains and 1,800 vehicles a day use the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst accident in Amtrak's 28-year history happened on Sept.  
22, 1993. Forty-two passengers and five crew members died when the 
Sunset Limited went off a bridge into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. The 
bridge had been damaged minutes earlier when it was hit by a 
towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst previous Amtrak crash killed 16 people in January 1987  
in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The City of New Orleans runs almost the same route between  
Chicago and New Orleans as was used by the original Illinois 
Central train with that name. It was the subject of a hit song for 
Arlo Guthrie.

	5 Killed in Amtrak Train Derailment  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Rescue crews climbed through the  
twisted hulk of an Amtrak train today, hoping to find survivors 
after a derailment killed at least five people and injured more 
than 100 others taking a ride on the City of New Orleans. As many 
as 21 people were missing and feared dead, said Mike Harshbarger, 
the Bourbonnais fire chief. He said 188 of the 214 people on the 
train had been accounted for at hospitals and shelters. It was 
unknown whether the missing were all passengers. The train had 18 
crew members. The New Orleans-bound train careened off the tracks 
shortly after 9:30 p.m. last night after it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, under  
attack from opponents seeking to oust him from power, rallied 
30,000 supporters today and said the breakaway republic was at risk 
of descending into anarchy. Maskhadov said that his foes, including 
prominent warlord Shamil Basayev, were pushing the territory into 
chaos and lawlessness by attempting to establish a parallel Islamic 
government in a bid to erode his power. Maskhadov has accused 
Basayev and other warlords of staging the recent kidnapping of a 
Russian police general in a bid to provoke another war with Russia.

artillery sites in the northern ``no-fly'' zone, a U.S. military 
official said. Lt. Col. Jane Rinell, a spokeswoman for the 
Operation Northern Watch based at Turkey's southern Incirlik air 
base, said the planes hit military facilities around Mosul, 250 
miles north of Baghdad. She said all U.S. F-15Es departed the area 
safely on the third consecutive day of confrontations. U.S. and 
British aircraft enforce ``no-fly'' zones over the north and south 
of Iraq to protect the Kurdish minority and Shiite rebels.

	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Police held four people for questioning

motorcycle opened fire Sunday at the game at Clondalkin on the 
city's suburban west side. Four people were hospitalized, but 
authorities said none faced life-threatening injuries. Detectives 
said today they had ruled out any paramilitary connection with the 
shooting, but the three men and one woman were all detained under 
Ireland's anti-terrorism law, permitting them to be kept in custody 
for up to 72 hours.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With implementation stalled on the Good Friday  
peace accord on Northern Ireland reached a year ago, President 
Clinton meets this week with several key figures in the peace 
process hopes of moving the process forward. Administration 
officials say the St. Patrick's Day meetings with republican and 
loyalist leaders from Northern Ireland and Irish government 
officials won't be negotiating sessions. Rather, Clinton will 
remind the leaders how far they've come and urge them to continue 
their dialogue. But with a new outbreak of violence in Northern 
Ireland on Monday -- a car bomb killed a prominent attorney who 
represented Catholic clients -- all sides will have their work cut 
out for them.

other violations of their rights as soon as next year. For the 
first time, a procedure has been drawn up to allow women to file 
complaints with the United Nations on violations of a 1979 
convention barring abuses against women. The U.N. Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women requires

already in the crossing and tried to get out of the way, according 
to Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National Transportation 
Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Gura described Stokes as ``very sad and upset. He felt he did  
whatever he thought he could do to clear the train track but he 
didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response at Stokes' home in the nearby town of  
Manteno on Tuesday, and neighbors said they had not seen him for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stead, head of rail safety at the ICC, said the gates were  
intact, and authorities have not been able to verify where the 
truck was at the time of impact or when the gates were lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensors turn on the lights and bells 26 seconds before a train  
reaches the crossing, and five seconds later the gates come down, 
Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrell said the crossing has a relatively good safety record,  
with three deaths in the last 35 years -- in 1964, 1968 and 1988. He 
said about 40 trains and 1,800 vehicles a day use the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst accident in Amtrak's 28-year history happened on Sept.  
22, 1993. Forty-two passengers and five crew members died when the 
Sunset Limited went off a bridge into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. The 
bridge had been damaged minutes earlier when it was hit by a 
towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst previous Amtrak crash killed 16 people in January 1987  
in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The City of New Orleans runs almost the same route between  
Chicago and New Orleans as was used by the original Illinois 
Central train with that name. It was the subject of a hit song for 
Arlo Guthrie.

<HEADLINE> Housing Project Ruling Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A court order mandating public housing in  
predominantly white, affluent suburbs has been overturned by a 
federal appeals court that said ``a race-conscious remedy should be 
the remedy of last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in  
New Orleans on Tuesday told U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer to 
come up with a more race-neutral solution to Dallas housing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also continued an order blocking further construction  
of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was a victory for two homeowners' associations that  
had challenged the construction of two 40-unit projects adjacent to 
their upscale North Dallas neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the recipients into our neighborhood,'' said Jacob  
Cherner, legal officer for the Preston Highlands Homeowners' 
Association. ``Our issue is with the building of permanent 
structures in our neighborhoods based on racial criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least part of the disputed housing development -- a $4.9  
million project that houses 75 families -- has been occupied since 
May. It was not clear how residents there would be affected by the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the city and the Dallas Housing Authority did not  
return phone calls Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  Pippen Searches for Offensive Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen has shown the Houston Rockets his  
defensive skills. Now he wants to show them he can play offense, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract with the  
Rockets in January and hoped to show he was worth it. But as the 
season has unfolded, most of the Rockets' offense has gone through 
Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen wants in on the fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes  
I'm playing, I'm not involved in the offense. It makes the game not 
any fun anymore. My next step is to find why this organization 
wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's frustration level has been rising recently as his  
offensive participation has remained sparse. He took only five 
shots and scored four points in 35 minutes Sunday during a 104-90 
loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is averaging 40.6 minutes, fourth in the NBA, but he  
doesn't believe the Rockets are getting the most from his talents. 
Against the Suns, Barkley took 21 shots and Olajuwon 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game for everybody. There's nights when things are not 
going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody else 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had similar comments following Saturday night's 100-89  
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers when he had only one point in 
the first half, but ended up with 16 points and 10 assists. The 
Rockets might have lost the game without his second-half spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cavaliers, Pippen was 4-of-11 from the field and  
Olajuwon was 11-of-19. Pippen is averaging 15 points, 5.6 assists 
and 7.5 rebounds this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult for me,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be  
hard for me to find myself in this offense. They've sort of built 
the offense around getting the ball in to Charles and Hakeem 
inside. For me to get shots, that's not going to happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is accustomed to the comfortable consistency of the  
Chicago Bulls, where he was the sidekick for Michael Jordan. 
Everyone knew his role and simply rolled to six NBA championships. 
Pippen found a different situation when he arrived in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``Obviously, we've got to do a better job of getting it to 
Scottie and Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their All-Star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records this season, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of 
what the offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders, and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow we 
can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good individuals 
show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each other and 
come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet NIreland Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With implementation stalled on the Good Friday  
peace accord on Northern Ireland reached a year ago, President 
Clinton meets this week with several key figures in hopes of moving 
the peace process forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the St. Patrick's Day meetings with  
republican and loyalist leaders from Northern Ireland and Irish 
government officials won't be negotiating sessions. Rather, Clinton 
will remind the leaders how far they've come and urge them to 
continue their dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will use the St. Patrick's Day celebration and  
the gathering of Northern Ireland leaders here in Washington on 
Wednesday to reiterate the importance of moving forward,'' White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``It is manifestly 
in the interests of all the parties to keep moving forward ... and 
to not ... return to an era of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with a new outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland on  
Monday -- a car bomb killed a prominent attorney who represented 
Catholic clients -- all sides will have their work cut out for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of the new 12-member, 10-department government was  
pushed back from March 10 to Good Friday, April 2, after the 
would-be government leader, Ulster Unionist Party chief David 
Trimble, insisted that the outlawed Irish Republican Army begin 
disarming before Sinn Fein, the political party affiliated with the 
IRA's cause, is seated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the president will fully support the position  
already taken by the British prime minister, Tony Blair, the Irish 
prime minister, Bertie Ahern that decommissioning must begin 
immediately if this process is to work,'' Trimble said in 
Washington Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein leaders have protested that the Good Friday accord,  
which Clinton's envoy, former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell, had a hand in crafting, never set decommissioning of 
weapons as a condition for joining the compromise government. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton wanted to steer clear of the legal arguments over the 
accord and focus instead on rebuilding trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are focused much more on helping the parties understand  
that in addition to the formalities of the document, they need to 
take the steps to give each other the confidence that the process 
is moving forward,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge, apparently, will be determining what steps will  
satisfy both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``There always has been a set of hard issues for the parties to  
work through,'' the administration official said. ``Because they're 
hard, they have often tried to defer solving them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was greeted warmly when he visited Ireland last year,  
and he has been credited with helping to keep the peace process 
alive. Administration officials hope the attention the key players 
receive in Washington this week will help restore confidence in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton won't be ``pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but he should  
be able to nudge all of the participants in the right direction,'' 
David Alderdice, mayor of Belfast, said Monday. ``In his past 
interventions in Northern Ireland, Clinton has always demonstrated 
a deft hand at nudging at exactly the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president will attend the annual St. Patrick's Day luncheon  
on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and present Mitchell with the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on the peace accord. 
That night, he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are to host a 
reception on the South Lawn of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But between the social events there will be time for separate  
meetings with key figures. Among those coming to the White House 
are Trimble, Ahern, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and Seamus Mallon, 
the Catholic deputy of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups will be working behind the scenes, particularly  
labor leaders who have long held an interest in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who is participating in many of  
the social events surrounding St. Patrick's Day, said he expects to 
meet with Adams, Trimble, and others.

<HEADLINE> 4 Charged in Date Rape Drug Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODHAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- Four men have been arraigned on charges  
they slipped a ``date-rape drug'' into the soft drink of a 
15-year-old girl who went into a coma and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Reid, a high school freshman, was one of three teen-age  
girls secretly drugged at a party Jan. 16 on Grosse Ile, an 
affluent island community in the Detroit River, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Samantha's Mountain Dew was spiked with either GHB  
or GBL, drugs that can render victims helpless. She died the next 
day at a hospital. One of the other girls also required hospital 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged Tuesday with manslaughter and poisoning were Erick  
Limmer, 25; Joshua Cole, 18; Daniel Brayman, 18; and Nicholas 
Holtschlag, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The poisoning charge carries a maximum sentence of life in  
prison. Manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was held at Limmer's apartment.  
</P>
<P>
	The victim's mother, Judi Clark, sobbed uncontrollably as the  
judge set bail for the defendants at $80,000 each. She collapsed in 
a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB and GBL are powerful central nervous system depressants.  
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration has said GHB is linked to 32  
deaths and 3,500 overdoses nationally since 1990. In 1990 the Food 
and Drug Administration banned GHB, a synthetic drug, amid concerns 
about its use as a dietary supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	As for GBL, the FDA has warned the public against swallowing it.  
Some claim GBL can build muscle, enhance sexual performance and 
reduce stress. Police say it is increasingly being used in sexual 
assaults.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Has Musical History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ``City of New Orleans'' is built of iron,  
but it's always had music in its soul. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlo Guthrie made the train famous when he sang the 1970s anthem  
by that name, a tune penned by folk singer Steve Goodman as he rode 
to New Orleans. The train had just begun the same run Monday night 
when it crashed and derailed outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Goodman wrote his song, the Illinois Central Railroad ran  
the train, a fact noted in Goodman's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of that song was written in 15 or 20 minutes,  
right on the train. He did crossword puzzles like that,'' said Al 
Bunetta, manager for Goodman, who died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's management has changed -- Amtrak operates it now --  
but the ``City of New Orleans'' retains its musical soul, which 
some trace to the rich musical traditions of blues, Dixieland and 
jazz shared by the cities at either end of the run, Chicago and New 
Orleans. The route also takes the train through Memphis, Tenn., 
another blues hotbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's known to be a party train, but it's even more so around  
Mardi Gras time,'' said Steve Grande, who writes train reviews and 
has traveled 126,000 miles on Amtrak routes over the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dining car of the ``City of New Orleans'' features Cajun  
cooking, including gumbo, red beans and rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's crash involving the train occurred about 9:45 p.m.  
local time, and that there were deaths in the sleeping cars 
indicated that some people had settled into their rooms for the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Grande said others probably were just getting warmed up for the  
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bar would probably still be open, and they might be  
playing a movie in the Sightseer lounge car,'' he said. ``That's 
where a number of people like to hang out, play cards, talk, have a 
drink.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Gore Needs Public Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be the front-runner  
for the Democratic presidential nomination, but new polls suggest 
he must inspire more public enthusiasm and confidence if he is to 
win the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore on Monday lined up endorsements from House Minority Leader  
Dick Gephardt and key Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire. But 
polls by CNN/USA Today/Gallup and ABC/Washington Post showed Gore's 
continued vulnerability with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore trailed Republican front-runners George W. Bush, governor  
of Texas, and Elizabeth Dole, former president of the Red Cross, in 
head-to-head matchups in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. Bush led 
Gore 56 percent to 41 percent, while Dole led Gore 52 percent to 44 
percent. Gore trailed the two Republicans by similar margins in the 
ABC/Post poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president matched up well with Bush on personal  
character traits in the ABC/Post poll, but trailed by 27 percentage 
points in the rating for strong leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of those polled, 56 percent, said they want a  
president who will keep the country going in the direction 
President Clinton has been leading it. And two-thirds say they 
think Gore's positions on important issues are the same as 
Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	And while six out of 10 in the ABC/Post poll say they approve of  
the job Gore is doing as vice president, 38 percent of those who 
approve of Gore say they would vote for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's aides say the vice president is just starting to define  
himself and note that vice presidents often face similar problems 
on public perceptions of their leadership potential. Then-Vice 
President George Bush, father of the Texas governor, trailed in 
categories like leadership in the 1988 battle for the GOP 
nomination and in the general election, but eventually won the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush had the support of 94 percent of Republicans,  
while Gore had the support of three out of four Democrats in the 
ABC/Post poll. Gore trailed Bush by 56 percent to 37 percent among 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,025 adults was taken Friday  
through Sunday. The ABC/Washington Post poll of 1,515 people was 
taken Thursday through Sunday. Both polls had error margins of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Pens' Kasparaitis Opts for Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius  
Kasparaitis on Tuesday said he will undergo season-ending surgery 
on his right knee, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, who hurt his knee for the second time this season  
earlier this month, had hoped a few weeks off would allow him to 
make the playoffs. But he decided the possibility of sustaining a 
career-ending injury was too big a risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knee now is swollen and not stable,'' Kasparaitis said.  
``To have more damage to my knee is really dangerous. I think I'm 
still young, I can rehab and come back next year healthy and ready 
to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation will be the second reconstructive surgery on  
Kasparaitis' right knee in four years. He expects to have the 
surgery in New York and rehabilitate it over the summer at his Long 
Island home. 
</P>
<P>
	When he suffered the knee injury in the preseason, the  
defenseman feared he would need season-ending surgery. With rest 
and rehabilitation, Kaspararitis played 48 games until his skate 
caught in a rut March 5 during a game against Edmonton and further 
damaged the knee ligaments. He hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had been unstable and it finally gave out,'' Penguins  
physician Charles Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, 26, is the Penguins' most physical presence. He had  
one goal and four assists this season with 70 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis said he wrestled with the decision to get the  
operation now. He knew he needed surgery and that it would 
eventually cost him six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to my wife and family and we asked if it was worth  
it,'' he said. ``Maybe you re-injure the knee again and you can 
damage it. It's not worth it because I want to play 10 or 12 more 
years. I'd rather have the surgery now and fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis is eligible to become a restricted free agent after  
this season.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders MOMA To Turn Art Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two paintings loaned to the Museum of Modern Art  
must be handed over to a grand jury investigating whether the works 
were stolen by Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court's Appellate Division on Tuesday reversed  
a lower court ruling that said the museum did not have to obey a 
grand jury subpoena and could return the two paintings to Vienna, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say the paintings were stolen from Jewish owners  
at the start of World War II and want them to remain here until 
ownership is sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings -- ``Dead City III'' and ``Portrait of Wally'' by  
Austrian Egon Schiele -- are worth about $2 million each. They were 
on loan from the Leopold Foundation for a three-month exhibit that 
ended in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	City prosecutors obtained a subpoena demanding the paintings be  
turned over to a grand jury for inspection after heirs to the 
owners complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The heirs said ``Portrait of Wally'' was stolen from Lea Jaray  
Bondi as she fled her home and that ``Dead City III'' was stolen 
from Fritz Grunbaum before his death in the Dachau concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum moved to quash the subpoena, citing a state law that  
bars ``any kind of seizure'' of art loaned to New York 
institutions. An acting state Supreme Court justice granted the 
motion, but the appeals court said the subpoena was not authorizing 
a ``seizure.'' Rather, the paintings were being brought before the 
court as physical evidence.

<HEADLINE>  Pippen Searches for Offensive Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen has shown the Houston Rockets his  
defensive skills. Now he wants to show them he can play offense, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract with the  
Rockets in January and hoped to show he was worth it. But as the 
season has unfolded, most of the Rockets' offense has gone through 
Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen wants in on the fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes  
I'm playing, I'm not involved in the offense. It makes the game not 
any fun anymore. My next step is to find why this organization 
wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's frustration level has been rising recently as his  
offensive participation has remained sparse. He took only five 
shots and scored four points in 35 minutes Sunday during a 104-90 
loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is averaging 40.6 minutes, fourth in the NBA, but he  
doesn't believe the Rockets are getting the most from his talents. 
Against the Suns, Barkley took 21 shots and Olajuwon 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game for everybody. There's nights when things are not 
going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody else 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had similar comments following Saturday night's 100-89  
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers when he had only one point in 
the first half, but ended up with 16 points and 10 assists. The 
Rockets might have lost the game without his second-half spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cavaliers, Pippen was 4-of-11 from the field and  
Olajuwon was 11-of-19. Pippen is averaging 15 points, 5.6 assists 
and 7.5 rebounds this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult for me,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be  
hard for me to find myself in this offense. They've sort of built 
the offense around getting the ball in to Charles and Hakeem 
inside. For me to get shots, that's not going to happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is accustomed to the comfortable consistency of the  
Chicago Bulls, where he was the sidekick for Michael Jordan. 
Everyone knew his role and simply rolled to six NBA championships. 
Pippen found a different situation when he arrived in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``Obviously, we've got to do a better job of getting it to 
Scottie and Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their All-Star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records this season, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of 
what the offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders, and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow we 
can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good individuals 
show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each other and 
come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Top-Seeded Huskies Coming of Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- It's been a long season for a team hobbled  
at times by injuries and inexperience. Coach Geno Auriemma's 
Connecticut Huskies may be coming of age just in time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, top seed in the Mideast Regional, will settle in  
Cincinnati on Wednesday to prepare for Iowa State in the NCAA 
tournament round of 16. The team, ranked fourth in the nation, 
nearly didn't make it. The Huskies survived a scare against Xavier 
on Sunday, securing an 86-84 victory in the final seven seconds on 
two free throws by freshman Tamika Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is one of two freshman starters for Auriemma, who also  
goes with two sophomores and a junior. Only senior Amy Duran has 
played in the Final Four, and so for most the tournament is new 
territory. He admits he has a lot to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is more physically gifted than any team we've ever  
had at their age,'' Auriemma said after practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the season with the nation's best recruiting class of  
forwards Williams, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones, and guards Sue Bird and 
Keirsten Walters. Injuries, however, have whittled down the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was lost at midseason with a torn knee ligament, Cash  
missed several games with a stress fracture in her right leg and on 
Tuesday suffered a mild concussion at practice. Walters started 14 
games but has been day to day with a sore left knee. Starters Jones 
and Williams are growing into a dominating presence under the 
boards, and Williams has had to work through back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries weren't limited to the rookies. Junior guard Shea  
Ralph, who missed her sophomore season while rehabilitating from a 
torn knee ligament, missed four games after she sprained the same 
knee. Duran broke her right hand and missed the final 10 games of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Auriemma said the challenge with a young team is turning a group  
of talented individuals into a team and getting them to believe it 
takes more than talent to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frustration is getting them to listen, to pay attention,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The close call against Xavier got everyone's attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like when we've been in these situations before,  
we've kind of crumpled with everyone kind of looking at each 
other,'' Ralph said. ``We didn't do that this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said when she saw some of her teammates struggling  
early in the game, ``I knew I just had to step it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some growing pains making the transition from  
high school, where Williams could usually breeze through the 
competition, to Connecticut's nationally ranked program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep playing hard,'' she said. ``If you cruise,  
you get exposed by players who may not have as much talent but are 
playing harder than you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auriemma said he hoped the Xavier nail-biter delivered the  
lesson that ``as long as there's time left on the clock, we have a 
chance to win.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Wears Brad Pitt's Clothes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The woman accused of breaking into Brad  
Pitt's home and trying on his clothes has been ordered to 
immediately begin counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Dale Fischer issued the order Monday after  
Athena Marie Rolando, 20, said she had signed up for counseling, 
but hadn't started. 
</P>
<P>
	Counseling was one of the terms of a three-year probationary  
sentence handed down last month when Ms. Rolando pleaded no contest 
to misdemeanor trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Ms. Rolando denied having an obsession with Pitt,  
star of such movies as ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Seven Years in 
Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he's good looking,'' she said, ``but I wouldn't  
want to hurt the man, would I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Rolando hoisted herself through a window of  
Pitt's Hollywood Hills home in January. She was discovered wearing 
Pitt's clothes and sleeping in an upstairs bedroom. Pitt was not 
home at the time.

<HEADLINE> HIV-Killing Proteins Found in Tears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found that tears, saliva and  
pregnant women's urine contain proteins that are powerful killers 
of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences, scientists found that a protein called 
lysozyme was able to kill the AIDS virus quickly in test-tube 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Lee-Huang of New York University, lead researcher in the  
study, said the protein could become an important drug against HIV 
because it is a natural compound that the body routinely makes in 
tears and saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ought to be more tolerated and have fewer side effects than  
other HIV drugs,'' said Lee-Huang. ``It possibly could be used in 
combination with other drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known how lysozyme kills HIV, but Lee-Huang speculated  
that it could work by breaking down the outer membrane of the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also found that the urine of pregnant women contains  
another type of protein, called ribonucleases, that destroys the 
genetic material in the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nava Sarver, an AIDS researcher at the National Institute of  
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the study was interesting but 
needs to be confirmed by other laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of work needs to be done to simulate the (laboratory)  
findings in a more relevant situation,'' said Sarver. Her agency, 
NIAID, is part of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the anti-HIV protein was prompted, said  
Lee-Huang, when researchers realized the babies of women infected 
with HIV were somewhat protected from the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers earlier suspected that human chorionic gonadotropin,  
or HCG, a hormone produced during pregnancy, was responsible for 
protecting against HIV and other viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee-Huang said she and her group purified HCG and found it had  
no effect on HIV. The researchers then spent two years isolating 
other proteins in urine and testing them against HIV. Eventually 
they found lysozyme and ribonucleases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher speculated that pregnancy prompts a woman's body  
to make more virus-killing proteins to protect the developing baby 
from viruses and bacteria. That suggests ``Mother Nature knows best 
how to protect the earliest stages of life,'' Lee-Huang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proteins also were found in mother's milk, white blood cells  
and chicken egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of lysozyme in saliva may be a factor in why HIV is  
not transmitted by casual kissing, said Lee-Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is trying to determine exactly how lysozyme attacks  
HIV. That is a critical step in developing a new HIV drug based on 
the protein, she said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Dip Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks lost ground early Wednesday,  
dropping on a bout of profit-taking amid lingering uncertainty over 
the outlook for the nation's recession-hit economy. The dollar rose 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 94.06 points, or 0.59 percent, to  
15,978.76 as of midday. On Tuesday, the average closed up 293.22 
points, or 1.86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.47 yen in late morning trading, up 0.63  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 117.79 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices retreated from gains  
at the outset of trading and moved lower as investors cashed in on 
the market's rally of almost 12 percent so far this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors appeared wary about the prospects for a recovery  
in corporate earnings and the overall economy without further 
policy steps by the government, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the government comes up with more economic stimulus  
measures by the end of the parliamentary session in June, the Tokyo 
stock market will continue rallying. But that's still uncertain,'' 
said Shoji Hirakawa, a strategist at Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-taking erased an early advance into positive  
territory after the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 
10,000-point mark for the first time Tuesday. Computer-driven 
selling sapped some of the Dow's early strength and it closed at 
9,930.47, down 28.30 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 3.18 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,237.71. The 
TOPIX closed up 29.71 points, or 2.45 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar climbed higher as domestic  
importers rushed to shore up their dollar holdings and foreign 
investors sold off yen to repatriate funds withdrawn from the 
Japanese stock market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not many people want or expect the yen to strengthen more than  
it has, and so people who need dollars -- like domestic importers -- 
are moving to cover their short positions,'' said Koichi Udagawa, 
assistant manager of the treasury division at Daiwa Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency also was buoyed by comments from the head of  
the Finance Ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko Kuroda, who 
said early Wednesday that recent movements in the dollar-yen 
exchange rate have been ``a little excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.32 yen, up  
sharply from 127.62 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell Tuesday on news that the entire 20-member European  
Commission resigned in response to a blistering report charging 
cronyism and fraud in the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.750  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.800 percent, driving its price 
up to 100.39 yen from 100.00 yen.

<HEADLINE> 4 Charged in Date Rape Drug Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODHAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- Four men were arraigned Tuesday on  
charges they slipped a ``date-rape drug'' into the soft drink of a 
15-year-old girl who later vomited, went into a coma and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Reid, a high school freshman, was one of three teen-age  
girls secretly drugged at a party Jan. 16 on Grosse Ile, an 
affluent island community in the Detroit River, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Samantha's Mountain Dew was spiked with either GHB  
or GBL, drugs that can render victims helpless. She died the next 
day at a hospital. One of the other girls also required hospital 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged Tuesday with manslaughter and poisoning were Erick  
Limmer, 25; Joshua Cole, 18; Daniel Brayman, 18; and Nicholas 
Holtschlag, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Poisoning carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.  
Manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was held at Limmer's apartment.  
</P>
<P>
	The victim's mother, Judi Clark, sobbed uncontrollably as the  
judge set bail for the defendants at $80,000 each. She collapsed in 
a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB and GBL are powerful central nervous system depressants.  
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration has said GHB is linked to 32  
deaths and 3,500 overdoses nationally since 1990. In 1990 the Food 
and Drug Administration banned GHB, a synthetic drug, amid concerns 
about its use as a dietary supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	As for GBL, the FDA has warned the public against swallowing it.  
Some claim GBL can build muscle, enhance sexual performance and 
reduce stress. Police say it is increasingly being used in sexual 
assaults.

<HEADLINE> Police Say Binion Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The death of Ted Binion, the eccentric son of a  
well-known casino family, at first was written off as an accidental 
drug overdose by a man who had a history of drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Then three men were caught digging up millions of dollars worth  
of silver coins and bars -- so much it overloaded a dump truck -- 
that Binion had buried in a farm town. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the coroner's office and a prosecutor say Binion's death  
Sept. 17 was indeed a homicide, caused by a heroin and Xanax 
overdose administered by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they said, Binion was known as a heroin  
smoker while the dose that killed him had been swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators cannot prove a particular person was  
responsible and the case remains open, David Roger, chief deputy 
district attorney for Clark County, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the coroner has determined it is homicide, we will be  
stepping up our efforts to serve justice in a timely manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Binion's body was found on the floor of his Las Vegas home next  
to an empty bottle of Xanax. Drug tests found that Binion had 
lethal levels of both the prescription sedative and heroin in his 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends insisted it had been several years since he had kicked a  
longtime drug habit, which cost him his stake in his family's 
Horseshoe Club, a downtown Las Vegas landmark started by his father 
in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Binion's live-in girlfriend, Sandra Murphy, 26, and a Missoula,  
Mont. contractor were eyed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The contractor, Richard Tabish, 33, and two other men, Michael  
David Milot and David Lee Mattsen, were arrested in Pahrump, Nev., 
two days after Binion's death, accused of digging up $4 million in 
silver bars and coins Binion had buried in an underground vault 
built by Tabish. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are free on bail.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers contend authorities are fishing for suspects.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have nothing of real substance,'' said David Chesnoff,  
Murphy's attorney.

to have expansion the way we'd like to have it with a facility we'd 
like to have. If it can't, the expansion committee would recommend 
an expansion team be located in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has percolated for four years, since the Raiders went  
back to Oakland and the Rams relocated to St. Louis after the 1994 
season. In 1996, the Oilers moved from Houston to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue has always been committed to returning to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
	But the problem has been made more difficult by the differences  
in the Houston and Los Angeles plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston came in with an owner that most of the current owners  
liked, Bob McNair, a stadium plan that met their standards and 
financing in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, on the other hand, had two competing groups and two  
stadium sites, one in Carson, 18 miles south of Los Angeles, and 
the renovated Los Angeles Coliseum. The NFL also is worried about 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	So within the next few weeks, the stadium committee will visit  
both Los Angeles sites in hopes it can determine quickly which is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every ownership group and political advisors have understood  
the economics of building a stadium,'' said Carolina owner Jerry 
Richardson, chairman of the league's stadium committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to figure out a way to do that and we have a very  
short window. The site is something we must address pretty 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it came down to the size of the television market --  
Los Angeles, with 5.5 million TV homes, and Houston with 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on television contracts and similar factors, the  
league's first priority should be the re-establishment of a 
successful NFL franchise in the great Los Angeles market,'' the 
resolution approved by the owners said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's changed?'' asked Al Davis, who has moved the Raiders  
north and south in California. ``They couldn't get their act 
together in four years. Why should they be able to do it in six 
months?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Buffalo's Ralph Wilson were the only owners to vote  
against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski and Michael Ovitz, who head the two groups, said they  
were pleased by the decision and expected to have their plans ready 
before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't comment on how the ownership would be decided  
and Richardson suggested that other owners for Los Angeles might 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we're together. we have a venue that is great, an  
ownership team that brings a lot to the table,'' Roski said. ``We 
feel we've gotten it together in the last 2 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not be more pleased,'' Ovitz said. ``At this point,  
it's Los Angeles' to lose. We will all continue to do our best to 
make it happen. I believe the team will be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, meanwhile, said he was happy no final decision had been  
made. He also didn't rule out seeking to purchase an existing 
franchise to move to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a feeling that Los Angeles was an advantageous  
location they couldn't ignore,'' he said. ``But they have six 
months. It's better than having an open-ended situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Declined to take action on the sale of the Washington Redskins  
to Howard and Edward Milstein, pending a full report from the 
league's finance committee. Tagliabue said he expects that report 
on Wednesday and that a vote on approving the $800 million sale 
should take place later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Confirmed the one-year suspension and $1 million fine for San  
Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo for his part in a Louisiana 
gambling scandal. Tagliabue said that if DeBartolo did not abide by 
all the conditions of the suspension that the fine would escalate 
to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Voted to keep the Thanksgiving Day games in Detroit and  
Dallas, turning down a motion by Kansas City and New Orleans to 
rotate the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners said we shouldn't tamper with a great tradition,''  
said William Clay Ford Jr. of the Lions, who have been host of a 
Thanksgiving game since 1934.

<HEADLINE> Men's Tournament Ratings Are Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The men's tournament may not be keeping up with  
last year's pace, but the women are doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	While CBS' men's ratings are down 4 percent through the first  
two rounds, ESPN's coverage of the women's tournament is up on both 
of its channels. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN2 posted a .44 for the eight games broadcast during the  
initial two rounds, a 10 percent increase from a .40 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two games on ESPN have shown a 6 percent increase, from a  
.89 last season to a .92. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women's basketball is a continuing success story,'' said Len  
DeLuca, senior vice president of program development. ``It is 
gaining depth, which is driving competition, interest and 
ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with several blowouts, the men's tournament posted a 5.4  
overnight rating and a 12 share through the first two rounds of 
action -- down just 4 percent from last year's 5.6 overnight rating 
and a 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there were about a dozen games that were decided in  
the game's final moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a couple of uncompetitive windows, which can happen,''  
said Mike Aresco, CBS' vice president of programming. ``We can't 
control what happens on the court. We've had a lot of good games, 
but what we haven't had was games coming down to the wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> DeFrantz: Expulsions Sad but Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A powerful Repulican senator has  
warned the IOC that Congress will be forced to step in unless the 
Olympic panel takes strong reform measures this week to deal with 
its greatest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the senior Olympic official in the United States,  
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain said it was 
``critical that the IOC understand the gravity of this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of U.S. athletes in the Olympic Games  
represents a vested interest by American citizens in reestablishing 
the integrity of the Olympic ideal of fairness and excellence in 
competition,'' McCain wrote to International Olympic Committee vice 
president Anita DeFrantz. ``This expectation of integrity extends 
beyond the playing fields and into all aspects of the Olympic 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated  
Press, McCain noted that his committee has scheduled hearings April 
14 on the Olympic scandal; that the IOC has tax-execmpt status in 
the United States; and that sponsorships from U.S. corporations 
``represent a substanial majority of IOC revenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that  
the IOC will move quckly to adopt reforms necessary to provide 
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and 
processes,'' McCain wrote. ``Without such independent action, the 
demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn  
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	With the IOC set to vote Wednesday on the unprecedented  
expulsions of six members and start work on long-range reforms 
stemming from the bribery scandal n Salt Lake's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games, DeFrantz characterized McCain's letter as ``an 
expression of concern'' rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain understands, especially in the United States, the  
importance of sponsors to Olympic athletes,'' she said. ``I'm 
confident he knows athletes need financial support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said she hoped to be asked to testify at the hearings.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I think about is how to save the athletes who are  
training for 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and how to make sure there 
will be games for them,'' she said. ``If that means talking to 
members of Congress or members of the American public, that is what 
I will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, herself a former Olympic athlete, said the expulsions  
were a sad but necessary part of retaining the honor of the games. 
She said the six members who face final votes had violated their 
oaths and tarnished the Olympic rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be difficult,'' she said. ``It's sad. It's  
disappointing to me, the actions some IOC members have taken. ... I 
think all the reports are very clear. We take an oath of office 
that we are `accorded the honor' of serving the IOC. The reports 
show that their actions were without honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by 91 eligible members of the IOC on whether to uphold  
expulsions imposed by the leadership will be a first in the panel's 
105 years. DeFrantz said it would be a decision with ``long-term 
impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that and other actions by the IOC in the next two days  
would show federal officials the committee was serious about 
reforms, because ``the athletes demand it.''

<HEADLINE> Discount Retailer To Close Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Co. plans to seek  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the discount retailer of jewelry 
and home products announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors authorized the filing Monday  
night after five vendors filed a petition seeking court supervision 
of Service Merchandise's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	The vendors, including Samsonite and Remington, say Service  
Merchandise owes them more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy announcement comes five weeks after Service  
Merchandise said it would close 134 of its 347 stores. Last week, 
the company said it would also cut the work force at its 
headquarters in Brentwood, Tenn., and close its Dallas distribution 
center. The company has not said how many jobs would be affected by 
all the moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive officer Bettina M. Whyte, a corporate turnaround  
specialist recruited by Service Merchandise in January, said the 
company plans to use the Chapter 11 process to transform the 
company ``into a stronger, more focused and healthier chain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interim, we need the support of our vendors, employees  
and other stakeholders as we work with our secured and unsecured 
creditors'' under the court-supervised restructuring, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte said employees will be paid without interruption, as will  
vendors for all new product shipments. Stores will remain open and 
the company expects no change in policies regarding returns, 
exchanges, layaways, product protection plans and gift 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced that Citicorp is preparing a waiver  
to allow the company to continue to borrow under its revolving 
credit line. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Service Merchandise were not traded Tuesday on the New  
York Stock Exchange, On Monday, they closed at 43 3/4 cents.

<HEADLINE> WBC Chief Denounces Boxing Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The head of the World Boxing Council contends  
Lennox Lewis was ``unjustly robbed of a clear victory'' and is the 
deserving heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sulaiman also criticized one of his organization's judges  
at the bout, New York boxing authorities and the rival 
International Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox Lewis, regardless of the results, showed that he is the  
authentic heavyweight champion of the world,'' Sulaiman said 
Tuesday from his organization's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman said his group and the World Boxing Association  
originally agreed on judges from neutral countries for Saturday 
night's bout in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was supposed to unify the heavyweight titles. Lewis is  
the WBC champion; Holyfield is the WBA and IBF champ. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman said the WBC had ``strongly objected'' to the IBF's  
nomination of judge Eugenia Williams because she had little 
experience in title fights and, like Holyfield, is American. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he said, the WBC dropped its original Dutch judge  
and appointed Larry O'Connell of Britain, ``of unquestionable 
integrity and competence and a proven impartiality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to think that image of impartiality was  
unconsciously assumed by Mr. O'Connell, but he definitely exceeded 
it,'' Sulaiman said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell scored the fight 115-115, but he later said he was  
surprised by his own score because he thought Lewis had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had it 116-113 for Lewis,  
and Williams scored it 115-113 for Holyfield -- favoring him in the 
fifth round that almost all observers ruled for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman called the fifth round decision ``inexplicable,'' but  
quickly added: 
</P>
<P>
	``Our explanation is Miss Williams' lack of experience for a  
fight of this magnitude as well as excessive favoritism for a boxer 
of her own nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged a rematch and called for clearer rules, saying Saturday  
night's bout was hurt by ``little authority and little 
supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the WBC did not have a supervisor seated alongside those  
of the other two sanctioning bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We again lament this very unjust decision which without any  
doubt affects the image of boxing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lyons Resigns As Baptist President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of  
one of the nation's largest and most influential black 
denominations, sobbed and apologized as he resigned Tuesday, two 
weeks after being convicted of swindling more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so sorry about all of this,'' he said quietly at a  
news conference outside his Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church, 
where he told the board of the National Baptist Convention USA of 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm truly repentant about it. I hate that I hurt so many  
people,'' he said, his voice breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	He was surrounded by other ministers, who told him: ``You're not  
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate it,'' he said as he began sobbing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. E.V. Hill, who will run for president when the  
convention's next elections are held in September, patted Lyons on 
the back and told him: ``We are with you. We forgave any errors you 
have made. We love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah, then kissed him on the cheek and defense  
attorney Denis de Vlaming helped lead him back into the church 
where he has been pastor for the past 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, is awaiting sentencing March 31. He faces three to  
seven years in prison under state sentencing guidelines. He is also 
expected to plead guilty to similar federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. S.C. Cureton of Mauldin, S.C., the convention's vice  
president at-large, will take over immediately as president until 
the September election. The board voted to support Hill as their 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Grady Irvin, a member of Lyons' church and a  
friend of the minister, said the decision to resign was difficult 
for Lyons, who was elected to a five-year term as president of the 
Baptist group in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like losing something you really loved, like a marriage  
not working out. You dread it, and one day you finally say, `It's 
time to go on,''' Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ministers said the group is restructuring to prevent  
future church leaders from abusing the near-autonomy now vested in 
its president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will bring about a sense of healing to the  
convention and we'll be able to go on,'' said the Rev. Herman 
Powell, pastor of Early Grove Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted Feb. 27 of racketeering for swindling  
corporations seeking to do business with convention members. The 
defense had described the transactions as failed business deals, 
not crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lyons duped businesses by claiming the  
convention had 8.5 million members when the real number was closer 
to 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was convicted of stealing almost $250,000 the  
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith had donated to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' troubles began in July 1997 when his wife set fire to a  
$700,000 waterfront home he owned with another woman, Bernice 
Edwards, the convention's public relations director. She was a 
co-defendant at Lyons' trial but was acquitted. She still faces 
federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began investigating the minister's finances,  
eventually accusing him and Ms. Edwards, his alleged mistress, of 
stealing money to buy jewelry, the waterfront home, a time-share 
condominium and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	After being named interim president, Cureton thanked Lyons for  
his leadership and said he accepted the post ``with great 
humility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know our convention needs much healing,'' Cureton said.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Couple Challenging Amazon.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- Linda and Lyle Bowlin are mounting a  
modest challenge to bookselling giant Amazon.com -- and 
demonstrating, perhaps, the democratic power of the Internet -- from 
the comfort of their own home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a reason why anybody else out there can't open up  
a business on the Internet and be successful,'' says Bowlin, 
sitting in what used to be his dining room but now houses two 
computers and stacks of book orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Since November 1997, Bowlin, formerly a grocery produce manager  
and now a professor of small-business development at the University 
of Northern Iowa, has been selling books over the Internet, first 
as a hobby that involved only self-help books, now as a business 
that supplies best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin found he could buy from Amazon.com's same wholesalers for  
about the same price if he ordered at least five copies of the same 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	And with his 18-year-old daughter doing the accounting, his wife  
doing the shipping and Bowlin managing the Internet site, their low 
overhead meant they could sell for less than Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman cited  
Bowlin's business -- positively-you.com -- as an testament to the 
power of the Internet and evidence that some Internet stocks are 
overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't 20,000 people who can produce software like  
Microsoft, but there are 20,000 who can set up bookstores or 
vitamin stores or video stores,'' Bowlin says. ``That's where the 
stock market missed the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin says his startup costs were about $2,500.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales have grown from about $400 a month to $4,000 a day. Books  
lie in neat rows across the living room floor, boxes of padded 
mailing packages are stacked ceiling-high against a wall, and the 
coffee table doubles as a shipping table. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't my hobby, this is work,'' Mrs. Bowlin laments as  
she places books in mailing packages and slaps handwritten mailing 
labels on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it is difficult to say what Bowlin's success proves  
and what effect such businesses will have on big Internet stocks. 
But one analyst says it llustrates how the Internet allows almost 
anyone to compete with big, established businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're online, you are immediately a multinational  
company in the sense you have mulitnational reach,'' said Robert 
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. ``But it 
also means that established companies have to take competition from 
places they never dreamed of and companies that perhaps did not 
exist a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin's business volume is nowhere near Amazon.com's 1998 sales  
of $609 million and he admits that he alone will not compete 
head-to-head with the bookseller. But with an estimated $24 billion 
book market, there is plenty of room for others like himself, 
Bowlin says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 5,000 independent booksellers out there and  
with a little extra investment they can be incredibly successful,'' 
Bowlin says. ``En masse, they pose a real threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Hooks, a computer systems and science professor at Pace  
University in New York, says Internet stock is not overvalued 
because it represents the expected earnings of the Internet of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Hooks says, ``the buying public is not interested in  
transacting business with people they don't know. That's a large 
hurdle for mom-and-pop shops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin, who is also director of the Small Business Development  
Center at UNI, plans to hire people and move the business out of 
the house soon. He says he is weighing offers to go public that 
could quickly make him a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an entrepreneur,'' Bowlin says. ``There's nothing wrong  
with that.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Assail Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday assailed  
House legislation that would make it tougher for people to erase 
their debts in bankruptcy, reigniting a debate over the welfare of 
single mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton played a leading role in the debate last  
year, when the White House threatened to veto a House-passed 
bankruptcy overhaul bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. Mrs. Clinton, along with consumer groups and some 
Democrats, complained that the bill would make single mothers and 
children who are owed support from bankrupt fathers take a back 
seat to credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the new House bill would have ``a devastating impact  
on the thousands of women who turn to bankruptcy courts to collect 
alimony and child support from former husbands'' who have sought 
bankruptcy protection, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, testified 
Tuesday at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson Lee is chairwoman of a congressional caucus on  
children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., and other  
Democrats opposed to the bipartisan bill, as the commercial and 
administrative law subcommitee opened three days of hearings on the 
legislation backed by credit card companies and retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors, led by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., say it  
gives highest priority among debts to child support and alimony 
payments, putting them ahead of credit card debt and other 
obligations. But Democratic opponents maintain that the bill, by 
barring certain credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, 
would force single mothers to compete for payment with big credit 
card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, meanwhile, said the Clinton  
administration's position on bankruptcy legislation ``is a really 
big question mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said White House aides recently told him they want such  
legislation and are willing to negotiate, but they can't promise 
anything because Clinton might veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a very good negotiating position for them to be  
in,'' he told a group of corporate credit managers. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said recently that the  
administration, which supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws, 
needed to examine this year's legislation to determine whether it 
strikes a balance between the legitimate needs of debtors and 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, with Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and  
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, proposed Tuesday a new version of 
legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real reform should address a number of factors such as  
irresponsible (consumer spending), lax bankruptcy laws and 
lawyer-run bankruptcy mills,'' Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to pick up the tab for bankrupts who walk away  
from their debts,'' he said. ``Businesses have to raise prices on 
products and services to offset bankruptcy losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would allow federal bankruptcy  
judges to determine case by case a debtor's ability to repay. 
</P>
<P>
	But in addition, an IRS standard would be used to estimate  
living expenses and calculate whether the payback could be 25 
percent or more of the total debt within three years. In that case, 
the debtor could be forced into a Chapter 13 reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> Congress Considers Savings Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is looking at ways other than shoring  
up Social Security to improve the golden years for Americans, who 
typically get more than half their retirement incomes from other 
sources but are doing a poor job of saving money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Social Security and proposed government-sponsored  
accounts command the political spotlight, several bipartisan 
proposals are circulating that would increase limits on 
contributions to 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is growing support to remove obstacles to creation of  
workplace pension plans for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face a major retirement challenge in this country,'' said  
Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, co-sponsor of one major proposal. ``While 
we need Social Security reform, we need to go well beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and President Clinton have pledged to reserve 62  
percent of projected budget surpluses to keep Social Security 
solvent into the next century. But that program provides only about 
40 percent of a typical retiree's income. 
</P>
<P>
	Aging baby boomers, who figure to live longer than their  
forebears, have a low savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a generation, they have not saved adequately for their  
retirement,'' said Matthew Fink, president of the Investment 
Company Institute, which represents nearly 8,000 investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the amount of money Americans were saving as a  
percentage of their personal disposal income dipped into the 
negative range for the first time since 1933, according to the 
Commerce Department. Although the rate has since crept up, analysts 
estimate that about half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, half of all workers have no pension plan, and only  
20 percent of businesses with 25 or fewer employees offer one. 
</P>
<P>
	One popular answer has been the 401(k) plan, in which 25 million  
Americans -- often with an employer match -- have $1 trillion in 
tax-deferred contributions invested in mutual funds and elsewhere. 
And millions of people have IRAs, which also grow through 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	But limits on how much people can contribute hamper the growth  
of these retirement nest eggs, particularly for older Americans who 
need to save more money quickly and for women who missed years at 
work while at home raising children. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, there is a $2,000 annual limit on tax-deductible  
IRA contributions, $10,000 for a 401(k). 
</P>
<P>
	Several pieces of legislation introduced in Congress would raise  
these limits. The bill sponsored by Portman and Rep. Ben Cardin, 
D-Md., would boost the 401(k) limit to $15,000 and the IRA ceiling 
to $5,000, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measures propose ``catch-up'' provisions for  
older people and women, allowing them to contribute more. A bill 
sponsored by Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, 
R-Del., would allow people ages 50 and up to contribute $7,500 a 
year to an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills also would create a new Roth 401(k), similar to the  
popular Roth IRA in which contributions are made after taxes are 
paid but withdrawals for retirement are tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
	They also would make it easier for employers to offer pension  
plans by eliminating complexity in tax rules and Internal Revenue 
Service user fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Start-up and maintenance costs are the primary reason small  
employers do not offer their employees a pension plan,'' said Dan 
Danner, vice president of federal public policy at the National 
Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a cost to such efforts, but it is far less than the  
tens of billions of dollars needed to rescue Social Security. The 
Portman-Cardin bill, for example, would cost up to $7 billion over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the political side, sponsors argue that improving the private  
pension system complements the fix of Social Security. But even 
Republicans acknowledge that these changes won't necessarily help 
people of modest incomes, who often can't afford to contribute to 
an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everybody had one of these plans, you could'' focus on  
them, said Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla, a senior member of the 
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``But your lower-income 
people don't.''

<HEADLINE> Group: Gay Military Harassment Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Navy Lt. Cmdr. Jill Szymanski said she  
lived ``in constant fear of being found out.'' Ex-Marine Lance Cpl. 
David Raleigh said he was harassed from the time he entered basic 
training and his drill instructor asked, ``You're a fag, aren't 
you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh and Szymanski are examples of harassment of homosexuals  
in the military that more than doubled last year, a gay rights 
groups said Monday in criticizing the Pentagon's enforcement of the 
Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 5-year-old policy, the military is not supposed to  
investigate sexual orientation unless it has ``credible 
information'' about a person's homosexuality. Proof that someone is 
homosexual or professes to be gay is ground for automatic 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network counted 400 cases of  
anti-gay harassment in the military last year, including death 
threats, compared with 182 in 1997, a 120 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Members said the group found 511 incidents, including many of  
the 400 harassed, in which service members said they were asked 
about sexual orientation and their cases pursued by military 
investigators or commanders until they quit or were discharged. In 
1997, the legal defense network found 359 such instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I heard derogatory remarks about gay people or faced  
questions about why I was not dating someone of the opposite sex,'' 
said Szymanski, who resigned in August after 12 years. ``It has 
become an acceptable part of military culture to pick on and demean 
suspected gay service members, and no one is held accountable for 
these actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year 1,145 people were discharged from the armed forces for  
homosexuality, the Pentagon reported in January. In 1997, the total 
was 997, the highest number since 1987. The number hit a low of 617 
in 1994, the year the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the discharge figures, Pentagon officials said many  
were recruits intent on leaving the military anyway. But a Pentagon 
report last April concluded, ``The reasons for this increase are 
not known and would be difficult to ascertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the legal defense  
network, said the cases his group documented tell the story behind 
the discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The service members are forced between hiding under this  
blanket of fear and anxiety from harassment every day or coming out 
and being fired for who they are,'' Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osburn said he isn't arguing for a ``zero discharge'' policy,  
realizing neither the Congress, the administration nor the Supreme 
Court is going to reverse the law soon. Instead, his group is 
advocating that commanders enforce rules designed to protect the 
privacy of service members and limit investigations into their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, facing criticism for alleged overzealous pursuit  
of gay men and women, issued guidelines in March 1997 for 
implementing the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigators should not solicit allegations concerning the  
sexual orientation or homosexual conduct of the threatened 
person,'' said the guidelines, written by Undersecretary of Defense 
Edwin Dorn. He wrote that service members who are harassed should 
be able to report that without fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh, who quit the Marine Corps after two years, said he was  
afraid that reporting the insults and threats he endured would end 
his career, but he finally decided it was unsafe to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, I knew I couldn't trust these Marines in combat  
for fear that I would be the first casualty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Jeff Bagwell Adjusts Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell saw it coming. Slow starts  
and long slumps made it obvious. If he was going to remain one of 
baseball's best hitters, he was going to have to ditch the hitch in 
his swing. 
</P>
<P>
	For as long as he can remember, Bagwell has stood at the plate  
with his hands below his waist, then pumped them down and up into 
the hitting position in time to whack balls all over the field. He 
knew it wasn't the best way to hit, but it was hard to argue with 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five seasons, the Houston Astros first baseman has  
batted .310 with an average of 34 home runs and 114 RBIs. He hit 
.304 with 34 homers and 111 RBIs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bagwell began last year by hitting .237 in April and .234 in  
May. It was the third time in four years that he had consecutive 
months of hitting below .240 and it made him realize it was time 
for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	Although all hitters go through down periods, Bagwell's last  
longer than most because of the intricate timing his swing 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year brought the realization that it's very hard to hit  
like I hit,'' said Bagwell, the unanimous pick for NL MVP in 1994. 
``My goal is consistency. I don't want to have months where I hit 
.240, then all of a sudden hit .320, then .320 again, then .240, 
then .400. That's too tough on me mentally. So I needed to do 
something to make myself a better hitter and this is what I came up 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell still crouches and twirls the bat a bit, but he no  
longer rocks backwards and bounces his arms before sweeping the bat 
across the plate. He starts with his hands already in the hitting 
position, eliminating some needless motion. That makes up for 
whatever time he's losing with age, and it gives him another 
fraction of a second before deciding whether to swing, something 
hitters are always seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this spring, it seems to be working. Bagwell had six hits  
in his first 13 at-bats, including two homers. If he keeps it up, 
he may have to end his tradition of labeling himself the team's 
worst player of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's on hold a little right now,'' Bagwell said, laughing.  
``But don't count me out yet. It's still early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things aren't likely to change considering how hard Bagwell is  
working. He had teammate Craig Biggio videotaped the new swing so 
he can study what he's doing. Bagwell also has been taking lots of 
extra batting practice and he's constantly hitting soft tosses into 
a net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never taken soft toss in my life and now I've taken so  
much it's not even funny,'' he said. ``But I need that muscle 
memory. That's what I'm hoping for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros hitting coach Tom McCraw said Bagwell first mentioned the  
change last season after noticing ``that some pitches he used to 
hit out of the ballpark he wasn't getting to as often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He realized that he was going to have to make that adjustment  
anyway, so he might as well make it now,'' McCraw said. ``It's a 
wise and intelligent move. It may not be something he wants to do, 
but it's something Mother Nature makes you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell, 30, probably picked up the habit while growing up  
outside Boston idolizing Carl Yastrzemski. Yaz also had a 
pronounced hitch in his swing, but he toyed with his mechanics 
enough to play into his 40s and reach the Hall of Fame. Bagwell's 
proactive tinkering could have the same results. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incentive for Bagwell, who came up through the Red Sox  
organization, is that the All-Star Game is in Boston. He made the 
NL squad in '94, '96 and '97, but missed in '95 and '98 because of 
slow starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give him a lot of credit for doing this,'' Astros manager  
Larry Dierker said. ``To decide after a good year that you're going 
to have a better year is not easy to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell enters his ninth season, all in Houston, with 221 career  
homers and 835 career RBIs. He needs three homers and 108 RBIs to 
become the Astros' leader in each category. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell said those titles would be nice, but he's far more  
interested in helping the team win the NL Central for a third 
straight year and hopefully get past the first round. An improved 
Bagwell is a good start, but it might not be enough to compensate 
for the loss of Moises Alou, who is likely out all year with a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all obviously have to step it up a little, but the reason  
I'm doing this is for my sanity,'' said Bagwell, a perfectionist 
who is his toughest critic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure a lot of people would love to have the problems I  
have, but that's not good enough for me. I'm always trying to get 
better.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Star Pitcher Wood Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood is expected to miss this season  
because of an elbow injury, leaving the Chicago Cubs without the 
pitcher who dazzled baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, who last May struck out 20 batters  
against Houston, damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his right 
elbow during his spring training debut against Anaheim on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a huge loss, no doubt about it,'' teammate Mark Grace  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs said more tests were needed on the 21-year-old  
right-hander to determine the extent of the injury. However, they 
assume he will need surgery and will not be able to pitch until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was in Chicago for an MRI exam and those results were not  
expected until later today. But even before the MRI, the Cubs 
suspected the injury was season ending, sending a shudder through 
their clubhouse on a cold, rainy morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for him,'' reliever Rod Beck said. ``I think as a  
pitcher every one of us has laid in bed with an ache and a pain 
thinking it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood became one of baseball's top attractions last season and  
helped the Cubs win the NL wild-card spot. He missed all of 
September because of a sore elbow, but returned to pitch five 
innings in Game 3 of the playoffs against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Sammy on the field -- put a glass case around him,''  
Beck said of star home run hitter Sammy Sosa, the Cubs' leading 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's status has shaken a team trying to win its first pennant  
since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' said Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman, referring to Andres Galarraga and Moises 
Alou, both out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some ups and downs from the time he signed that most  
young pitchers have gone through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was hospitalized twice at the start of spring training for  
an upper respiratory and intestinal illness, then threw just 10 of 
26 pitches for strikes Saturday against Anaheim. He wound up with 
elbow pain again that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had hoped the pain was from scar tissue, not ligament  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has less than a year of major league service,  
Cubs players already look to Wood as a leader. Grace compared him 
to Curt Schilling, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, calling him 
``almost irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is one of those guys that can win even when he doesn't  
have his good stuff because of his reputation,'' Grace said. 
``Selfishly, he's so much fun to play behind, watching those 
overpowering fastballs and those bowel-locking curves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Terry Mulholland and Jon Lieber  
are the other four starters in the Cubs' rotation. Scott Sanders or 
Kurt Miller will most likely move into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity for a guy like Scott Sanders or Terry  
Mulholland to step up,'' Grace said.

<HEADLINE> Delaware Lawyer Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano, a politically connected  
lawyer convicted of murdering his mistress and dumping her body at 
sea, was sentenced to death Tuesday by a judge who branded him ``a 
malignant force'' who will be a menace even behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano was found guilty of killing Anne Marie Fahey, Gov. Thomas  
Carper's secretary, after she tried to break off their secret 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Swain Lee could have sentenced Capano to lethal  
injection, as the jury recommended, or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a ruthless murderer who feels compassion for no one and  
remorse only for the circumstances in which he finds himself,'' Lee 
said. ``He is a malignant force from whom no one he deems disloyal 
or adversarial can be secure, even if he is incarcerated for the 
rest of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had argued that Capano might try to take revenge on  
those who testified against him. He has been charged with trying to 
arrange from prison the murders of his brother and a mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano showed no emotion and mouthed, ``It will be all right''  
to his mother and brother as he was led from the packed courtroom 
and back to jail. The former prosecutor and gubernatorial adviser 
becomes the 18th person on death row in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, was convicted in January after a three-month trial  
that exposed lurid details about some of Delaware's most prominent 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never showed remorse,'' said Erin Reilly, a juror who  
attended the sentencing. ``That was the biggest thing. He never 
said he was sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of a wealthy and influential Wilmington family of  
developers, Capano admitted dumping Ms. Fahey's body in an ice 
chest off the New Jersey coast but said that another mistress, 
Deborah MacIntyre, had accidentally shot Ms. Fahey in a jealous 
rage. He said he got rid of the body to protect himself and Ms. 
MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied any connection to Ms. Fahey's death and  
testified that Capano had her buy him a gun a month before Ms. 
Fahey's disappearance in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano was convicted even though prosecutors had no body and no  
murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until the time of his trial, Capano maintained he had nothing  
to do with Ms. Fahey's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, except the defendant, will ever know exactly how or  
why Anne Marie Fahey died,'' the judge said. ``It was not a crime 
of passion, but rather, a crime of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey's family -- which has filed a wrongful death suit  
against Capano -- did not take a position on whether he should be 
executed. But Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, said: ``The 
judge summed up in 12 minutes what we've been feeling for two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano attorney Joseph Oteri said he will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Vehicles on Tracks a Train Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investigation of the deadly Amtrak crash  
in Bourbannais, Ill., has just begun, but Amtrak officials and 
engineers have long complained about vehicles being where they 
shouldn't be: on railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency crews arriving at the scene of Monday night's  
collision involving a New Orleans-bound passenger train and a 
steel-hauling truck found the rail crossing lights working, but 
they were checking to determine if they were on at the time of the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 245 Amtrak trains were involved in accidents reportable  
to the Federal Railroad Administration, according to Amtrak 
statistics. They caused 1,020 crew injuries and 266 passenger 
injuries, most of which were minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the reportable accidents, 183, or 74 percent, were  
attributable to motor vehicle operator inattention or impatience. 
Some 114 of those accidents occurred at crossings with active 
warning devices, such as gates, flashing lights and bells. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, 50 highway users died in collisions with Amtrak  
trains at highway-rail intersections. Amtrak trains struck and 
killed another 69 people who were deemed to be trespassing on 
Amtrak rail line. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide, collisions at grade crossings killed or seriously  
injured about 2,100 people in 1996, according to Federal Railroad 
Administration statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its heft, an eight-car passenger train traveling at  
79 mph -- a standard Amtrak speed -- takes over 6,000 feet to stop. 
The train involved in Tuesday night's collision was 16 cars in 
length, or twice as big, and was authorized to travel at 79 mph in 
Bourbannais, according to Amtrak officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A 150-car freight train traveling at a routine 50 mph needs  
8,000 feet to stop, or about 1.5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Amtrak unveiled its new high-speed service that will  
start serving the Northeast Corridor by November or December. 
Equipped with technology that allows them to tilt through turns, 
the new ``Acela'' trains race between Washington, New York and 
Boston at top speeds of 150 mph, trimming travel times to 2 1/2 to 
three hours per leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The route that will be used has no grade crossings south of New  
Haven, Conn., according to Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington. There 
will be one crossing in Massachusetts, one in Rhode Island that 
will be used only by emergency vehicles and 11 in eastern 
Connecticut that Amtrak is working to make safe for high-speed 
trains, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the gala unveiling, Amtrak officials stressed the safety of  
the trains, saying they exceeded the standards of high-speed trains 
currently in use in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very safe train,'' said Amtrak President  
George Warrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak annually serves about 21 million passengers. The national  
railroad has 23,000 employees.

<HEADLINE>  One Judge Stands by Holyfield Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The woman at the heart of boxing's  
latest scandal has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams, a veteran judge whose scoring of the Evander  
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight championship helped Holyfield 
gain a draw, said Monday she called it like she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	But many observers wondered what she was looking at.  
</P>
<P>
	The draw, which was announced after a fight dominated by Lewis,  
has triggered cries of ``fix'' and calls for an investigation into 
the judging process. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you're honest, they can say what they want to  
say,'' Williams said Monday. ``I'm not the first that disagreed 
with someone else. I guess I won't be the last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far from the glare of Madison Square Garden's ringside klieg  
lights, Williams returned to her day job Monday -- answering 
telephones at a cramped office in City Hall, where she works as a 
$39,200-a-year accounts clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	She had no apologies. No, she wasn't told to favor Holyfield.  
No, she wasn't biased. No, she isn't incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are entitled to their own opinion. I called what I saw.  
I have no problems with that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lifelong boxing fan, Williams trained to be a boxer as a  
teen-ager when she was growing up here. She quit because there were 
no opportunities for women fighters, turning to karate instead. She 
raised two children as a single mother and worked the day job in 
the city's landlord-tenant relations office. 
</P>
<P>
	Active with amateur boxing programs at the Police Athletic  
League, she began judging amateur fights in 1983, then moved up to 
the pro ranks in 1989. Since then, she has judged more than 90 
fights, including 27 world title bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who won't give her age, has attended clinics and  
seminars put on by the sport's sanctioning bodies at least once a 
year throughout her tenure as a professional judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked with her many times, and I've never had a problem  
with her,'' said veteran judge Eva Shain of Fort Lee. ``I can't 
answer for what happened the other night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee, president and commissioner of the IBF, which appointed  
her to the $1,600 one-night gig, called Williams a top-flight 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has impeccable credentials,'' Lee said Monday. ``She  
attends the seminars and she takes an active part in them. I don't 
question her decision. She is a good professional. When I appoint 
her, I expect her to record what she sees. If she says that's what 
she saw, then I support her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Williams apparently didn't see clearly was the fifth round,  
when Lewis battered Holyfield mercilessly, landing 43 punches to 
Holyfield's 11. 
</P>
<P>
	She awarded that round for Holyfield, shocking most observers.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams scored the fight 115-113 for Holyfield. WBA judge  
Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had it 116-113 for Lewis and 
WBC judge Larry O'Connell of Britain scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's jumping on poor Jean for the way she scored, but if  
you look at the British official, he scored two rounds even, and if 
he hadn't scored the last round for Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield 
would have won the fight,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why did Lee join with the heads of the WBA and WBC in  
immediately ordering a rematch? 
</P>
<P>
	``The major concern we had was that we didn't get a unified  
title holder, which is what we wanted,'' Lee said. Asked if he 
thought Lewis won the fight, he said: ``I really didn't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell, however, has been having second thoughts. Subjected  
to heavy criticism upon his return to London, he said he may have 
made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judged on the weight of opinion, I would say I was wrong,''  
O'Connell told the London Evening Standard. ``But I did what I 
thought was right at the time. I can't be any more honest than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King, who had the most to lose in a Holyfield loss,  
denied the fix allegation. ``Absolutely not. Why would it even be 
considered that I fixed the fight?'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki called for an investigation. Boxing  
observers, meanwhile, called Williams names. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is either biased, incompetent, or worse,'' said HBO's Lou  
DiBella.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Device To Remove Blood Clots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With thousands of Americans undergoing  
angioplasty every year to increase the blood flow to their hearts, 
the government has approved a new alternative for those who need to 
have blood clots removed first. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has  
approved use of a medical device called AngioJet to remove those 
clots. 
</P>
<P>
	AngioJet has been in use since late 1996 to help remove clots  
from grafts in people undergoing dialysis. It is expected to be 
especially helpful to heart patients who cannot use the so-called 
clot-busting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Angioplasty is a widely used method for treating heart arteries  
that have narrowed. As many as a half-million of the procedures are 
done annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In an angioplasty, a tiny balloon is threaded into the blocked  
artery, inflated to widen the blood vessel, then deflated and 
removed. Usually the widening remains and blood flow is increased. 
Sometimes a device called a stent is placed in the artery to help 
it stay widened. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes blood clots form in the narrowed areas and these  
can lead to heart attack or death. Currently these clots are 
treated with clot-removing drugs. However, some people cannot take 
the drugs, particularly those with a predisposition to bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said it gave the AngioJet System expedited review and  
approved it less than six months after receipt of a marketing 
application from the manufacturer, Possis Medical of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Kravik, principal design engineer at Possis, said AngioJet  
is faster and can be targeted at a specific area, unlike drugs that 
move throughout the patient's system. 
</P>
<P>
	AngioJet is a coronary catheter containing a steel and a plastic  
tube. The end of the metal tube is bent into a halo shape and 
shoots a jet of saline solution back into the tip of the plastic 
one, creating a vacuum that pulls along any blood clots. Treatment 
with this device takes about one minute, FDA said. Once the blood 
clot is removed, the patient can undergo angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA said the manufacturer studied 731 people with symptoms of  
heart artery blockage at 41 medical centers in the United States 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In one study, 180 were treated with AngioJet and 169 with  
urokinase, a clot-busting drug. The study showed the two had 
similar effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study, 105 patients who could not be treated with  
clot-busting drugs were treated with AngioJet. The study showed the 
device to be equally effective in these patients, FDA said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Co-Owner DeBartolo Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The 49ers lost co-owner Eddie DeBartolo for at  
least another year and San Francisco's hold on the 2003 Super Bowl 
also appears to be slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who withdrew from active ownership of the team  
because of legal problems, was fined $1 million and his banishment 
was extended through the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Tuesday cited conduct detrimental  
to the NFL in imposing the sanctions on DeBartolo, who pledged to 
abide by the league's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's action leaves the 49ers under the control of  
DeBartolo's sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and her husband, John 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said DeBartolo could be reinstated a year from now but  
also could be fined an additional $4 million fine if he violates 
terms of his agreement with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's a friend of mine,'' Denver Broncos owner Patrick  
Bowlen said. ``I'm sorry for his difficulties. I look forward to 
having him back as an owner in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with plans for the 49ers' new stadium stalled, the  
NFL appeared ready to take the 2003 Super Bowl away from San 
Francisco. Tagliabue said the issue would be taken up later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision hasn't been made, but sources attending the NFL  
owners meetings said Tuesday the lack of progress toward building a 
replacement for aging 3Com Park forced the league to look elsewhere 
to stage the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said San Francisco's hold on the game was tenuous.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to play a Super Bowl there but we're not going to do  
it until we get a new stadium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego and Phoenix were among the cities mentioned as an  
alternate host for the league's marquee event should the NFL yank 
the game out of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's right to be host of the Super Bowl was  
contingent on construction of the stadium. Soaring cost estimates 
and months of tumult within the 49ers' inner circle left the 
project in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	York, a senior vice president of the family-run Edward J.  
DeBartolo Corp., who also has joined the 49ers' front office, said 
the team still hopes to build a stadium. But he conceded the 
project might not get on track in time to rescue the Super Bowl for 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told if we pick it up we can still get ready, but  
you've got to recognize that this is going to be one of the more 
expensive, if not the most expensive, stadiums built,'' York said. 
``It is more important to make the right decisions and do the right 
thing for both the 49ers and the city than it is to start tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the important thing is we're committed to a stadium,  
but I can't put a timetable on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the second time the NFL took the Super Bowl away  
from San Francisco. The city was supposed to have the 1999 
championship, but approval by league owners was contingent upon an 
estimated $26 million in renovations to 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pumping the money into upgrades, however, the 49ers  
pushed for a new stadium, and in June 1997 voters approved a $525 
million measure for a new stadium and shopping mall next to 3Com 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With the imposition of formal sanctions, DeBartolo was further  
isolated from the team he ran for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew as active owner in December 1997 after becoming  
entangled in a Louisiana gambling fraud case, and his attempts to 
regain control of the team have been rebuffed amid a growing rift 
with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	York said the two siblings at one time were close to an  
agreement that would have returned control of the team to 
DeBartolo, but that deal now appears dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Denise has the reins and she's committed to keeping  
the team and running it,'' York said. ``For the good of both 
parties, both Eddie and Denise need to have a resolution, because 
their business interests are different and they go along different 
paths. So it's going to be best for the two of them to be 
separated, business-wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony and was fined $2 million and placed on probation. BeBartolo 
also agreed to testify against his friend and former Louisiania 
Gov. Edwin Edwards and others charged in an alleged 
influence-peddling scheme involving the awarding of a riverboat 
gambling license.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Seeking Early Season Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes aren't back to playing like  
their ancestors by any means. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Winnipeg Jets had a 30-game winless streak during the  
1980-81 season. This season, just two more wins in the last 15 
games will give the Coyotes 34 victories -- more than in all but 
seven of the team's 19 previous campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phoenix has been living off its fast start for months and  
has no cushion left. With the playoffs a month away, the players 
are trying to re-establish the punishing, unselfish style that got 
the club off to the best start in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have five important players out of the lineup, and we  
have to do it to give ourselves a chance to win until we can get 
some help here,'' general manager Bobby Smith said. ``We have to 
play with desperation and passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix was 14-2-2 after going undefeated in November -- the  
fifth time an NHL team has gone a calendar month without a loss. In 
the last 17 games of that burst, the Coyotes held the opposition to 
two goals or fewer, the third-longest such streak in hockey's 
modern era. 
</P>
<P>
	They are 18-22-9 since then, and had lost 11 of 13 games until  
they beat Anaheim 1-0 Saturday and tied Carolina 5-5 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking steps in the right direction,'' center Jeremy  
Roenick said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the first win of the season over the Mighty Ducks was a  
tonic, the Carolina game was a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes made progress offensively after scoring 20 goals in  
the 14 previous games of the slump. But they also allowed the 
Hurricanes back in it after grabbing a 5-2 lead in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to learn how to win those games, especially when you  
look to the playoffs,'' said captain Keith Tkachuk. ``You've got to 
put teams away and not give them a sniff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith would like to make a move before the March 23 trading  
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spoken with the players,'' he said. ``I spend a lot of  
time every day with our coaching staff, and from a general 
manager's position there's plenty that I've tried to do. That does 
not preclude making an important trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is where the Coyotes need the most help.  
</P>
<P>
	It was on the blue line a few days ago because defensemen Gerald  
Diduck, Jyrki Lumme and J.J. Daigneault were out. 
</P>
<P>
	But all three were expected back before the playoffs, Smith  
acquired Jamie Huscroft from Vancouver last week and Phoenix's need 
for balanced scoring won't go away: Tkachuk (28), Rick Tocchet (22) 
and Roenick (21) have scored 43 percent of the team's 165 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	With right wings Dallas Drake and Shane Doan sitting out most of  
the last game with new injuries, Smith is was seeking to find a 
scorer on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one move -- firing coach Jim Schoenfeld -- is out of the  
question, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our best opportunity to have a successful season,'' Smith  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern coach offered his view on the cries for his scalp.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of rats who want to jump off the ship, but  
none of them wear Coyotes uniforms,'' Schoenfeld said.

<HEADLINE> San Fran Won't Get 2003 Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NFL will not hold the 2003 Super Bowl in San  
Francisco because of concerns the 49ers' new stadium won't be 
ready, a league source said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No formal decision has been made on taking the game from the  
city, said Jim Speeg, vice president of special events for the NFL. 
But the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an 
announcement would be made soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the stadium isn't going to be ready in time,  
and it's clear that the league was going to move it anyway,'' one 
unidentified source told the San Francisco Chronicle. ``The only 
question was, on whose terms was the plug going to be pulled?'' 
</P>
<P>
	49ers vice president John York admitted it would be ``tough'' to  
get approval but he hadn't given up. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Mercury News reported today that the NFL also  
rejected Oakland's offer to hold the game and probably will play it 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle reported that the league was asking a handful of  
cities, including San Diego, Oakland and Phoenix, to make bids, 
with the final pick to be announced in May. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the second time the NFL took the Super Bowl away  
from San Francisco. The city was supposed to have had the 1999 
championship, but approval by league owners was contingent upon an 
estimated $26 million in renovations to 3Com Park.

<P>
	Instead of putting money into upgrades, the 49ers pushed for a  
new stadium, and in June 1997 voters approved a $525 million 
measure for a new stadium and mall next to 3Com Park.

contingent upon there being a new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Announces Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes sees the Internet as the  
natural place to announce that he's running for president in 2000 -- 
and a great place to campaign too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in business as usual, and I don't believe in  
politics as usual,'' he said in an Internet address today that, 
along with a more traditional tour of New Hampshire, kicks off his 
second run for the GOP nomination. ``This is going to be a new, 
information-age campaign about great ideas and enduring values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said in a telephone interview his Internet site ``will  
set a new standard, a new level, for high technology and politics. 
We see the 'net as a way to bring politics and power back to the 
people in a way that was not possible in the era of mass media -- 
i.e. radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think others will be scrambling to catch us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes promised ``a major announcement'' today during an  
afternoon State house news conference on the first of two days in 
the state with the earliest primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to announce the beginning of my campaign for  
president of the United States of America,'' Forbes said in his 
Internet address. ``Today marks the beginning of a national crusade 
to restore Ronald Reagan's vision of hope and prosperity for all 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and I are entering the information age, and Washington  
politicians are stuck in the Stone Age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He outlined his agenda to abolish the tax code, protect Social  
Security and curb abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2000 campaigns have Internet sites, with Forbes and  
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio competing to see who can be the most 
creative. Forbes' advisers say he is the first to use the Internet 
for the main announcement of his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a millionaire publisher who has never held elective  
office, ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination in 1996, but 
since then he has courted conservative leaders who were skeptical 
of him in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	According to 1998 election exit polls conducted by Voter News  
Service, four out of 10 voters described themselves as regular 
Internet users. Thirty-eight percent of Republicans described 
themselves as Internet regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' site will include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Campaign ``reporters'' who will submit information directly to  
the site. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A digital camera to file photos directly from the road.  
</P>
<P>
	-- A volunteer section to organize and motivate grass-roots  
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a major vacuum in the public square,'' Forbes told the  
AP. ``By pushing hard our principles and policies, I think we're 
going to enormously impact the political landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is in the middle of the pack in most public opinion  
polls, well behind the current GOP favorite, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. But his wealth gives him a huge cash advantage over the rest 
of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' attack ads during the 1996 primaries nearly sank the  
candidacy of Bob Dole, who eventually won the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past four years, Forbes has courted conservative leaders  
who were skeptical of him in 1996. His staff is loaded with 
veterans from conservative campaigns of the past, including media 
strategists Greg Mueller, Keith Appell and Craig Shirley and press 
aides Juleanna Glover, K.B. Forbes and Sean McCabe.

<HEADLINE>  One Judge Stands by Holyfield Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The woman at the heart of boxing's  
latest scandal has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams, a veteran judge whose scoring of the Evander  
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight championship helped Holyfield 
gain a draw, said Monday she called it like she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	But many observers wondered what she was looking at.  
</P>
<P>
	The draw, which was announced after a fight dominated by Lewis,  
has triggered cries of ``fix'' and calls for an investigation into 
the judging process. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you're honest, they can say what they want to  
say,'' Williams said Monday. ``I'm not the first that disagreed 
with someone else. I guess I won't be the last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far from the glare of Madison Square Garden's ringside klieg  
lights, Williams returned to her day job Monday -- answering 
telephones at a cramped office in City Hall, where she works as a 
$39,200-a-year accounts clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	She had no apologies. No, she wasn't told to favor Holyfield.  
No, she wasn't biased. No, she isn't incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are entitled to their own opinion. I called what I saw.  
I have no problems with that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lifelong boxing fan, Williams trained to be a boxer as a  
teen-ager when she was growing up here. She quit because there were 
no opportunities for women fighters, turning to karate instead. She 
raised two children as a single mother and worked the day job in 
the city's landlord-tenant relations office. 
</P>
<P>
	Active with amateur boxing programs at the Police Athletic  
League, she began judging amateur fights in 1983, then moved up to 
the pro ranks in 1989. Since then, she has judged more than 90 
fights, including 27 world title bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who won't give her age, has attended clinics and  
seminars put on by the sport's sanctioning bodies at least once a 
year throughout her tenure as a professional judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked with her many times, and I've never had a problem  
with her,'' said veteran judge Eva Shain of Fort Lee. ``I can't 
answer for what happened the other night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee, president and commissioner of the IBF, which appointed  
her to the $1,600 one-night gig, called Williams a top-flight 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has impeccable credentials,'' Lee said Monday. ``She  
attends the seminars and she takes an active part in them. I don't 
question her decision. She is a good professional. When I appoint 
her, I expect her to record what she sees. If she says that's what 
she saw, then I support her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Williams apparently didn't see clearly was the fifth round,  
when Lewis battered Holyfield mercilessly, landing 43 punches to 
Holyfield's 11. 
</P>
<P>
	She awarded that round for Holyfield, shocking most observers.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams scored the fight 115-113 for Holyfield. WBA judge  
Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had it 116-113 for Lewis and 
WBC judge Larry O'Connell of Britain scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's jumping on poor Jean for the way she scored, but if  
you look at the British official, he scored two rounds even, and if 
he hadn't scored the last round for Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield 
would have won the fight,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why did Lee join with the heads of the WBA and WBC in  
immediately ordering a rematch? 
</P>
<P>
	``The major concern we had was that we didn't get a unified  
title holder, which is what we wanted,'' Lee said. Asked if he 
thought Lewis won the fight, he said: ``I really didn't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell, however, has been having second thoughts. Subjected  
to heavy criticism upon his return to London, he said he may have 
made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judged on the weight of opinion, I would say I was wrong,''  
O'Connell told the London Evening Standard. ``But I did what I 
thought was right at the time. I can't be any more honest than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King, who had the most to lose in a Holyfield loss,  
denied the fix allegation. ``Absolutely not. Why would it even be 
considered that I fixed the fight?'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki called for an investigation. Boxing  
observers, meanwhile, called Williams names. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is either biased, incompetent, or worse,'' said HBO's Lou  
DiBella.

<HEADLINE> Government Breaks Up Visa Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal prosecutors said Tuesday they have  
broken up a ring of forgers who helped Iranians and others win 
visas and asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said the group allegedly  
provided new identities to clients, some of whom included members 
of the Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian opposition group based in Iraq. 
The group is one of 30 designated as terrorist organizations by the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged ringleader, Bahram Tabatabai, is one of 29 people  
who have been arrested in the case. None have been charged with 
involvement in terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabatabai allegedly represented more than 300 people during  
asylum interviews before the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. Authorities would not say how many successfully gained 
entry into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. Zebley, an agent for the State Department's Bureau of  
Diplomatic Security, said Tabatabai pretended to be a Farsi 
translator at the hearings, enabling him to change answers given by 
clients to the INS officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebley said Tabatabai used a network of fake document suppliers.  
The sources allegedly provided documents including birth 
certificates, titles for automobiles, houses, land and businesses, 
letters from guarantors, passports, employment records, bank 
records and university diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Tabatabai created new identities for clients who  
had criminal records or ties to subversive organizations, agents 
said. When asylum was requested, they allegedly invented stories of 
political oppression in their homeland, usually Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients, the majority of them Iranians, allegedly were charged a  
minimum of $2,000 for Tabatabai's services. Those who got visas had 
to pay between $8,000 and $12,000, Zebley said.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Costa Rican court has cleared the  
only suspect in the killing of a 78-year-old American rancher, a 
case that has caused friction between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Court spokeswoman Sandra Castro said Tuesday that the criminal  
court in the southern town of Golfito had found Gerardo Mora 
Aguilar not guilty of slaying Max Dalton. The court ruling was 
issued March 9, but was not publicized until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton's family has campaigned for a conviction in the case, and  
some members of the U.S. Senate and Congress have urged Costa Rica 
to take stronger action. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Embassy officials Tuesday said they had no comment on the  
ruling because they had not receive official notification. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton was shot to death Nov. 13, 1997, during an apparent  
dispute with squatters who had occupied part of his ranch in the 
southern province of Pavones. Dalton also killed a squatter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton had frequently asked local authorities to remove the  
squatters from his land, but Costa Rican law permits lengthy legal 
proceedings before squatters can be evicted -- and often even allows 
squatters to claim the land.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman,  
in Brazil to drum up more business for her state, on Tuesday said 
she wanted to expand and strengthen New Jersey's ``vital'' 
partnership with Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to expanding trade and multiplying investment  
opportunities in Brazil,'' Whitman told the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, who arrived Sunday leading a delegation of 130 state  
and business officials, said she was confident that Brazil's 
current economic slowdown was a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said her trip was also aimed at strengthening trade ties  
with Mercosur, the trade bloc composed of Brazil, Argentina, 
Uruguay and Paraguay. Mercosur imports more than $1 billion worth 
of products from New Jersey and is responsible for nearly 14,000 
jobs in the state, she added.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A former guerrilla leader  
defeated in recent presidential elections has resigned as head of 
El Salvador's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the 
country's second-largest party. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation of Facundo Guardado appears to deepen a crisis  
within the Front, which became a political party after signing a 
1992 treaty with the government ending a 12-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Front appeared to be neck-and-neck with the governing  
Republican Nationalist Alliance during local elections two years 
ago. But in presidential elections on March 7, Guardado received 
only 29 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardado had been the Front's coordinator-general since December  
1997 and has tried to move the party away from socialism toward 
social democracy.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- A man was killed and  
four police officers injured in clashes during general strikes in 
northern Salcedo in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said college student Vladimir Frias, 20, was shot in the  
head Monday and died minutes later at a hospital. It was unclear 
who fired the shot, but local media reported riot police and 
protesters were exchanging gunfire in the town's center. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officer Cristian Suero was also shot in the head and was  
hospitalized in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters were demanding a reduction in the price of  
gasoline, the construction of new water lines and the repair of 
streets. 
</P>

	In the last year, the Dominican Republic has been wracked by  
violent strikes and protests to demand more government services.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- President Carlos Flores Facusse  
ordered thousands of troops to help police patrol the streets 
Tuesday to stop a crime wave in the Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The action come a day after Honduras' main business organization  
demanded action against crime, complaining that kidnappings and 
robberies were rampant and were damaging the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas Rodriguez said about 12,000  
members of the army, air force and navy were joining 8,000 police 
on the streets of Honduras' main cities on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has sent troops into the streets against crime  
five times since 1994, usually for brief periods. The last time was 
in August.

<HEADLINE> Sunbeam Balks at Dunlap's Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Sunbeam Corp. says former chairman Al  
Dunlap should be ``ashamed'' for trying to collect $5.5 million he 
claims the appliance maker owes him in unpaid salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The brash corporate cost-cutter filed an arbitration claim  
against the Delray Beach company Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap claims Sunbeam is obligated to fulfill his contract  
because he turned around ``an enormously unsuccessful, bloated 
company,'' said his attorney Donald Zakarin. 
</P>
<P>
	Zakarin called Sunbeam's response to the arbitration claim  
``outrageous and stupid and moronic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap had 18 months remaining on his contract in February 1998  
when Sunbeam asked him to extend the deal, Zakarin said. The new 
contract only allowed him to be fired without pay if he is 
convicted of a felony or for ``willful failure'' to perform his job 
by taking actions that were ``not in good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap was fired in June after the company failed to generate a  
profit in the first six months of the year. The former chief 
executive officer, Russel Kersh, was fired three days later and is 
seeking $2 million, Zakarin said. The lawyer represents both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunbeam refused to comment beyond a written statement.  
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the damage that occurred during their stewardship  
-- damage to this company, its employees, its investors and the 
communities in which we operate -- we are outraged they are seeking 
even more money from Sunbeam,'' the statement said. ``The Sunbeam 
board has made it clear that it has no intention of paying any more 
money to ... Dunlap and Kersh. The company will vigorously defend 
the action they have filed.''

<HEADLINE> Bears Don't Scare Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Though he suspects the end may be coming soon  
for the great bull market on Wall Street, Charles Royce and his 
Royce family of mutual funds aren't bailing out of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	They are sticking around in anticipation of what Royce believes  
will be a revival, once the dust has settled, of his specialized 
area of the market -- small-cap and micro-cap stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the wrong moment in the cycle to be betting the ranch  
on stocks,'' Royce said in an interview at the mid-Manhattan 
offices of his $2.3 billion fund group. ``The bull cycle that began 
in 1990 may be nearing its end. Market leadership has narrowed 
dramatically, and Internet speculation may be the catalyst for a 
market correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Royce, who has been at this game for more than 25 years,  
says it is also the wrong time to be giving up on small stocks, 
roughly defined as companies whose shares have a total market value 
of $1 billion or less. That represents about 90 percent of the 
population of public companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While super-hot technology stocks and the blue chips look very  
vulnerable to him, he notes that the vast majority of other stocks, 
particularly of medium-sized and smaller companies, are already 
depressed in price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a bear market in small caps for almost three  
years,'' he observes. ``We're in a period where people just don't 
want to own them. It's so bad it's going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From mid-May 1996 to the end of 1998, Royce points out, the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, dominated by blue 
chips, climbed 89 percent. Over the same stretch, the Russell 2000 
index, a widely used yardstick of small-stock performance, rose 
less than 20 percent. That included a 36 percent plunge between 
April and October of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at market history over the past several decades, he says,  
shows that small caps have bounced back strong from every setback, 
although the timing of such rebounds has proved impossible to 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Performance following major small-cap declines has been  
consistent and significant,'' Royce says. ``They are inevitably 
followed by periods of higher returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All small-stock managers' lives are complicated these days by  
the mania for Internet stocks, which has driven their prices so 
high most professional investors won't touch them. Their 
discipline, however prudent, has excluded them from what has 
amounted to the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the big speculation at the end of this very big bull  
market,'' Royce says. ``We have not been active in that area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royce's nine funds do invest in technology -- typically what he  
calls ``sort of chicken tech,'' such as the shares of electronics 
component suppliers. But his hopes for this kind of company are 
longer-term, rather than for a quick run to the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in his company-by-company search for stocks to invest  
in, Royce says, ``we're shopping in the energy area, which is very 
distressed. Some of these stocks are down 75 percent from their 
highs. They're very much off the radar screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another field in which he has been prospecting lately:  
insurance. His funds have had some very good results with the 
stocks of fund-management companies, and he expects the fund 
industry to continue adding new chapters to its long success story. 
</P>
<P>
	Royce is enthusiastic enough about the outlook for small stocks  
to suggest that diversified investors consider gradually increasing 
the amount of their assets they allot to the category -- perhaps to 
as much as twice the usual allocation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also sees a good case for keeping a healthy cushion in  
reserve, and putting it in short-term money-market investments 
(``cash,'' in Wall Street parlance) rather than bonds. ``I think 
we're in an environment where interest rates, best-case, are going 
to be flat,'' he says. ``Over the next three to four years you're 
not going to have another big leg downward in interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that kind of situation, he says, ``there's nothing wrong with  
cash. It's sometimes the best place to wait.''

<HEADLINE> Fighting Goes With Food in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIEGLO, Somalia (AP) -- In Somalia, bringing food to the hungry  
is a military operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmen hold up a convoy of trucks carrying international food  
aid to starving Somalis. Other gunmen hired to protect the sacks of 
maize fight them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's common,'' said Daahir Abdullah Ali, leader of the convoy  
that delivered the food last week to this parched town, 120 miles 
northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. ``But God is helping us 
because we are serving the needy population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where there is no central government and rival  
warlords dominate a culture of hired guns, humanitarian agencies 
working in Somalia must play -- and pay for -- the security game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obliged to pay the militias in order to distribute  
food, so we are directly continuing to finance warlords,'' conceded 
Duarte de Carvalho, head of the European Commission's Somalia unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it means paying the same men who have participated in  
Somalia's disintegration, it is difficult for Western relief 
agencies to ignore images of people so hungry they are boiling 
camel skins to eat and struggling to collect firewood to sell for a 
cup of grain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a camp for displaced people in Bardera, a western market town  
on the Juba River, Zeynab Nur has one milk-producing cow to sustain 
her 18 children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing worse than this is death,'' she said tearfully,  
just before a U.N. World Food Program shipment arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency estimates that 1 million people in southern Somalia's  
Bay and Bakol regions are facing starvation and 300,000 are in 
immediate danger after drought resulted in a third bad harvest in 
the country's breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
	If rains expected this month don't come, the World Food Program  
fears a famine as severe as the one in which an estimated 100,000 
people died in 1992, when most food aid was seized by warring 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying the warlords to ensure delivery of food aid isn't new.  
During the 1992 famine, relief agencies poured in food, buying 
protection from militias even as the gunmen stole from their aid 
stores to finance the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result was that the famine continued to rage ... and the  
food relief inadvertently fueled the fighting that was causing the 
crisis,'' a 1998 U.N. report said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-led peacekeeping operations fared as poorly, culminating in  
a U.S. pullout after 18 American soldiers were killed in Mogadishu 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief agencies have learned some lessons during the Somalia  
debacle, said Roger Carter, head of UNICEF in Bardera.

<P>
	When 400 sacks of food were looted recently in Hoddur, west of  
Tieglo, UNICEF gave town elders an ultimatum -- replace the food or 
the aid stops. Within a week, 220 sacks were returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Food Progam has reduced its food distribution in the  
region and has transportation contracts with Somali businessmen who 
pay a cash bond on the value of the food, retrievable only when the 
cargo is delivered in full. 
</P>
<P>
	To transport 620 tons of food in 30 trucks last week, Daahir Ali  
hired 11 armed trucks as escorts and 132 armed guards. If a convoy 
is hit by bandits -- as most are -- Ali and other shippers buy 
replacement food from the local market rather than forfeit their 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the new measures, arguments over food distribution often  
turn violent because everyone is armed. Also, aid continues to 
sustain militias and politicians whose interests are not 
necessarily those of the often-frustrated Somali people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim Muallem Ahmed, a shopkeeper in the western town of  
Qansaderrah, accused elders in his town of ``helping themselves'' 
to the aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The only solution is to pray for rain so farmers can grow their  
own food, he said. ``We cannot be dependent on international 
support.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Promises To Share Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To settle an antitrust case, Intel Corp.  
promised the government to share with customers advance information 
about upcoming new computer chips except in rare circumstances, 
people familiar with the secret consent decree said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can be denied the advance information only if they  
have not paid Intel as agreed or have asked a court to halt its 
manufacturing of microprocessors, the sources said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement makes no mention of monopoly power the Federal  
Trade Commission had accused Intel of holding through its 85 
percent share of the market for processors running the world's 
personal computers, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission had accused Intel of bullying some of its  
customers into handing over their own secrets, seeing them as 
potential future rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, which was expected to announce terms of the settlement  
early Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesman for Intel, Chuck 
Mulloy, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Intel settlement was announced last week, details  
of the agreement were closely guarded at the time and it was 
unclear what concessions the government had won. The FTC said last 
week it would not disclose those details until its commissioners 
formally voted to approve the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had alleged that Intel illegally withheld from  
three companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies had developed independently and for which they had 
secured patents. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Arquit, an antitrust lawyer in New York, said the  
exceptions allowing Intel to withhold advance information about its 
chips are insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving up the right to seek an injunction isn't giving up very  
much,'' Arquit said. ``Companies want their intellectual property 
to be used, they just want to be paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An admission by Intel that it wields monopoly power would have  
been a significant loss for the company, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could have caused all kinds of mischief in other,  
unrelated litigation,'' Arquit said. ``This is a very big upside 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's decision to settle the Intel case is its biggest  
decision affecting the nation's burgeoning high-tech industry since 
the commission deadlocked 2-2 in 1993 and didn't sue Microsoft 
Corp. over alleged antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's settlement does not affect a broader investigation  
of Intel the FTC launched in September 1997. That probe is widely 
believed to be looking into Intel's business relating to computer 
motherboards and graphics technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In its original lawsuit, filed last June, the FTC demanded that  
Intel stop discriminating against or threatening any company over 
the sale of its microprocessors or sharing information about its 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had called Intel's actions ``a raw exercise of  
monopoly power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual 
property rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel had already acknowledged it did most of what the FTC  
alleged but said its practices did not violate federal antitrust 
laws. It argued that companies have a legal right to decide what 
secrets to disclose to customers about upcoming products.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Urged Over Farm Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some farm-state Republicans are pushing GOP  
leaders to address the agricultural economy soon, arguing that 
delay could risk losing control of the issue to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., four GOP  
lawmakers proposed a series of steps to aid farmers, including an 
increase in price supports that could cost several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture has historically led the U.S. economy into and out  
of recession,'' the lawmakers warned. ``While the overall economy 
is generally good, inattention to the distress in the agricultural 
sector could prove disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Republicans proposed $4 billion in emergency farm  
spending but had to add nearly $2 billion after President Clinton 
vetoed their package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're better served to move now and put the groundwork there  
and establish ourselves as leaders on the issue,'' Rep. John Thune, 
R-S.D. said Tuesday. ``If we do it now, we do it on our own 
terms.'' He signed the letter along with Rick Hill of Montana, Wes 
Watkins of Oklahoma and Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, dated Monday, follows meetings the lawmakers  
recently had with Hastert and other members of the GOP leadership, 
including Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom Davis, 
R-Va., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of farm-state Democrats in the Senate recently proposed  
$6 billion in emergency farm spending this year, about the same 
amount Congress approved last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices fell sharply last year because of a worldwide  
glut of grain, and economists expect farm income to fall about 6 
percent this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on 
Tuesday called the farm sector ``one of the more notable soft 
spots'' in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to increasing price supports, an idea that many  
Republicans have opposed, the letter endorses two ideas opposed by 
the meatpacking industry: country-of-origin labels on meat, and 
mandatory reporting of the prices packers pay for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are things we've been out there advocating for quite  
some time, because we think they make common sense,'' said Tom 
Buis, director of governmental affairs for the National Farmers 
Union, traditionally aligned with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond Democrats and Republicans in the countryside,''  
Buis said. ``People want action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Agriculture Committee spokesman Chris Matthews said the  
panel is considering ways to help farmers, with a focus on 
improving federally subsidized crop insurance.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Guzman Won't Go to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Pitcher Juan Guzman said Tuesday he  
won't accompany the Baltimore Orioles for their March 28 game in 
Cuba because he will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to pitch the day before. I'm not going to go for one  
day,'' said Guzman, who will make an exhibition start on March 27 
against the New York Mets at Port St. Lucie. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman lives in Miami, a city with a heavy Cuban population, but  
he said that wasn't a factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting close to the regular season, and we have to set  
it up so I can make my regular start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, according to the current rotation, Guzman's regular  
start would have come on the day of the game in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller on Tuesday selected Scott Erickson as  
his starter for the game. That decision allows him to set up his 
rotation so staff ace Mike Mussina is followed by Guzman and 
Erickson once the season starts April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman admitted he has shared reservations with teammates and  
members of the Orioles organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought up the question -- am I going to (have) any problems  
if I go down there because I live in Miami,'' Guzman said. ``They 
don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Orioles received clearance from major league baseball  
and the U.S. State Department for the exhibition game, many 
Cuban-Americans have criticized the trip, citing the oppressive 
regime of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Protestors demonstrated outside Fort Lauderdale Stadium before  
the team's home exhibition opener on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina, the team's player representative, said that players are  
allowed to make their own decisions about participating in the 
first major league baseball game in Cuba in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a problem with him not going,'' Mussina said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Orioles continued the process of seeing that  
approximately 30 team personnel without passports had the proper 
applications. More than 60 sets of passport photos were taken of 
members of the team's traveling party before a game against the St. 
Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he will take a squad of 31 players to Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want a representative club out there,'' Miller said. ``They  
are playing the Baltimore Orioles and it's going to get worldwide 
attention. ... We'll let out players know that it'll be like the 
seventh game of the World Series for their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will play host to Cuba's national team on May 3 at  
Camden Yards.

<HEADLINE> Sheffield Hampered by Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gary Sheffield returned to the Los  
Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday after taking two days off to attend to 
personal matters, but didn't play against the Florida Marlins due 
to his sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have him healthy,'' manager Davey Johnson said  
after his team lost 7-3. ``He's important to this ballclub, not 
only physically, but mentally, personally, the whole nine yards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield threw lightly and took batting practice before the  
game, and will probably do the same on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers have said Sheffield won't play in any exhibition  
games until they're convinced his shoulder has improved 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield has been hampered by chronic pain in his shoulder. He  
had surgery to repair tendon damage during the offseason, and 
received a cortisone shot last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that same day that Sheffield told the Los Angeles Times  
he might have retired by now if he didn't have five years remaining 
on a $61 million, six-yea contract, and had he not been traded by 
the Marlins to the Dodgers last May. 
</P>
<P>
	About the demands on a player of Sheffield's stature, Johnson  
said, ``I've never been in that class, but I've been close to guys 
who are in that class, personally. It's not easy being great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the possibility that Sheffield might be moved to first  
base, as reported in Tuesday's editions of the Times, Dodgers 
general manager Kevin Malone said, ``There's no truth to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Sheffield has been switched from right field to  
left this spring. Newcomer Devon White is in center and Raul 
Mondesi is in right, forming one of baseball's best outfield trios.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Earnings Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Novartis's  
earnings climbed 16 percent last year, its second full year of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis became the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals  
company when it was created in the 1996 merger of Ciba-Geigy and 
Sandoz. 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted net profits of 6 billion Swiss francs, or $4  
billion, in 1998, up from 5.21 billion francs a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 2 percent to 31.7 billion francs, or $21.7 billion,  
from 31.18 billion francs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company saw its sales of the cancer drug Aredia rise by 68  
percent, while Sandostatin, a drug to treat bone disease, rose by 
38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a rapidly changing environment the challenges ahead will be  
increasingly demanding, but the success of the merger provides us 
with strong fundamentals and an outstanding competitive platform 
upon which to build our business,'' said Daniel Vasella, 
chairman-designate and president of Novartis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company raised its dividened to 29 francs, or $20, per  
share, also an increase of 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Priorities for 1999 include key drugs currently under  
development, Novartis said. These are Zelmac, a treatment for 
irritable bowel syndrome, the diabetes drug Starlix and Amdray, a 
cancer treatment.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs New Arthritis Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved a machine to  
filter the blood of Americans with severe rheumatoid arthritis, in 
hopes it can alleviate the debilitating disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prosorba column, made by Cypress Bioscience, works much like  
dialysis. Once a week for 12 weeks, a patient's blood is slowly 
removed, the plasma is separated and treated by the Prosorba 
machine, and then the blood is retransfused into the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine offers a 30 percent chance of improving the swelling  
and pain that cripples patients' joints, Food and Drug 
Administration officials said in approving Prosorba late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA stressed that Prosorba is only for a small proportion of  
patients -- those with moderate to severe symptoms who have failed 
all other treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a front-line therapy. ... It's clearly not for  
lots of people,'' said Miriam Provost, an FDA engineer and lead 
reviewer of the device. ``It's for patients who have basically 
failed everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million Americans suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. This  
is not the kind of arthritis common in the elderly because of the 
wear-and-tear of aging. Instead, rheumatoid arthritis is an 
autoimmune disease. Patients' own immune systems go awry and attack 
their joints, causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune 
cells eat away cartilage and eventually erode bone. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease mostly strikes women, usually between ages 25 and  
50. Within 10 years, about half are too disabled to work. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of newly approved drugs help diminish the symptoms and  
may slow progression of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypress Bioscience's blood-filtering machine Prosorba, which has  
been sold for a decade to treat a rare blood disorder, is aimed at 
about 10 percent of patients not helped by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine is a column filled with silica and ``protein A,'' a  
protein from the cell wall of a bacterium that clings to human 
antibodies. As plasma runs through the column, the protein A 
separates out a small amount of antibodies before the plasma is 
retransfused, Provost said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibodies are immune cells that in healthy people fight off  
infections. In rheumatoid arthritis, some antibodies are believed 
to go out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how Prosorba works is unclear, because scientists do not  
know exactly which antibodies it removes from blood. And it doesn't 
remove enough to account for all of the effect, so the company is 
doing further research to understand how it helps, said Cypress 
chief executive Dr. Jay Kranzler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prosorba can work for about 30 percent of patients: In a  
study of 99 patients, half had their blood run through the machine 
and were compared with ``sham'' patients, who had their blood 
removed but not treated. Three months later, 15 Prosorba patients 
had a significant improvement, vs. just 5 of the sham patients. 
</P>
<P>
	For Merrill Meyer of Tempe, Ariz., the improvement was dramatic.  
She went from being bedridden to, after a year and two Prosorba 
treatments, an active life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm taking care of my family and myself and looking now to  
return to work on my art,'' said Meyer, 48, who quit taking 
arthritis medicine in 1996 after a severe drug reaction. ``It 
didn't seem radical to be taking part of my blood and ... cleansing 
out what may be causing the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kranzler said Prosorba's price has not been set, but it will be  
less than the $1,100 per treatment now charged to blood disorder 
patients. To be treated, rheumatoid patients would go to blood 
banks or other designated Prosorba centers with experience in blood 
filtering techniques.

<HEADLINE> Pension System To Invest in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The California Public Employees'  
Retirement System said Tuesday it will invest $100 million in a new 
fund for ``distressed'' Asian companies that are in bankruptcy or 
reorganization proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The global investment bank Rothschild Inc. is establishing the  
``Asian Recovery Fund,'' which will seek to raise a total of $300 
million from a variety of sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Other investment banks also are increasing their Asian  
investments, targeting companies they feel are poised to recover 
from the turmoil in Asia's economy and financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild plans to buy into ailing or bankrupt companies at  
bargain prices, then develop turnaround plans that could boost the 
value of the securities. The investments could soar in value if the 
companies recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to capitalize on an opportunity here,'' said  
CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese and Korean governments have pledged to help their  
banking sectors, allowing banks to write off bad loans and sell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's action is timely and presents valuable investment  
opportunities to purchase securities at historically low prices,'' 
said Charles P. Valdes, chairman of the CalPERS Investment 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS is the nation's largest public pension fund with assets  
totaling more than $153 billion. The system provides retirement and 
health benefits to more than 1 million state and local public 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Campbell, president of the Retired Public Employees  
Association, said the investment sounded ``a little riskier than 
perhaps some of the things that they could do,'' but added, ``I'm 
not worried by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like a lot of things, if 25 percent of those companies are  
turned around, CalPERS would stand to make a good bit of money,'' 
she said. ``CalPERS has shown that it has good investment 
strategies.''

<HEADLINE> Times Delayed China Espionage Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times has confirmed that it acceded  
to the FBI's request and held for one day a front-page story about 
China's theft of U.S. nuclear secrets. A second request was 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said that China had miniaturized its nuclear bombs  
using information stolen from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico. The story was supposed to run on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI asked the Times to delay the article because the main  
suspect in the theft, a Taiwanese-American scientist, was due to be 
interviewed by the bureau that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The story contained at least two facts the scientist didn't  
know, including his failing a lie detector test, Times executive 
editor Joseph Lelyveld told The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lelyveld told the Post that when the FBI asked the Times to hold  
off for a second day, he said he would only do so if FBI Director 
Louis Freeh called him directly. When Freeh failed to call by 7 
p.m., Lelyveld went ahead with the story. It appeared March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The story did not name the suspect, Wen Ho Lee. Two days later,  
he was fired. He has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Times spokeswoman Lisa Carparelli confirmed that the Times  
delayed publication for a day at the FBI's request. She was unable 
to provide further details and Lelyveld did not return a call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Carver, an FBI spokesman in Washington, refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Journalism Review editor Marshall Loeb said the  
practice of editors delaying stories at the request of government 
officials is appropriately rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is legitimate for an editor to hold a story for a brief  
period if he or she has persuasive reason to believe that reporting 
it might endanger national security or hurt a significant criminal 
investigation,'' Loeb said Monday. ``But such withholding should be 
done only rarely and only when a really important issue is at 
stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb said the most famous example of a newspaper honoring such a  
request was when President Kennedy asked the Times to withhold 
disclosing the Bay of Pigs invasion before it began. 
</P>
<P>
	``They withheld it much to the regret of one and all,'' Loeb  
said. ``Had the information been revealed, there might have been 
sufficient public outcry to get the whole operation called off. In 
the end, the operation was a total fiasco.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Farming Prospects Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite plummeting prices for corn, soybeans,  
wheat and hogs, American farmers remain in better financial shape 
than during the farm crisis of the early 1980s, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, in a speech in San Francisco, focused on what he  
called ``one of the more notable soft spots'' in an impressive and 
robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers, rather than sharing in the general prosperity, have  
been experiencing disappointing exports and sharply falling 
prices,'' he told the Independent Bankers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Due largely to the world economic slump that began in Asia a  
year and a half ago, February prices received by farmers were down 
5 percent from a year earlier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All told, falling shipments to the Asian countries accounted  
for more than 80 percent of the drop in the value of farm exports 
over the past two years,'' he said, noting that shipments to 
Russia, particularly of poultry, and to South America also have 
been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly our farm sector stands to gain, perhaps appreciably,  
when more favorable economic conditions finally emerge'' around the 
world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, farmers have responded ``by reducing the costs  
of production to the bare bone.'' And they've been assisted by 
falling prices for diesel fuel and fertilizer, which helped produce 
a 3 percent drop in their costs, by past technological innovations 
that have made them more efficient and by increased government 
support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ``favorable readings'' suggest farmers are in better  
shape than during the early 1980s, he said. Their debt remains low 
relative to the worth of their land and equipment, net farm income 
is holding up fairly well and most farmers are repaying their loans 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weakening of farm markets, while pressuring farm income  
and wealth, has not had effects as dramatic as the declines in 
market prices might seem to have implied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both farmers and lenders appear to retain a fair degree of  
optimism about the longer-run prospects for the sector,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reassured farmers and others working in troubled  
sectors of the economy that their voices are heard in the central 
bank's interest-rate deliberations. At the same time, he said, 
``monetary policy decisions, of course, must be directed toward 
what is deemed to be the best path for the economy as a whole.''

<HEADLINE> Bills To Give Flutie $22M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills are trying to keep  
everyone happy. But quarterback Rob Johnson can't be thrilled with 
the contract extension signed by Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson isn't happy about the agreement that will give Flutie  
a four-year, $22 million deal, he isn't saying much about it -- yet. 
Flutie's extension, expected to be signed today, will pay the Pro 
Bowl quarterback a $6 million bonus and base salaries of $400,000, 
$3 million, $5.5 million and $7 million during the 1999, 2000, 2001 
and 2002 seasons, respectively, The Buffalo News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also gives Flutie the sense of acceptance in the NFL,  
something that has eluded the 1984 Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to me, not from the dollars-and-cents  
standpoint,'' Flutie told the newspaper from his off-season home in 
Natick, Mass. ``I think I've taken it to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the roles were reversed when Johnson got big bucks  
and Flutie was headed for the bench even before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After Flutie secured the starting job last season, the injured  
Johnson said of Flutie's contract, ``If it does (go on beyond this 
year), I probably won't be here. You can't pay a guy this much to 
be a backup, and I'm not a backup in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also said he would re-evaluate the situation with agent  
Leigh Steinberg after the season if he remained the No. 2 guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rob may have said that last year,'' Steinberg said Monday  
night. ``But Rob's point of view now is that he'll always be 
competitive and always want to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Johnson discussed the situation with Bills  
general manager John Butler on Monday and that the quarterback does 
not want to go elsewhere. ``He's staying right there,'' the agent 
said. ``He'll just make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's Boston-based agent, Jack Mula, who last week called the  
month-long negotiations ``arduous,'' said the deal was all but 
wrapped up over the weekend, when Flutie spoke with Bills owner 
Ralph Wilson and expressed a desire to remain with the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo is the team that gave Doug a chance,'' Mula said. ``He  
still wants to give something back. Buffalo put the money where the 
mouth is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, last year's starter until going out with a rib injury  
in the fifth game, signed a $25 million contract last offseason. 
Flutie took over and led the Bills to a 10-6 record and a wild-card 
playoff berth after they started the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash crunch at the quarterback position made for tough  
negotiations, Mula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo had to find a way to reward Flutie while keeping Rob  
Johnson,'' Mula said. ``That's why it was difficult. I'm happy. 
Doug's happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paying two quarterbacks over $5 million per year.  
That's a first for the National Football League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said at the league meetings in Phoenix that the team  
``needs two No. 1 quarterbacks'' and will keep both Johnson and 
Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not cut or trade Rob Johnson,'' Wilson said with  
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie is just the latest veteran quarterback to parlay a strong  
1998 season into a big contract. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde received a $19.5  
million three-year extension, and Randall Cunningham reportedly 
received a $25 million deal from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde took New York to the AFC East title. He was 12-1  
after replacing Glenn Foley as starter, and threw 29 TD passes with 
only seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a Pro Bowl year and selection as NFL Comeback Player of  
the Year, Flutie's status for next season remained uncertain after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie signed as a free agent after eight seasons in the  
Canadian Football League and was told he would have a shot at the 
starting job in Buffalo. But he became Johnson's backup even before 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He posted a 7-3 mark in his starts, including 5-1 in six home  
starts, and completed 57.1 percent of his passes for 2,711 yards 
and 20 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE>  5 Killed in Amtrak Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Rescue crews climbed through the  
twisted hulk of an Amtrak train today, hoping to find survivors 
after a fiery derailment killed at least five people and injured 
more than 100 others taking a ride on the City of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 21 people were missing and feared dead, said Mike  
Harshbarger, the Bourbonnais fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 188 of the 214 people on the train had been accounted  
for at hospitals and shelters. It was unknown whether the missing 
were all passengers. The train had 18 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to go to sleep. Then all of the sudden everything  
just started crashing and catching on fire and people hollering and 
running. It was awful,'' said Blanche Jones, a passenger from 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We was trying to get out. We couldn't get out, couldn't find a  
way out. That was the most devastating thing of all,'' Jones said 
as she limped out of a school that served as a temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the grace of God, I just went down a stairway and found a  
way to get out and let everybody know how to get out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans, careened off the  
tracks shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday after it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars at a crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago. The truck was leaving a nearby Birmingham Steel 
Co. facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The windows rattled,'' said Don O'Dell, who lives a block away  
from the scene and was watching TV when he heard the crash. ``We 
got up and looked around to see what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members clambered atop overturned cars and two derailed  
engines -- one was split in half -- searching through an eerie, smoky 
haze for trapped passengers. Firefighters doused flames on one of 
the engines and another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ramsey, chief of the fire department in nearby Herscher,  
said eight cars derailed, with three of them ending up on their 
sides. Amtrak officials said two engines and 11 cars derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Joseph Beard said most of the injured were in a  
sleeper car, which Amtrak officials said was behind the engines and 
a baggage car. Some of the rescuers peeled off their coats for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said 101 people were taken to two hospitals in  
nearby Kankakee, and at least 11 were in critical condition. One 
was airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition of the truck driver wasn't immediately known,  
Beard said, though the cab of the truck was not struck by the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were investigating whether gates and  
lights -- which were flashing after the accident -- were working 
before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were  
also being called to the scene.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Greets Jays Without Glares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- No brushbacks, no glares. Rather, Roger  
Clemens offered only friendly glances to his former teammates, and 
maybe even a hittable pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the Toronto Blue Jays for the first time since forcing  
them to trade him, the New York Yankees' new ace worked around five 
walks in five innings Tuesday night and left with the score tied at 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awkward seeing the guys you went to battle with. It's  
definitely strange,'' Clemens admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``You study them a little bit as hitters when they're your  
teammates, but it's different when you see them from 60 feet,'' he 
said. ``It was real interesting when I faced a guy like Fletch. 
He's caught me, worked with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays certainly agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he went out to take the mound for the first time,  
everyone was on the top step of the dugout, checking him out and 
seeing how he looked,'' said Darrin Fletcher, who caught most of 
Clemens' games last year. ``It was odd, sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens demanded a trade in the offseason, saying he did not  
think Toronto would contend this year. The Blue Jays sent him to 
the World Series champions last month for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd 
and Homer Bush -- in fact, Wells was in the Yankees' locker room 
before the exhibition game, which the Yankees won 2-1 in 10 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green doubled for two of the three hits  
off Clemens. He twice retired Bush and threw 69 pitches, just 33 
for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed I was getting behind,'' Clemens said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemens probably enjoyed putting this outing behind him, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young winner did not express any hard feelings  
toward the Blue Jays after leaving them. The only one on the 
Toronto side who had sharp words for Clemens was first-year 
pitching coach Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I owe a lot of thanks to the guys over there,'' Clemens  
said. As for Stewart, he added, ``He was not in my situation, so 
it's hard for him to comment. He was not there when I had the 
relationship I did with those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And clearly, he still had good feelings for many of the Blue  
Jays, most apparent when they approached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at a couple of guys, we were making eye contact,''  
Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher, one of Clemens' biggest admirers, caught the pitcher's  
eye when he stepped into the batter's box. Fletcher then lined out 
hard to center field on a changeup. 
</P>
<P>
	In his next at-bat, Fletcher grounded into an easy double play  
on a pitch that sharply dipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, he kind of gave me one,'' Fletcher said. ``But the next  
time, he brought out the `thing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher made sure to run past Clemens on the way back to the  
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I said something like, `What's up?' or `You look  
good,''' he said. ``It's no secret that I think he's one of the 
best.''

<HEADLINE> House Members Backing Steel Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200 House members are backing a  
steel quota bill scheduled for a vote Wednesday despite indications 
the domestic industry's troubles are easing. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong congressional support reflects a belief that the  
turnaround is temporary and much larger layoffs loom if the 
government doesn't act, soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making some progress but the issue is a longer-term  
one,'' said Curtis Barnette, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Bethlehem Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. steel plants recently recalled workers laid off last  
year as the domestic industry faced a surge in low-priced steel 
imports. Some imports have dropped since November because of 
preliminary rulings on complaints, and several companies have 
announced price hikes for April and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, support for quantitative limits on steel imports  
remains strong in a Republican-led Congress, which normally would 
oppose restrictions on free trade. More than 40 Republicans with 
large steel constituencies are among the bill's 205 co-sponsors. 
The bill needs 218 votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the trade figures have marginally improved, the crisis  
continues,'' said Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., the bill's chief 
sponsor. ``We can't let the problem take care of itself. We have to 
take a global approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill faces a veto threat even if it overcomes steep hurdles  
in the Senate, so it may never become law. But supporters say they 
are happy just to show Congress takes the issue seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the legislation would violate international trade  
agreements and ultimately could hurt the U.S. economy if other 
countries respond with raised trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really sends a pathetic message,'' said David Phelps,  
executive director for a Washington trade group for steel importers 
and exporters. ``One hopes there is some fundamental economic 
common sense in Congress and that they will give this legislation 
the indecent burial it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels last year as the Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rehiring at some plants, thousands of steelworkers  
remain out of work, and 100,000 more jobs are threatened when a 
contractual no-layoff clause expires this summer. Three companies 
have filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and two steelworkers unions complained to the  
government that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped a widely 
used product -- hot-rolled carbon steel -- and other lines in the 
United States at prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall imports in January, the most recent figures available,  
are 27 percent higher than December 1997 levels, while steel prices 
have barely inched back to what they were before.

<HEADLINE> Congress Poised To OK Missile Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic opponents of a bill to commit the  
United States to a national missile defense system claim it could 
undermine delicate efforts to reduce the world's arsenal of nuclear 
warheads. But they were waging an uphill battle against popular 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill heading toward expected Senate passage, perhaps by the  
end of today, ``increases the odds that Russia will end the 
reduction of nuclear weapons,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``The 
stakes here are huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin contends the legislation violates terms of the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Soviet Union, as does the 
Clinton administration, which has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levin conceded that support for the measure in the  
Republican-led Senate appeared high. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, lawmakers introduced a bill that would allow Russia  
to back out of the START II arms-reduction treaty if the United 
States withdraws from the ABM treaty in order to begin a missile 
defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	After blocking missile defense legislation for the past several  
years, Levin and other Senate Democrats were putting up only token 
opposition this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of espionage by China at a U.S. nuclear weapons plant  
and recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran are helping build 
bipartisan support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, North Korea's Aug. 31 firing of a three-stage  
ballistic missile on a trajectory that passed over Japan and other 
recent developments ``have answered the question about the 
threat,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a sponsor of the legislation, 
told the Senate on Monday. ``The question today is whether we 
intend to defend ourselves against the threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, one of four Democratic  
co-sponsors, told the Senate, ``We should take action to protect 
ourselves against this threat. We would be derelict if we did 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee,  
said he has several potential amendments he may offer today, but he 
wanted to sound out other Democrats at a policy luncheon first. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin wants to preserve the administration's ability to decide  
by June 2000 whether to field such a system. He also wants to add 
language that would keep such a system from being deployed before 
working out ABM modifications with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	But he contends amendments dealing with the ABM treaty may not  
fare well. Many Senate Republicans, including Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., contend that the ABM treaty 
has outlived its usefulness since the Soviet Union no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, speaking in behalf of the overall bill on Monday, said  
the measure ``takes the first step toward protecting the American 
people from attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This policy is clear, if unequivocal. But it's only the first  
step,'' Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill calls for the United States to deploy a missile defense  
system capable of defending the 50 states against limited ballistic 
missile attack -- including an accidental firing by Russia or a 
deliberate firing by a rogue nation -- as soon as ``technologically 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton proposed an increase of $6.6 billion for a  
missile defense system over the next five years in the budget he 
submitted last month. But he put off a decision on whether to field 
such a system until June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is taking up its version of the bill, offered by Rep.  
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., on Thursday, after it holds a rare closed-door 
session to receive classified information on missile threats facing 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cochran and Weldon bills represent a blank check to  
defense contractors and a hollow promise to Americans rightly 
concerned about the potential of terrorist attack -- attacks that 
are much more likely to be delivered via a panel truck than a 
ballistic missile,'' John Isaacs, president of the Council for a 
Livable World, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is waging a lobbying campaign against both Senate and  
House versions of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Senators Vow To Add Border Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Senate Republicans pledged Tuesday to  
overrule the Clinton administration and add 1,000 new Border Patrol 
agents next year. They accused the White House of raiding 
immigration enforcement accounts to fund other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication is that we will put them back in'' the  
budget, said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has been a 
sharp critic of the Clinton administration's decision not to seek 
the 1,000 agents, as Congress ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., questioned whether the $600 million  
sought by the administration to expand its politically popular 
cops-on-the-streets program was coming at the expense of the Border 
Patrol -- a contention the White House denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the question of the administration: 'What is the  
responsibility of the federal government?''' said Gregg, who chairs 
the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Justice Department 
and its agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it to defend the borders or is it to put a police officer  
on the street in Epping, N.H.? I happen to think it's to defend the 
borders. If the town of Epping wants a new police officer, that's 
great. But that's the town of Epping's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his subcommittee's hearing on INS' 2000 budget, Gregg  
accused the administration, which has long trumpeted the 100,000 
police officers put on the streets, of ``a press conference 
approach to law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg's stance was endorsed by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be putting that money against that which is a  
purely federal obligation rather than against what the states and 
local governments already have the responsibility of doing,'' Kyl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House and Justice Department officials denied any linkage  
between the 100,000 police program and Border Patrol funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg is ``flat-out wrong,'' said White House spokesman Barry  
Toiv. ``We found reductions elsewhere in the budget to finance the 
president's initiative to put additional police on the streets of 
our communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv defended the administration's performance on immigration.  
``Believe me, this administration has been the first administration 
to take this issue seriously,'' he said. ``And we will gladly stand 
on our record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have been up in arms at the  
administration's decision not to seek 1,000 Border Patrol agents 
next year as directed by the 1996 immigration law. At a hearing of 
Gregg's subcommittee Tuesday, they questioned INS Commissioner 
Doris Meissner repeatedly about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Meissner and Attorney General Janet Reno have said  
their concerns over tremendous growth in the Border Patrol led to 
the decision not to seek new agents next year. Nearly 40 percent of 
all agents in the nearly 9,000-person force, which has doubled 
since 1993, have less than two years on the job. Meissner didn't 
reiterate that position Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are able to deal with this level of growth,'' she said.  
``We have been able to attract very high-quality personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, she acknowledged that the INS and the Justice  
Department had requested money for the 1,000 agents in their fiscal 
2000 budget submissions, but were overruled within the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration did make the decision in this budget round  
to take a breather for a year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment drew a sharp retort from Kyl. ``Nobody else at the  
border is taking a breather,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jones, Husband Separate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Paula Corbin Jones and her husband have  
separated, but both say a divorce is not likely, USA Today 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quotes Mrs. Jones, 33, in today's editions as saying  
the situation with her husband is ``not any different than other 
couples'' that live apart because of different career ambitions and 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get ugly at each other,'' she told the  
paper, adding that the couple has been discussing a trial 
separation ``for some time.'' They were married in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the split follows disagreements over strategy in  
her now-settled sexual harassment suit against President Clinton, 
how to spend the money they received and where to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jones, 38, will remain at the couple's condominium in Long  
Beach, Calif., to pursue an acting career and work on a book, the 
paper said. He is contesting his dismissal from Northwest Airlines, 
which fired him last March from his job as a counter clerk. He told 
the paper: ``People are taking this argument stuff out of 
proportion. My idea is you don't spend money until you know what 
you're going to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones will live in Cabot, Ark., in a house she purchased  
last week. It is about 10 miles from Beebe, Ark., where her mother 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get back closer to my family and friends,'' Mrs.  
Jones said. ``In California, I had to be very careful about who I 
got to know, so I didn't develop any close friendships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the couple's two sons will live with Mrs. Jones,  
who intends to accept a job offer to be a manicurist, and visit 
their father in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones and Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement of  
$850,000 last November on her claim that Clinton made an improper 
sexual advance to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. Her 
share of the money came to $201,000, with the rest going to 
lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Teens Recount Train Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, Miss. (AP) -- About 20 Mississippi teen-agers and their  
chaperones were on Amtrak's City of New Orleans, returning from a 
spring break ski trip to Canada, when the train struck a truck and 
derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	```Oh, Mom, it was just a nightmare,''' Sharon Bomgaars quoted  
her daughter, Christiana, as telling her about the deadly wreck in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the teens were told today that one young member of  
the group had a back injury, and at least one adult was 
hospitalized, but no other serious injuries were reported in the 
group, said Karen Freeman, whose son, Michael, was of the traveling 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Freeman said the group was made up of students from both  
Covenant Christian and Clinton High School who had attended Mount 
Salus Elementary in Clinton, a city just west of Jackson, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard from just about all the other parents and their  
kids have been calling,'' said Mrs. Freeman, who teachers at both 
the elementary and the Christian schools. ``They've been calling 
from borrowed car phones, calling from the hospital, anywhere they 
could get a phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans with a scheduled  
stop in Jackson, careened off the tracks late Monday after slamming 
into a truck at a crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bomgaars' husband, Dennis, said their daughter was aboard  
one of the Amtrak cars that ended up on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christiana said there was an initial jolt during which she was  
standing and got thrown against the seat in front of her,'' 
Bomgaars said. ``Then she said it was perfectly quiet, then there 
was another jolt and they could tell they were leaving the tracks. 
That's when people started screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bomgaars said two Clinton High students, Caleb McNair and  
Michael Freeman, worked their way to a roof escape hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got Michael out and then those two started lifting out of  
the car anyone able to make it to that window, including my 
15-year-old daughter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Coal said her 13-year-old daughter, Suzanne, was in a  
hospital intensive care unit with a compression fracture in her 
back, but appeared to be stable. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was in one of the cars that flipped,'' Mrs. Coal said.  
``Michael Freeman helped her out and they walked about a half-mile 
to get help. Thank God she was able to walk out without more injury 
to her back.''

<HEADLINE> Wayward Heir's Death a Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The wayward heir to a casino fortune who died  
in September after burying $4 million in silver bars and coins was 
killed with a heroin and prescription drug overdose administered by 
someone else, the coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends of Ted Binion had been saying for months that  
the 55-year-old man -- who had lost his gambling license because of 
a drug problem -- would not have taken an overdose himself or 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would not say how the drugs were administered or  
whether they had a suspect, only that Binion was killed by someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are numerous scenarios,'' Clark County Coroner Ron Flud  
said Tuesday. ``We're not to the point we're going to comment on 
any of the scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, lawyers for Binion's girlfriend, 27-year-old former  
topless dancer Sandy Murphy, said they think their client may be a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hasn't been designated a target,'' David Chesnoff said  
Tuesday. ``But I would be an incompetent lawyer if I didn't think 
she was the target of law enforcement interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Binion's sister, Becky Behnen, owner of the family's Horseshoe  
hotel-casino, had been pushing police to treat the Sept. 17 death 
as a homicide. Binion's brother, Jack Binion, executor of his 
estate, increased a reward for the killer from $25,000 to $100,000 
after Monday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The homicide ruling comes just days before three men are to  
appear in court on charges they removed $4 million in silver bars 
and coins Binion had buried in a vault just a few feet from a 
heavily traveled road in Pahrump, about 65 miles west of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Tabish, Michael David Milot and David Lee Mattsen were  
arrested as they loaded the silver onto a truck before daybreak on 
Sept. 19, two days after Binion's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are due in court for a preliminary hearing Friday on  
charges of burglary, larceny and conspiracy. They have refused to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Binion, whose father, Benny Binion, came here from Texas to  
fulfill his dream of owning a casino, had an estate valued at $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy has said she found her boyfriend dead in front of his  
television, a comforter draped about him. The coroner found a 
lethal dose of heroin and Xanax in Binion's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Binion's lawyer, Richard Wright, Binion thought Ms.  
Murphy was having an affair with Tabish. Wright said Binion called 
him two days before his death and asked that Ms. Murphy be removed 
from his will. A judge refused to acknowledge the change because 
Binion was not present when it was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Binion expressed fear for his life at the time he  
changed the will. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the death, Ms. Murphy has been involved in a legal battle  
with Binion's family over what she says is her share of his estate, 
including a $900,000 house and $300,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy refused to answer some 200 questions posed to her in  
the civil case last month, citing her Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination.

<HEADLINE> First Lady: Whitewater Books Unseen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In testimony made public for the first  
time today, Hillary Rodham Clinton said she didn't monitor the 
records of the Whitewater land deal that would later prompt an 
independent counsel investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never spent any significant time at all looking at the books  
and records of Whitewater,'' Mrs. Clinton told Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors in the testimony videotaped in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty minutes of the first lady's testimony were shown in court  
today as part of the contempt trial of Susan McDougal, who has 
refused to answer prosecutors' questions about her Whitewater 
partnership with the Clintons that began in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure of Mrs. Clinton's secret testimony in 1998 revives  
the troublesome Whitewater issue as she is considering a run for 
the U.S. Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors appeared attentive as Mrs. Clinton's face appeared on two  
TV screens in the nearly full courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the videotape, Starr deputy Hickman Ewing Jr. showed Mrs.  
Clinton a $27,600 cashier's check payable to Bill Clinton, which 
was used to pay off a Whitewater debt. Mrs. McDougal's husband, 
Jim, had taken the money from a financial institution he owned to 
bankroll the Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you know that that loan was being paid off by check to  
your husband?'' Ewing asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, Mr. Ewing, I don't know anything about this,'' Mrs.  
Clinton answered. The first lady, wearing a yellow suit, appeared 
serious during her testimony, nodding and occasionally smiling 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing asked whether she had ever seen a $27,600 entry in  
Whitewater records. Mrs. Clinton said she had not reviewed the 
books, and ``I have absolutely no memory of seeing an entry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also asked her about a $5,081.82 check that was signed by  
Mrs. McDougal seven months after the other check. It bore the 
notation ``payoff Clinton.'' That check was used to pay off part of 
the $27,600 loan, which was in Bill Clinton's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen these documents before,'' Mrs. Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	In allowing the tape, U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr.  
agreed with Starr's prosecutors that McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos 
had opened the door to showing Mrs. Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos suggested Thursday in questioning FBI agent Mike Patkus  
that prosecutors had never bothered to ask questions of the first 
lady that the investigators now want Mrs. McDougal to answer about 
a disputed two-decade-old loan in the name of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett stressed that Mrs. Clinton's testimony  
is not being shown to prove the truth of what the first lady said, 
but simply to show that the prosecutors did ask her questions about 
the $27,600 loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton testified in the deposition in Washington on April  
25, 1998, two days after Mrs. McDougal appeared before the 
Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock and refused to answer 
questions. Her videotaped testimony was shown to the grand jury in 
Little Rock on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's testimony has been secret for nearly a year.  
</P>
<P>
	In prosecution papers obtained by The Associated Press, Starr's  
office suggested Mrs. Clinton's testimony on Whitewater 
transactions made it more critical than ever for Mrs. McDougal to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The videotape will show that the first lady testified that she  
had no knowledge or information about either'' a $27,600 loan made 
in Bill Clinton's name in 1982 or a $5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. 
McDougal in 1983 and used to pay off part of the Clinton loan, said 
the prosecutors' papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at the 1996 trial of the McDougals and  
then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker that he never had taken out a loan at the 
McDougals' savings and loan. Prosecutors say the $27,600 loan in 
Clinton's name, which they discovered in 1996, was used to pay off 
a $30,000 Whitewater debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, is on trial on two counts of criminal  
contempt and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to 
answer grand jury questions Sept. 4, 1996, and April 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her ex-husband, James, who died in prison last year,  
were business partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater land 
development venture in Arkansas from 1979 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal claims she has no information pertinent to the  
case. She says she refused to answer questions because she believed 
Starr would twist her words around and use them to suit his own 
agenda or would charge her with perjury if he did not like what she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also alleges that Starr's deputies have used false  
information from her ex-husband and David Hale, a former judge and 
businessman, to pursue their investigation of her and the Clintons.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa, McGwire Tied With 5 Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The start of the 1999 home run race didn't  
wait for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire hit two Sunday to take over the major league lead  
at five. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa answered back with two Monday to tie him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but this is spring training,'' Sosa said. ``Ain't no  
competition. We're just going out trying to do our jobs and make 
fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's second home run was a moon shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the left-field fence at HoHoKam Park, about 360 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the 50-foot-high scoreboard, about 30 more feet back.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the back wall of the ballpark, about 10 feet behind the  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Over four full rows of cars in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Arizona, where balls rifle through the thin Sonoran  
Desert air. But by any stretch, this was a rocket, a 450-foot-plus 
bomb of a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Tim Raines turned to the crowd on the berm behind  
the fence and started laughing. Then he shrugged his shoulders, as 
in: ``What was I supposed to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit the ball, I don't look how far it's going to go,''  
Sosa said after driving in four runs in the Chicago Cubs' 10-7 win 
over the Oakland Athletics. ``I just let you people do that. I just 
try to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez hit a pair of homers off loser Kenny Rogers. Sosa  
followed Hernandez's first-inning homer with a solo shot to 
left-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit a two-run homer off Rogers in the third, and Sosa  
hit his monster shot off Gil Heredia in the fourth, a three-run 
drive that made it 10-2. After blowing his traditional kiss in 
honor of his mother, Sosa bowed to the fans, a habit he picked up 
during last year's All-Star tour of Japan. He says he intends to 
bow after each home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some balls up, and the Cubs didn't miss them,'' A's  
manager Art Howe said. ``Right-handed hitters had a field day today 
with the wind blowing to left field. They capitalized on every 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After thrilling the nation with their historic home-run race  
last summer, won by McGwire 70-66, the pair are doing it again this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa didn't see McGwire's homers on the highlight shows Sunday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sleeping,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was tagged for six runs and eight hits in three innings.  
He's lost both his starts this spring, allowing nine earned runs in 
five innings, a 16.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through this,'' he said. ``I feel like right  
now, my location, it's not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Results of Kerry Wood's MRI exam weren't expected until  
today. ... Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer off Terry Adams in the 
eighth and Domingo Cedeno hit a two-run homer off Ray King in the 
ninth. ... Ben Grieve was 4-for-5 with an RBI. ... Winner Steve 
Trachsel allowed two runs and five hits in three innings.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Hits 10,000, Then Falls / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For a brief moment, the Dow Jones industrial  
average stood atop 10,000, eliciting cheers and confetti on the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But as often happens when the blue-chip stock indicator reaches  
new milestones, selling pulled the Dow back down Tuesday and left 
market watchers wondering when it might actually close above 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of 30 blue chip stocks breached the five-digit mark 20  
minutes into the day, traded as high as 10,001.78, then fell back 
within a minute and closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30. 
</P>
<P>
	To people who follow the stock market closely, the Dow's  
achievement wasn't a one-day event -- it was just part of a long 
Wall Street rally fed by a strong U.S. economy, low interest rates 
and the world's growing fascination with high technology, 
particularly the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenon that's been going on for three years,''  
said Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the market does in the next few days, analysts  
are looking for the Dow ultimately to continue its advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take the long-term perspective, the average annual  
equity returns have been around 10 percent. If the Dow merely does 
what it's been doing, you'll have a Dow 20,000 in 10 years,'' said 
Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is already up 8 percent so far this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow 10,000 rocket was launched early in the decade -- when  
the index hadn't even reached 3,000 yet -- as the United States 
recovered from the 1990-91 recession. The growing economy, low 
interest rates and low inflation have kept consumers spending and 
corporate profits rising. High technology has become part of the 
average American's life, at home as well as on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market found particular strength in the past year  
through an explosion of enthusiasm for the Internet -- hundreds of 
companies created Web sites to sell themselves and their products. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic troubles in Russia, Asia and Latin America have  
threatened several times to halt the Dow's advance. The blue chips 
dropped below 7,500 on Oct. 8, but stocks rebounded on a series of 
three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent perception that the troubled foreign economies were  
beginning to rebound has also allowed the Dow to resume its climb. 
</P>
<P>
	To most market analysts, the Dow's ascension to 10,000 is more  
of a curiosity or media event. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 10,000 mark is absolutely a psychological milestone,''  
said Jan Holman, vice president of investment services at American 
Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. ``But for most 
investors, it's just another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual investors shrugged off the event.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought it would get there. The records are made to  
be broken,'' said Kathleen Daly, interviewed outside a Fidelity 
Investments office in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, one cause for concern is the fact that the  
market's recent gains have been concentrated in a few business 
sectors, most notably Internet and high-tech stocks. That leaves 
many other stocks lagging behind, particularly those of smaller and 
younger businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clipping 10,000 is not going to change that,'' said analyst  
Eugene Peroni at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing in favor of even higher stock prices is the ever-growing  
stock ownership of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 43 percent of U.S. households now own stock or mutual  
funds and millions believe that the stock market, despite 
occasional downturns, is the best place to earn money for 
retirement, college and other needs. Banks paying in the 
neighborhood of 5 percent on certificates of deposit cannot match 
the double-digit returns stocks have provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some fear that the fascination for the Internet that has  
driven the market's recent gains could also be its undoing. Online 
traders now account for more than 14 percent of all stock trades 
and many were just toddlers during the last big bear market of the 
1970s. Some market pros fear these investors will click their way 
out of the market fast if they see signs of a decline. 
</P>
<P>
	But the investing public today is much more savvy than in the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schwab, interviewed outside the Fidelity office in  
Manhattan, is already expecting a selloff at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there will be another downturn, but it will be  
short.''

<HEADLINE>  Son of Lions Owner Complains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A son of Detroit Lions owner William Clay Ford  
says proposals to grab the Lions' traditional Thanksgiving Day game 
shows how ``mean-spirited'' the NFL has become. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Ford Jr., named the team's vice chairman four years ago,  
was attending an NFL owners meeting this week in Phoenix. The 
owners were expected to discuss the possibility of rotating the two 
games -- the other is in Dallas -- among the 31 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having trouble with this league,'' Ford told the Detroit  
Free Press for a story Tuesday. ``It's a very mean-spirited league, 
the lack of goodwill, the lack of transparency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could look the chairman of General Motors or Toyota in the  
eye and if they shake your hand and they give you their word, it's 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it's not the case. There's always a hidden agenda. All I  
can say is thank goodness the sport of football is still a great 
sport, because the business of football isn't,'' said the younger 
Ford, who also is chairman of Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he now understands why his father soured on his fellow  
NFL club owners years ago. The senior Ford stopped attending 
owners' meetings, leaving it to other team executives to represent 
the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Jr. has given the Lions a more active voice, holding  
positions on the NFL finance and international committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was absolutely right, and I give him his due,'' Ford  
Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his remarks aren't only about proposals to rotate the  
Thanksgiving Day games, made by owners Lamar Hunt of Kansas City 
and Tom Benson of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's the Thanksgiving Day game or the Redskins sale,  
everybody has their own agenda,'' Ford Jr. said. ``Nothing's ever 
above board; everybody's whispering in the corners, and to me 
that's just not the way you do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you do business is you lay it all on the table and  
everybody has different opinions, you bang heads, count votes and 
that's it. I've never been part of anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CIA has nothing on this place.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said the Lions or Cowboys shouldn't have the game  
automatically, regardless of the Lions' 65-year history with the 
holiday game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it should be considered, but on the other hand, this  
is something we've raised for over 15 years,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition is longer in Detroit's case, but the tradition  
in Dallas' case really is a much shorter time period, and I don't 
think that should overcome what is clearly a competitive 
advantage,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt and Benson propose the games be rotated among any of the  
NFL's 31 teams that express an interest, with the Lions and Cowboys 
getting preferential treatment for the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford told the newspaper the Lions and Cowboys can gather enough  
support among the other 29 teams to keep the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would need support by 24 of the 31 owners to pass.  
Detroit has hosted a Thanksgiving Day game since 1934, the year the 
franchise moved from Portsmouth, Ohio. The Dallas Cowboys followed 
in 1966.

	Dow Tops 10,000 Then Slips  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average topped the  
10,000 mark for the first time today, but closed down 28.30 at 
9,930.47. Soon after reaching the 10,000 milestone at 9:50 a.m. 
EST, the 103-year-old index of 30 blue-chip stocks retreated. 
``There's nothing in particular holding it down,'' said Richard A. 
Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in 
Richmond, Va. ``It's just a really mixed market.'' On the NYSE, 
decliners led advancers 1,672-1,305. The Nasdaq Composite index was 
up 7.84 at 2,439.28.

	Fourteen Die in Amtrak Derailment  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- At least 14 people died, four are  
missing and feared dead and more than 100 were injured last night 
when an Amtrak passenger train collided with a truck loaded with 
steel at a crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. Rescue workers today 
sifted through the remains of a sleeper car, searching for 
survivors. All of the dead were aboard the double-decker car, which 
was pierced by one of the engines and then set afire by leaking 
diesel fuel. The train, which was carrying a total of 216 
passengers and crew, was headed from Chicago to New Orleans when it 
slammed into the truck and careened off the tracks.

	Hale Makes Deal on Charges  
</P>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- Retired Army Maj. Gen. David Hale,  
accused of sexual improprieties with the wives of subordinates, has 
agreed to plead guilty to some charges in exchange for limitations 
on his sentence. His attorney, Frank Spinner, said the agreement 
was accepted by his client and Army prosecutors after lengthy 
negotiations. Spinner did not specify which charges Hale would 
plead guilty to, but said, ``He is not pleading guilty to any 
non-consensual sexual offenses.''

	European Leaders Cope With Scandal  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European leaders scrambled today to  
plug the hole left by the abrupt resignation of the entire 
20-member European Commission following the publication of a report 
on fraud and sloppy management. The overnight departure of the 
European Union's executive body plunged the trade bloc into its 
deepest crisis in decades, just days ahead of a crucial summit to 
overhaul EU finances in preparation for its expansion into Eastern 
Europe. The resignations were hailed by governments around Europe, 
which hoped they would lead to more responsible EU management.

	Clinton Unhappy With Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of work, the commission charged  
with overhauling Medicare is poised to adjourn without making any 
formal recommendation. President Clinton said today the plan under 
consideration ``falls short'' of what's needed to reform the health 
program for the elderly. The panel, which includes Republicans, 
Democrats, members of Congress and private economists, hoped to 
rise above politics and offer Congress a blueprint for overhauling 
a program that has attracted partisan sniping.

	Latvian Waffen SS March Is Peaceful  
</P>
<P>
	RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- A march today by Latvian Waffen SS veterans  
was peaceful, but arguments among onlookers and a 
counter-demonstration by ethnic Russians exposed tensions. The 
demonstration was part of an official day of remembrance for all 
Latvian veterans, but with Latvia's history of Nazi and Soviet 
occupation, commemoration of World War II fighting taps strong 
emotions. Several arguments erupted among onlookers, with some 
hailing the veterans as freedom fighters and others shouting that 
they were Nazis and should not have been allowed to march.

	Leader of Montana Freemen Sentenced  
</P>
<P>
	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- The kingpin of the Montana Freemen  
carried his scorn for the federal government to the end today, 
refusing to enter the courtroom as a judge handed down what his 
lawyer said amounted to a life sentence. Leroy Schweitzer, 61, was 
given 22 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted on a slew of fraud 
charges. In 1995, about two dozen members of the group, living on a 
farm on the plains of eastern Montana, held an army of FBI agents 
at bay for 81 days before surrendering without a shot being fired.

	Cubs Star Pitcher Wood Out for Year  
</P>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood is expected to miss the entire  
1999 season because of an elbow injury, leaving the Chicago Cubs 
without the pitcher who dazzled baseball last year. The NL Rookie 
of the Year, who last May struck out 20 batters against Houston, 
damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during his 
spring training debut against Anaheim on Saturday. The Cubs said 
more tests were needed on the 21-year-old right-hander to determine 
the extent of the injury. However, they assume he will need surgery 
and will not be able to pitch until next year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Hits 10,000, Then Falls / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average broke 10,000  
ever so briefly Tuesday, a milestone credited to a record eight 
years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in high technology and 
investor enchantment with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's best-known index burst into five figures 20  
minutes into the trading day, stayed there for just under a minute, 
and never went past 10,001.78. But that was enough to make traders 
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange cheer, wave their hands 
and toss hand-ripped confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	As often happens after such achievements, sellers took over, and  
the index of 30 blue chip stocks ended the day down 28.30 at 
9,930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts were pleased with the breakthrough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a number, but hitting 10,000 says to me it's  
continued confirmation that the bull market is alive and well,'' 
said Alfred E. Goldman of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 8 percent this year on top of an unprecedented  
four straight years of double-digit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The index was pushed over the top by everyday events of the  
business world that often prompt buying -- announcements this week 
of corporate mergers and the promise of healthy earnings reports 
from big companies such as Union Carbide. But these were just the 
immediate causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow 10,000 rocket was launched early in the decade, fueled  
by a growing economy combined with low inflation and interest rates 
that kept consumers spending and corporate profits rising. The rise 
of personal computers and technology improved Corporate America's 
productivity even as manufacturing jobs steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got an additional boost in the past year through an  
explosion of enthusiasm for the Internet as hundreds of companies 
to put a ``.com'' after their names, expecting a big payoff by 
selling everything from Furby dolls to stocks on the World Wide 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, for instance, went from $16 a year ago to $105  
now. Yahoo, the online directory service, has gone from $21 to 
$175. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic troubles in Russia, Asia and Latin America  
threatened several times over the past two years to halt the Dow's 
advance. The Dow fell below 7,500 as recently as Oct. 8, but then 
stocks rebounded on a series of three interest rate cuts by the 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent perception that the troubled foreign economies were  
beginning to rebound also allowed the Dow to resume its climb. 
</P>
<P>
	To most market analysts, the Dow's ascension to 10,000 is more  
of a curiosity or media event. 
</P>

	``The 10,000 mark is absolutely a psychological milestone,''  
said Jan Holman, vice president of investment services at American 
Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. ``But for most 
investors, it's just another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual investors were underwhelmed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't affect the long-term view,'' said Mark Harchelroad,  
interviewed outside a Fidelity Investments office in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dow at 10,000 inevitably raises questions of what happens  
next. 
</P>
<P>
	One cause for concern is the fact that the market's recent gains  
have been concentrated in a few business sectors, most notably 
Internet and high-tech stocks. That leaves many other stocks 
lagging behind, particularly those of smaller and younger 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be resigned that this is going to be a very  
focused advance. Clipping 10,000 is not going to change that,'' 
said Eugene Peroni at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing in favor of even higher stock prices is the ever-growing  
stock ownership of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 43 percent of U.S. households now own stock or mutual  
funds and millions believe that the stock market, despite 
occasional downturns, is the best place to earn money for 
retirement, college and other needs. Banks cannot match the 
double-digit returns stocks have provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some fear that the fascination with the Internet that has  
driven the market's recent gains could also be its undoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential  
Securities, disagreed. ``It's a real industry,'' he said. ``They're 
not making Hula Hoops. Some of these companies will survive, but 
not all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that online traders now account for more than  
14 percent of all stock trades, and many were just toddlers during 
the last big bear market of the 1970s. Some market pros fear these 
investors will click their way out of the market fast if they see 
signs of a decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pros point out that the investing public today is much  
more savvy, thanks in part to an abundance of financial news 
available instantly on cable TV and easy access on the Internet to 
sophisticated stock research once available only to professional 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't scare me,'' Lorraine Baran, a New York computer  
consultant, said of the possibility of another Dow plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it took a dip, I'd probably buy more.''

minutes into the day, traded as high as 10,001.78, then fell back 
within a minute and closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30. 
</P>
<P>
	To people who follow the stock market closely, the Dow's  
achievement wasn't a one-day event -- it was just part of a long 
Wall Street rally fed by a strong U.S. economy, low interest rates 
and the world's growing fascination with high technology, 
particularly the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenon that's been going on for three years,''  
said Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the market does in the next few days, analysts  
are looking for the Dow ultimately to continue its advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take the long-term perspective, the average annual  
equity returns have been around 10 percent. If the Dow merely does 
what it's been doing, you'll have a Dow 20,000 in 10 years,'' said 
Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is already up 8 percent so far this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow 10,000 rocket was launched early in the decade -- when  
the index hadn't even reached 3,000 yet -- as the United States 
recovered from the 1990-91 recession. The growing economy, low 
interest rates and low inflation have kept consumers spending and 
corporate profits rising. High technology has become part of the 
average American's life, at home as well as on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market found particular strength in the past year  
through an explosion of enthusiasm for the Internet -- hundreds of 
companies created Web sites to sell themselves and their products. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic troubles in Russia, Asia and Latin America have  
threatened several times to halt the Dow's advance. The blue chips 
dropped below 7,500 on Oct. 8, but stocks rebounded on a series of 
three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent perception that the troubled foreign economies were  
beginning to rebound has also allowed the Dow to resume its climb. 
</P>
<P>
	To most market analysts, the Dow's ascension to 10,000 is more  
of a curiosity or media event. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 10,000 mark is absolutely a psychological milestone,''  
said Jan Holman, vice president of investment services at American 
Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. ``But for most 
investors, it's just another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual investors shrugged off the event.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought it would get there. The records are made to  
be broken,'' said Kathleen Daly, interviewed outside a Fidelity 
Investments office in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, one cause for concern is the fact that the  
market's recent gains have been concentrated in a few business 
sectors, most notably Internet and high-tech stocks. That leaves 
many other stocks lagging behind, particularly those of smaller and 
younger businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clipping 10,000 is not going to change that,'' said analyst  
Eugene Peroni at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing in favor of even higher stock prices is the ever-growing  
stock ownership of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 43 percent of U.S. households now own stock or mutual  
funds and millions believe that the stock market, despite 
occasional downturns, is the best place to earn money for 
retirement, college and other needs. Banks paying in the 
neighborhood of 5 percent on certificates of deposit cannot match 
the double-digit returns stocks have provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some fear that the fascination for the Internet that has  
driven the market's recent gains could also be its undoing. Online 
traders now account for more than 14 percent of all stock trades 
and many were just toddlers during the last big bear market of the 
1970s. Some market pros fear these investors will click their way 
out of the market fast if they see signs of a decline. 
</P>
<P>
	But the investing public today is much more savvy than in the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schwab, interviewed outside the Fidelity office in  
Manhattan, is already expecting a selloff at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there will be another downturn, but it will be  
short.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached Over Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and Senate  
Democrats abandoned their opposition to a popular missile-defense 
bill Tuesday, agreeing to a compromise with Republicans designed to 
keep the system from interfering with arms-control efforts with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99-0 acceptance of a proposal by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La.,  
and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, all but assured passage in the Senate 
of the overall measure that declares as U.S. policy deployment of a 
ballistic-missile defense as soon as ``technologically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote is expected Wednesday on the overall bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had blocked the measure from coming to the floor for  
years, and until Tuesday the Clinton administration had threatened 
a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But the legislation was gaining considerable bipartisan support  
in the aftermath of ballistic missile tests by North Korea and Iran 
and the disclosure that China had obtained technology from a U.S. 
nuclear laboratory that could have enabled it to build smaller, 
more efficient nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill recognizes the threat is real,'' Landrieu told the  
Senate. ``It is clear to many of us that this threat is more real 
than ever before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Collina, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes  
the legislation, called the compromise ``sort of vacuous policy'' 
that he said will do little except annoy China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are running scared on this,'' he said. ``The  
Republicans have had this issue for years. Now the threat has 
appeared and the Democrats were caught flat-footed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Landrieu-Snowe amendment still commits the United States to  
a missile-defense system while recognizing the importance to 
negotiate with Moscow on reducing nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was embraced by both Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the chief  
sponsor of the overall legislation, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., 
who had been its chief opponent. ``It strengthens the bill,'' 
Cochran said. ``Defenses and offensive reductions are not 
incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also adopted, 99-0, an amendment by Cochran and Sen.  
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., that assures that the money to be spent on a 
missile-defense system would be determined each year, through 
normal congressional appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two amendments ``improve the bill to the point where that  
makes it possible for us to accept it,'' Bob Bell, a national 
security official at the White House, said in an interview. ``The 
veto threat is withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration hoped the House would adopt similar  
language Thursday when it takes up its version of the missile 
defense legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican supporters cited reports of Chinese espionage at a  
U.S. weapons laboratory to buttress their case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the People's Republic of China has more than a dozen  
missiles aimed at American cities,'' said Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-La. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's nuclear espionage and the administration's lackluster  
response is bad enough,'' Lott added. He said when combined with 
earlier satellite transfers to China ``it raises very serious 
questions not only about this administration's handling of China 
policy, but more broadly about whether it can be trusted to manage 
the nation's security affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott called the lack of a national missile defense the nation's  
``Achilles' heel'' and said he detected ``movement in the Senate'' 
to support the idea of building a defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the Los Alamos disclosures,  
along with U.S. satellite technology exports to China, are 
``chilling, alarming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not only a serious breach in our national security but  
a quantum leap in the ability of the Chinese government to not only 
threaten the security of their neighbors in Asia but to ultimately 
threaten the security of American cities,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota accused  
Senate Republicans of overplaying the China card. ``It's 
partisanship,'' Daschle told reporters. ``Nobody's going to give 
away anything (to China), I assure you.''

<HEADLINE>  Dow Hits 10,000, Then Falls / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average broke 10,000  
ever so briefly Tuesday, a milestone credited to a record eight 
years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in high technology and 
investor enchantment with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's best-known index burst into five figures 20  
minutes into the trading day, stayed there for just under a minute, 
and never went past 10,001.78. But that was enough to make traders 
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange cheer, wave their hands 
and toss hand-ripped confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	As often happens after such achievements, sellers took over, and  
the index of 30 blue chip stocks ended the day down 28.30 at 
9,930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts were pleased with the breakthrough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a number, but hitting 10,000 says to me it's  
continued confirmation that the bull market is alive and well,'' 
said Alfred E. Goldman of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 8 percent this year on top of an unprecedented  
four straight years of double-digit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The index was pushed over the top by everyday events of the  
business world that often prompt buying -- announcements this week 
of corporate mergers and the promise of healthy earnings reports 
from big companies such as Union Carbide. But these were just the 
immediate causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow 10,000 rocket was launched early in the decade, fueled  
by a growing economy combined with low inflation and interest rates 
that kept consumers spending and corporate profits rising. The rise 
of personal computers and technology improved Corporate America's 
productivity even as manufacturing jobs steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got an additional boost in the past year through an  
explosion of enthusiasm for the Internet as hundreds of companies 
to put a ``.com'' after their names, expecting a big payoff by 
selling everything from Furby dolls to stocks on the World Wide 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, for instance, went from $16 a year ago to $105  
now. Yahoo, the online directory service, has gone from $21 to 
$175. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic troubles in Russia, Asia and Latin America  
threatened several times over the past two years to halt the Dow's 
advance. The Dow fell below 7,500 as recently as Oct. 8, but then 
stocks rebounded on a series of three interest rate cuts by the 
Federal Reserve.

</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't affect the long-term view,'' said Mark Harchelroad,

<HEADLINE> Giants Cut Pitcher Trevor Wilson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Trevor Wilson was given his outright  
release by the San Francisco Giants today. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander, who pitched in 15 games with the Anaheim Angels  
last year, was trying to win a job as the Giants' fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I was surprised,'' said Wilson. ``I wanted to retire in  
San Fran man. It's never been easy and it won't be easy somewhere 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who compiled a 41-46 record with the Giants between  
1988-1995, allowed seven runs in 3 1/3 innings on Sunday, and had a 
spring ERA of 12.86. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can pitch,'' Wilson said. ``But that's the way the  
business works. This gives me an opportunity to hopefully find a 
job somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson missed three seasons, 1994, 1996 and 1997 to injuries and  
had been on the disabled list eight separate times. He was signed 
by the Giants as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was 0-0 with an ERA of 3.52 with the Angels last year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Get Hot Under Collar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An Olympic leader under  
investigation in the Salt Lake bribery case struck a martial-arts 
pose amid a shouting match with the IOC's top administrator 
Tuesday, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, a South Korean member of the International Olympic  
Committee, and IOC director general Francois Carrard exchanged 
heated words on a terrace during a break in a board meeting, 
according to witnesses who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim also had a confrontation with Dick Pound, a vice president  
and leader of the internal investigation of the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. Kim has received a severe warning in the inquiry 
and could face expulsion as the probe continues. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the witnesses said, Kim, the president of the  
International Taekwondo Federation, crouched in a Taekwondo stance, 
sending Carrard running from the terrace at Chateau de Vidy 
yelling, ``I quit!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, a former swimmer from Canada, then stepped toward Kim  
saying, ``Calm down. Calm down,'' according to the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim finally relaxed and the four men later met with IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, according to Olympic sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound and Carrard also received a letter of apology from Kim,  
said the sources, who also spoke on the condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	No blows were exchanged during the incident outside the IOC's  
lakefront headquarters, which was seen by a small group including 
members of the IOC's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, the new head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
had just finished his first meeting with the executive board and 
was on the large terrace when the blowup occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he heard some ``elevated voices'' as he was talking  
with another group, but said he did not see Kim, Carrard or Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound has said he suspects there is evidence to prove whether  
Kim knew a telecommunications job in Utah had been underwritten by 
Salt Lake Olympic bidders, and that if such evidence was found, Kim 
could be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, one of international sports' most powerful men, says he is  
innocent of any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Get QB Mitchell From Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens finally got the  
quarterback they coveted Tuesday, obtaining Scott Mitchell from the 
Detroit Lions for two draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens also were expected to trade Jim Harbaugh to the San  
Diego Chargers, clearing the way for Mitchell to become the Ravens' 
third opening-day quarterback in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard, in Phoenix for the NFL  
owners meetings, said the Harbaugh deal could be finished by 
Wednesday. It is contingent upon the quarterback reworking his 
deal. Harbaugh's agent, Steve Forest, said a deal was ``pretty 
imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh is under contract for $3.25 million for 1999, but his  
deal must be reworked so it can fit under San Diego's salary cap. A 
source familiar with the negotiations said Harbaugh would be given 
a two-year contract worth approximately $2.75 million, which 
includes a minimal signing bonus, plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard also said the Chargers are getting close to a deal with  
wide receiver Jeff Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell cost Baltimore a third-round draft choice this year and  
a conditional fifth-round selection in 2000. The latter pick will 
be upgraded to a fourth-rounder if Mitchell appears in half the 
Ravens' offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who fell out of favor with the Lions last season after  
a four-year run as a starter, signed a one-year deal with Baltimore 
for a reported $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have been trying for weeks to land the 6-foot-6  
Mitchell. The Lions were holding out for Baltimore's second-round 
pick in April, but Ravens director of player personnel Ozzie 
Newsome repeatedly refused the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell broke into the NFL in 1990 with the Miami Dolphins but  
threw only eight passes in his first two seasons. In 1993, he was 
an effective replacement for injured Dan Marino and subsequently 
signed as a free agent with Detroit in March 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell immediately stepped into the starting job and held it  
until last year. Despite ranking in the top three in Lions' history 
in touchdown passes, completions and passing yards, Mitchell was 
benched by coach Bobby Ross two weeks into the season and replaced 
by Charlie Batch. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't deter the Ravens' interest in Mitchell, whose 32 TD  
passes in 1995 is a Lions record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott is a very capable quarterback who has plenty of life in  
the NFL,'' said Baltimore coach Brian Billick, who last year turned 
aging quarterback Randall Cunningham into a star with the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be self-serving, but I've had plenty of success with  
players whom others said no longer have it or couldn't do it in the 
first place,'' added Billick, who also is apparently interested in 
talking to Warren Moon about backing up Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens hope Mitchell can take the struggling franchise to  
the playoffs for the first time since owner Art Modell moved the 
team from Cleveland after the 1995 season. Vinny Testaverde failed 
to produce a winning season in 1996 and 1997, and Harbaugh battled 
injuries and ineffectiveness last year when Baltimore struggled to 
a 6-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh finished with only 12 touchdown passes and 11  
interceptions.

<HEADLINE> NFL Expands to L.A. Tentatively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Los Angeles was awarded the NFL's 32nd franchise  
over Houston on Tuesday, providing it can come up with a viable 
stadium plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, Houston will get the franchise, which the league hopes  
can begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've worked extremely hard to continue the process with our  
first focus on Los Angeles,'' commissioner Paul Tagliabue said 
after the 29-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to determine whether the conditions can be met there --  
to have expansion the way we'd like to have it with a facility we'd 
like to have. If it can't, the expansion committee would recommend 
an expansion team be located in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has percolated for four years, since the Raiders went  
back to Oakland and the Rams relocated to St. Louis after the 1994 
season. In 1996, the Oilers moved from Houston to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue has always been committed to returning to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
	But the problem has been made more difficult by the differences  
in the Houston and Los Angeles plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston came in with an owner that most of the current owners  
liked, Bob McNair, a stadium plan that met their standards and 
financing in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, on the other hand, had two competing groups and two  
stadium sites, one in Carson, 18 miles south of Los Angeles, and 
the renovated Los Angeles Coliseum. The NFL also is worried about 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	So within the next few weeks, the stadium committee will visit  
both Los Angeles sites in hopes it can determine quickly which is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every ownership group and political advisors have understood  
the economics of building a stadium,'' said Carolina owner Jerry 
Richardson, chairman of the league's stadium committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to figure out a way to do that and we have a very  
short window. The site is something we must address pretty 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it came down to the size of the television market --  
Los Angeles, with 5.5 million TV homes, and Houston with 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on television contracts and similar factors, the  
league's first priority should be the re-establishment of a 
successful NFL franchise in the great Los Angeles market,'' the 
resolution approved by the owners said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's changed?'' asked Al Davis, who has moved the Raiders  
north and south in California. ``They couldn't get their act 
together in four years. Why should they be able to do it in six 
months?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Buffalo's Ralph Wilson were the only owners to vote  
against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski and Michael Ovitz, who head the two groups, said they  
were pleased by the decision and expected to have their plans ready 
before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't comment on how the ownership would be decided  
and Richardson suggested that other owners for Los Angeles might 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we're together. we have a venue that is great, an  
ownership team that brings a lot to the table,'' Roski said. ``We 
feel we've gotten it together in the last 2 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not be more pleased,'' Ovitz said. ``At this point,  
it's Los Angeles' to lose. We will all continue to do our best to 
make it happen. I believe the team will be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, meanwhile, said he was happy no final decision had been  
made. He also didn't rule out seeking to purchase an existing 
franchise to move to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a feeling that Los Angeles was an advantageous  
location they couldn't ignore,'' he said. ``But they have six 
months. It's better than having an open-ended situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Declined to take action on the sale of the Washington Redskins  
to Howard and Edward Milstein, pending a full report from the 
league's finance committee. Tagliabue said he expects that report 
on Wednesday and that a vote on approving the $800 million sale 
should take place later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Confirmed the one-year suspension and $1 million fine for San  
Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo for his part in a Louisiana 
gambling scandal. Tagliabue said that if DeBartolo did not abide by 
all the conditions of the suspension that the fine would escalate 
to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Voted to keep the Thanksgiving Day games in Detroit and  
Dallas, turning down a motion by Kansas City and New Orleans to 
rotate the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners said we shouldn't tamper with a great tradition,''  
said William Clay Ford Jr. of the Lions, who have been host of a 
Thanksgiving game since 1934.

<HEADLINE> NBC Wins Week's Nielsens Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC won last week's Nielsen Media Research derby  
by being the only major network to maintain its season average 
during a week where the prime-time schedules were clogged with 
reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had a 9.0 rating and 15 share for the week, Nielsen said  
Tuesday. CBS was second with an 8.6 rating and 14 share, ABC had a 
7.8 rating and 13 share and Fox had a 6.2 rating and 10 share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' with one of the relatively few original series  
episodes to air last week, was the most-watched show. NBC's foray 
into reality television, ``World's Most Amazing Videos,'' finished 
a solid 28th for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Season leader CBS slipped to second place for the week, largely  
because its prime-time schedule was pre-empted by college 
basketball on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sacrifice the network was willing to make. CBS had its  
second-best week of the season among young men, a demographic it 
covets because of its popularity with advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three newsmagazines finished among the week's top 10 shows,  
which generally happens when there are a lot of reruns. In a battle 
of news stars, an ABC John Stossel special, ``Teens: What Makes 
Them Tick,'' narrowly outrated NBC's Geraldo Rivera report, ``Back 
to Bedlam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Strange World,'' an ``X-Files''-inspired replacement  
series for ``NYPD Blue,'' had poor ratings in its premiere, 
finishing a distant 89th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another show on the danger list: NBC's sitcom ``Caroline in the  
City,'' which finished 79th for the week despite airing an original 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks showed the reruns because it's the lull after a  
``sweeps'' month, when ratings are watched closely to set 
advertising rates. Among the developing networks last week, the WB 
had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, UPN had a 2.0 rating and 3 share, and 
Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with an 8.5  
rating and a 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with 
an 8.3 and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.5; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.3; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: 
Seasons of Love, Part 2,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' 
NBC, 12.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.9; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Oppose Use of Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Ask the Colorado Rockies' medical staff for  
its opinion about the muscle-building supplement androstenedione, 
and the answer is: Don't use it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rockies' trainers aren't snooping around lockers to find  
out who is ingesting the controversial substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Andro became a hot topic last season when Mark McGwire admitted  
using it during his 70-homer season. At least one Rockies player, 
Dante Bichette, acknowledged using the substance, too, but has 
since insisted he quit taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has commissioned a Harvard study to determine whether  
androstenedione raises testosterone levels. Further studies might 
be necessary to determine whether andro helps build muscle mass and 
whether it enhances performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The substance is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and  
the men's and women's tennis tours. Baseball, however, wants 
stronger proof before agreeing to a ban, and the players' 
association is philosophically opposed to random testing for any 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We advise against it as a medical team,'' Rockies head trainer  
Tom Probst said Tuesday. ``We're leery about any substance that 
hasn't had enough studies to determine its long-term effects. In 10 
years we may find out that it's fine, or we may find out that it's 
a cancer agent. But there are too many question marks right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're advising against it not because we know so much about it  
but because we don't know anything about it. We need solid medical 
research on andro and creatine substances to determine if they have 
detrimental long-term effects. But it's still a player's choice to 
take it or not take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many Rockies players are taking andro or creatine,  
Probst said, ``To tell you the truth, I really have no idea. That's 
their business and I stay out of it. I don't walk around being a 
detective to see who's on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette said he started taking andro last season but quit  
``when all that negativity came out with McGwire. It got a lot of 
bad press, and I didn't want people to judge me by that. Andro is 
produced in the body naturally, so it's not a synthetic steroid. 
But a lot of people have taken it that way, like it is a steroid 
and is illegal. So I just decided not to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor influenced Bichette to stop using andro.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I don't think it helped me a bit,'' he said.  
``Creatine was the one that really worked for me. But I haven't 
taken anything, not even vitamins, since last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette defended McGwire, saying, ``It didn't help me that  
much, and I guarantee you Mark would say the same thing. He was 
just trying it out because it was the first year it was available. 
He's been hitting home runs forever.''

<HEADLINE> Court Orders MOMA To Turn Art Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two paintings on loan to the Museum of Modern  
Art borrowed from an Austrian foundation must be handed over to a 
grand jury investigating whether the works were stolen by Nazis 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's unanimous ruling by the state Supreme Court's  
Appellate Division reversed a lower court ruling in May that said 
the museum did not have to obey a grand jury subpoena and could 
return the two paintings to Vienna, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say the paintings were stolen from Jewish owners  
at the start of World War II and want them to remain here until 
ownership is sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings, ``Dead City III'' and ``Portrait of Wally'' by  
Austrian Egon Schiele, are worth about $2 million each. They were 
on loan from the Leopold Foundation for a three-month exhibit that 
ended in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan district attorney's office obtained a subpoena  
demanding the paintings be turned over to a grand jury for 
inspection after heirs to the owners complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The heirs said ``Portrait of Wally'' was stolen from Lea Jaray  
Bondi as she fled her home and that ``Dead City III'' was stolen 
from Fritz Grunbaum before his death in the Dachau concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum moved to quash the subpoena, citing a state law that  
bars ``any kind of seizure'' of art loaned to New York 
institutions. An acting State Supreme Court justice granted the 
motion, but the appeals court said the subpoena was not authorizing 
a ``seizure.'' Rather, the paintings were being brought before the 
court as physical evidence.

<HEADLINE>  Ecuador Bus, Taxi Drivers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Angry bus drivers joined striking taxi  
drivers Tuesday, barricading streets and bringing traffic to a 
standstill across Ecuador in an effort to force the government to 
revoke a gas price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad last week announced a harsh austerity  
package, proposing spending cuts, price hikes and tax increases he 
says are needed to rescue this indebted Andean nation from its 
worst economic crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Commuters waited fruitlessly at bus stops Tuesday while others  
crossed barricades of yellow taxis, burning tires and club-wielding 
drivers to get to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers took some stranded commuters to work in packed, green  
military trucks, but there were only enough trucks to help a small 
number of those stranded. Many factories reported 50 percent of 
workers didn't make it in. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, empowered by a 60-day state of emergency, says  
it will clear the barricades. Soldiers armed with automatic weapons 
patrolled the streets of major cities on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government representatives met with strike leaders and  
opposition politicians on Monday, but failed to find a solution to 
the standoff. Spokesmen said they would continue meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the reforms -- especially tax increases and laws to speed  
up privatizations -- must be approved by Congress, where Mahuad's 
centrist Popular Democracy Party lacks a majority. Congress has 30 
days to rule on the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	But hopes of passing the reforms dimmed when the powerful

<HEADLINE>  Ecuador Bus, Taxi Drivers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Angry bus drivers joined striking taxi  
drivers Tuesday, barricading streets and bringing traffic to a 
standstill across Ecuador in an effort to force the government to 
revoke a gas price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad last week announced a harsh austerity  
package, proposing spending cuts, price hikes and tax increases he 
says are needed to rescue this indebted Andean nation from its 
worst economic crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Commuters waited fruitlessly at bus stops Tuesday while others  
crossed barricades of yellow taxis, burning tires and club-wielding 
drivers to get to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers took some stranded commuters to work in packed, green  
military trucks, but there were only enough trucks to help a small 
number of those stranded. Many factories reported 50 percent of 
workers didn't make it in. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, empowered by a 60-day state of emergency, says  
it will clear the barricades. Soldiers armed with automatic weapons 
patrolled the streets of major cities on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government representatives met with strike leaders and  
opposition politicians on Monday, but failed to find a solution to 
the standoff. Spokesmen said they would continue meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the reforms -- especially tax increases and laws to speed  
up privatizations -- must be approved by Congress, where Mahuad's 
centrist Popular Democracy Party lacks a majority. Congress has 30 
days to rule on the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	But hopes of passing the reforms dimmed when the powerful  
conservative Social Christian Party, which had supported Mahuad on 
past measures, assailed the reforms as ``inhuman'' and vowed to 
block the tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis in Ecuador, a South American nation of 12

<HEADLINE> British Boxing Judge Admits Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The judge who became the most unpopular man in  
British sports by scoring the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight 
a draw would like to handle the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not counting on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'd definitely do it,'' Larry O'Connell said Tuesday.  
``But I don't think they'd want me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell admits being surprised that his scorecard showed a  
draw for Saturday night's heavyweight title bout at Madison Square 
Garden fight. However, he ruled out any error in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a result widely condemned on both sides of the Atlantic,  
another judge called the fight for Lewis, the WBC champion, and the 
other gave it to Holyfield, WBA-IBF champion. The draw meant both 
fighters kept their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell, a 60-year-old British judge, has faced heavy  
criticism since returning from New York. He says he understands the 
response but insists he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot closer than it might have appeared,'' he said by  
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been answering questions since the fight ended and I've  
been taken out of context and misquoted about making mistakes. But 
I've also had a lot of support from friends and people who've 
reviewed the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell says such issues as nationalism do not affect his  
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go to judge a fight I only see two pairs of shorts, not  
a British boxer and an American,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People maybe expected me to favor Lewis because I'm British  
but you can't play it like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, you might get a gut feeling about how the fight is going,  
but you have to ignore it. What you see, round by round, ends up on 
the scorecard. You just have to focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``You keep your score for each round. You can't add up the  
totals -- that's unethical -- so I didn't know what my final score 
was until I heard it read out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Saturday's fight, O'Connell said he thinks Lewis would  
win a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Holyfield doesn't want a rematch then he should retire.  
He's got nothing else to fight for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell, who has spent 23 years as a judge or referee, was  
appointed by the WBC for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``(WBC) appointed me so they obviously think I must have  
something going for me,'' he said. ``It just happened to be the 
biggest fight in years and I happen to be caught in the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sulaiman, the head of the WBC, called O'Connell a man of  
``unquestionable integrity and competence and a proven 
impartiality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sulaiman said Tuesday from the organization's  
headquarters in Mexico City that Lewis was ``robbed'' and is the 
deserving champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to think that image of impartiality was  
unconsciously assumed by Mr. O'Connell, but he definitely exceeded 
it,'' Sulaiman said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell said he didn't think the bout was ``the greatest fight  
on God's earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I think Lennox could have avoided all this  
controversy for us if he'd boxed for an opportunity instead of 
waiting for a break,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Lewis) could have done it in the fifth round but he waited  
for about 20 seconds when maybe he should have been more 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell added that he felt sorry for both Lewis and the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox has done nothing wrong -- he's never missed a  
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called Lewis an example of ``what is right about sport.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Since the fight he's been a real sportsman,'' he said. ``I  
hope he gets another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell said any insinuation about a fix was ``total  
nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he couldn't comment on U.S. judge Eugenia Williams  
scoring the bout for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not criticizing her. ... She's got her view and that's how  
she scored the fight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other judge, Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa, scored  
the fight for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's even more experienced than me,'' O'Connell said. ``All of  
the officials have a good record in boxing.''

<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Rescue crews climbed through a twisted,  
charred rail car today, with hopes fading of finding survivors 
after Amtrak's City of New Orleans struck a truck and derailed, 
killing at least 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've removed 12 bodies,'' Capt. Ed St. Louis of the  
Bourbonnais Fire Protection District said this morning. ``We 
believe there to be six to eight more people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers were focusing their search in one of the sleeper cars,  
said St. Louis, adding that Amtrak officials were still trying to 
determine if there were 214 people on the train or 216. Eighteen 
crew members were on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,''  
said Bourbonnais Fire Chief Mike Harshbarger. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis said 196 survivors from the train were accounted-for  
at hospitals or at a local school where passengers were cared for 
by the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 were injured enough to be taken to hospitals and  
at least 11 were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans, careened off the  
tracks shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday after it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars at a crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to go to sleep. Then all of the sudden everything  
just started crashing and catching on fire and people hollering and 
running. It was awful,'' said Blanche Jones, a passenger from 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We was trying to get out. We couldn't get out, couldn't find a  
way out. That was the most devastating thing of all,'' Jones said 
as she limped out of a school that served as a temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the grace of God, I just went down a stairway and found a  
way to get out and let everybody know how to get out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was leaving a nearby Birmingham Steel Co. facility.  
</P>
<P>
	Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National Transportation  
Safety Board team at the scene, said today that the driver told 
authorities he didn't see the train or flashing warning lights 
until he had alreadly started driving across the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not released, was unable to get entirely  
across in time, Gura said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very sad and upset. He felt he did whatever he thought he  
could do to clear the train track but he didn't do it,'' Gura said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speed limit on that section of track is 79 mph, but the  
precise speed of the train at the time was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The windows rattled,'' said Don O'Dell, who lives a block away  
from the scene and was watching TV when he heard the crash. ``We 
got up and looked around to see what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gura said a twisted pile of metal wreckage at the crash site  
contained two locomotives and six train cars. One engine was split 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members clambered atop overturned cars searching through an  
eerie, smoky haze. Firefighters doused flames on one of the engines 
and another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the rescuers peeled off their coats for the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said 101 people were taken to hospitals in nearby  
Kankakee. One was airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in suburban 
Chicago. Of the injured, 11 were listed in critical condition and 
at least 19 in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured included a person with an amputated foot, another  
with head wounds and others with severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst accident in Amtrak's 27-year history occurred on Sept.  
22, 1993, when 42 passengers and five crew members died in accident 
near Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	A towboat pilot became disoriented in a dense fog and plowed a  
barge into a railroad bridge. Minutes later, the Sunset Limited, 
with 210 passengers aboard, hit the bent tracks and plunged into 
the bayou. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst previous single Amtrak crash killed 16 people in  
January 1987 in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Japan Airlines To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan Airlines will cut its ground work force by 10  
percent and nearly halve the number of its directors in an effort 
to reduce its debt and improve profitability, the company said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, Japan's largest, will slash 3,600 on-the-ground  
jobs by the fiscal year ending March 2002 and reduce the number of 
its directors to 15 from the current 28 this year, the company said 
in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring aims to cut debt by about $850 million to $12  
billion, and to achieve an annual parent pretax profit of $255 
million by March 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	JAL also said it will reorganize the operations of some of its  
flight units, defer deliveries of 12 new airplanes and retire three 
fleets of aircraft ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	JAL President Isao Kaneko told reporters the company is likely  
to achieve its targets of pretax profit of $136 million and a 
profit of $85 million for this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier suffered a net loss of 94.2 billion yen (dlrs 799  
million) in fiscal 1997.

<HEADLINE> Torre To Have Surgery in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A physician considered a pioneer in the  
detection and treatment of prostate cancer will perform surgery 
Thursday on New York Yankees manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Catalona of St. Louis will perform the operation at  
Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Torre's prostate cancer was disclosed last 
week. He has taken leave from the world champions until he 
recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes-Jewish spokeswoman Kim Kitson said Catalona does similar  
prostate surgery 5-7 times a week at the hospital. The Yankees have 
seen his work before -- Catalona performed successful prostate 
cancer surgery on then-general manager Bob Watson in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in  
American men and the second deadliest. The prostate gland, about 
the size of a small chestnut, is in the male pelvic area. 
</P>
<P>
	Men 50 and older are most at risk. Torre is 58.  
</P>
<P>
	Catalona developed the blood test used to help detect prostate  
cancer in men in 1989. He also led a team that developed a new test 
for the cancer, called ``free PSA test,'' recently approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration. Researchers say the new test could 
reduce the need for biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona also is a pioneer in the development of nerve-sparing  
radical prostatectomy, a procedure to remove the cancerous prostate 
gland while minimizing damage to surrounding nerves and tissues. He 
has trained other surgeons in the procedure, making the hospital 
one of the leading centers in the country for prostate cancer 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has strong ties to St. Louis. He played for the Cardinals  
from 1969-74. He was an all-star each year from 1969-73 and won the 
1971 Most Valuable Player award with a .363 average and 137 RBIs, 
both tops in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre also managed the Cardinals, replacing Whitey Herzog in  
1990. He was fired during the 1995 season. He earlier managed the 
Atlanta Braves and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre spoke about the cancer publicly for the first time Monday,  
when he met with the Yankees at their spring training camp in 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding upbeat and confident, he said doctors believe they  
detected the cancer early. He expects to be in the hospital for 
three or four days after the surgery. He has not decided where he 
will recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre gave no timetable for his return to the bench.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure when I come back, I'm strong enough to  
stay back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Poised To OK Missile Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic opponents of a bill to commit the  
United States to a national missile defense system claim it could 
undermine delicate efforts to reduce the world's arsenal of nuclear 
warheads. But they were waging an uphill battle against popular 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill heading toward expected Senate passage, perhaps by the  
end of today, ``increases the odds that Russia will end the 
reduction of nuclear weapons,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``The 
stakes here are huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin contends the legislation violates terms of the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Soviet Union, as does the 
Clinton administration, which has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levin conceded that support for the measure in the  
Republican-led Senate appeared high. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, lawmakers introduced a bill that would allow Russia  
to back out of the START II arms-reduction treaty if the United 
States withdraws from the ABM treaty in order to begin a missile 
defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	After blocking missile defense legislation for the past several  
years, Levin and other Senate Democrats were putting up only token 
opposition this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of espionage by China at a U.S. nuclear weapons plant  
and recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran are helping build 
bipartisan support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, North Korea's Aug. 31 firing of a three-stage  
ballistic missile on a trajectory that passed over Japan and other 
recent developments ``have answered the question about the 
threat,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a sponsor of the legislation, 
told the Senate on Monday. ``The question today is whether we 
intend to defend ourselves against the threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, one of four Democratic  
co-sponsors, told the Senate, ``We should take action to protect 
ourselves against this threat. We would be derelict if we did 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee,  
said he has several potential amendments he may offer today, but he 
wanted to sound out other Democrats at a policy luncheon first. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin wants to preserve the administration's ability to decide  
by June 2000 whether to field such a system. He also wants to add 
language that would keep such a system from being deployed before 
working out ABM modifications with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	But he contends amendments dealing with the ABM treaty may not  
fare well. Many Senate Republicans, including Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., contend that the ABM treaty 
has outlived its usefulness since the Soviet Union no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, speaking in behalf of the overall bill on Monday, said  
the measure ``takes the first step toward protecting the American 
people from attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This policy is clear, if unequivocal. But it's only the first  
step,'' Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill calls for the United States to deploy a missile defense  
system capable of defending the 50 states against limited ballistic 
missile attack -- including an accidental firing by Russia or a 
deliberate firing by a rogue nation -- as soon as ``technologically 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton proposed an increase of $6.6 billion for a  
missile defense system over the next five years in the budget he 
submitted last month. But he put off a decision on whether to field 
such a system until June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is taking up its version of the bill, offered by Rep.  
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., on Thursday, after it holds a rare closed-door 
session to receive classified information on missile threats facing 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cochran and Weldon bills represent a blank check to  
defense contractors and a hollow promise to Americans rightly 
concerned about the potential of terrorist attack -- attacks that 
are much more likely to be delivered via a panel truck than a 
ballistic missile,'' John Isaacs, president of the Council for a 
Livable World, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is waging a lobbying campaign against both Senate and  
House versions of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Home Construction at 20-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new single-family homes rose  
to the highest level in more than two decades last month while 
applications for new building permits hit an all-time high as good 
economic times sustained a boom in the housing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that construction of  
single-family homes was up 1.1 percent in February to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units, the highest level since 
December 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, housing construction dipped a slight 0.6 percent in  
February as the rise in single-family housing starts was offset by 
a 6.3 percent drop in construction of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1.80 million annual rate for home and apartment  
construction was down only slightly from January's 12-year high of 
1.81 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of strength to come, applications for building permits  
for single-family homes rose 2.7 percent to an annual rate of 1.31 
million units, the highest level since the government began 
tracking housing starts in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom times in housing have been credited to the good economy  
with strong job growth and low inflation. The absence of 
inflationary pressures has allowed the Federal Reserve to keep 
interest rates low, which has translated into low mortgage rates 
for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, builders started 1.62 million units, an 11-year high.  
Economists are looking for a modest decline in that pace this year 
as the economy slows under the weight of the Asian currency crisis. 
But so far, there have been few signs of a slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The small 0.6 percent drop in overall housing starts in February  
was the first setback since a 2.6 percent decline in November. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the biggest gain was posted in the Northeast, where  
housing construction shot up 35.7 percent to an annual rate of 
209,000 units. Starts were also up in the Midwest, rising 8 percent 
to an annual rate of 340,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction suffered a setback in the West, dropping  
15.9 percent to an annual rate of 369,000 units and was down 2.5 
percent in the South to an annual rate of 872,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, applications for building permits dipped 1.8 percent to  
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.75 million units. The 2.7 
percent increase in applications for single-family homes was offset 
by a 13.3 percent dip in applications for apartment units.

<HEADLINE> Retired General in Sex Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A former deputy inspector general of  
the Army has agreed to a court-martial on charges he had improper 
sexual relationships with the wives of four officers and lied to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale waived his right to a hearing  
before a military jury that was to decide whether to convene 
court-martial proceedings, the Army announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Military prosecutors immediately filed revised charges and said  
the court-martial could begin as early as today, when the 
evidentiary hearing had been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale retired with honor in February 1998, after spending four  
months as a deputy inspector general at the Pentagon despite 
allegations of improprieties while he was a NATO commander in 
southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 53, faces seven counts of improper conduct and one of  
lying to investigators. He is accused of having the relationships 
with wives of subordinate officers in Turkey and in Virginia, 
Maine, Connecticut and Nevada between 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Hale surfaced last year when The  
Washington Times reported that a woman named Donnamaria Carpino had 
accused him of forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in 
Turkey while her husband, an Army colonel, was posted there. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped two charges of obstruction of justice. Hale  
initially faced 17 charges and, if convicted, 56 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible sentence under the revised charges was not made  
clear Monday, said Fort Lewis spokeswoman Mary Casad.

<HEADLINE> Housing Project Ruling Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A court order mandating public housing in  
predominantly white, affluent suburbs was overturned Tuesday by a 
federal appeals court that said ``a race-conscious remedy should be 
the remedy of last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in  
New Orleans vacated an order issued in 1995 by U.S. District Judge 
Jerry Buchmeyer and told him to come up with a more race-neutral 
solution to Dallas housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also continued an order blocking further construction  
of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was a victory for two homeowners' associations that  
had challenged the construction of two 40-unit projects adjacent to 
their upscale North Dallas neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	At least part of the disputed housing development -- a $4.9  
million project that houses 75 families -- has been occupied since 
last May. It was not clear how residents there would be affected by 
the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the city and the Dallas Housing Authority did not  
return phone calls Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lady Maria Theresa Armstrong, a reclusive  
aristocrat whose castle in northern England was once a stronghold 
of ancient Saxon kings, died Monday. She was in her 80s, but her 
date of birth was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Italian descent, she was the daughter of Count Fabrizio Enea  
Chiodelli-Manzoni and was married in 1947 to the 3rd Baron 
Armstrong, a descendant of a Victorian industrialist who built a 
business empire from armaments and engineering. The couple adopted 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	The baron died in 1987 and Lady Armstrong spent her latter years  
in the Norman keep of Bamburgh Castle, which sits atop a narrow 
outcrop of rock at the edge of the North Sea in Northumberland, 
northeast England.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Agustin Barrios Gomez, a diplomat and  
journalist who twice received his country's top prize for 
journalism, died Monday of a heart attack, the government news 
agency Notimex reported. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career at the daily Novedades in 1948. A year  
later, he began writing a full-page column ``Popoff Salad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios Gomez launched a daily radio commentary in 1950, then  
moved on to television programs -- winning awards in both media. 
</P>
<P>
	He won Mexico's National Prize for Journalism in 1974 and 1975,  
as well as honors from France, England and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, Barrios Gomez was named editorial coordinator of the  
Televisa network. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a diplomat between 1977 and 1987, serving as Mexico's  
ambassador to Canada, the Bahamas and Switzerland. In 1990-92, he 
was Mexico's consul-general in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Barrios Gomez began a weekly newspaper column. He  
returned to radio in 1993 with a program that was broadcast daily 
in Mexico and in the southern United States until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Patricia Segues, and a son.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Marvin G. Krieger, who served as one of the  
judges at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, died Friday from 
complications of heart surgery. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Krieger was likely best known for his role in the Nuremberg  
trials, in which he oversaw the prosecution of Nazi commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Krieger's Army Air Corps duties included  
both the legal wing and active combat. During the D-Day invasion, 
his unit dropped the first glider personnel into Normandy before 
the beachhead landed. He was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation 
and the Bronze Star for his role in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war he served with the Judge Advocate General in  
several capacities, including military prosecutor and defense 
attorney. He retired from the Army in 1971, and went on to teach 
law at the University of San Diego School of Law until 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.N. May Hear Women's Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Women may be able to turn to the United  
Nations with complaints of discrimination, sexual harassment and 
other violations of their rights as soon as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, a procedure has been drawn up to allow women  
to file complaints with the United Nations on violations of a 1979 
convention barring abuses against women. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major success for women around the world,'' Patricia  
Flor, chairperson of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, 
said Monday. ``They will finally be able to take their complaints 
and grievances to the U.N. in case they cannot get remedies within 
their own local judicial system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  
Discrimination Against Women requires that women have equal rights 
to work, pay, benefits and safe working conditions. It also 
prohibits discrimination against women in political activities and 
requires a minimum age for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the treaty -- signed by 163 member states -- did not give  
women any other recourse if violations were not addressed by their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of negotiations, the Commission on the Status  
of Women approved an optional protocol to the treaty on Friday 
making it possible for women, individually or in groups, to submit 
complaints about alleged violations of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The protocol also allows a committee to launch its own inquiries  
into allegations that a signatory country has violated treaty 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any recommendations by the committee are legally binding on  
signatories under international law, said Aloisia Woergetter of 
Austria, who chaired the working group that drafted the protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	But the committee has ``no way of policing what they are  
doing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the protocol was adopted by consensus in the commission,  
Flor said it should definitely be adopted by the General Assembly 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	To come into force, it must then be ratified by 10 countries.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do hope that this comes into being as quickly as possible --  
certainly early next year,'' said Angela King, director of the U.N. 
Division for the Advancement of Women. 
</P>
<P>
	When the treaty was being negotiated 22 years ago, there was  
opposition to a complaints procedure. But Woergetter said times 
have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody ... has understood that it is important to fully  
implement the convention. And I think there will be a lot of 
support,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Tape Part of McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
previously secret Whitewater testimony was shown in court today in 
the trial of one of the Clintons' former business partners, Susan 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was not present as the judge allowed Mrs. McDougal's  
defense attorney to preview 40 minutes of Mrs. Clinton's videotaped 
testimony in open court. U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. 
ruled earlier today that prosecutors could show the tape to the 
jury after the preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure of Mrs. Clinton's secret testimony in 1998 about  
Whitewater revives the troublesome political issue as she is 
considering a run for the U.S. Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape began with deputy prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing Jr.  
explaining the independent counsel's authority and asking Mrs. 
Clinton if she understood that her testimony could be used against 
her. The first lady, wearing a yellow suit, appeared serious, 
nodding and occasionally smiling slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In allowing the tape, the judge agreed with Kenneth Starr's  
prosecutors that McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos had opened the door 
to showing Mrs. Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos suggested Thursday in questioning FBI agent Mike Patkus  
that prosecutors had never bothered to ask questions of the first 
lady that the investigators now want Mrs. McDougal to answer about 
a disputed two-decade-old loan in the name of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett stressed that Mrs. Clinton's testimony  
is not being shown to prove the truth of what the first lady said, 
but simply to show that the prosecutors did ask her questions about 
a $27,600 loan in her husband's name and how the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton testified in a deposition in Washington on April  
25, 1998, two days after Mrs. McDougal appeared before the 
Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock and refused to answer 
questions. Mrs. Clinton's videotaped testimony was shown to the 
grand jury in Little Rock on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony has been secret for nearly a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers said two parts of Mrs. Clinton's  
testimony would be shown -- a section of about 35 minutes and 
another of about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In prosecution papers obtained by The Associated Press, Starr's  
office suggested Mrs. Clinton's testimony on Whitewater 
transactions made it more critical than ever for Mrs. McDougal to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The videotape will show that the first lady testified that she  
had no knowledge or information about either'' a $27,600 loan made 
in Bill Clinton's name in 1982 or a $5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. 
McDougal in 1983 and used to pay off part of the Clinton loan, said 
the prosecutors' papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at the 1996 trial of the McDougals and  
then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker that he never had taken out a loan at the 
McDougals' savings and loan. Prosecutors say the $27,600 loan in 
Clinton's name, which they discovered in 1996, was used to pay off 
a $30,000 Whitewater debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' court papers said the videotape will establish  
the importance of questions posed to and answered by Mrs. Clinton 
and prepared for'' Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to correct what they said was the false  
impression left by defense questioning of FBI agent Michael Patkus 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus said he didn't think Mrs. Clinton had been asked at her  
videotaped deposition of April 25, 1998, about the loan from James 
and Susan McDougal's savings and loan made out to Bill Clinton and 
the check on a James McDougal account, payable to Madison Guaranty, 
and bearing the notation ``payoff Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, is on trial on two counts of criminal  
contempt and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to 
answer grand jury questions Sept. 4, 1996, and April 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her ex-husband, James, who died in prison last year,  
were business partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater land 
development venture in Arkansas from 1979 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal claims she has no information pertinent to the  
case. She says she refused to answer questions because she believed 
Starr would twist her words around and use them to suit his own 
agenda or would charge her with perjury if he did not like what she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also alleges that Starr's deputies have used false  
information from her ex-husband and David Hale, a former judge and 
businessman, to pursue their investigation of her and the Clintons.

<HEADLINE> USOC Members Put Faith in IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Members of the U.S. Olympic  
Committee say they are confident the International Olympic 
Committee will take necessary action to prevent scandals that have 
caused sponsors to lose confidence and the bidding process to lose 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The 91-member IOC assembly begins a two-day meeting Wednesday in  
Switzerland to discuss reform and decide the fate of six members 
accused of receiving cash payments or other improper gifts during 
Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other members have and 10 have received warnings for their  
part in the $1.2 million vote-buying scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seeing the agenda for this meeting, I feel much more  
comfortable that they are prepared to take the steps that they need 
to take to reform the IOC so the movement will be stronger and 
business can go on,'' U.S. Olympic Committee executive director 
Dick Schultz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly is expected to appoint an independent ethics  
commission and a reform panel, including outside experts, to study 
long-term structural reforms. That could include term limits and 
democratic elections for IOC members and open financial books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously if they were not able to carry out what they've  
already indicated they were going to do, I think we would all be 
very disappointed,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz and USOC president Bill Hybl said they are hopeful the  
United States will have a representative on any ethics commission 
that is created. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would depend on the size of the committee and it also would  
depend on what they determine over the next two days in terms of 
what sort of commission they want,'' Hybl said. ``Will it be just 
IOC members, or will it really be independent and more broadly 
represented? That's what we have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the USOC Executive Committee unanimously approved  
former Olympic biathlete John Reuger as an ombudsman for athletes 
who have complaints against their governing body, other sports 
organizations or the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuger, who previously was chairman of the USOC athletes  
advisory council, was on the 1980 U.S. biathlon team. He was 
selected from 227 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that the athlete ombudsman will prove to be a valuable  
resource for America's athletes and will allow them to keep even 
more of their focus on training for the games that we all like to 
see them compete in,'' said Jeff Benz, a member of the USOC's 
athletes advisory council.

spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks didn't play in the Padres' game against  
the Giants at Scottsdale, but he will get his first start of the

</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* As usual, Brooks signed a lot of autographs.  
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``We've got some outfielders hurt, and with an  
off day Thursday, I want to give some guys Wednesday off, too,'' 
Bochy said. ``So this will be Garth's chance.''

<HEADLINE> Wounded Capitals Take Historic Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ODENTON, Md. (AP) -- Ron Wilson has tried everything.  
</P>
<P>
	He canceled a practice to take his players bowling. He took them  
to Las Vegas for a couple of days of gambling, a rodeo and a roller 
coaster ride. On the serious side, there have been long team 
meetings and extra film sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the coach who last year motivated the Washington Capitals to  
the best season in franchise history has this year seen his 
gimmicks produce little. The Capitals are on their way to becoming 
the first team in nearly 50 years to bounce from no playoffs to the 
Stanley Cup finals and back to no playoffs in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what I can do, when six, seven, eight, nine guys are  
missing, core people ...'' Wilson said. ``It's the first time I've 
ever been on a team where there isn't one guy who's going to be 
able to say he played in every game during the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a team ever had a right to claim injuries as an excuse, it's  
the Capitals. Now eight points out of the final playoff spot with 
15 games left, the defending Eastern Conference champions may have 
to settle for celebrating their 400th man-game lost because of 
injury this season when they play the Dallas Stars Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at 399 man-games, and we'll have a nice cake (Wednesday)  
night as we pass 400,'' said Wilson, who produced a cake when the 
team hit 300 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's total might not pass last season's club record of  
476, but there's been a big difference in who's been hurt and when. 
Adam Oates, Sergei Gonchar, Richard Zednik and Yogi Svejkovsky 
missed huge chunks early this season, leaving Peter Bondra as the 
only consistent offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just as the Caps got healthy and put together a six-game  
winning streak to get back into the race in February, the other end 
of the lineup got hit. Defensemen Mark Tinordi, Brendan Witt and 
Dmitri Mironov and now Calle Johansson -- out six weeks with a 
sprained knee -- all have been sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got so bad that the team hired an outside sports medicine  
consultant to examine everything about the organization to see if 
there's anything to the injuries beyond bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize it's an excuse, and I hate using it,'' said  
defenseman Ken Klee, one of the few players not injured this 
season. ``But when you have injuries like we've had, it's tough. We 
need lines to get comfortable together. You've got different guys 
in and out ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals' hopes essentially ended when they failed to beat  
playoff hopefuls Boston, Florida and the New York Rangers within 
the past month. Now it's time for general manager George McPhee to 
trade some of the 10 potential free agents -- including Tinordi, Joe 
Juneau, Craig Berube, Dale Hunter and Brian Bellows -- to teams who 
need extra manpower for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good chance that George is going to move a couple of  
potential free agents,'' Wilson said. ``There's a lot of teams 
calling. I don't like it because there are some guys who might be 
moved who I like personally and have meant a lot to me, and I only 
hope we can get these guys back in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has missed the playoffs, made the finals, then missed  
the playoffs consecutively since the New York Rangers of 1948-49, 
1949-50 and 1950-51, and that was when the NHL only had six teams. 
It's probably something Wilson won't commemorate with a cake, but 
he's determined to keep things upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to practice as positive as possible,'' Wilson said.  
``What you're trying to do is keep people from becoming cynical, 
thinking that they don't have a chance, that it's still a fun place 
to come to work. If it becomes dreary, it's 10 times worse.''

<HEADLINE> Leopard Attacks Colo. Boy at Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- A leopard bit the head of a  
6-year-old boy who climbed an embankment at a zoo to get a better 
look at the big cats on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two off-duty Colorado State Patrol workers at the Cheyenne  
Mountain Zoo kicked the 72-pound leopard away from Phillip Rupert 
and pulled him to safety. He was released from a hospital after 
being treated for puncture wounds on his forehead and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Phillip was with his mother and a sibling when they  
stopped at the Asian Highlands exhibit. He climbed over a rope and 
scrambled up the embankment, then leaned against a fence that 
surrounded the enclosure. The leopard pushed his head through the 
fence and bit the boy.

<HEADLINE>  Elbow Injury Ends Cubs' Wood's Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood's 1999 season lasted all of 26  
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's brightest young pitcher, whose fastball dazzled fans  
during his rookie season, will undergo ligament replacement surgery 
on his right elbow within two weeks. Rehabilitation is expected to 
take about one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's a huge loss for us -- the NL Rookie of the Year  
and a huge part of our rotation,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch 
said Wednesday after an MRI in Chicago revealed the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander has had a tender elbow since the  
Cubs drafted him out of high school in June 1995 and he missed all 
of last September while it was sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood returned to throw five innings in the Cubs' final playoff  
game against Atlanta, then was hospitalized twice at the start of 
spring training because of an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. The latest injury occurred Saturday, on 
the first warmup pitch of the second inning of his 1999 debut 
against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very, very conservative with Kerry,'' Lynch said.  
``Whether this was bound to happen, I can't answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs clubhouse in Mesa was quiet after players learned the  
news on a cool and rainy morning. Wood not only is respected, he's 
one of the most well-liked players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selfishly, he's so much fun to play behind, watching those  
overpowering fastballs,'' first baseman Mark Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to get a second opinion and allow swelling to  
subside before going ahead with surgery. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the 
Anaheim Angels team physician, or Dr. James Andrews most likely 
will perform a ligament replacement, a procedure considered radical 
when Dr. Frank Jobe used it to save Tommy John's career in 1974 but 
now is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully we live in a day and age when they can put us back  
together like an erector set,'' said Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland, 
ensured a spot in the rotation because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston on May 6, 1998, to tie  
Roger Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, was a big part of 
baseball's renaissance last season. He not only was a key to the 
Cubs' pennant hopes, but had become one of baseball's top 
attractions. He was rewarded with a $690,000 salary -- a record for 
a player with less than one year in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his promise, there was always the danger he would burn  
out too soon, such as Mark Fidrych and David Clyde. For now, the 
Cubs are positive Wood can rebound next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for him,'' reliever Rod Beck said. ``I think as a  
pitcher every one of us has laid in bed with an ache and a pain 
thinking it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest blow to baseball during a spring training that  
has seen Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga, New York Yankees 
manager Joe Torre and Florida infielder Mike Lowell diagnosed with 
cancer; Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio die following lung cancer 
surgery; and Houston outfielder Moises Alou severely damage a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga and Alou are out for the season, and Torre is expected  
to miss 1-to-3 months. Lowell already has returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the retirement of Michael Jordan, Wood and Sammy Sosa  
were Chicago's biggest sports stars. It's hard to see the Cubs, the 
lovable losers who haven't won a pennant since 1945 and a World 
Series since 1908, getting back to the playoffs without Wood, even 
if Sosa has another 66-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Sammy on the field -- put a glass case around him,''  
Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubs mentioned that Wood might benefit from having the  
surgery so early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard guys who had the ligament replacement say the  
ligament that's put in is stronger and more durable,'' Mulholland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Alex Fernandez, who tore a ligament during the 1997 NL  
championship series, is the latest top pitcher whose career was 
saved by the procedure. Cubs pitcher Jeremi Gonzalez had a ligament 
replaced by Yocum last Aug. 21 and is ahead of schedule, hoping to 
return during the first half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the injury means the Cubs are left with a rotation of  
Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Mulholland and Jon Lieber, with Scott 
Sanders or Kurt Miller the top candidates for the fifth spot. While 
Kansas City's Kevin Appier is available and perhaps others, Lynch 
didn't seem inclined to make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every club is looking for a pitcher,'' he said. ``We  
have the people to put in the rotation.''

<HEADLINE> VW Pays 219 Ex-Slave Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- A fund set up last year by German  
automaker Volkswagen to pay slave laborers the company used under 
the Nazis has compensated 219 people so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Each recipient received about $5,570, the fund reported Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Those paid included 84 former slave laborers from Israel, 58  
from the Netherlands, 22 in France, 17 in Poland, 15 in Belgium, 13 
in Italy, four in Germany, 3 in the United States and one each in 
Argentina, Canada and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	VW estimates that some 17,000 forced laborers toiled in its  
factories from 1941 to the end of World War II, but others put the 
number much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's chairman, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres,  
took out advertisements in 22 countries late last year to help 
trace former slave laborers the Nazis provided Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
	VW established $11.1 million humanitarian fund under pressure  
from lawsuits in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Volkswagen also joined 11 other companies last month  
to work with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government to set up a 
German industry foundation for compensating former slave laborers.

<HEADLINE> The Boss, McCartney, Joel Inducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Piano Man's beard is more salt than pepper  
these days. The Boss is a half-century old. And the Beatle -- the 
impetuous, impossibly handsome Beatle who wanted to fill the world 
with silly love songs -- is a widower with three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame convened Monday night to honor  
its new inductees, and what it staged was a sweet, slightly 
melancholy blend of elegy and glory-days reminiscence. The angry 
young men and women, the ones who defined the rebellion, have 
grayed and grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' said Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner,  
co-chairman of the Cleveland-based hall, ``tonight we honor 
legends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, now legends. How incongruous: They came in formal  
wear and ate off fine Waldorf-Astoria china, these architects of 
status-quo toppling who made lives out of fiddling and strumming 
and banging and swiveling and setting raw thoughts to music. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting top billing: Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen and Paul  
McCartney, with nearly a century of music among them and strikingly 
diverse origins. McCartney came from the middle-class grit of 
Liverpool, England, Springsteen from the streets of New Jersey, 
Joel from the postwar suburbs of Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from Levittown,'' Joel said, marveling after Ray Charles  
inducted him. ``This is not supposed to happen to people like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney, in his first major appearance since his wife, Linda,  
died last year, lamented her absence. ``I would like my baby to 
share this with me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also threw in a plug: ``While we're here, you've got me,  
you've got John in this, how about George and Ringo? C'mon, guys.'' 
The Beatles were inducted as a group in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen jammed with the E Street Band, a much-awaited  
precursor to an upcoming reunion tour. He stood back and smiled, a 
generation of memories in his eyes, as Clarence Clemons did his sax 
solo in ``Promised Land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for giving me access and entrance into your lives. I  
hope I've made a good companion,'' Springsteen said. 
</P>
<P>
	U2's Bono, in a manic, brilliant tribute, covered just about  
everything -- from Springsteen managing to have ``no bad hair 
period, even in the 80s'' to his ``eyes that could see through 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He created an alternative mythology -- one where ordinary lives  
became extraordinary,'' Bono said. He said Springsteen, when he 
appeared in the 1970s, immediately set to ``saving music from the 
phonies, saving lyrics from the folkies, saving black leather 
jackets from the Fonz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time has silenced some instruments. Four of the performers  
inducted Monday are dead -- including Del Shannon (``Runaway'') in 
1990, and Dusty Springfield (``Son of a Preacher Man,'' among many) 
just two weeks ago. Another, Curtis Mayfield, was too ill to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure if you told any of 'em 25 years ago that there's  
gonna be a Hall of Fame and they're going to put on tuxedos and 
have a dinner, well... ,'' rocker Melissa Etheridge said after 
performing ``Preacher Man.'' Then she trailed off, laughing in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the inevitable mutual admiration. Elton John told of  
joining a Dusty Springfield fan club as a boy. Neil Young swore the 
first song he ever played -- in a school cafeteria, no less -- was 
the Beatles' version of ``Money (That's What I Want).'' And Joel 
credited his R&AMP;B influences -- quite bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've been referred to as derivative,'' he said. ``I'm  
damn guilty. ... If everyone who is derivative was excluded from 
this institution, there wouldn't be any white people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mavis Staples of The Staples Singers, the gospel group inducted  
Monday, agreed. ``All of this music is related,'' she said. ``We're 
first cousins with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the jam session -- more than a half hour of improv.  
</P>
<P>
	In the end, McCartney sang ``Let It Be,'' and they all stood  
behind him, adding their voices and instruments to his: Lauryn 
Hill. Eric Clapton. Bonnie Raitt. Melissa Etheridge. The Staples. 
Wilson Pickett. Generations crossing, creating something with a bit 
of the old and a dash of the new -- the very definition of rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Then McCartney smiled. ``It's time to go home,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was just past 12:30 a.m. When they were younger, the night  
would have been just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was a lifetime ago.

	Dow Closes at 9,930.47  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average cracked 10,000  
today, propelled by a record eight years of U.S. economic growth, a 
boom in high technology and investor enchantment with the Internet. 
It was there for just under a minute, and never went past 
10,001.78. The index ended the day down 28.30 at 9,930.47. On the 
New York Stock Exchange, decliners outnumbered advancers 
1,688-1,313. The NASDAQ closed up 7.79 at 2,439.23.

	U.S. Gets Access to N.Korea Site  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- North Korea agreed today to let U.S. inspectors  
make several visits to a suspected nuclear weapons site without 
charging Washington the $300 million it initially demanded for 
access. In return, the United States promised to help the 
famine-stricken communist nation increase potato yields. The 
dispute had threatened a 1994 accord under which North Korea agreed 
to freeze what the United States believed was a developing nuclear 
weapons program, in exchange for energy supplies and help from the 
United States, South Korea and Japan.

	U.S. Again Warns Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the United States again warned the Serbs  
about blocking a settlement in Kosovo, a new poll found that 62 
percent of Americans oppose bombing if Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic does not agree to the peace deal. Milosevic has not 
relented in his refusal to permit NATO peacekeepers on Serb 
territory to support a self-rule plan for ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo. Half of the 1,515 adults questioned in the ABC/Washington 
Post poll released today supported the United States and its allies 
in sending ground troops to enforce the peace treaty.

	Truck Driver: I Didn't See Train  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- The driver of the truck that was hit by  
an Amtrak train said he didn't see the train or flashing warning 
lights until he started driving across the tracks, a National 
Transportation Safety Board member said. Amtrak's City of New 
Orleans struck the truck loaded with heavy steel bars and derailed 
about 9:30 p.m. yesterday. Fourteen people, who were aboard a 
sleeper car near the front of the train, died. That car was pierced 
by one of the train's engines and set afire by leaking diesel fuel. 
Four others are missing and feared dead and more than 100 were 
taken to hospitals.

	Mrs. Clinton's Testimony Played  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a grand jury videotape made public  
for the first time today, Hillary Rodham Clinton testified she 
``never spent any significant time at all'' monitoring records of 
the Whitewater land deal she and President Clinton shared with Jim 
and Susan McDougal. Mrs. Clinton also said she was unaware of a 
$27,600 loan for Whitewater taken out in Bill Clinton's name in 
1982. Forty minutes of her testimony were played in the trial of 
Mrs. McDougal, who is charged with criminal contempt for refusing 
to answer Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's questions about 
Whitewater.

	Apple Reveals Software Blueprints  
</P>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Jobs today made Apple Computer  
Inc. the first major company to release the programming secrets 
behind an operating system to software developers. Apple's move, 
while limited to its software that runs central computers, gives a 
big push to a movement to use the Internet for enlisting volunteer 
programmers and speeding software development. The so-called ``open 
source'' method also is used for Netscape's browser software and 
the Linux operating system for business computers. Apple will keep 
secret its operating system for the Macintosh personal computer, at 
least for now.

	So You Think You've Got a Good Job?  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Website manager, computer systems analyst and  
software engineers topped the list of best jobs in the ``Jobs Rated 
Almanac.'' The book ranks 250 jobs according to six criteria: 
income, stress, physical demands, potential growth, job security 
and work environment. The data came from the government, trade 
groups and telephone surveys. Nine of the top 10 jobs were in 
computer or math-related fields. But physical labor didn't fare as 
well, with oil field ``roustabouts'' ranking last and fishermen 
ranking 248th, although lumberjacks made it to No. 149.

	Ravens Get QB Mitchell From Lions  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens finally got the  
quarterback they coveted today, obtaining Scott Mitchell from the 
Detroit Lions for two draft picks. The Ravens also were expected to 
trade Jim Harbaugh to the San Diego Chargers, clearing the way for 
Mitchell to become the Ravens' third opening-day quarterback in 
three seasons. Mitchell cost Baltimore a third-round draft choice 
this year and a conditional fifth-round selection in 2000. The 
latter pick will be upgraded to a fourth-rounder if Mitchell 
appears in half the Ravens' offensive plays.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Members Sue HMO Over Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Members of Kaiser Permanente, one of the  
nation's largest HMOs, sued the organization Tuesday, claiming they 
were duped by ads that said its doctors weren't influenced by 
financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends Kaiser and its parent, The Permanente  
Federation, compromised care with their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser has gone beyond the pale with its statements here that  
doctors make decisions based on medical need and there's no fiscal 
interference,'' said Jamie Court of the nonprofit Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which filed the proposed class-action 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that Kaiser withheld up to 30 percent of  
doctors' salaries and tied physician bonus pay and other 
compensation to reaching certain profit goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser called the allegations ``patently false.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole premise upon which the lawsuit is based is a lie,''  
said Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of Permanente 
Medical Group for Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical decisions at Kaiser Permanente do rest in the hands of  
doctors and we're very proud of that fact,'' she said. ``No health 
plan administrator has anything to do with those decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages for up to 800,000  
members of Oakland-based Kaiser, which has nearly 5.6 million 
members in California and over 9 million members nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Bagpipers Join NYC Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Only one bagpipe band in the nation's oldest and  
largest St. Patrick's Day Parade is coming from abroad, and it's 
not from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's from Japan.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a samurai spirit in the bagpipe. It's very evocative,  
invigorating, uplifting -- especially the marching tunes,'' said 
Japanese consul general Seiichiro Otsuka, who will be playing in 
the Tokyo Pipe Band on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll be drinking miso soup or Irish whisky  
Wednesday morning,'' he added with a laugh. ``We'll need a lot of 
energy. It's 40 blocks!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty of the band's 50 men and women will be dancing, drumming  
and piping during the 238th year of New York's St. Patrick's 
festivities, held on Fifth Avenue. It is the first Japanese group 
to march in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The band was formed in 1975 for Queen Elizabeth ll's visit to  
Tokyo. Since then, growing in size and talent, it has performed in 
France, Hong Kong and Jakarta and won prizes at international 
competitions. Many band members have trained in Scotland and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Otsuka, who was Japan's first consul general in Edinburgh,  
Scotland, said the first time he heard a bagpipe, the beauty of the 
sound brought him to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``One autumn afternoon I was walking around Edinburgh castle.  
The sun was setting. There was a lone piper on top of the Edinburgh 
castle wall playing `Amazing Grace.' The music brought tears to my 
eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing Japanese about the group's costumes, which are  
traditional kilts in a Royal Stuart plaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt funny the first time, but it gets more comfortable.  
When I tell my colleagues I wear a kilt, many people are interested 
in trying it on,'' said Atsushi Yamane. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to traditional Irish and Scottish tunes, the band  
will be playing ``Sukiyaki,'' ``Mount Fuji'' and ``Koi Nobori,'' 
all Japanese songs. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fitzsimons, a parade organizer, said having the Japanese  
pipers was ``a real honor for the Irish community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are a few Western faces in the group. Sandy Tryk, of  
Cleveland, a physics professor at the University of Tokyo and the 
band's only American, said Wednesday's parade would be something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play in a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Tokyo, but it's  
really small,'' he said. ``There are five Irish pubs in Tokyo, 
though -- more than in Cleveland, I'm sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yamane studied at an intensive piping program in California.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we are not Celtic, but the sound is so very brave  
and huge and real to us. Japanese traditional music is all quiet,'' 
he said. ``The bagpipe feels very powerful.''

<HEADLINE>  Calipari Fired by Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The John Calipari era is over for the New Jersey  
Nets, whose owner and president flanked the former coach at a 
bizarre hotel press conference to announce the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The change did not come as a surprise after the Nets struggled  
to a 3-17 record and the players had begun to tune out their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say this about pro basketball: If you're a good group of  
guys and you're winning, there is no better gig in the world,'' 
Calipari said. ``But if you're losing and you have a few bad seeds, 
I can't explain to you misery like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Calipari himself who was often regarded as the bad  
seed on the Nets, a team he helped lead to respectability during 
his 2 1/2 seasons at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games to fall to 3-17. Only the Los 
Angeles Clippers (1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Don Casey will take over the team on an interim  
basis while the Nets pursue former Chicago Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has said he'd one day like to return to the NBA, and  
it's unclear whether he's interested -- or whether he would move up 
his timetable to take over the Nets this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal had been expected ever since Calipari met with  
team owners Finn Wentworth and Lewis Katz on Sunday after a 102-76 
loss in Miami. Calipari didn't accompany the team to Toronto, but 
traveled there separately Monday and met briefly with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal said, ``Thank you'' and that's about it,'' Jayson Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari was  
given the power to change the Nets from a laughingstock into a 
winner, and made some progress. But his in-your-face, high-pitched 
coaching style alienated many of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying so hard to change his style,'' Katz said. ``I  
don't know that there was a determining factor, but it was pretty 
obvious that he was in his misery as he watched the season slip 
away when there had been such high expectations at the start of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the somewhat impromptu press conference, Katz and team  
president Michael Rowe flanked Calipari, with Katz calling Calipari 
a friend who he was concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, in his third season with the Nets, had two years and  
$6 million remaining on his five-year, $15 million contract. He was 
offered a consulting job with the team, although he did not say if 
he would take it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown has already said he will offer  
Calipari a job as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's first game will come Tuesday night against the Raptors.  
He was the head coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89 season and 
has spent the last three seasons as Calipari's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets' problems began on opening night when point guard Sam  
Cassell severely sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games 
after that, and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and 
later Doug Overton at the point. All-Star center Jayson Williams 
has played with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season, although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In 2 1/2 years, look where it is. Four or five years 
ago, no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm OK with that. I don't own the 
team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the losing 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very very blessed man,'' Calipari said. 
``I came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn 
around an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the 
floor. In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like 
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Ready To OK Missile Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican proponents of a bill to commit the  
United States to a national missile defense system cited reports of 
Chinese espionage at a U.S. weapons laboratory to buttress their 
case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accused them of politicizing the situation but  
nonetheless appeared ready to support some compromise on a 
nationwide shield against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Olympia Snowe,  
R-Maine, which would commit the United States to a missile-defense 
system while recognizing the importance to negotiate with Moscow on 
reducing nuclear arsenals, appeared to be gaining bipartisan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has earmarked about $10 billion for such a  
system over the next five years but does not want to make a 
decision on whether to deploy it before June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill before the Senate would commit the United States to  
deploy such a system as soon as the technology exists to do it. The 
administration has threatened a veto. Similar legislation is coming 
up in the House later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and congressional Democratic leaders  
contend the legislation would violate terms of the landmark 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which generally prohibits either 
nation from developing a nationwide shield against ballistic 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would permit only a limited system, based in North  
Dakota. In 1972, U.S. officials assumed the biggest threat of 
nuclear attack was from the Soviet Union, over the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials now say the greater danger is an attack from  
a rogue nation, or an accidental firing by Russia, than missiles 
coming from the north. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of trying to block the missile-defense legislation,  
Democrats generally are trying to seek common ground this year with 
Republicans, with the added advantage of neutralizing the subject 
as a 2000 campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said reports of  
alleged espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which may 
have helped China build smaller, more efficient nuclear warheads, 
gives even more reason to deploy a national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it still going on?'' he asked. Lott called the lack of a  
national missile defense the nation's ``Achilles' heel'' and said 
he detected ``movement in the Senate'' to support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans made a point of noting that China has at least a  
dozen ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the Los Alamos disclosures,  
along with U.S. satellite technology exports to China, are 
``chilling, alarming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not only a serious breach in our national security but  
a quantum leap in the ability of the Chinese government to not only 
threaten the security of their neighbors in Asia but to ultimately 
threaten the security of American cities,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota accused  
Senate Republicans of overplaying the China card. ``It's 
partisanship,'' Daschle told reporters. ``Nobody's going to give 
away anything (to China), I assure you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Landrieu-Snowe proposal would still commit the United States  
to deploying a missile defense when technologically possible, but 
it would add this sentence at the end: ``It is the position of the 
United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian 
nuclear forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would uphold the spirit, if not the letter, of the ABM  
treaty, supporters said.

<HEADLINE> Factories, Housing Show Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Single-family housing construction hit a  
20-year high and even the nation's beleaguered factories showed 
unexpected strength in February as the remarkable U.S. economy 
turned in another stellar performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic news cheered Wall Street investors, pushing  
the Dow Jones industrial average briefly through the historic 
10,000-mark shortly after trading opened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unstoppable U.S. economy just won't quit,'' said Bruce  
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that construction of  
single-family homes rose 1.1 percent in February to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units, the best showing since 
December 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, housing construction dipped 0.6 percent, reflecting a  
drop in apartment building, but the 1.80 million annual rate for 
total home building was down only slightly from a 12-year high of 
1.81 million units set in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that output at the  
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a better-than-expected 
0.2 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories, which have been hard-hit by a loss of export markets  
because of the spreading global economic crisis, managed a 0.2 
percent gain, led by a 1.8 percent surge in production of 
computers, computer chips and communications equipment. Output in 
these high-tech categories is up 26 percent over the past 12 
months, bucking a trend in the rest of manufacturing that has seen 
production cutbacks and job losses totaling 337,000 over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Output in the mining industry was up 0.4 percent as gains in  
coal mining offset weakness in oil and gas drilling. Output at the 
nation's utilities was down 0.6 percent, reflecting a 
warmer-than-usual February. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory output advance prompted some analysts to say the  
worst of the Asian crisis may be over for U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had words of hope  
for the other part of the economy that has suffered from the global 
turmoil -- farming. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the economy's overall performance ``impressive,''  
Greenspan told an audience in San Francisco that he believed 
farmers were weathering their current problems much better than the 
1980 farming crisis. He said they would be in good position to take 
advantage of rising world demand when the one-third of the world in 
recession does recover. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving above the 10,000 milestone in early trading, the  
Dow gave up those gains, ending the day at 9,930, down 28 from 
Monday's record close. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of manufacturing and farming, the U.S. economy has  
continued to forge ahead, powered by strong consumer demand. Most 
analysts had expected the total economy, as measured by the gross 
domestic product, to slow sharply from last year's 3.9 percent 
rate. But Steinberg said the recent strong economic reports were 
prompting him to revise his forecast upward to match last year's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy continues to walk its way through the  
mine fields,'' said Robert Dederick, economist at Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's factories operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in  
February, the lowest capacity utilization rate in 6 1/2 years. The 
absence of production bottlenecks is one reason inflation has 
remained well behaved. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom in housing has been credited to strong job growth and  
low inflation. The absence of inflationary pressures has allowed 
the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, which has 
translated into low mortgage rates for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mortgage rates have been rising for the past six weeks  
and now stand at a 10-month high of 7.11 percent for 30-year 
mortgages. But analysts said housing should remain strong for the 
first half of the year even with the slightly higher mortgage 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing report showed applications for building permits, a  
good indication of future trends, rose 2.7 percent for 
single-family homes to an annual rate of 1.31 million units, the 
highest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the biggest housing gain was posted in the Northeast,  
where construction shot up 35.7 percent in February. Starts also 
rose in the Midwest, by 8 percent, but they fell 15.9 percent in 
the West and were down 2.5 percent in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said the  
good economy was helping homeowners meet their mortgage payments. 
The mortgage delinquency rate fell to 4.24 percent during the final 
three months of 1998, the best showing since 1996.

<HEADLINE> IOC Nears Vote on Expelling Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- After more than a century as a  
private club accountable only to itself, the scandal-tainted 
International Olympic Committee faces a critical test Wednesday of 
whether it can clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in a sign that change won't come easily or swiftly, IOC  
leaders are sticking to their old ways as they struggle to regain 
their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed-door sessions, votes by acclamation and behind-the-scenes  
deals will still be the order of the day as the IOC convenes a 
watershed general assembly to deal with the biggest crisis in its 
105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day session comes against the backdrop of an internal  
IOC power struggle that could challenge the leadership of president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest test of his 19-year reign, Samaranch is under  
pressure to deliver on his promises to clean house and undertake 
reforms to restore public confidence in the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Closely watching the outcome will be the corporate sponsors who  
pay hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the games. They have 
told the IOC to act decisively to resolve the scandal or risk a 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
	With critics outside the IOC calling for him to resign,  
Samaranch hopes the members will close ranks around him and set 
aside any internal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to get through these two days calmly,''  
Italian member Mario Pescante said. ``We have to close the matter 
as soon as possible. People must put water on the fire, not 
petrol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented purge, six members face expulsion for  
receiving cash payments or other improper inducements during Salt 
Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. Four other 
members have already resigned, while 10 have received warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those up for expulsion are Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El  
Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic 
of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul 
Wallwork of Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Expulsion requires a two-thirds majority of the 91-member  
assembly. Each of the six accused will have 20 minutes to state 
their defense before the body, which will vote on one case at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they all will be expelled,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an  
American IOC vice president. ``I think all the reports are very, 
very clear. We take an oath of office that we are accorded the 
honor of representing the International Olympic Committee. The 
reports show their actions were without honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure could turn nasty if the accused members point  
fingers at the IOC inquiry team that recommended their ouster. Some 
have accused the panel of letting off the higher-profile members at 
the expense of less- influential ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who is accused of receiving more than $200,000 in cash,  
travel, gifts and medical care, has called the expulsions a ``show 
trial'' and a vendetta against Third World countries and Africa in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am expelled, it is only because they have to sacrifice  
some heads to save the IOC,'' Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to approve any of the expulsions would be a critical  
defeat for Samaranch and his board. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olympic sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
said Samaranch may have found a way to eliminate any risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed formula, once the accused members have spoken  
and left the room, Samaranch will read out the recommendation for 
expulsion and ask the floor: ``Who is opposed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave members with little choice: go along with the  
proposal or face isolation by raising their hand in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch could use a similar procedure to gain a show of  
confidence from the members. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears unlikely there will be a formal confidence vote or  
secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, officials said members may approve Samaranch by  
acclamation or applause after his opening speech. Another 
possibility is that approval of all the proposals will be 
considered as a de facto vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned with that,'' DeFrantz said. ``I think  
(Samaranch) has heard from enough members since the last meeting. 
He knows what a difficult task it is, but he is the leader. I 
wouldn't worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls for more openness and accountability, the session  
will be held behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are pros and cons,'' IOC director general Francois  
Carrard said. ``We are considering giving more publicity and more 
transparency to our deliberations, but as of now the session will 
not be open to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard played down a report by The Associated Press that  
Samaranch has told close associates he suspects there is an 
in-house campaign to push him out of office before his term expires 
in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many reports about many plots,'' Carrard said. ``I  
don't think this has any importance. ... (Samaranch) is totally 
unaware of it and he doesn't seem very concerned about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of rumors and 5,000 plots going around  
tonight,'' he said. ``By tomorrow, there will be 5,000 to 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another key issue, the assembly will be asked to approve a  
new system for the selection of the 2006 Winter Games host city. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of a revolt by rank-and-file members, IOC leaders  
were forced to withdraw their earlier proposal to strip the general 
membership of the vote and leave the decision to a 15-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a compromise, the small body will narrow the six-city  
field to two finalists; then, the full IOC will elect the winner -- 
all on the same day at the June session in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly is also expected to appoint an independent ethics  
commission and a reform panel, including outside experts, to study 
long-term structural reforms. That could include term limits and 
democratic elections for IOC members and open financial books. 
</P>
<P>
	How fast the reforms will be implemented is unclear. Officials  
said the assembly may approve only a general framework, while a 
second session could be convened in December to act on any specific 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not enough if we expel six members and establish an  
ethics commission,'' Pescante said. ``We need to change the IOC 
structure completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A powerful Repulican senator is warning the IOC that Congress  
will be forced to step in unless Olympic officials enact strong 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to DeFrantz, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John  
McCain noted he has scheduled hearings April 14 on the Olympic 
scandal; that the IOC has tax-execmpt status in the United States; 
and that sponsorships from U.S. corporations ``represent a 
substanial majority of IOC revenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn  
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A disillusioned group of Canadian Olympians, led by 1992 gold  
medal-winning swimmer Mark Tewksbury, launched an athletes' 
coalition to act as an IOC watchdog. The athletes hope to get 
international support to promote systematic change in the IOC -- a 
huge undertaking, given the fact that Olympic leaders have shown an 
unwillingness to listen to outside critics.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Star Pitcher Has Injured Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood has a ``significant injury'' in  
his pitching elbow, but it's not immediately clear how long he will 
be sidelined for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said tests on Monday showed damage to the ulnar  
collateral ligament. Additional tests will be performed today on 
the NL Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's uncertain status has shaken a team trying to win its  
first pennant since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said  
before Monday's 10-7 win over the Oakland Athletics. ``We just 
crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After today's bad news, Riggleman said, ``I think our players  
will take this as a challenge we will have to overcome, the same as 
Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' referring to season-ending 
injuries to Andres Galarraga and Moises Alou. ``He's had some ups 
and downs from the time he signed that most young pitchers have 
gone through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, the sensation who struck out a record-tying 20 against  
Houston last May in his fifth career start, missed all of last 
September because of a sore elbow, then returned for Game 3 of the 
division series against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was hospitalized twice at the start  
of spring training for an upper respiratory and gastrointestinal 
illness, then threw just 10 of 26 pitches for strikes Saturday 
against Anaheim in his 1999 debut and wound up with elbow pain 
again that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had hoped the pain was from scar tissue, not ligament  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was real down yesterday, understandably so,'' Riggleman  
said Monday. ``He's a young power pitcher, and I don't know a young 
power pitcher who hasn't gone through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has less than a year of major league service,  
Cubs players already look to Wood as a leader. Mark Grace compared 
him to Curt Schilling, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, calling him 
``almost irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is one of those guys that can win even when he doesn't  
have his good stuff because of his reputation,'' Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Terry Mulholland and Jon Lieber  
are the other four starters in the Cubs' rotation. If Wood is 
sidelined, Scott Sanders or Kurt Miller are the most likely 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to go out there and pick it up,'' Sammy Sosa  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Calipari Fired by Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The John Calipari era is over for the New Jersey  
Nets, whose owner and president flanked the former coach at a 
bizarre hotel press conference to announce the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The change did not come as a surprise after the Nets struggled  
to a 3-17 record and the players had begun to tune out their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say this about pro basketball: If you're a good group of  
guys and you're winning, there is no better gig in the world,'' 
Calipari said. ``But if you're losing and you have a few bad seeds, 
I can't explain to you misery like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Calipari himself who was often regarded as the bad  
seed on the Nets, a team he helped lead to respectability during 
his 2 1/2 seasons at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games to fall to 3-17. Only the Los 
Angeles Clippers (1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Don Casey will take over the team on an interim  
basis while the Nets pursue former Chicago Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has said he'd one day like to return to the NBA, and  
it's unclear whether he's interested -- or whether he would move up 
his timetable to take over the Nets this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal had been expected ever since Calipari met with  
team owners Finn Wentworth and Lewis Katz on Sunday after a 102-76 
loss in Miami. Calipari didn't accompany the team to Toronto, but 
traveled there separately Monday and met briefly with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal said, ``Thank you'' and that's about it,'' Jayson Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari was  
given the power to change the Nets from a laughingstock into a 
winner, and made some progress. But his in-your-face, high-pitched 
coaching style alienated many of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying so hard to change his style,'' Katz said. ``I  
don't know that there was a determining factor, but it was pretty 
obvious that he was in his misery as he watched the season slip 
away when there had been such high expectations at the start of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the somewhat impromptu press conference, Katz and team  
president Michael Rowe flanked Calipari, with Katz calling Calipari 
a friend who he was concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, in his third season with the Nets, had two years and  
$6 million remaining on his five-year, $15 million contract. He was 
offered a consulting job with the team, although he did not say if 
he would take it. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown has already said he will offer  
Calipari a job as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's first game will come Tuesday night against the Raptors.  
He was the head coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89 season and 
has spent the last three seasons as Calipari's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets' problems began on opening night when point guard Sam  
Cassell severely sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games 
after that, and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and 
later Doug Overton at the point. All-Star center Jayson Williams 
has played with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season, although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In 2 1/2 years, look where it is. Four or five years 
ago, no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm OK with that. I don't own the 
team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the losing 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very very blessed man,'' Calipari said. 
``I came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn 
around an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the 
floor. In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like 
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Wins Week's Nielsens Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Season leader CBS slipped to second in last  
week's prime-time ratings derby but the network isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's overall ratings suffered because its prime-time schedule  
was pre-empted by NCAA basketball on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the basketball games enabled CBS to have its second best  
week of the season among young men. That's a demographic group 
attractive to advertisers and one CBS has sought as a priority this 
year. Only during the week where CBS telecast the AFC Championship 
football game in January did it attract more young men. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 9.0 rating and 15 share won a lackluster week clogged with  
reruns, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. CBS was second with an 
8.6 rating and 14 share, ABC had a 7.8 rating and 13 share and Fox 
had a 6.2 rating and 10 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Three newsmagazines finished among the week's top 10 shows,  
which generally happens when there are a lot of reruns. Networks 
showed the reruns because it's the lull after a ``sweeps'' month, 
when ratings are watched closely to set advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' with one of the relatively few original series  
episodes to air last week, was the most-watched show. NBC's 
``World's Most Amazing Videos'' finished a solid 28th for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Strange World,'' an ``X-Files'' inspired replacement  
series for ``NYPD Blue,'' had poor ratings in its premiere, 
finishing in 89th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.1 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 2.0 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with an 8.5  
rating and a 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with 
an 8.3 and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.5; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.3; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: 
Seasons of Love, Pt. 2,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.9; ''20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> NBC Programmer Wants To Go Younger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's incoming programming chief, fresh from the  
experience of chasing teen-age viewers at the fledgling WB 
television network, said Tuesday he wants his new network to 
attract younger people. 
</P>
<P>
	Garth Ancier was appointed a day earlier as president of NBC  
Entertainment. Scott Sassa, who's had that job since last fall, was 
promoted to president of NBC West Coast, succeeding Don Ohlmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to bring the age down maybe five years,'' Ancier  
said. He wants the median age of NBC's viewers, now at 43, to drop 
to 38. Younger viewers tend to be more attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier's appointment has been anticipated for the last several  
months. He announced in December that he would leave the WB, which 
he helped build into a minor success story with programs like 
``Dawson's Creek,'' a hit among teen-age viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier, 41, will join NBC on May 10, after his contract with the  
WB expires. 
</P>
<P>
	He's worked with Sassa in the past at Fox. Ancier said he  
anticipated he would concentrate on programming while Sassa pays 
more attention to the business of running the network's 
entertainment division. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlmeyer will remain with NBC as a senior consultant.

<HEADLINE>  Elbow Injury Ends Cubs' Wood's Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood will miss this season because of a  
torn elbow ligament, leaving the Chicago Cubs without the pitcher 
who dazzled baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, who last May struck out 20 batters  
against Houston, completely tore the ulnar collateral ligament in 
his right elbow during his spring training debut against Anaheim on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a huge loss, no doubt about it,'' teammate Mark Grace  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was in Chicago for an MRI exam. But even before the  
results, the Cubs announced the injury was season ending, sending a 
shudder through their clubhouse on a cold, rainy morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for him,'' reliever Rod Beck said. ``I think as a  
pitcher every one of us has laid in bed with an ache and a pain 
thinking it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood became one of baseball's top attractions last season and  
helped the Cubs win the NL wild-card spot. He missed all of 
September because of a sore elbow, but returned to pitch five 
innings in Game 3 of the playoffs against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Sammy on the field -- put a glass case around him,''  
Beck said of star home run hitter Sammy Sosa, the Cubs' leading 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's status has shaken a team trying to win its first pennant  
since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' said Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman, referring to Andres Galarraga and Moises 
Alou, both out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some ups and downs from the time he signed that most  
young pitchers have gone through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was hospitalized twice at the start of spring training for  
an upper respiratory and intestinal illness, then threw just 10 of 
26 pitches for strikes Saturday against Anaheim. He wound up with 
elbow pain again that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had hoped the pain was from scar tissue, not ligament  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has less than a year of major league service,  
Cubs players already look to Wood as a leader. Grace compared him 
to Curt Schilling, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, calling him 
``almost irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is one of those guys that can win even when he doesn't  
have his good stuff because of his reputation,'' Grace said. 
``Selfishly, he's so much fun to play behind, watching those 
overpowering fastballs and those bowel-locking curves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Terry Mulholland and Jon Lieber  
are the other four starters in the Cubs' rotation. Scott Sanders or 
Kurt Miller will most likely move into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity for a guy like Scott Sanders or Terry  
Mulholland to step up,'' Grace said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Kerry Wood's season ended almost before it started.  
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, whose fastball dazzled fans during  
his rookie season, will undergo ligament replacement surgery on his 
right elbow within two weeks. Rehabilitation is expected to take 
about one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's a huge loss for us -- the NL Rookie of the Year  
and a huge part of our rotation,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch 
said Wednesday after an MRI in Chicago revealed the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander has had a tender elbow since the  
Cubs drafted him out of high school in June 1995 and he missed all 
of last September while it was sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood returned to throw five innings in the Cubs' final playoff  
game against Atlanta, then was hospitalized twice at the start of 
spring training because of an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. The latest injury occurred Saturday, on 
the first warmup pitch of the second inning of his 1999 debut 
against Anaheim. He wound up throwing 26 pitches over two innings, 
the only action he'll see in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to get a second opinion and allow swelling to  
subside before going ahead with surgery. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the 
Anaheim Angels team physician, or Dr. James Andrews most likely 
will perform a ligament replacement, a procedure considered radical 
when Dr. Frank Jobe used it to save Tommy John's career in 1974 but 
now commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad for him, too bad for baseball,'' Atlanta manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I don't like to face the guy, but he's a special, 
special pitcher. We need those to come along in the game like that, 
who really pack them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gary Sheffield returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers  
camp at Vero Beach, Fla, after taking two days off to attend to 
personal matters. He didn't play against the Florida Marlins due to 
a sore right shoulder, but threw lightly and took batting practice 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have him healthy,'' manager Davey Johnson said.  
``He's important to this ballclub, not only physically, but 
mentally, personally, the whole nine yards.'' 
</P>

	In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Baltimore Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman  
said he won't go to Havana for his team's March 28 exhibition game, 
the first by a major league team in Cuba in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to pitch the day before. I'm not going to go for one  
day,'' said Guzman, who lives in Miami, a city with a heavy Cuban 
population. He said that wasn't a factor, only the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tempe, Ariz., Anaheim Angels ace Chuck Finley pitched one  
shutout inning in his first appearance of the spring, a 4-3 loss to 
a Chicago White Sox split squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley had not pitched previously due to stiffness in his upper  
back. He struck out his first two batters before giving up a single 
to Jeff Abbott, who stole second before Paul Konerko grounded out . 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I could go out Thursday or Friday. I guess I just  
have to get in the flow with everyone else,'' Finley said. ``I have 
three weeks to get ready. I have to get my pitch count up.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Fund-Raiser in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY KEVIN GALVIN   	
</P>
<P>
	STUART, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton attended a fund-raiser in  
Florida on Tuesday, where the Drifters' song ``Stand by Me'' took 
on extra meaning for a leader who little more than a month ago 
survived impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the song after the group's performance, Clinton  
said he couldn't help but think ``about how the American people 
stood by me through thick and thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This country has got to get over believing that our political  
life is about beating each other up and hurting people instead of 
lifting people up and bringing them together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a $500,000 Democratic National Committee  
fund-raiser at trial attorney Willie Gary's home, a mansion along 
the St. Lucie River about 40 minutes north of Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling his own small-town upbringing, Clinton told his  
listeners they had a responsibility to reinvest in the communities 
they came from so that others would have an opportunity to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary credited Clinton with increasing the medium income of black  
households, raising the minimum wage and providing tax credits to 
low-income families. He said that it was extraordinary that 
Clinton, who hailed from a house hard by the railroad tracks in 
Hope, Ark., had come to the home of a man whose father had been a 
sharecropper. 
</P>
<P>
	A massive chandelier dominated the atrium of the home where  
Clinton joined about 250 supporters. Florida Democratic Reps. Alcee 
Hastings and Peter Deutsch joined the president aboard Air Force 
One. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson and incoming DNC co-chair Joe Andrew  
attended the event, as did Minnesota Vikings receiver Cris Carter.	   Andrew cast the affair as another gathering of Democratic forces 
determined to regain control of Congress and retain the presidency 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also had been scheduled to attend a fund-raising  
luncheon in West Palm Beach, but it was canceled because of a death 
in the family of the hosts.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Begins Budget Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans began pushing a $1.74 trillion  
federal budget for fiscal 2000 through a Senate committee Tuesday, 
aiming to leave Social Security surpluses untouched, cut taxes and 
boost defense and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, offered by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., is intended to paint the GOP as pursuing its 
priorities while protecting Social Security and Medicare, two 
widely popular programs that President Clinton and other Democrats 
have repeatedly accused Republicans of jeopardizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would protect them by saying they would only use the  
$1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses projected over the next 
decade to reduce the national debt. Reducing the debt would 
strengthen the economy, making it easier for the government to 
raise money that can be used to pay Social Security and Medicare's 
swelling ranks of beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do one thing with them -- retire the debt load on the American  
public,'' said Domenici of those surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici would allow tax cuts totaling up to $15 billion next  
year and $778 billion over the next 10 years. That would be far 
more than Clinton sought in the budget he proposed last month, 
underlining that reducing taxes remains a defining Republican issue 
as the parties prepare for the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici would set aside another $133 billion over the next  
decade for additional debt reduction, bolstering Medicare or for 
``unexpected emergencies or contingencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is well below the $350 billion Clinton proposed using for  
Medicare during the same period. That prompted Democratic 
complaints that Republicans were using too much of the projected 
surpluses for tax cuts at the expense of Medicare, a distinction 
they seem ready to emphasize all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Medicare beneficiaries -- too bad. Get used to deeper cuts,  
higher costs, fewer services,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New 
Jersey, the committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another contrast, the GOP would use most of the projected  
surpluses from the non-Social Security side of the budget -- $800 
billion over the next decade -- for tax cuts. Clinton would divide 
that money into three roughly equal parts: for Medicare, for 
defense and domestic programs and for helping Americans set up new 
personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also ignore a proposal Clinton made in his budget  
last month to use about one-fifth of the Social Security surpluses 
for government-controlled stock market investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' budget is a blueprint that sets overall tax and  
spending targets but leaves decisions on specifics for later 
legislation. Taking advantage of that, Domenici's plan only hints 
at the answers to tough questions that will have to be answered by 
lawmakers later. 
</P>
<P>
	He does not say which taxes would be cut, but suggests several  
that are possible. These include phased in income-tax rate 
reductions, education credits and an end to the so-called marriage 
penalty, under which some couples pay higher income taxes than they 
would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici says his budget would honor the $536 billion spending  
limit on defense and many domestic programs enacted in the 1997 
budget-balancing deal. But he does not fully identify all the 
savings he would need to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pays for the $133 billion, 10-year fund that could  
finance debt reduction or Medicare in part by assuming that much of 
federal spending will only grow by about 1 percent annually for 
that period -- without detailing how. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Republicans envision the plan as a place-holder  
until this summer. That is when they say the humming economy will 
probably produce higher budget surplus projections, which 
Domenici's budget would set aside to make next year's tax cuts 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will need to set priorities,'' Domenici said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a budget based on Beltway fantasy,'' responded  
Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The package did not say how Social Security or Medicare should  
be shored up for the retirement of the nation's 76 million baby 
boomers, which begins in a decade. Social Security already provides 
pensions to 45 million mostly elderly and disabled people, while 
Medicare supplies health-care insurance to 39 million elderly and 
disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also recommend hefty increases for schools, another  
area where polls show the public trusts Democrats more than 
Republicans. And like Clinton, they would increase the Pentagon's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Budget Committee planned to consider a similar plan on  
Wednesday. The unity between Republicans in the two chambers marked 
a departure from last year, when an internal battle over whether to 
cut taxes caused Congress to fail to produce a budget for the first 
time in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Both budget committees plan to complete their work this week and  
to take their packages to the Senate and House floors next week.

<HEADLINE> Retired General in Sex Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A former deputy inspector general of  
the Army has agreed to a court-martial on charges he had improper 
sexual relationships with the wives of four officers and lied to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale waived his right to a hearing  
before a military jury that was to decide whether to convene 
court-martial proceedings, the Army announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Military prosecutors immediately filed revised charges and said  
the court-martial could begin as early as today, when the 
evidentiary hearing had been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale retired with honor in February 1998, after spending four  
months as a deputy inspector general at the Pentagon despite 
allegations of improprieties while he was a NATO commander in 
southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 53, faces seven counts of improper conduct and one of  
lying to investigators. He is accused of having the relationships 
with wives of subordinate officers in Turkey and in Virginia, 
Maine, Connecticut and Nevada between 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Hale surfaced last year when The  
Washington Times reported that a woman named Donnamaria Carpino had 
accused him of forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in 
Turkey while her husband, an Army colonel, was posted there. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped two charges of obstruction of justice. Hale  
initially faced 17 charges and, if convicted, 56 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible sentence under the revised charges was not made  
clear Monday, said Fort Lewis spokeswoman Mary Casad.

<HEADLINE> First Lady: I Didn't Review Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a grand jury videotape made public  
for the first time Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton testified she 
``never spent any significant time at all'' monitoring records of 
the Whitewater land deal she and President Clinton shared with Jim 
and Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also said on the tape, played at Mrs. McDougal's  
trial, that she was unaware of a $27,600 loan for Whitewater taken 
out in Bill Clinton's name a decade before he became president. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty minutes of the first lady's testimony, recorded at the  
White House last April, were played for the jury in the trial of 
Mrs. McDougal, who is charged with criminal contempt for refusing 
to answer Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's questions about the 
loan and other aspects of the couples' Whitewater business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The new attention comes at a sensitive time for Mrs. Clinton, as  
she is considering a run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' lawyer, David Kendall, had no comment on Starr's  
use of the first lady's videotaped testimony. In it, Mrs. Clinton 
told prosecutors repeatedly that she had little information to 
give. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen these documents before and have no  
information about them,'' she said when asked about a 1982 Clinton 
loan that prosecutors allege is linked through a series of 
transactions to a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 3 1/2 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at the McDougals' trial in the spring of 1996  
that he had never borrowed money from the savings and loan the 
McDougals owned in the 1980s. Three months later, Jim McDougal told 
Starr's office that Clinton had signed documents for the 
transaction. Jim McDougal has since died. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, wearing a yellow suit and serious expression,  
appeared on two television monitors in the federal court Tuesday. 
Her deposition was taped at the White House on April 25, 1998, with 
her lawyers present and played for the Whitewater grand jury four 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	During the questioning, she often put on reading glasses to  
review documents shown to her by Starr deputy Hickman Ewing Jr., at 
one point complaining, ``I can't see anything anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's clipped, businesslike but polite answers  
contrasted with the low-key, friendly approach of Ewing, a career 
federal prosecutor from Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing underscored the seriousness of the occasion by reminding  
Mrs. Clinton of her constitutional rights: ``You ... have the right 
to refuse any question if the truthful answer would tend to 
incriminate you. Do you understand that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I do,'' Mrs. Clinton replied.  
</P>
<P>
	When shown a Nov. 15, 1982, cashier's check for $27,600 made  
payable to ``Bill Clinton,'' Mrs. Clinton answered, ``I'm sorry, 
Mr. Ewing, I don't know anything about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After another question about the loan, she explained, '' I never  
spent any significant time at all looking at the books and records 
of Whitewater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office is using Mrs. Clinton's videotape in an attempt  
to convict Mrs. McDougal of criminal contempt and obstruction for 
refusal to cooperate with prosecutors. Given Mrs. Clinton's 
assertions that she knows little or nothing about the matters in 
question, prosecutors told U.S. District Judge George Howard that 
they have nowhere to turn for answers but to Mrs. McDougal, who 
watched the videotape intently. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing the videotape, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark  
Geragos, said if he had known what was on it he would have 
introduced it himself as evidence. He had objected to showing the 
video. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors ``weren't doing anything here but stalking the  
president and first lady and they were using Mrs. McDougal to get 
to that,'' Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that there's anybody that can follow'' the complex  
financial transactions that Ewing walked Mrs. Clinton through, he 
said. Prosecutors ``spent and wasted taxpayers' money of $40 
million on absolutely nothing,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing questioned Mrs. Clinton on several subjects:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. McDougal and bearing the  
notation ``payoff Clinton.'' The check was used to make a payment 
on the Clinton loan. Mrs. Clinton said ``I do not know'' anything 
about the check. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mrs. Clinton's law firm billing records that indicate she spoke  
with Mrs. McDougal on July 18, 1985, at a time when the McDougals 
were desperately trying to save their floundering S&AMP;L. Mrs. Clinton 
said ``I do not'' know anything about the conversation revealed in 
the billing records, which turned up inside the White House in 1996 
two years after prosecutors subpoenaed them. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has never been questioned about the $27,600 loan,  
which wasn't discovered until early December 1996 when FBI agent 
Mike Patkus, who works for Starr, found a microfilmed copy of the 
cashier's check. The original of the check turned up in 1997 in the 
trunk of an abandoned car. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Mrs. McDougal was given limited immunity from  
prosecution by Starr's office in order to compel her testify. She 
still refused and was jailed for civil contempt. Then she was 
charged with criminal contempt because Starr deemed her a crucial 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, a former employee of the McDougals' savings and  
loan explained why he abandoned the car with the cashier's check 
and other documents inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Floyd testified that he was supposed to be carry Madison  
Guaranty documents to a warehouse in 1988 but dropped off his car 
at a garage for repair. When a dispute arose over the bill, he left 
the car there, forgetting the documents, Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The garage owner opened the car's trunk 10 years later, after a  
tornado, and discovered thousands of S&AMP;L documents. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd was asked why he sought a limited grant of immunity  
from Starr's office before testifying, Mrs. McDougal remarked from 
the defense table: ``Scared.'' That led to a complaint from 
prosecutors and admonishment from the judge.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Remains On Leave From Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman remained on a paid, indefinite  
leave of absence from the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, with 
neither the player nor team having anything definitive to say about 
it other than it continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any comment,'' Lakers spokesman John Black said  
from Minnesota before the Lakers faced the Timberwolves on Tuesday 
night in the second game of a six-game road trip. ``We don't have 
any idea when he'll rejoin the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black reiterated that Rodman was being paid. Rodman, who joined  
the Lakers last month, receives $12,195 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rodman hired a publicist -- the Beverly Hills firm of  
Baker, Winokur and Ryder, which issued a statement late Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis appreciates the level of interest that people have  
taken in his life. He's currently dealing with personal matters and 
when they are resolved, looks forward to rejoining the Lakers with 
the same intensity that he's displayed throughout his career. 
Dennis is thankful for the support of his teammates and the Lakers' 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder each of the last seven  
seasons, has played in nine games for the Lakers -- all victories. 
He is averaging 10.3 rebounds in 14.8 minutes of action. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman missed practice Saturday, and didn't travel with the team  
to Sacramento, where the Lakers lost to the Kings 105-101 on Sunday 
night to snap a 10-game winning streak.

<HEADLINE> NFL Realignment an Issue for Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- With tentative approval given to Los Angeles for  
the NFL's 32nd franchise, one of the next topics league owners will 
discuss is realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue won't be addressed during these meetings, although  
preliminary discussions were held and commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
found enough support for realignment. The 32nd team wouldn't begin 
play until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the league has much choice. The current setup of six  
divisions would require two divisions with six teams and the rest 
with five, which makes little sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a fair amount of discussion of realignment, and  
there is quite a bit of sentiment on moving ahead with eight 
divisions of four teams,'' Tagliabue said. ``There clearly is not 
enough information or time to get any kind of consensus here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll come back later this year with an alignment proposal of  
eight divisions with four teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only concrete proposal offered thus far comes from  
Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney. He favors realignment highly 
flavored by geography. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney also would like to see as close to a balanced schedule as  
possible. That would feature two games vs. each division opponent, 
four intraconference games against another division, four 
interconference games against a full division, and two wild-card 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is any question that we have to realign,''  
said Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. ``It's got to happen when we 
get to 32. I don't know if it would be eight divisions of four 
teams or what, but that looks like the most logical plan at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any realignment plan is bound to meet with resistance from teams  
which would see certain annual rivalries dissolve. For example, the 
Washington Redskins surely would be placed in a different division 
from the Dallas Cowboys on a geographic basis. How often would they 
get to play under such a system? 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans want to see something they can reason with,'' Rooney  
said. ``They would like to be able to see all the teams, and the 
way the schedule is now, we'll never see some teams.''

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Baseball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kerry Wood's season ended almost before it started.  
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, whose fastball dazzled fans during  
his rookie season, will undergo ligament replacement surgery on his 
right elbow within two weeks. Rehabilitation is expected to take 
about one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's a huge loss for us -- the NL Rookie of the Year  
and a huge part of our rotation,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch 
said Wednesday after an MRI in Chicago revealed the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander has had a tender elbow since the  
Cubs drafted him out of high school in June 1995 and he missed all 
of last September while it was sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood returned to throw five innings in the Cubs' final playoff  
game against Atlanta, then was hospitalized twice at the start of 
spring training because of an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. The latest injury occurred Saturday, on 
the first warmup pitch of the second inning of his 1999 debut 
against Anaheim. He wound up throwing 26 pitches over two innings, 
the only action he'll see in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to get a second opinion and allow swelling to  
subside before going ahead with surgery. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the 
Anaheim Angels team physician, or Dr. James Andrews most likely 
will perform a ligament replacement, a procedure considered radical 
when Dr. Frank Jobe used it to save Tommy John's career in 1974 but 
now commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad for him, too bad for baseball,'' Atlanta manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I don't like to face the guy, but he's a special, 
special pitcher. We need those to come along in the game like that, 
who really pack them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gary Sheffield returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers  
camp at Vero Beach, Fla, after taking two days off to attend to 
personal matters. He didn't play against the Florida Marlins due to 
a sore right shoulder, but threw lightly and took batting practice 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have him healthy,'' manager Davey Johnson said.  
``He's important to this ballclub, not only physically, but 
mentally, personally, the whole nine yards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Baltimore Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman  
said he won't go to Havana for his team's March 28 exhibition game, 
the first by a major league team in Cuba in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to pitch the day before. I'm not going to go for one  
day,'' said Guzman, who lives in Miami, a city with a heavy Cuban 
population. He said that wasn't a factor, only the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tempe, Ariz., Anaheim Angels ace Chuck Finley pitched one  
shutout inning in his first appearance of the spring, a 4-3 loss to 
a Chicago White Sox split squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley had not pitched previously due to stiffness in his upper  
back. He struck out his first two batters before giving up a single 
to Jeff Abbott, who stole second before Paul Konerko grounded out . 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I could go out Thursday or Friday. I guess I just  
have to get in the flow with everyone else,'' Finley said. ``I have 
three weeks to get ready. I have to get my pitch count up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:  
</P>
<P>
                         *Astros, 8, Royals 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Haines City, Fla., Scott Elarton combined with five relievers  
on a five-hitter, stopping Kansas City's nine-game winning streak. 
The Royals are 11-2, losing to Houston twice. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Orioles 11, Cardinals 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Lauderdale, Cal Ripken drove in four runs with two  
doubles, and Brady Anderson and Charles Johnson hit two-run 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Tigers 14, Reds 8    	
</P>
<P>
	At Lakeland, Fla., rookie Gabe Kapler hit a two-run homer and  
Frank Catalanotto had a three-run shot. Pete Harnisch was tagged 
for 12 runs, eight hits and three walks in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Indians 12, Braves 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Roberto Alomar hit a three-run homer and  
Omar Vizquel had three hits and drove in three runs. Rich Sexson 
and Travis Fryman added solo homers. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Rangers 10, Pirates 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Bradenton Fla., Jon Shave's triple highlighted a six-run  
seventh inning that also featured five Pittsburgh errors. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Devil Rays 8, Phillies 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At Clearwater, Fla., Wilson Alvarez pitched four strong innings,  
Wade Boggs had three hits and Fred McGriff hit a two-run homer. 
Phillies ace Curt Schilling allowed two runs and five hits in three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Expos 5, Mets 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., Jason Isringhausen pitched two shutout innings  
in his third appearance this spring following 15-month layoff 
caused by surgery on his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Marlins 7, Dodgers 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Derrek Lee hit a three-run homer that capped a  
five-run seventh-inning rally, and Kevin Brown allowed seven hits 
but just one run in 4 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Mariners 6, Cubs 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Peoria, Ariz., Jay Buhner returned to right field for the  
first time since a ligament in his right elbow was replaced last 
Sept. 9. He played five innings, making one throw. 
</P>
<P>
                 *White Sox (ss) 4, Diamondbacks (ss) 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., Mike Sirotka pitched five no-hit innings and  
Magglio Ordonez hit a three-run double. Arizona's Randy Johnson 
gave up one hit in four shutout innings with five strikeouts and 
one walk. 
</P>
<P>
             *Diamondbacks (ss) 2, Rockies 2, tie, 11 innings    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., Kurt Abbott drove in the tying run with a  
sacrifice fly in the eighth. The game, halted when both managers 
ran out of pitchers, was played in chilly 57-degree weather with 
wind and intermittent light rain. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Giants 8, Padres 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Scottsdale, Ariz., Charlie Hayes had two hits and drove in  
two runs, including a tiebreaking homer.

<HEADLINE> Date Set for Trial in 1966 Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- A judge has refused to dismiss murder  
and arson charges against a businessman in the 1966 Ku Klux Klan 
firebombing death of civil rights leader Vernon Dahmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Circuit Judge Richard McKenzie ordered Charles Noble to  
go on trial on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble was first tried in 1969 on federal conspiracy charges in  
connection with Dahmer's killing. That case ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The state case was reopened in 1991. Last May, Noble was  
indicted along with former Klan Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers and 
Deavours Nix. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowers was convicted in August and sentenced to life in prison.  
Nix died in September before standing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Joe Sam Owens has argued that Noble was denied  
a speedy trial, and also challenged the credibility of the 
prosecution's likely key witness, former Klansman Billy Roy Pitts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitts has testified that he took part in the firebombing of  
Dahmer's home and store in Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified at Bowers' trial last year that Noble was one of  
the Klansmen who burned Dahmer's store while others firebombed the 
nearby house where the Dahmer family slept. Dahmer stayed inside 
the burning house, firing his gun out a window to hold the 
attackers off while his wife and children escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahmer's son, Dennis Dahmer, said after Monday's hearing that  
family members ``look forward to the trial date ... so we can get 
this behind us.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Raise Prices Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Analysts say some of the blame for the latest  
round of airfare hikes can be placed on rising fuel costs, though 
high demand for tickets is just as important a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the airline industry upped their business  
fares about 1 percent and their leisure fares by about 3 percent, 
the second price increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they continue with this momentum, we could see the highest  
rates in many moons,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of BestFares.com 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines started the latest round of increases last  
Thursday with a 1 percent increase in business fares and 3 percent 
for leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airfare increases by an individual airline usually don't stick  
unless other major competitors follow suit, which is exactly what 
happened over the weekend. The increases come on top of those 
imposed in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a flight from New York to Los Angeles booked 21  
days in advance that cost $562 on Jan. 1 now costs $602, according 
to Bestfares.com, Parsons' Web site. The same flight booked on 
short notice -- as many business travelers do -- rose from $1,836 to 
$1,890. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have now boosted leisure fares 7 percent this year  
and business fares are up 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines played down fuel costs -- which remain quite  
low-- as the major reason for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly that was a factor, but we were matching the  
others,'' said American spokesman Bill Dreslin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet fuel cost about 36 cents a gallon in the first week of  
March, said a report from the securities firm BT Alex. Brown Inc. 
That's up 7 percent from the previous week, but still down 19 
percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to see a little bit of a creep back up,'' said  
Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin, without providing specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have made five attempts to raise prices so far in  
1999 after relative stability for about 18 months. The air carriers 
were unable to increase prices primarily because Northwest Airlines 
was holding out. Northwest has been having labor problems with 
flight attendants and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, Northwest matched the rise on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	While business travel ticket prices have been rising during the  
last three years, most advance-purchase tickets have fallen, 
meaning average prices have been somewhat stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong U.S. economy has kept demand up among business  
travelers and vacationers and airline profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, for instance, filled a record 73 percent of its  
seats last year. The industry average was 62 percent in 1990, 
according the Air Transport Association, a trade group, but the 
average has increased steadily through the decade. In 1997, the 
average hit 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After a slowdown in the last quarter of 1998, some analysts  
worried that the industry might be in for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, UAL Corp. said its earnings per share would  
be about $1.35 for the first quarter, well above analyst 
predictions of $1.12 as compiled by the research firm First Call. 
Annual profits will be between $10 and $12 a share, UAL said, while 
analysts expected $9.12. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL, the parent company of United, said that economic  
uncertainty present in the fourth-quarter had dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy passenger demand has meant few empty middle seats and few  
alternatives for passengers when a flight was canceled. Passengers 
have been increasingly unhappy with service. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent snowstorm more than 4,500 travelers were  
stranded by Northwest for up to 8 1/2 hours aboard 34 planes unable to 
take off or reach passenger gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then several bills that would strengthen the rights of air  
travelers have been debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is acting to relieve the pressure by buying more  
planes. Even more capacity is expected by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investments like new planes keep up the pressure on airlines to  
raise fares or face lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be concerned about the sizable amount of  
capacity growth that we expect the majors to have in third quarter 
'99,'' said Susan Donofrio, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Germany Adopts New Citizenship Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet  
approved a modernization of Germany's 1913 citizenship law today, 
hoping to end weeks of debate about the integration of foreign 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a historic shift, the changes cut the link between German  
blood ties and nationality. But the government dropped a 
controversial plan to make dual nationality the rule because of 
opposition from conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the ruling Social Democrats and Greens agreed last  
week to an opposition proposal designed to pass the bill in 
parliament, where the coalition lacks an upper-house majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower house is to take up the law Friday. Schroeder wants  
the law passed by May, apparently to keep the matter out of the 
next state election in June in Bremen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure by the small Greens party for wide-ranging dual  
nationality has created strains with Schroeder over the citizenship 
reform, hurting the government's image. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise bill gives automatic German citizenship for the  
first time to children born to foreign residents. 
</P>
<P>
	They would also be able to keep their parents' nationality, but  
would have to choose one at age 23. Adults would be allowed to hold 
two passports only in rare hardship cases, as under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the reform recognizes that Germany is becoming  
increasingly multicultural and brings its citizenship rules in line 
with the rest of Europe. Opponents of regular dual nationality 
argue it actually hinders integration by leading to split 
loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has some 7.3 million foreigners, nearly 10 percent of  
the population. About 2 million are Turks.

<HEADLINE> Is Elway on Way Back to Broncos? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The chance to be the first quarterback to win  
three straight Super Bowls seems to be enticing John Elway back for 
a 17th season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the playoffs, the 38-year-old Elway said he was ``99  
percent'' sure he would retire. But after leading Denver to its 
second straight title, he may be wavering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what John's going to do,'' coach Mike Shanahan  
said Tuesday. ``I don't think John knows what he's going to do. But 
the opportunity to try for a threepeat has made John rethink about 
retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wishful thinking?  
</P>
<P>
	Later, Shanahan was talking about the trade of Jeff Lewis, one  
of his young quarterbacks, to Carolina. ``If John comes back, he 
would have been fourth on the depth chart. It would have been hard 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might have been a hint.  
</P>
<P>
	Either way, expect to hear from Elway before April 5, when the  
Broncos begin preseason workouts. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHAT? ME RETIRE?* Jimmy Johnson, who quit for about 12 hours  
after the Dolphins were eliminated from the playoffs by Denver, 
said he's now as enthusiastic as ever about coaching again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't change the way I am,'' said Johnson, who decided to  
quit after his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Johnson said, his father will stay with him in Miami  
for part of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he may scrap the original plan to have assistant  
head coach Dave Wannstedt, his close friend and former Chicago 
coach, stay late and finish up game plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll both stay late,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REPLAY NOT FOR BENGALS:* The Cincinnati Bengals usually vote  
against instant replay as an aid for officiating. Coach Bruce 
Coslet made it clear his team will say no again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the form that it is being presented,'' Coslet said Tuesday,  
``I don't care for it much. It makes the coaches referees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet strenuously objects to the coaches' challenge system that  
is part of the instant replay proposal to be voted on this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to an observer in the last two minutes of a  
half, why not go to an observer all the time?'' he said. ``The 
thing is, if you are trying to correct mistakes, why leave it on 
the coach to throw a flag or sound a buzzer? Correct it however you 
must.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Coslet, New York Jets coach Bill Parcells -- who  
is not at the league meetings -- has indicated he objects to the 
proposed system. Still, in the wake of so many controversial 
officiating calls last season, it is expected to pass. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HELPING PEYTON:* Indianapolis Colts coach Jim Mora thinks one  
of the best ways to help quarterback Peyton Manning improve is 
through his team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say we could have six new starters,'' Mora said. ``We were  
not a good defensive team. Our emphasis in free agency has been on 
defense and, most likely, with the fourth pick in the draft, it 
will be a defensive player. But that's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would help him a lot if we get better on defense and will  
get him on the field more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora doesn't envision the Colts making big inroads in the tough  
AFC East this season, although he expects marked improvement after 
a 3-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go, so even if we're improved, we won't  
turn this thing around in one or two years. It will take more than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he is not intimidated by being in a division with four teams  
that made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I battled the 49ers for 11 years,'' he said of his seasons  
coaching the Saints, ``and now ... there are four teams, and there 
are the Colts. That's the balance of power right now.''

<HEADLINE> NIreland Police Ask Bomb Probe Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The car-bomb assassination of  
Rosemary Nelson, a prominent lawyer who defended IRA suspects, was 
designed to halt Northern Ireland's peace process, politicians said 
Tuesday as local police asked the FBI to help in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish and British political leaders from all political stripes  
denounced the killing of Mrs. Nelson, a 40-year-old mother of 
three. Most of them were in Washington for a series of St. 
Patrick's Day meetings Wednesday between President Clinton and 
representatives of all eight parties who agreed to the Northern 
Ireland peace accord last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nelson died Monday, two hours after a bomb blew apart her  
car as she drove away from her home in Lurgan, 30 miles southwest 
of Belfast. An anti-Catholic terror group calling itself the Red 
Hand Defenders claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the car bomb was  
``very clearly designed to sabotage the peace process at this very 
critical time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who killed Rosemary Nelson did so because they thought  
it would destroy the Good Friday agreement,'' said British Northern 
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam. ``(She was) a brave woman who stood up 
for what she believed in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart read a statement from  
Clinton, calling the bombing ``a despicable and cowardly act by the 
enemies of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her funeral was scheduled for Thursday in Lurgan.  
</P>
<P>
	Due to the nature of her work, Mrs. Nelson had no shortage of  
enemies. She also had complained of being threatened by officers 
from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief of police in Northern Ireland,  
sought help from the FBI and asked David Phillips, the chief 
constable in England's Kent County, to head the investigation into 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize this is an unprecedented case in the nature of the  
sort of allegations that have been made,'' Flanagan said Tuesday. 
``It is important that we give this investigation a totally 
independent direction and that it is given an international 
dimension as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Scotland Yard officer recently completed an  
investigation into Mrs. Nelson's complaint that some officers had 
accused her of being a terrorist and of being sexually involved 
with her clients. The results of the investigation have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nelson represented a Catholic man, Colin Duffy, in his  
successful appeal after he was convicted of murdering a soldier. 
She represented Duffy again when he was charged with murdering two 
police officers in Lurgan in 1997, but those charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	She served as the attorney for the family of Robert Hamill, a  
Catholic who was beaten to death by Protestant loyalists in 1997. 
The family was considering legal action against the police, 
alleging they failed to come to Hamill's assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nelson also advised Catholic residents of the Garvaghy Road  
in Portadown, the focus of a long-running and bitter confrontation 
with the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization that has 
insisted on marching down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, the Protestant politician who has been designated  
to head the new Northern Ireland government, said the use of a 
sophisticated booby-trap bomb suggested the involvement of 
mainstream paramilitary groups, which are officially observing a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble is among those coming to the White House, as well as  
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and 
Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of Northern Ireland's new Protestant-Catholic  
government has been held up by an argument over IRA weapons. 
Clinton administration officials say the meetings Wednesday aim to 
rebuild confidence in the stalled peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will use the St. Patrick's Day celebration and  
the gathering of Northern Ireland leaders here in Washington on 
Wednesday to reiterate the importance of moving forward,'' Lockhart 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bills To Give Flutie $22M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills are trying to keep  
everyone happy. But quarterback Rob Johnson can't be thrilled with 
the contract extension signed by Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson isn't happy about the agreement that will give Flutie  
a four-year, $22 million deal, he isn't saying much about it -- yet. 
Flutie's extension, expected to be signed today, will also pay the 
Pro Bowl quarterback a $6 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the roles were reversed when Johnson got big bucks  
and Flutie was headed for the bench even before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After Flutie secured the starting job last season, the injured  
Johnson said of Flutie's contract, ``If it does (go on beyond this 
year), I probably won't be here. You can't pay a guy this much to 
be a backup, and I'm not a backup in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also said he would re-evaluate the situation with agent  
Leigh Steinberg after the season if he remained the No. 2 guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rob may have said that last year,'' Steinberg said Monday  
night. ``But Rob's point of view now is that he'll always be 
competitive and always want to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Johnson discussed the situation with Bills  
general manager John Butler on Monday and that the quarterback does 
not want to go elsewhere. ``He's staying right there,'' the agent 
said. ``He'll just make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's Boston-based agent, Jack Mula, who last week called the  
month-long negotiations ``arduous,'' said the deal was all but 
wrapped up over the weekend, when Flutie spoke with Bills owner 
Ralph Wilson and expressed a desire to remain with the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo is the team that gave Doug a chance,'' Mula said. ``He  
still wants to give something back. Buffalo put the money where the 
mouth is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, last year's starter until going out with a rib injury  
in the fifth game, signed a $25 million contract last offseason. 
Flutie took over and led the Bills to a 10-6 record and a wild-card 
playoff berth after they started the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash crunch at the quarterback position made for tough  
negotiations, Mula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo had to find a way to reward Flutie while keeping Rob  
Johnson,'' Mula said. ``That's why it was difficult. I'm happy. 
Doug's happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paying two quarterbacks over $5 million per year.  
That's a first for the National Football League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said at the league meetings in Phoenix that the team  
``needs two No. 1 quarterbacks'' and will keep both Johnson and 
Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not cut or trade Rob Johnson,'' Wilson said with  
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie is just the latest veteran quarterback to parlay a strong  
1998 season into a big contract. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde received a $19.5  
million three-year extension, and Randall Cunningham reportedly 
received a $25 million deal from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde took New York to the AFC East title. He was 12-1  
after replacing Glenn Foley as starter, and threw 29 TD passes with 
only seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a Pro Bowl year and selection as NFL Comeback Player of  
the Year, Flutie's status for next season remained uncertain after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie signed as a free agent after eight seasons in the  
Canadian Football League and was told he would have a shot at the 
starting job in Buffalo. But he became Johnson's backup even before 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He posted a 7-3 mark in his starts, including 5-1 in six home  
starts, and completed 57.1 percent of his passes for 2,711 yards 
and 20 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Reporter's Sentencing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The newspaper reporter who stole voice mail  
from the Chiquita banana company may have to wait longer to learn 
whether he goes to prison, lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gallagher, fired by The Cincinnati Enquirer in June, is  
scheduled to be sentenced Friday in Hamilton County Common Pleas 
Court. His lawyer expects a postponement because Gallagher first is 
expected to testify for the prosecution against former Chiquita 
Brands International Inc. lawyer George Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, now a Salt Lake City lawyer, is accused of helping  
Gallagher steal the voice-mail messages for stories he wrote 
criticizing Cincinnati-based Chiquita's business practices. The 
Enquirer published the stories May 3. In June, it renounced them, 
apologized to Chiquita on the front page and paid Chiquita more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is trying to have the felony charges against him  
dismissed. A hearing in that case had been scheduled Tuesday, but 
was postponed to April 5 because special prosecutor Daniel Breyer 
is trying a case in neighboring Clermont County. Ventura's trial is 
still scheduled for April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's former home telephone number has been disconnected  
and he could not be reached for comment Tuesday. His lawyer, 
Patrick Hanley, said Gallagher is willing to testify against 
Ventura if prosecutors request that. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Gallagher pleaded guilty to unlawful interception  
of communications and unauthorized access to computer systems. He 
could be sentenced to as much as 2 1/2 years in prison and fined a 
maximum $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has pleaded innocent to five counts of unlawful  
interception of communications and five counts of unauthorized 
access to computer systems. He could get 12 1/2 years in prison if 
convicted.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Agree To Acquire Harbaugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jim Harbaugh, once known as ``Captain  
Comeback,'' is on his way to the San Diego Chargers, a team in 
serious need of a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh has been virtually penciled in as the opening-day  
starter after the Chargers agreed Monday to terms of a trade with 
the Baltimore Ravens. The deal is contingent on Harbaugh reworking 
his contract and the Ravens acquiring Scott Mitchell from the 
Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be the start of a new identity for San Diego,''  
Chargers coach Mike Riley said from the owners meetings in Phoenix. 
``I'm excited about this. I think it's a big accomplishment in the 
offseason to get Jim coming our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau certainly was happy with the  
news. After the Chargers finished 5-11, Seau, leader of the NFL's 
top-rated defense, publicly called for the Chargers to get a 
veteran quarterback following the poor showing of rookie Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it's a done deal where we can be confident going  
into the first minicamp,'' Seau said Monday night. ``It's nice we 
have a guy that has the tenacity that Jim Harbaugh has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard said it was his  
understanding that the Lions have agreed to send Mitchell to 
Baltimore, which would then allow the Ravens to deal Harbaugh to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shook hands on it,'' Beathard said of the deal with the  
Ravens. ``Nothing's official until it's all turned into the league 
...But we have confidence it will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News reported today  
that the Lions were prepared to trade Mitchell to Baltimore in 
exchange for the Ravens' third-round draft choice this spring and a 
fourth- or fifth-round pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the News, the deal is so near completion that  
Mitchell's agent, Tony Agnone, said his client obtained permission 
from Baltimore Colts Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas to wear 
his uniform number, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade could be announced as early as today, the Detroit  
newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harbaugh deal would likely keep the troubled Leaf on the  
bench, where he'd be expected to learn from Harbaugh, who's 
entering his 13th season. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said there was always the chance Leaf would win the job in  
training camp, but added: ``My guess is that Jim is our starting 
quarterback on opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh reportedly has said that he's willing to take a  
significant cut in his $3.25 million salary for 1999 in order to 
play in San Diego. Beathard wouldn't comment on salary figures, but 
a source familiar with the negotiations said Harbaugh would be 
given a two-year deal worth approximately $2.75 million, plus 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers agreed to send Baltimore their fifth-round pick in  
2000, or a fourth-round pick if Harbaugh plays 50 percent of the 
time and the Chargers win at least nine games in 1999. The latter 
scenario would require a dramatic improvement for the Chargers, 
who've won only nine games combined the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Chargers' problems last year stemmed from poor play  
by Leaf and Craig Whelihan, who combined to throw 34 interceptions 
and only 10 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was the second pick in the 1998 draft and received an  
$11.25 million signing bonus as part of a $31.25 million contract. 
He was benched after nine starts because of ineffective play and 
immature behavior off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting Jim Harbaugh because we think this gives us a  
chance to give the defense help to win some games,'' Beathard said. 
``This is a great situation for Jim and I think the players will be 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1995 season, Harbaugh was dubbed ``Captain  
Comeback'' after leading the Colts to a series of improbable wins 
that ended one completion short of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those victories was over the defending AFC champion  
Chargers in the wild-card round, 35-20, at San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Russians Fight To Get Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Alexander Smolensky, the head of one of Russia's  
largest private banks, had a brusque answer last fall for 
depositors who demanded that their money be released from frozen 
accounts: Go ahead and sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past six months, persistent SBS-Agro Bank customers  
took up the challenge and won judgments worth nearly $10.8 million, 
according to the International Confederation of Consumers' Unions. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the sluggish world of Russian justice, winning a lawsuit  
doesn't mean getting satisfaction. Of more than 1,100 depositors 
who have won court orders to return their deposits frozen after the 
August financial crisis, only 23 have actually laid hands on their 
money. And the government seems as loath as the bank to fix that. 
</P>
<P>
	When Russia's financial crisis hit last year, landing hundreds  
of banks on the brink of insolvency, the Central Bank moved to help 
save the larger ones, considered key to the country's financial 
system. But critics accuse the government and Central Bank of 
frequently favoring bank owners over customers. 
</P>
<P>
	With two high-profile banks already in bankruptcy proceedings  
and a new bankruptcy law for insolvent banks on the books this 
month, SBS-Agro depositors say they're in a fight against time. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank has already changed its name to Soyuz, or Union,  
stoking suspicions that it is trying to evade responsibility for 
its old SBS-Agro obligations. And court bailiffs have simply let 
the court orders pile up instead of ensuring that the bank pays. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say SBS-Agro depositors have little hope of  
recovering their money if the bank goes bankrupt. But how can they 
force the bank to pony up? 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank frankly announces in the media that it doesn't want  
to fulfill the court decisions,'' said Sergei Trukhachev, vice 
president of the Russian chapter of the International Confederation 
of Consumers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank says ``that only those depositors who don't file suit  
will get their money back,'' added Trukhachev, whose telephone 
hotline is clogged with up to 200 calls a day from depositors 
seeking advice on how to retrieve their money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy expose, the Novye Izvestiya newspaper has accused  
the government and Central Bank of yielding to pressure from 
SBS-Agro and preventing its depositors from recovering their funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank hasn't been bankrupted; the bank is operating. The  
bank is using all the advantages of an acting bank and even so it 
doesn't pay,'' Otto Latsis, deputy editor for economics at the 
daily, said after the report was published. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is impossible without ... the connivance of the Central  
Bank,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SBS-Agro was the nation's second-largest retail network, with  
some 5.7 million depositors holding more than $500 million in hard 
currency and the equivalent of $112 million in rubles. 
</P>
<P>
	It has gotten two stabilization loans from the Central Bank  
totaling $956 million, Novye Izvestiya reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the financial boost, the Central Bank has  
protected the bank, refusing court orders to pay depositors from 
SBS-Agro accounts it holds, and allowing SBS-Agro to form a new 
bank, feeding fears that it will saddle the old bank with all its 
debts and guard its assets in the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Central Bank has pulled licenses from Tokobank  
and Inkombank, and allowed bankruptcy cases against them to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	SBS took over the bankrupt state agricultural bank in 1996,  
becoming a main conduit for the government's preferential 
agricultural loans. Critics say that gives it an important role in 
the country's finances and politics, buying allies for the central 
government among regional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Novye Izvestiya allegations have awakened some  
high-level attention. Nikolai Bordyuzha, President Boris Yeltsin's 
chief of staff and head of the National Security Council, ordered 
investigators to look into them. Bailiffs were soon summoned to a 
meeting at the Justice Ministry to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	SBS-Agro has denied any wrongdoing and even accused Novye  
Izvestiya reporters of trying to smear the bank because they have 
been unable to draw money from their frozen accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Interior Ministry officials recently reopened a criminal  
investigation into seven-year-old embezzlement accusations against 
bank chief Smolensky.

<HEADLINE> Son of Lions Owner Complains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A son of Detroit Lions owner William Clay Ford  
says proposals to grab the Lions' traditional Thanksgiving Day game 
shows how ``mean-spirited'' the NFL has become. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Ford Jr., named the team's vice chairman four years ago,  
was attending an NFL owners meeting this week in Phoenix. The 
owners were expected to discuss the possibility of rotating the two 
games -- the other is in Dallas -- among the 31 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having trouble with this league,'' Ford told the Detroit  
Free Press for a story Tuesday. ``It's a very mean-spirited league, 
the lack of goodwill, the lack of transparency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could look the chairman of General Motors or Toyota in the  
eye and if they shake your hand and they give you their word, it's 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it's not the case. There's always a hidden agenda. All I  
can say is thank goodness the sport of football is still a great 
sport, because the business of football isn't,'' said the younger 
Ford, who also is chairman of Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he now understands why his father soured on his fellow  
NFL club owners years ago. The senior Ford stopped attending 
owners' meetings, leaving it to other team executives to represent 
the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Jr. has given the Lions a more active voice, holding  
positions on the NFL finance and international committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was absolutely right, and I give him his due,'' Ford  
Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his remarks aren't only about proposals to rotate the  
Thanksgiving Day games, made by owners Lamar Hunt of Kansas City 
and Tom Benson of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's the Thanksgiving Day game or the Redskins sale,  
everybody has their own agenda,'' Ford Jr. said. ``Nothing's ever 
above board; everybody's whispering in the corners, and to me 
that's just not the way you do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you do business is you lay it all on the table and  
everybody has different opinions, you bang heads, count votes and 
that's it. I've never been part of anything like this.

<P>
	Hunt said the Lions or Cowboys shouldn't have the game  
automatically, regardless of the Lions' 65-year history with the 
holiday game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it should be considered, but on the other hand, this  
is something we've raised for over 15 years,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition is longer in Detroit's case, but the tradition  
in Dallas' case really is a much shorter time period, and I don't 
think that should overcome what is clearly a competitive 
advantage,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt and Benson propose the games be rotated among any of the  
NFL's 31 teams that express an interest, with the Lions and Cowboys 
getting preferential treatment for the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford told the newspaper the Lions and Cowboys can gather enough  
support among the other 29 teams to keep the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would need support by 24 of the 31 owners to pass.  
Detroit has hosted a Thanksgiving Day game since 1934, the year the 
franchise moved from Portsmouth, Ohio. The Dallas Cowboys followed 
in 1966.

	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Gov. Tommy Thompson is considering forming  
an exploratory committee consider a possible run for the Republican 
presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said Tuesday the committee would examine whether he  
could raise the money and political backing it would take to seek 
the presidency. He said he probably will decide by the end of next 
month whether to form an exploratory committee, the traditional

	The four-term Republican governor said that as yet he is waiting  
and watching as the field of hopefuls shapes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George Bush is considered the leading prospect so  
far, followed by Elizabeth Dole, former director of the American

<HEADLINE>  Sosa, McGwire Tied With 5 Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The start of the 1999 home run race didn't  
wait for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire hit two Sunday to take over the major league lead  
at five. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa answered back with two Monday to tie him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but this is spring training,'' Sosa said. ``Ain't no  
competition. We're just going out trying to do our jobs and make 
fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's second home run was a moon shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the left-field fence at HoHoKam Park, about 360 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the 50-foot-high scoreboard, about 30 more feet back.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the back wall of the ballpark, about 10 feet behind the  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Over four full rows of cars in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Arizona, where balls rifle through the thin Sonoran  
Desert air. But by any stretch, this was a rocket, a 450-foot-plus 
bomb of a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Tim Raines turned to the crowd on the berm behind  
the fence and started laughing. Then he shrugged his shoulders, as 
in: ``What was I supposed to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit the ball, I don't look how far it's going to go,''  
Sosa said after driving in four runs in the Chicago Cubs' 10-7 win 
over the Oakland Athletics. ``I just let you people do that. I just 
try to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez hit a pair of homers off loser Kenny Rogers. Sosa  
followed Hernandez's first-inning homer with a solo shot to 
left-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit a two-run homer off Rogers in the third, and Sosa  
hit his monster shot off Gil Heredia in the fourth, a three-run 
drive that made it 10-2. After blowing his traditional kiss in 
honor of his mother, Sosa bowed to the fans, a habit he picked up 
during last year's All-Star tour of Japan. He says he intends to 
bow after each home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some balls up, and the Cubs didn't miss them,'' A's  
manager Art Howe said. ``Right-handed hitters had a field day today 
with the wind blowing to left field. They capitalized on every 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After thrilling the nation with their historic home-run race  
last summer, won by McGwire 70-66, the pair are doing it again this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa didn't see McGwire's homers on the highlight shows Sunday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sleeping,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was tagged for six runs and eight hits in three innings.  
He's lost both his starts this spring, allowing nine earned runs in 
five innings, a 16.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through this,'' he said. ``I feel like right  
now, my location, it's not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Results of Kerry Wood's MRI exam weren't expected until  
today. ... Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer off Terry Adams in the 
eighth and Domingo Cedeno hit a two-run homer off Ray King in the 
ninth. ... Ben Grieve was 4-for-5 with an RBI. ... Winner Steve 
Trachsel allowed two runs and five hits in three innings.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A late rally in soybean futures led grains higher Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade on hopes that the government would put more 
land in a conservation set-aside program. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, gold and silver futures dropped.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) proposed idling up to 10 million acres  
before spring planting, pushing soybeans higher toward the close of 
trading, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get news like this ... everybody just scrambles,''  
said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in Iowa. 
``Soybeans are so depressed to begin with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May soybeans rose to their highest level in almost a month  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans shook off news that the dry weather in South America  
will hold at least through Wednesday, facilitating the harvest of 
large corn and soybean crops in Argentina and Brazil. Analysts said 
the news had been expected and already factored into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat surged higher at the close Tuesday, following soybeans, on  
word of the possible acreage set-asides. Wheat had been mixed 
earlier as market participants balanced news of strong export 
demand with forecasts for more rain in the hard red winter wheat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also followed soybeans higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for May delivery were up 11 3/4 cents to $4.82 3/4 a bushel;  
May wheat was up 4 1/4 cents to $2.76 1/2 a bushel; May corn was up 3 3/4 
cents to $2.23 3/4 a bushel; and May oats were up 3/4 cent to $1.10 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell to a 6 1/2-month low Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after President Clinton recommended that the International 
Monetary Fund sell part of its reserves to help reduce debts of 
impoverished nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's suggestion, made during a speech at the State  
Department about Africa, followed similar proposals from Britain, 
France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	While a longheld policy of the United States, it's believed to  
be the first time Clinton has publicly voiced his support. An IMF 
spokesman confirmed the fund is considering just such a strategy to 
assist poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold had dropped 2 percent Monday after French President Jacques  
Chirac said he might support the selling of IMF gold. Gold fell to 
a 19-year low in August on IMF sale expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	April gold fell $3.90 to $283.70 per troy ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange on  
rumors that billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
wants to sell its stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
	May silver fell to a 2 1/2-month low before rebounding slightly on  
feelings a selloff may have been overdone. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver declined early in the day as the dollar rose against the  
euro, making dollar-priced metals more expensive to European 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	April silver was off 7 cents to $5.02 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Duchess Battles for $24M Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALNWICK, England (AP) -- A century or so ago, the 4th Duke of  
Northumberland restored ``by his grace and munificence'' Alnwick 
Castle, the magnificent medieval fortress where his family has 
lived for nearly 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As astute as they are aristocratic, his descendants are  
undertaking a project as fittingly grandiose: A $24 million garden 
that could be Europe's most ambitious horticultural venture this 
century and a strong tourist draw. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, a decidedly modern duchess is looking for a  
commercial sponsor, and she's using the Internet. If she succeeds, 
a foreign name is likely to be attached to the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because in Britain, the duchess has met resistance.  
</P>
<P>
	If the House of Percy, a dynasty that ranks among the grandest  
of British bluebloods, wants to build a great garden, well, ``why 
shouldn't the Percys pick up the tab?'' the Evening Standard asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be easy, the newspaper noted, for the family ``to  
scrape a few spare millions together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, it's not that simple, the 40-year-old duchess insists.  
``People don't understand -- you can't just take a Canaletto off a 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bubbling with enthusiasm, the former Isobel Jane Miller,  
daughter of a Scottish stockbroker, sits in a huge kitchen created 
from a vault in Alnwick (pronounced Annick), the biggest inhabited 
castle in Britain after Queen Elizabeth II's beloved Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	From the battlements adorned with life-size stone sentinels  
there are breathtaking views over the undulating 100,000-acre 
estate, located 30 miles north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 
</P>
<P>
	It was here that Henry ``Hotspur'' Percy, the soldier and  
statesman immortalized in Shakespeare's Henry IV, was born in 1366. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is here that 8-year-old Lord Max Percy, the youngest  
child of the present-day duchess and her husband, Ralph, the 12th 
Duke, is now playing with a TV computer game while his mother talks 
about her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke inherited the title -- and vast landholdings, the  
castle, a mansion near London, mineral rights and a priceless art 
collection -- unexpectedly in 1995 when his unmarried older brother 
died of an accidental drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, the duchess took up the plan to transform the  
derelict walled garden created around 1750. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsor willing, the duchess hopes the new version will be  
completed by 2001 -- a child-friendly spectacle of pools, floodlit 
fountains and landscaped rosebush hedges, complete with a garden of 
the senses, one of poisonous plants, and another of fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be open to the public year-round, unlike the castle,  
which opens only six months a year, and would be run for 30 years 
as a charitable trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke and duchess have spent $1.2 million of their own money  
so far and will lay out up to $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, says the duchess, whose Web site boasts a letter of  
backing from Prince Charles, there's this ``depth of hostility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a public project. We ourselves can't take a penny from  
it, but that's what's so difficult to get across in England,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the U.S.-based International Management Group, the world's  
leading sports management and sponsorship company, has taken on the 
sales job, beginning with soliciting sponsors on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	In the castle dining room -- a room of sports-field proportions  
itself -- a model of the proposed 27-acre garden competes for 
attention among works of great art and ancestral pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, there may be corporate dinners and advertising shoots  
here, too, for sponsors would be entitled to use any part of the 
castle 10 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think this is the most exciting project in England this  
century,'' the duchess says. ``So there must be someone out there 
who wants and is brave enough to put his name to it.'' 
</P>
<P>

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's trial  
ruled today that prosecutors can show 40 minutes of Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's previously secret videotaped grand jury testimony. U.S. 
District Judge George Howard Jr. agreed with Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors that McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos had opened the door 
to showing Mrs. Clinton's testimony. Geragos suggested that 
prosecutors had never bothered to ask questions of the first lady 
that the investigators now want Mrs. McDougal to answer. Prosecutor 
Mark Barrett stressed that Mrs. Clinton's testimony is not being 
shown to prove the truth of what the first lady said, but simply to 
show that the prosecutors did ask her questions about a $27,600 
loan in her husband's name.

officials resigned amid allegations of cronyism and fraud. Jacques 
Santer, president of the European Commission, and his fellow 
commissioners quit their posts today after a published report 
issued by an investigative panel accused some of them of 
maintaining lax control over aid programs and putting friends and 
relatives on the payroll. The Commission runs the day-to-day 
affairs of the 15-nation union. Their resignations would be roughly

injuries, but were treated at a hospital and released. Croation 
radio in Zagreb says doctors are fighting to save the life of Jozo 
Leutar, the federation's deputy interior minister, who is 
undergoing surgery for a piece of metal in his brain. A Bosnian 
official indicated that Leutar may have been the target of 
organized crime. Leutar also heads the local branch of the ethnic

sanctions that bar flights to and from Iraq. The Russian-made Il-76 
took off from the al-Rashid military base, 10 miles south of 
Baghdad, with the religious affairs minister on board along with 
the hajj pilgrims, mostly women and elderly people, INA said. It 
landed a few hours later in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Iraq apparently

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The seeds for the next great rivalry in  
golf supposedly were planted a year ago this week at the Bay Hill 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els, Tiger Woods and Davis Love III were in the final  
threesome for a 36-hole final, all of them winners of a major 
championship the year before. Even more tantalizing was the fact 
that Woods, just one month earlier in Thailand, came from seven 
strokes off the lead to catch Els and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Els got his revenge. While Woods had made up 11 strokes in the  
final 36 holes in Thailand, Els was 12 strokes clear of Woods at 
Bay Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he feel a rivalry with Woods?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you're probably going to feel it a lot more now,'' Els  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling was fleeting.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither was much of a factor in the Masters. Els hurt his back  
the week before his defense in the U.S. Open and never could muster 
an attack. Neither did Woods, although he had a great start and 
finish in the British Open, missing the playoff by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time Woods went head-to-head with another  
emerging star was in the World Series of Golf in August. He was 
tied with David Duval going into the weekend, but Duval closed with 
rounds of 66-68 for a two-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson and 
six shots ahead of Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	When Duval opened the new season with a nine-stroke victory in  
the Mercedes Championship and then a 59 on Sunday to win the Bob 
Hope Classic, the debate turned to whether Duval or Woods deserved 
to be No. 1 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie who?  
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward one month to find the two-time U.S. Open champion  
going down the stretch in Los Angeles against Woods and winning by 
two strokes, with Duval another stroke behind. Els won for the 
sixth straight year on the PGA Tour, the longest streak anyone had 
put together from his rookie season since Jack Nicklaus won at 
least once for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, the next great rivalry in golf is starting to  
get crowded. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even three months into the 1999 season, Els and Duval have  
won twice (Els also won the South African Open). Woods won the 
Buick Invitational in San Diego and has been in the top five in all 
but one of his stroke-play tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is still room for others to join them.  
</P>
<P>
	What happens when Mickelson, who already has won 13 times, wins  
again? What if Justin Leonard wins the Masters or the U.S. Open, 
giving him as many majors as Greg Norman? 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have stages where Tiger and Ernie might be  
going, or Tiger and David, or Phil and David. Justin can be thrown 
in there, too,'' said Mark O'Meara, the 42-year-old champion of the 
Masters and British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a nice core of some very fine, young, talented  
players who aren't going anywhere but towards the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there will always be room at the top for Woods, the one  
constant in the evolution of golf's next great rivalry. Duval has 
won more PGA Tour events. Els has won more majors. But a bulls-eye 
was painted on Woods when Nicklaus predicted he would win 10 green 
jackets -- and then Woods won his first Masters as a professional by 
12 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger will always play the leading role in this little tale,''  
Els said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	``He is 23 years old,'' O'Meara said. ``This kid has got an  
incredible 12 to 15 years ahead of him. He can do things with the 
golf ball that a majority of these guys out here can't do. That's 
why the comparisons go towards him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than that, his charisma makes Woods either a hero or a  
villain, which can be a crucial ingredient for just about any 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before Nicklaus was revered as perhaps the greatest in the  
game, he was the brash and sassy threat to the stylish, adored 
Arnold Palmer. That great rivalry of the 1960s soon gave way to 
Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, followed briefly by Nicklaus and Johnny 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last great rivalries was Nicklaus and Tom Watson,  
which started in 1977 when Nicklaus finished second to Watson in 
the Masters and British Open, and ended in 1982 U.S. Open with 
Watson's chip-in for a birdie on the 17th hole at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	What made those rivalries so captivating was the player  
(Nicklaus) and the arena (major championships). 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Woods stays near the top, golf has a chance to get  
another great rivalry. Until these young stars slug out in the 
majors, it may never blossom.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Beat Finland 4-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Tiffeny Milbrett scored twice, helping  
the U.S. women's soccer team to a 4-0 victory over Finland in the 
Algarve Cup on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for the Americans is defending world champion Norway on  
Thursday for a spot in the championship game. China already has 
clinched a spot in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Parlow and Brandi Chastain scored the other goals for the  
Americans, who lead Group A of the international tournament that is 
a tuneup for June's World Cup. Six World Cup teams are competing in 
the Algarve Cup, which the United States never has won. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other Group A game, Norway defeated Sweden 2-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Finland played conservatively, with five defenders and four  
midfielders. But Milbrett penetrated in the 14th minute. She 
received a short pass from Julie Foudy about 35 yards from the goal 
and sent a 30-yard left-footed shot into the upper left corner of 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The second goal came off a brilliant individual dribbling effort  
from Shannon MacMillan, who beat two defenders at the top of the 
penalty box, beat another to the end line and slipped a cross to 
Parlow to touch home. Parlow's 18th international goal came 28 
minutes into the match and was the first goal of the year for 
Parlow, who has been battling a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp passing inside the penalty box freed Carla Overbeck for a  
shot from 19 yards that was blocked. The ball ricocheted to 
Milbrett, who put a shot off the left post and into the net. It was 
Milbrett's 50th international goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was our best effort of '99 so far,'' U.S. coach Tony  
DiCicco said. ``Every player, including all the substitutes, made a 
huge commitment to the game both mentally and physically. Shannon 
MacMillan looked great, Cindy Parlow definitely made a difference 
and Tiffeny Milbrett put on one of her shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain scored on a header off MacMillan's corner kick in the  
71st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals are always to improve as a team and win,'' said  
Chastain. ``We've never won here and Norway is in our way. Looking 
at the bigger picture, we know we will probably have to play them 
to win the World Cup this summer and this match will be a great 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China beat Denmark 2-0, while Australia and Portugal tied 0-0.

<HEADLINE> Communities Sue Over Crack Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- City residents who say federal authorities  
did nothing to stop crack cocaine sales in their neighborhoods in 
the 1980s have sued the CIA and Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were filed on behalf of mostly black residents  
whose babies were born addicted to crack, whose relatives died in 
drug-related drive-by shootings and whose communities were affected 
by crowded emergency rooms and gutted business districts, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not some sort of litigation lottery ticket,'' attorney  
Katya Komisaruk said. ``The government contributed to what happened 
to us, so now we need the government to come and help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal civil rights lawsuits, filed Monday in Oakland and  
Los Angeles, were partially prompted by last year's disclosure of a 
1982 agreement between the late CIA Director William Casey and 
former Attorney General William French Smith that the spy agency 
had no duty to report drug crimes to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Komisaruk said she wants a judge to declare the agreement  
illegal, order the CIA and Justice Department to report crimes they 
are aware of and issue reparations to cities affected by cocaine 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials declined immediate comment and the  
CIA did not return a telephone message left by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are the latest result of a 1996 San Jose Mercury  
News series that claimed a drug ring funneled profits to the 
Nicaraguan Contra rebels for the better part of a decade. The 
series traced the drugs to traffickers who were also leaders of a 
CIA-run guerrilla army in Nicaragua during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive editor of the Mercury News later acknowledged in a  
letter to readers that the series had shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, an 800-page internal Justice Department report  
exonerated the department and the CIA.

<HEADLINE> Top Attorney Probes Disputed Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A web of ``very twisted'' boxing  
relationships helped account for the disputed draw in the Evander 
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis bout, New York's attorney general said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism comes as the Manhattan district attorney's office  
said it is now investigating possible illegalities in how the fight 
was judged. It is the fourth such inquiry into Saturday night's 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Eliot Spitzer pointed to what he said were  
questionable alliances involving boxing's sanctioning bodies, the 
fighters, promoters and judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general will hold a hearing Friday in New York, one  
of three state investigations stemming from Saturday night's 
heavyweight title bout at Madison Square Garden in which Lewis was 
widely believed to have won. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's hearing will focus on ways states or the federal  
government can ``redefine'' the roles of the principal players in 
professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing's chief governing bodies -- the WBC, WBA and IBF -- select  
judges for major title bouts and pay their expenses and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	When a judge selected by a governing body backs that group's  
champion -- as the IBF judge did in the Holyfield-Lewis fight -- the 
fairness of the scoring is called into question, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way in which judges are picked certainly breeds the lack  
of confidence that the public has,'' Spitzer said. ``The entire 
world of judging these days is insufficiently regulated and the 
aura of incompetence and perhaps worse, corruption, that permeates 
the industry flows from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer also wants to look at how governing bodies determine  
rankings and who gets title shots. Fighters appear to ``move up and 
down based upon, apparently, their relationships with promoters,'' 
the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Holyfield-Lewis bout, judge Eugenia Williams of New  
Jersey, selected by the IBF, declared Holyfield the winner. The IBF 
and the WBA recognize Holyfield as champion; Lewis is the WBC 
champ. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBC judge, Larry O'Connell of England, said Tuesday he was  
surprised when he tallied his scorecard and found it was a draw. 
But he said he made no mistake in judging the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot closer than it might have appeared,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The WBA judge, Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa, had Lewis  
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	WBC president Jose Sulaiman said Tuesday that Lewis was  
``robbed'' of the unified heavyweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman said the WBC had objected to Williams as a judge  
because of her inexperience in championship bouts. He also 
questioned if she would favor Holyfield, an American, in a fight 
with an Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer is chairman of a boxing task force within the National  
Association of Attorneys General. The task force has been working 
with U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona on boxing reform. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki has ordered the state Athletic  
Commission to examine how fights can be assured of impartial 
judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly believe there should be some federal changes to  
prevent a repeat of that incident,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate Committee on Investigations said it would hold  
a hearing on the bout on Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses scheduled to attend the Senate hearing are  
Williams, referee Arthur Mercante Jr. and promoters Don King and 
Dino Duva. Lewis may participate in person or by conference call. 
Sulaiman will speak by phone from Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's hearing will feature many of the same witnesses, he  
said. Asked if his hearing would be redundant following the 
Senate's hearing, Spitzer said, ``We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan assistant district attorney Daniel Castleman said his  
office's investigation was prompted by numerous complaints, 
including one from Peter Vallone, speaker of the New York City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Vallone, in a letter dated Tuesday, said, ``The outcome of the  
fight is troubling and raises substantial questions of tampering 
with a sports contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vallone's letter added that the fight's result ``was a sports  
travesty.''

<HEADLINE> It's Been a Dark Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- This is supposed to be baseball's time of  
hope and optimism. Instead, it's turned into a spring training full 
of sickness and severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Torre, Andres Galarraga and Mike Lowell diagnosed with  
cancer. The death of Joe DiMaggio, and a minor league pitcher 
killed in a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Moises Alou wrecking his knee, Kerry Ligtenberg throwing out his  
elbow. And now, Kerry Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think about all the wonderful things that happened in  
baseball last year -- McGwire and Sosa, Kerry Wood having his great 
rookie year and Joe Torre winning 114 games with the Yankees -- and 
you wonder if things are trying to balance out now with a lot of 
bad things,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said after Tuesday's 
game against Kansas City in Haines City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the rash of ill fortune has become topic No. 1 in some  
spring locker rooms, more so than talk about the early exhibition 
home runs hit by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always injuries in spring training, but I've never  
seen so many stars get hurt,'' Detroit outfielder Luis Polonia said 
in Lakeland, Fla. ``There have been a lot of big names this year. 
It's unfortunate, but that's how life goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood became this spring's latest victim when the Chicago Cubs  
learned their 21-year-old pitcher would probably miss the season 
because of an elbow injury. The setback not only took away the 
team's strikeout ace, but robbed baseball of one of its most 
exciting phenoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman said at Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta lost Galarraga last month on the same day pitchers and  
catchers were to report to camp. The first baseman, who hit .305 
with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs, will miss the season because of 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also will be minus Ligtenberg for at least a month,  
and possibly the whole year. Coming off a rookie season in which he 
recorded 30 saves, Ligtenberg partially tore a ligament in his 
right elbow while pitching in a game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker and the Astros are trying to make up for the loss of  
Alou, expected to miss most of the season, if not all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star outfielder, who hit .312 with 38 homers and 124  
RBIs, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last 
month when he fell off a treadmill at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' camp has been subdued. First, Joe DiMaggio  
died. Then, Torre disclosed he had prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 victories and the  
World Series championship, will undergo surgery Thursday. He did 
not set a date for his return, though he managed to maintain his 
humor in discussing his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned to someone that now I know why all of those bloop  
singles fell in last year,'' he said in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, a rookie third baseman traded by the Yankees to the  
Florida Marlins last month, was diagnosed with testicular cancer a 
few days before he was supposed to start workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major league pitcher Ken Robinson was killed in a car  
crash on Feb. 28, shortly before he was to report to Arizona's 
minor league camp. He was buried in his Diamondbacks uniform, and a 
teammate, John Rosengren, was indicted on a manslaughter charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Cleveland pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews were killed  
and Bob Ojeda was injured in a boating accident on Little Lake 
Nellie near the Indians' camp in Winter Haven, Fla. The crash came 
during the team's only off-day at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, Robin Ventura broke his right ankle in a gruesome  
slide at home plate, and did not come back to the Chicago White Sox 
until after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Angels pitcher Matt Keough was hit in the head by a  
line drive off the bat of San Francisco's John Patterson while 
sitting in the dugout. Keough, in camp as a non-roster player, 
underwent brain surgery. He recovered but never pitched again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryne Sandberg and Chipper Jones also sustained serious injuries  
in previous springs and St. Louis pitcher Scott Radinsky, then with 
the White Sox, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease at camp in 
1994.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out $35.3M Judgment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A judge has thrown out a jury verdict  
awarding $35.3 million to a couple who blamed the AIDS death of 
their hemophiliac son on tainted blood-clotting medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of other hemophiliacs who died after receiving  
allegedly tainted medicine embraced and wept as the jury's verdict 
was read Monday. But they sat stone-faced a short time later when 
Orleans Parish Civil District Court Judge Max Tobias threw out the 
ruling, saying the family of Kenneth Dixon had waited too long to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mull, the lawyer for Leo and Shirley Dixon of Lafayette,  
said he will appeal Tobias' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely pleased by the fact that the jury decided what  
we have known all along, that the defendants are guilty of gross 
negligence and wanton disregard for the safety of their consumers 
and the American public,'' Mull said. ``We asked for justice and we 
got it from the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixons claimed that Kenneth Dixon died as a result of  
receiving tainted clotting medicine made by Miles Inc. -- now Bayer 
Corp. -- and Alpha Therapeutic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which began deliberating Friday, found the companies  
knew or should have known the medicine was tainted with HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS, and fraudulently misrepresented its safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon sued the drug companies in 1993. When he died in 1995 at  
27, his parents took over as plaintiffs and raised claims for their 
son's wrongful death in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge said the family learned in 1985 that he was  
infected and should have sued by late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias waited until jurors had left the courthouse to announce  
his ruling, which he had written earlier but sealed until the 
jurors finished deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``gone back and forth'' on the statute of  
limitations issue but that he believed time had run out on all the 
Dixon's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants, who are facing trial in several similar cases in  
New Orleans, may appeal the jury's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug companies maintain they did nothing improper and the  
medicine was tainted before anyone knew AIDS existed. The jury did 
not find two other defendants, Baxter Healthcare Corp. and Armour 
Pharmaceutical Co., liable.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Commission Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Stunned by allegations of cronyism and  
fraud in their ranks, the European Union's chief executive and 19 
other senior officials resigned early today, throwing the powerful 
trading bloc into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, and his  
fellow commissioners took the unprecedented action after an 
investigative panel issued a report accusing some of them of 
maintaining lax control over aid programs and putting friends and 
relatives on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission runs the day-to-day affairs of the 15-nation  
union, proposes EU law, enforces its implementation across Europe, 
represents EU governments in international trade talks and attends 
gatherings such as summits of the G-7 group of nations. The 20 
political appointees earn $17,280 a month and up. They are 
unelected and virtually unaccountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Their resignations would be roughly equivalent to the U.S.  
Cabinet stepping down en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	The upheaval comes as the EU leaders are scheduled to meet next  
week in Berlin to finalize 18 months of tortuous talks about 
overhauling the group's budget to finance the entry into the union 
of 12 newcomers, mostly former communist nations in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	This year also brought the launch of the euro, the united  
currency that aims to eventually rival the U.S. dollar's supremacy 
in world finance. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the resignations sent the euro tumbling, but it later  
recovered somewhat. In trading in Tokyo today, the euro was quoted 
at $1.0839, down from $1.0934. But the European currency later 
opened at $1.0867 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU also is engaged in a half-billion dollar trade dispute  
with the United States over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	A crisis of confidence is bound to distract them from these  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget reform talks are not going well, causing fears the  
EU's eastward expansion may suffer a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as he left the EU head office with the other  
commissioners, Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek 
insisted the mass resignation ``should not delay the enlargement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santer said that ``in light of the (fraud) report, the members  
of the commission have unanimously decided this evening to 
collectively submit their resignation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The German Foreign Ministry said the commissioners would remain  
in office until replacements are named. Jose Maria Gil-Robles, 
president of the European Parliament, said he hoped new 
commissioners would be in place by early May following hearings 
next month before the EU assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The 140-page report, issued Monday, was a scathing indictment of  
cronyism and financial irregularities in some offices at the top of 
the EU executive body. It also confirmed the popular image of an 
underworked, overpaid organization of some 15,000 bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Several commissioners were cited in the report for lax control  
over aid and other programs, for putting friends and relatives on 
the payroll and pleading ignorance when asked why they did not act 
sooner to stop waste and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said fraud and corruption pass ``unnoticed'' in some  
top offices. ``It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even 
the slightest sense of responsibility,'' concluded the report, by a 
five-member inquiry set up in January by the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Santer called the report ``unbalanced.''  
He accepted there were cases of wrongdoing but said some dated back 
to before 1995 when his commission took office. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners not personally cited in the report expressed  
bitterness at the sweeping nature of the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unjust and it's incorrect,'' Karel Van Miert, the  
antitrust commissioner, told Belgium's RTBF radio. ``Most of my 
colleagues took their responsibilities very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fraud report was harshest for Research Commissioner Edith  
Cresson, a former French prime minister, who ``failed to act in 
response to known, serious and continuing irregularities over 
several years'' in educational and other programs for which she was 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	It said when informed of fraud and waste in an outside  
contractor that squandered $160 million meant for a youth training 
program, she failed to stop it. She was also criticized for giving 
an unqualified friend a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report made clear that no commissioner ``was directly and  
personally involved'' in fraud or personally enriched himself or 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found no irregularities in Santer's office. But it  
did express dismay he did not act sooner on allegations of fraud in 
security contracts for EU buildings in Brussels dating back to 
1993.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Actor Kirk Alyn, a dancer who followed friend Red  
Skelton to Hollywood and became the first Superman on film, died 
Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Superman, the comic book hero born in the Depression, already  
had captured the imagination of a generation of children in print 
and on radio when Alyn agreed to play the part in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyn was age 37 when he starred as the Man of Steel in two  
pictures for Columbia Films: ``Superman'' in 1948 and in ``Atom Man 
vs. Superman'' in 1950. Each film was done in a 15-part serial 
format. 
</P>
<P>
	Born John Feggo Jr., Alyn began his show business career in New  
York, first in vaudeville acts and later in chorus lines. When his 
friend Skelton left for Hollywood, Alyn soon followed.

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Maud Morgan, an artist who exhibited  
with Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman and was a 
mentor to the young Frank Stella and Carl Andre, died Sunday. She 
was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Morgan worked in abstract and representational styles. She  
drew and painted in watercolors, oils, and gouache. She also 
created collages, made prints and worked with handmade paper. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, her work was bought by the Museum of Modern Art,  
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	She exhibited her paintings for 50 years at the Addison Gallery  
of American Art in Andover.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Commodore William Eldon Warwick, the first captain  
of the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's best-known cruise ship, died 
Feb. 27 at age 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick, who was known as Bil, participated in the vessel's May  
1969 maiden voyage across the Atlantic, steered the ship around the 
globe and dined with royalty, world leaders and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick began his career in the British merchant navy in 1928,  
serving in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. During World War II, he 
enlisted in the Royal Navy. After the war, he joined the Cunard 
company and took charge of his first passenger vessel, the 
Carinthia, in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to command almost every passenger liner in the Cunard  
fleet, including the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he won the sought-after assignment as master to QE2,  
which was still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick, who received a CBE, or Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971, died weeks before 
he was due to make another voyage across the Atlantic on the QE2 as 
part of the ship's 30th anniversary celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Ronald, is now the vessel's commodore.

<HEADLINE> Grains Mixed, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grains were mixed and soybeans higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat was mixed as market participants balanced news of strong  
export demand with forecasts for more rain in the hard red winter 
wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans recovered slightly after falling Monday amid reports  
that the dry weather in South America will hold at least through 
Wednesday, facilitating the harvest of large corn and soybean crops 
in Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was mixed on the news from South America, where  
precipitation had hampered the harvest until this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was down 1 1/4 cent to $2.71 a bushel; May  
corn was unchanged at $2.20 a bushel; May oats were up 1/2 cent to 
$1.10 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans were up 1/2 cent to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures fell 0.05 cent to 66.30 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle was up 0.13 cent to 71.70 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs fell 0.37 cent to 40.70 cents a pound; and May pork 
bellies were up 0.98 cent to 50.30 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Make Boselli Highest-Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars finally made  
good on a promise to make Tony Boselli the highest-paid offensive 
lineman in football Tuesday, agreeing to a four-year contract 
extension worth $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro left tackle, widely considered the best in the NFL,  
will play out two of the final three years of his current contract, 
which pays him an average of $2.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will take effect in 2001 and will keep him in  
Jacksonville through 2004, a source familiar with the negotiations 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars would not comment on the signing, but the Florida  
Times-Union and radio station WBWL in Jacksonville also reported 
the four-year extension Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boselli will average $6.5 million a year under the new deal,  
surpassing tackle Lomas Brown as the highest-paid offensive lineman 
in the NFL. Last month, the Cleveland Browns signed Brown to a 
contract that averaged out to $4.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal secures the player who became the cornerstone of the  
franchise in 1995, when the Jaguars used their first-ever draft 
pick to select him. 
</P>
<P>
	It also closes a contentious period that began last year when  
team owner Wayne Weaver, pressed about the possibility of 
renegotiating Boselli's contract, promised that he would ``take 
care'' of his star lineman in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	A whole season passed with no deal and this week's NFL meetings  
in Phoenix -- where Jaguars officials met with Boselli's agent -- 
were considered a crucial period for the negotiations, with the 
team's voluntary offseason workout program set to begin March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	With Boselli's signing, the Jaguars now have the entire core of  
their offense -- quarterback Mark Brunell, receivers Jimmy Smith and 
Keenan McCardell, running back Fred Taylor and right tackle Leon 
Searcy -- in the midst of long-term deals.

<HEADLINE> Braves Visit With Galarraga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A knock on Andres Galarraga's front  
door turned into an emotional reunion with his Atlanta Braves 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Javy Lopez made the pretense of just stopping by  
Galarraga's home Monday. But when he brought the ailing first 
baseman outside, two buses filled with Braves were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Galarraga had met with his teammates since  
being diagnosed with lymphoma Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was happy to see everybody,'' manager Bobby Cox  
said. ``It's tough. But he looked very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was planned by Galarraga's wife, Eneyda, with help  
from Cox and traveling secretary Bill Acree. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit ``helped him a lot,'' Mrs. Galarraga said. ``He was  
excited everybody came to see him. It was good for the team. He's 
an inspiration to everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves appeared impressed by how Galarraga was holding up.  
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he could hit a couple of home runs today,''  
pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``You'd just have to expect that 
what he's going through would take something out of him. But he 
looks strong as a bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked relaxed, not depressed anymore,'' Lopez said. ``He's  
calm knowing he's going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a month's seclusion with his family while he started  
chemotherapy, Galarraga will make his first public appearance 
Wednesday during a news conference at the Braves' Walt Disney World 
complex. He is expected to miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Galarraga's home, Ryan Klesko approached the big  
first baseman. Klesko is being moved from left field to first base 
to replace Galarraga this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a big hug,'' Klesko said. ``He told me to go  
hard.''

<HEADLINE> TWA Announces Executive Succession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- William F. Compton will become chief executive  
officer of Trans World Airlines Inc. on May 25, while retaining his 
title of president, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Current chief executive officer Gerald Gitner will continue as  
chairman of the board and will assume the additional role of 
chairman of the board's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gitner's new duties will focus on leading TWA's strategic  
planning initiatives, including alliance development, aircraft 
acquisition and financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton will assume responsibility for staff functions formerly  
reporting to Gitner. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the more than two years since Bill Compton and I agreed to  
assume leadership of this company, we have formed a close and 
effective working relationship and we have made significant 
progress,'' Gitner said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton was named to TWA's board of directors in November 1993.  
He was named executive vice president of operations in 1996. In 
December 1997, he was named president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Optimism that Japan's economy may be bottoming out  
sent the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index to a seven-month high 
today. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.84 yen at late afternoon, down 0.58 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level 
of 117.64 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 293.22 points,  
or 1.86 percent, closing at 16,072.82 points. On Monday, the 
average closed up 290.74 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's closing in the Nikkei was its highest finish since Aug.  
3, when the average closed at 16,165.08 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an uptrend, probably sustainable till March end,'' said  
Louis Tseng, managing director at LHT Investment Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks started slightly lower on profit-taking but soon headed  
into positive territory on buying from foreign and domestic 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report, released  
today, that overall conditions remained extremely severe, but also 
added the Japanese economy's ``downward movement continues to slow 
to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Bank of Japan said today that the nation's  
economy ``appears to have stopped deteriorating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official optimism came just days after the EPA reported  
Japan's economy contracted for an unprecedented fifth straight 
quarter in the October-December period. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report was in line with a view among many officials and  
investors that the worst of Japan's economic malaise may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent gains in the Tokyo Stock Exchange were based on corporate  
restructuring like that announced last week by Sony Corp. and the 
likely tie-up between Nissan Motor Co. and France's Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with about 1.1 billion shares changing hands  
on the exchange's first section, up from Monday's 742 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 1046 to 195, with 73 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as low as 117.28 yen at  
one point early in the session following comments from Japan's 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that seemed initially to indicate 
a turn toward a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa told reporters said the dollar's slide below 118 yen in  
New York overnight somewhat reflected fundamental economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players who sold the U.S. currency soon after Miyazawa's  
remarks scrambled later to cover their short, or oversold, 
positions, traders said. The dollar ranged between 117.28 yen and 
118.32 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.62 yen, down  
sharply from 129.44 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell after news that the 20-member European Union  
Executive Commission resigned en masse today following reports of 
financial irregularities. The resignation was announced by E.U. 
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 29.71 points, or 2.45 percent, to 1,240.89. 
The TOPIX gained 15.57 points, or 1.30 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.780 percent from Monday's close of 1.785 
percent, driving its price up to 110.15 yen from 110.11 yen.

<HEADLINE> Greyhound Buy Is OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shareholders approved the $403 million purchase  
Tuesday of Greyhound Lines Inc., by a Canadian company that is 
North America's largest provider of city transit fleets, school 
buses and ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington, Ontario-based Laidlaw Inc., which already owns  
Greyhound Lines of Canada, will buy its U.S. counterpart for $6.50 
per share in cash. Eighty-five percent of the 62 million shares 
that voted were in favor of the deal. The transaction is effective 
Tuesday and Greyhound will become a wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Lentzsch, Greyhound Lines president and chief executive,  
will continue in that role. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers are unlikely to notice any difference from the  
ownership change, although the companies do expect better 
transportation service to develop between the border neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no visible changes in our service,'' said  
company spokesman George Gravley. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bus lines were separated 19 years ago when Dial Corp.  
spun off Greyhound Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Greyhound's headquarters will remain in Dallas and no immediate  
operational or personnel changes are anticipated. Greyhound employs 
12,500 people nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1914, Greyhound Bus Lines has operated independently  
in the United States since the Dial spin-off in March of 1987. A 
few months later, Greyhound bought its only nationwide competitor, 
Trailways Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since then, Greyhound has been the only national bus line  
in the United States. The bus line has seen its share of problems. 
In 1990, the company was crippled by a drivers' strike and was 
later forced into bankruptcy protection. But a management change in 
late 1993, started Greyhound back on the road to recovery. Today, 
the bus line serves 2,600 destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Laidlaw is one of the largest operators of city buses and  
ambulance fleets in North America. The company also operates 40,000 
school buses.

<HEADLINE> AOL Will Let Netscape Be Netscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Shortly after America Online  
revealed it would buy Netscape, AOL chairman Steve Case flew out to 
the Web software pioneer's headquarters to address its workers. The 
subject was hairy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can still bring your dogs to work,'' he told a cheering  
crowd of 2,000 Netscape employees. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment, related by several attendees, seemed no small  
concession from a company whose cautious corporate culture, some 
feared, could snuff out the freewheeling creativity of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Netscape shareholders vote on the $9.9 billion  
deal. If they say yes, as expected, the deal could close within 
days. But the real work in combining these very different companies 
is just starting. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's ability to soothe Netscape's coveted army of software  
designers is key to creating what could be a powerful new threat to 
Microsoft's computer software dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is completed, AOL becomes the distributor of  
Netscape's Internet browser software and adds the Netcenter Web 
site, giving it two of the four most popular Internet destinations. 
Also part of the deal, Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of business 
software and computers, will distribute Netscape's corporate 
software for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, AOL's assurances to Netscape staff appear to be working.  
Common goals, such as making the Internet easy to navigate, are 
helping to bridge the divide of culture and distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively few Netscape employees have quit since the Nov. 24  
agreement, thanks in part to Case's promise to pay an extra month's 
salary as a bonus for sticking around. Others are waiting for 
Netscape stock options to take effect so they can sell stock at fat 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's Marc Andreessen, who co-invented the first widely  
used browser for finding and retrieving Internet information, 
signed on as chief technology officer of AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is because they have a really good  
story,'' Andreessen, 27, said Monday from his car phone near AOL's 
Dulles, Va. headquarters. Though not discussing pay, he recently 
bought a Virgina ``starter palace'' so he can shuttle from his Palo 
Alto, Calif. home. The hardest choice is which home his three dogs 
will live in. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the differences that make the marriage a leap of faith  
were apparent in visits this year to the companies' headquarters 
3,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It's tough to find AOL subscribers, and there are 16 million of  
them, in Netscape's Mountain View, Calif. offices. While Netscape 
created the tool for people to surf the Net on their own, AOL 
supplies neatly organized channels of information for ``newbies,'' 
or Internet beginners who otherwise might be groping. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape conference rooms are named after Dennis the Menace and  
other cartoon characters. One top software manager wore his hair 
shoulder-length, and sported black fingernail polish and a T-shirt 
emblazoned with a heavy-metal band logo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dulles, Va., America Online's halls are dotted with posters  
touting ``Valued Work Behaviors'' and ``Valued Leadership 
Abilities.'' While many of its 10,000 employees playfully decorate 
their offices -- giant chess pieces adorn the online games 
department -- the company's corporate-sounding ``Mission Statement'' 
is carved into common entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Such platitudes seem bound to rankle freer spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	While AOL pledges to keep Netscape autonomous with separate  
headquarters and staff, it may merge some overlapping parts. 
Netscape also could be hit by cuts in divisions that make software 
already made by Sun Microsystems, observers say. Morale may suffer 
due to the departure of James Barksdale, Netscape's well-liked 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The physical distance is a challenge; staff needs to spend  
longer hours swapping e-mails and shuttling cross-country. ``The 
issue is it takes a lot of stamina and a lot of willingness to 
communicate through a longer day,'' said Barry Obrand of Russell 
Reynolds Associates Inc., a Silicon Valley recruiting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet similarities could help smooth things.  
</P>
<P>
	Both companies arose in the Internet's dawn, and are infused  
with go-getter mentalities. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeatedly ``morphed'' to survive -- AOL by linking its  
members-only online service to the broader Internet, and Netscape 
by going from just browsers to building corporate software and a 
Web site geared toward businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL already has practice preserving the unique identities of  
acquired companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that users of ICQ, a sophisticated instant  
messaging service AOL bought last June, would flee, membership has 
soared. CompuServe, the competing members-only online service also 
bought by AOL, retains its Columbus, Ohio headquarters and much of 
its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned some things about respecting the special cultural  
ways of companies involved'' in acquisitions, said AOL spokeswoman 
Kathy Bushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of worry permeated even Netscape's Mozilla.org unit,  
which develops the famous Navigator browser that faces an 
increasingly difficult challenge from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the takeover could quash Netscape's competitive  
essence, Mozilla.org's nail polish-wearing manager Jamie Zawinsky 
seemed nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people worried about that,'' he said.  
``But it sounds like business as usual.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro Tuesday after  
the new currency recovered from turmoil in the European Union.

<P>
	The dollar also slipped against the yen as Tokyo stocks rallied.

	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0985, up  
from $1.0935 on Monday. The dollar was quoted at 117.79 Japanese 
yen, down from 117.82 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, after rising against the dollar Monday, initially fell  
on news that the entire 20-member European Commission resigned 
overnight in response to a blistering report charging cronyism and 
fraud in the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro recovered as traders noted the commission has little  
fiscal policy power and no monetary policy authority at all. 
Traders also interpreted the mass resignations as being cleansing 
for the new currency and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acknowledgment of the corruption, addressing the issue, is  
the main thing,'' said Rob Poynder, chief dealer at Credit 
Commerciale de France in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the euro had been weaker against the yen in recent  
days and traders bolstered the euro Tuesday by selling off the 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors decided ``this is a day to take profits,'' said Kevin  
Harris, an international economist at MCM Currencywatch. ``There 
was pretty good buying of euro/yen after the whole business with 
the commission resigning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was caught in the euro/yen crossfire, falling to the  
euro as it slipped against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was also supported as the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main  
index rose to a seven-month high, hitting levels not seen since 
early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ignored positive U.S. economic news, including  
single-family housing construction hitting a 20-year high and 
factories showing unexpected strength in February. The news helped 
push the Dow Jones industrial average above the 10,000 mark for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not responding to today's news, which was dollar  
positive,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4539 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4653, and 1.5278 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5266. The British 
pound rose to $1.6284 from $1.6228. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7803 German 
marks, down from 1.7886; 5.9701 French francs, down from 5.9988; 
and 1,763.67 Italian lire, down from 1769.91.

	Train Wreckage Is Searched  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators examining the nation's  
worst train wreck since 1993 focused Tuesday on how a truck loaded 
with steel girders drove into the path of an Amtrak train even 
though crossing gates apparently were working properly. At least 14 
people were killed and 119 injured in Monday night's collision at a 
rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. The train was headed for 
New Orleans. Rescue crews used cranes to move mangled, smoldering 
pieces of metal as the search for more victims stretched into the 
night. Four to six people were missing and feared dead.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team crossed into  
Mexican airspace late Tuesday, expecting to retain enough fuel to 
cross the Atlantic and become the first to circle the world 
nonstop. Earlier, the Breitling Orbiter 3 set a record for the 
longest distance flown in a balloon, passing the milestone of 
14,236 miles over the Pacific, said Brian Smith, a flight 
controller at the Geneva control center. The balloon crossed the 
Mexican coast near Acapulco at 9 p.m. EST, and expected to pass 
over the country in five hours.

	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday slapped stiff  
prison sentences on the leaders of the Montana Freemen. LeRoy 
Schweitzer drew 22 1/2 years, which his lawyer said amounted to a life 
sentence for the 61-year-old man. Other top figures among the 
anti-government extremists were sentenced to as many as 15 years, 
but two women -- wives of Freemen -- received sentences equal to the 
time already served. Nine Freemen were convicted in two trials last 
year. They and their followers were accused of trying to undermine 
the nation's banking system by issuing thousands of bogus checks 
totaling billions of dollars.

Tuesday, agreeing to a compromise with Republicans designed to keep 
the system from interfering with arms-control efforts with Moscow. 
The 99-0 acceptance all but assured passage in the Senate of the 
overall measure that declares as U.S. policy deployment of a 
ballistic-missile defense as soon as ``technologically possible.'' 
The bill gained considerable support after missile tests by North 
Korea and Iran and the disclosure that China had obtained warhead

sleep improvement from eight weeks of psychotherapy than they did 
from eight weeks of sleeping pills or from a combination of the 
two, a study found. The psychotherapy -- called cognitive behavioral 
therapy -- involves changing people's habits, such as spending too

notion that everyone needs eight hours of sleep. The study was

Crawford put the Hawks ahead to stay at 71-69. The Pacers then went 
more than three minutes without scoring, while turning the ball

species were listed as endangered or threatened under the federal 
Endangered Species Act. The protection will likely be felt by all

without the pitcher who dazzled baseball last year. The NL Rookie 
of the Year, who last May struck out 20 batters against Houston, 
damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during his 
spring training debut against Anaheim on Saturday. The Cubs said 
more tests were needed on the 21-year-old right-hander to determine 
the extent of the injury. However, they assume he will need surgery 
and will not be able to pitch until next year.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs New Arthritis Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who have run out of options to treat  
severe rheumatoid arthritis won a new therapy Tuesday: A machine 
that filters their blood for antibodies that may contribute to 
their painful, swollen joints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prosorba column, made by Cypress Bioscience, works much like  
dialysis. Once a week for 12 weeks, a patient's blood is slowly 
removed, the plasma separated and treated by the Prosorba machine. 
The blood is then remixed and retransfused back into the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine offers a 30 percent chance of improving the swelling  
and pain that cripples patients' joints, Food and Drug 
Administration officials said in approving Prosorba. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA stressed that Prosorba is only for the small proportion  
of patients with moderate to severe symptoms for whom all other 
treatments have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a front-line therapy. ... It's clearly not for  
lots of people,'' said Miriam Provost, an FDA engineer and lead 
reviewer of the device. ``It's for patients who have basically 
failed everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million Americans suffer rheumatoid arthritis, a  
debilitating illness. This is not the kind of arthritis common in 
the elderly because of the wear-and-tear of aging. Instead, 
rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, in which patients' 
immune systems go awry and attack their joints. This causes 
inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away cartilage 
and eventually erode bone. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease mostly strikes women, usually between ages 25 and  
50. Within 10 years, about half are too disabled to work. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of new drugs have been approved that help diminish the  
symptoms and may slow progression of the disease, but about 10 
percent of patients not helped by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine is a column filled with silica and ``protein A,'' a  
protein from the cell wall of a bacterium that clings to human 
antibodies. As plasma runs through the column, the ``protein A'' 
separates out a small amount of antibodies before the plasma is 
retransfused, Provost said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibodies are immune cells that fight off infections in healthy  
people. In rheumatoid arthritis, some antibodies are believed to go 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how Prosorba works is unclear, because scientists do not  
know exactly which antibodies it removes from blood. It doesn't 
remove enough to account for all of the effect, so the company is 
doing further research to understand how Prosorba helps, said 
Cypress chief executive Dr. Jay Kranzler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prosorba can work for about 30 percent of patients: In a  
study of 99 patients, half had their blood run through the machine 
and were compared with ``sham'' patients, who merely had their 
blood removed but not treated. Three months later, 15 Prosorba 
patients had a significant improvement, compared with just five of 
the sham patients. 
</P>
<P>
	For Merrill Meyer of Tempe, Ariz., the improvement was dramatic.  
She went from being bedridden to, after a year and two Prosorba 
treatments, an active life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm taking care of my family and myself and looking now to  
return to work on my art,'' said Meyer, 48, who quit taking 
arthritis medicine in 1996 after a severe drug reaction. ``It 
didn't seem radical to be taking part of my blood and ... cleansing 
out what may be causing the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kranzler said Prosorba's price has not been set, but it will  
cost less than the $1,100 per treatment now charged to patients 
with a rare blood disorder the machine is used to treat. To be 
treated, rheumatoid patients would go to blood banks or other 
designated Prosorba centers with experience in blood-filtering 
techniques.

<HEADLINE> LA Has To Step Up to Plate for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NFL plans to return to Los Angeles, but the  
city may have to roll out the red -- and green -- carpet to lock up 
the league's 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owners voted 29-2 Tuesday to award LA the league's next  
expansion franchise, which they hope would begin play in 2002. But 
they made it a conditional, six-month offer. 
</P>
<P>
	If the owners don't feel LA has a suitable deal by Sept. 15,  
it's back to the drawing board, and likely off to Houston, which 
also was seeking the expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	No ownership group for a Los Angeles franchise was picked. There  
are two bidding for the team, one headed by Hollywood deal-maker 
Michael Ovitz, who wants to build a stadium on a landfill in 
suburban Carson, and the other by real estate developer Ed Roski 
and billionaire Eli Broad, who want to completely remodel the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum is believed to have the edge over Carson, but many  
of the team owners grumbled about the lack of ``public support,'' 
meaning public money, available for the proposed stadium remodel. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, declaring the vote ``a victory for football fans in Los  
Angeles,'' said the league has not talked to the New Coliseum 
Partners about any certain criteria for getting the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's the franchise fee and I'm sure a number of other  
things to decide,'' Roski said. ``We will work with them step by 
step, as we have all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, while his group intends to use private funding for  
the Coliseum, ``like we did with the Staples Center,'' government 
funds already were spent on repairs to the stadium infrastructure, 
freeway off-ramps and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski said his group doesn't need six months to put a deal  
together: ``We feel we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said in Los Angeles, ``We could not be more pleased. At  
this point it's Los Angeles' to lose. We will continue to do our 
best to make it happen. I believe the team will be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the NFL finance and stadium committee will visit Los  
Angeles to check out the two sites sometime within the next two or 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditionally granting the Los Angeles area a franchise would  
seem to set up a bidding war between the competing groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has the whip hand now,'' said Leigh Steinberg, the  
sports agent who had tried to keep the Rams in Anaheim and has 
since been supporting other efforts to return a team to the area, 
which lost the Rams and the Raiders after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see public funding providing a template for  
everything,'' Steinberg said, adding that he considers Los Angeles 
``tax-phobic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But Cincinnati, Seattle and San Francisco, all quite different  
cities, passed bills for stadiums, so LA might, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the league wants to  
determine if Los Angeles can have ``an expansion the way we'd like 
it and with a facility we'd like to have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't, the expansion committee would recommend an  
expansion team be located in Houston.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Inmates Attack Mass Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORCORAN, Calif. (AP) -- Mass murderer Juan Corona was attacked  
and Charles Manson's guitar was smashed after three inmates slipped 
into an area reserved for the state's most notorious prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65-year-old Corona, who suffers from dementia and usually  
paces the recreation yard mumbling to himself, sustained minor 
injuries in Saturday's attack. Manson scurried from the yard back 
into his cell block and was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other inmates from the Corcoran State Prison's protective  
housing unit reportedly suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``To attack one of these inmates is a big badge of honor. So  
we're embarrassed. This is a big breach,'' Corrections Department 
spokesman Tip Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three inmates were able to enter the unit because of a  
broken sensor on an emergency exit, Kindel said. A light indicated 
to guards that the door was locked when it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials had returned Manson's acoustic guitar to him  
only a few weeks ago after he was caught using it to record music 
that was smuggled outside and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	During the attack, a guard shot one round from a wood block gas  
gun to help break it up. It wasn't immediately clear what 
punishment the three attackers might face. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, is also held in the  
protective housing unit but was not involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Corona killed 25 itinerant farm laborers, whose hacked bodies  
were dug up in 1971. Manson was convicted that year of 
masterminding seven grisly murders in 1969 -- including that of 
actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of film director Roman 
Polanski.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Kicks Off Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes took a New Hampshire-style  
pledge to oppose any increase in income taxes as he announced his 
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes noted that New Hampshire has no income or sales tax but  
worried that could soon change. The Legislature is considering a 
state income tax to pay for education. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged New Hampshire residents to resist a broad-based tax,  
and urged every other candidate for local or national office to 
take the anti-tax ``pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be pressure, there will always be excuses  
for imposing more burdens on the people of New Hampshire,'' Forbes 
said at a news conference in front of the Statehouse, accompanied 
by his wife, Sabina, and their youngest daughter, Elizabeth, 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a multimillionaire magazine publisher making his second  
run for the White House, also explained his plan for a flat, 17 
percent federal income tax. The first $36,000 in income for a 
typical family of four -- two adults and two children -- would be 
exempt. Individuals would not pay taxes on interest and dividends, 
and neither individuals nor businesses would pay capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during his speech, a group of flat-tax protesters,  
dressed in dark suits and calling themselves ``Billionaires for 
Steve Forbes,'' marched between Forbes and the television cameras, 
carrying a banner that said: ``Billionaires for Steve Forbes: 
Because inequality is not growing fast enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes supporters, including Republican activist Paul Young,  
quickly ripped the banner off its poles and wrestled the protesters 
to one side of the crowd. State Rep. Julie Brown, R-Rochester, 
grabbed one protester's poster and ripped it. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters began chanting, ``Workers pay the tax so  
investors can relax.'' They were drowned out by Forbes supporters 
chanting ``Go, Steve, go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes went on speaking and said later he was flattered that  
Democrats were taking his candidacy seriously enough to send 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Duncanson, who identified himself as the chairman of  
``Billionaires for Steve Forbes,'' said the flat tax would save 
Forbes about $174,000 per year on his own income taxes, while 
costing working people more. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes contends his plan would cut taxes for all income groups.  
People could choose between the current tax system and the flat tax 
and file whichever would save them more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes announced on his World Wide Web site that he had filed  
for candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his Statehouse news conference, Forbes also held  
an Internet ``chat'' with subscribers of America Online, talking on 
the telephone from state GOP headquarters to someone at AOL, who 
typed his comments into the live chat forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Internet, millions of Americans will be able again to  
participate directly in the political process,'' he said. ``It 
brings back precinct politics in an electronic age.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Sentenced for Bashing Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A high school girl got 2 1/2 to seven  
years in prison Tuesday for bashing her pregnant teacher in the 
head with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalise Salvatto, 16, attacked her social studies teacher Dawn  
Jawrower in a Yonkers classroom last April, hitting her twice with 
a carpenter's hammer. The teen-ager told police she was angry 
because Mrs. Jawrower had gone to her parents about her poor 
grades, causing her to miss the prom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jawrower, who suffered a fractured skull, said that she has  
almost fully recovered and that her baby, a boy now 3 months old, 
is fine. She has returned to teaching in another school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Salvatto pleaded guilty to assault.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really bad for what I've done,'' she said, weeping. ``I  
felt worse when I found out you were pregnant. If I could take it 
back I would, in a second. ... I just want you to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jawrower told a judge that her son, Nicolas, is ``a  
constant reminder of what she did to me,'' added that Miss Salvatto 
``needs to get help. ... She has a lot of potential and she needs 
to find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed, and ordered psychiatric counseling.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most Smokers Too Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Despite years of publicity about the dangers of  
cigarettes, most smokers don't believe they are at 
higher-than-average risk of heart disease and cancer, according to 
a 1995 study published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 3,031 people -- 737 of them smokers -- was  
reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A firm commissioned to conduct the survey found that only 29  
percent of smokers believed they had a higher-than-average risk of 
suffering a heart attack, and only 40 percent believed they had a 
higher-than average risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among heavy smokers -- more than 40 cigarettes daily -- only 39  
percent and 49 percent acknowledged the risks, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks were least appreciated by smokers 65 and older, by  
less educated smokers and by lighter smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigarette smoking causes more preventable deaths from  
cardiovascular disease and cancer than any other modifiable risk 
factor,'' said the authors of the report, Dr. John Ayanian and Paul 
Cleary of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smokers who quit reduce their risk of these conditions and  
prolong their lives substantially, but approximately 48 million 
U.S. adults continue to smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for a consumer education group concerned with health  
risks said the survey belies a popular belief, supported by the 
tobacco industry, that adult smokers know and accept the risks of 
their habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with `They know that it's dangerous' is now we're  
hearing that everything is dangerous -- pesticides, plastics, cell 
phones, NutraSweet, gasoline, the insidious chemicals in our water 
and air,'' said Dr. Gilbert Ross, medical director of the American 
Council on Science and Health. He said people tend to file such 
warnings away and not think about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, tobacco IS dangerous,'' he said. ``Tobacco, or smoking,  
kills 500,000 people in this country every year, and God knows how 
many worldwide. That's the message that we want to get across.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Retailers Settle Charges With FTC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six major clothing manufacturers and retailers  
-- including Wal-Mart, Burlington Coat Factory and Bugle Boy -- have 
settled government charges they failed to disclose the origin of 
textile products in their Internet catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which announced the agreements  
Tuesday, alleged that the companies did not comply with federal 
laws governing textile and wool products. These require that 
mail-order catalogs, including those distributed electronically, 
clearly state whether a textile item was made in the United States, 
was imported, or is a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The statutes also mandate that textile and woolen goods have  
labels listing fiber content, country of origin and the identity of 
any second party hired to market or handle the items. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, these companies violated laws that  
make it a crime to sell or advertise misbranded products with 
online promotional materials: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Burlington Coat 
Factory Warehouse Corp., Delia's Inc., Woolrich Inc., Gottschalks 
Inc. and Bugle Boy Industries. The FTC reached a settlement with 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for alleged violations in its print catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said any infringement of  
textile and wool disclosure laws was inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart is now taking steps to ensure continued compliance,  
including training new associates and making existing associates 
aware of the law,'' the company said in a statement. Spokesmen for 
Burlington and Delia's would not comment, and messages left with 
the other companies were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the companies are prohibited from violating  
the act in the future and are subject to certain record keeping and 
reporting requirements to help the FTC monitor compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FTC adopted amendments to streamline the textile  
and wool rules and also altered the definition of mail-order to 
include promotional materials on the Internet. Over the last six 
months, federal regulators have reviewed more than 200 sites 
offering textile or wool products for direct sale to consumers to 
ensure they complied with the statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more consumers turn to the convenience of online shopping,  
it is important that retailers who market on the Internet comply 
with the law,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau 
of consumer protection. ``Whether a textile product is made in the 
United States or imported must be clearly disclosed in catalogs 
offered either in print or on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who manufacture, import, sell, distribute or advertise  
products covered by the Textile and Wool Acts must comply with the 
labeling requirements. In general, most clothing and textile 
products commonly used in a household are covered by the 
requirements, including handkerchiefs, scarfs, blankets, yarns and 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also announced Tuesday a settlement with Design  
Zone Inc., a women's apparel manufacturer based in Los Angeles, on 
charges that the company removed ``Made in China'' labels from 
certain T-shirts and replaced them with ``Made in USA'' labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements are subject to a 60-day public comment period  
before the commission makes them final.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Amtrak Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Rescue crews climbed through the  
twisted hulk of an Amtrak train today, hoping to find survivors 
after a fiery derailment killed at least five people and injured 
more than 100 others taking a ride on the City of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 21 people were missing and feared dead, said Mike  
Harshbarger, the Bourbonnais fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 188 of the 214 people on the train had been accounted  
for at hospitals and shelters. It was unknown whether the missing 
were all passengers. The train had 18 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to go to sleep. Then all of the sudden everything  
just started crashing and catching on fire and people hollering and 
running. It was awful,'' said Blanche Jones, a passenger from 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We was trying to get out. We couldn't get out, couldn't find a  
way out. That was the most devastating thing of all,'' Jones said 
as she limped out of a school that served as a temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the grace of God, I just went down a stairway and found a  
way to get out and let everybody know how to get out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans, careened off the  
tracks shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday after it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars at a crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago. The truck was leaving a nearby Birmingham Steel 
Co. facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The windows rattled,'' said Don O'Dell, who lives a block away  
from the scene and was watching TV when he heard the crash. ``We 
got up and looked around to see what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members clambered atop overturned cars and two derailed  
engines -- one was split in half -- searching through an eerie, smoky 
haze for trapped passengers. Firefighters doused flames on one of 
the engines and another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ramsey, chief of the fire department in nearby Herscher,  
said eight cars derailed, with three of them ending up on their 
sides. Amtrak officials said two engines and 11 cars derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Joseph Beard said most of the injured were in a  
sleeper car, which Amtrak officials said was behind the engines and 
a baggage car. Some of the rescuers peeled off their coats for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said 101 people were taken to two hospitals in  
nearby Kankakee, and at least 11 were in critical condition. One 
was airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition of the truck driver wasn't immediately known,  
Beard said, though the cab of the truck was not struck by the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were investigating whether gates and  
lights -- which were flashing after the accident -- were working 
before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were  
also being called to the scene.

<HEADLINE> Dow Hits 10,000, Then Falls / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average passed 10,000  
for the first time today as the stock market continued its long, 
steady climb. But the blue chips were unable to hold their gains, 
and they ended their historic day with a modest loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103-year-old index reached the milestone nearly 21 minutes  
into the session, having flirted with 10,000 over the past few 
trading days. The Dow made it to 10,001.78; then its gains 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 28.30 to 9,930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slipped 0.84 to 1,306.42, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.84 to 2,439.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,688 down, 1,313 up and 568 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 738.88 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
724.55 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.14 to 614.08, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.60 to 716.31 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 1.67 to  
399.17. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing in particular holding it down,'' said Richard  
A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in 
Richmond, Va. ``It's just a really mixed market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Union Carbide helped the index to its strong start  
with an upbeat earnings forecast this morning. Merck, which secured 
FDA approval for a new use of its Mevacor drug, was one of the 
strongest of the 30 stocks comprising the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, which have profited mightily from the run  
of the bull market, also rose. Analysts said those gains resulted 
more directly from takeover speculation than the market euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate news aside, the Dow was really moved by the momentum  
of the past few days. On Monday, it came within 30 points of 10,000 
before settling back in the final hour of trading. The Dow is now 
up nearly 9 percent this year on top of an unprecedented four 
straight years of double-digit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent rally of the blue-chip stocks has heartened analysts  
who grew jittery last year when volatile technology stocks led the 
market higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones industrial  
average, three -- General Electric, Merck and United Technologies -- 
hit 52-week highs today, while several others are near their peak 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several of the Dow components have languished in recent  
months, including Boeing, which has been plagued by production 
problems and weak growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators followed the Dow's pattern, shedding  
early gains and turning mixed by afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Congressmen Arrested in NYC Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two congressmen and former Mayor David Dinkins  
were among 14 people arrested as they protested last month's fatal 
police shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Charles Rangel and Gregory Meeks, both Democrats, as well  
as the Rev. Al Sharpton and two members of the City Council, were 
arrested at police headquarters Monday and charged with criminal 
trespass. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators have demanded action against four police officers  
involved in the Feb. 4 shooting of Amadou Diallo, 22. Police fired 
at him 41 times; he was hit 19 times. The shooting is under 
investigation by a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the 14 arrested were given summonses and released  
after about two hours. One man was detained after police found an 
outstanding warrant against him from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the arrests a ``publicity stunt.''  
</P>
<P>
	According to a New York Times poll published today, fewer than  
25 percent of New York residents say they believe police treat 
blacks and whites equally. Nearly nine out of 10 blacks questioned 
said they thought police often engaged in brutality against blacks. 
</P>

	The telephone poll of 915 adults, conducted by telephone last  
week, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes China Spying As Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suddenly, everyone seems to have a China  
angle. 
</P>
<P>
	It's become a burning issue among Republican presidential  
aspirants. Republican members of Congress are jumping up and giving 
speeches. And it's spilling over into debate on foreign policy 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	An allegation that China stole weapons technology from the Los  
Alamos, N.M., nuclear laboratory in the 1980s is fueling the 
outbursts. But GOP attacks on the administration's engagement with 
Beijing have been simmering for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans last year failed to get much mileage out of their  
complaints that China had benefited militarily from satellite 
exports and other technology transfers from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Newt Gingrich, then the House speaker, created a special  
committee, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., to look into 
China's efforts to modernize its military at U.S. expense -- and the 
related issue of whether Chinese contributions to President 
Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	But that investigation, along with just about everything else,  
was eclipsed by the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment 
proceedings of the fall and winter. Furthermore, the special 
committee's hearings were closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Cox Committee report remains classified and has not  
been released. But the summary by the panel concluded that China 
did benefit from technology transfers from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the reports of espionage at the Los Alamos National  
Laboratory, Republicans are able to tie together a lot of loose 
ends. And with the impeachment struggle over, they have a wide open 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	This emerging GOP strategy was summed up by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Senate debate on a missile 
defense bill -- a piece of legislation directly affected by the 
China missile issue. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Lott accused the administration of a ``lackluster  
response'' to reports of Chinese espionage. Then he linked it with 
``the previous scandal'' involving satellite exports and campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises very serious questions not only about this  
administration's handling of China policy, but more broadly about 
whether it can be trusted to manage the nation's security 
affairs,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent indication that Democrats are worried about the  
indictment: their flocking to a face-saving ``compromise'' on the 
Senate's missile-defense bill on Tuesday, legislation they had 
fought furiously in past years, even blocking it from coming to the 
floor twice on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month's visit to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji  
could be a little rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	And the annual June debate over renewing China's  
most-favored-nation trade status promises to be even more 
contentious than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans view the controversy over China's missile program as  
a good one politically. That's because, unlike the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, it also touches Vice President Al Gore, the leading 
Democratic presidential contender -- both in terms of policy and 
questionable fund raising from Asian interests. 
</P>
<P>
	China cards are being played by the GOP presidential contenders.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., accused the administration of having  
sacrificed national security for the sake of engaging China. As to 
Chinese contributions and satellite-technology transfers, '' If it 
is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it will bring more of 
history's shame upon the president than his personal failings 
will,'' McCain told a Kansas audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow GOP presidential hopefuls Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Pat  
Buchanan, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes have called for National 
Security Adviser Sandy Berger to resign over the case -- or be 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, it's an ironic line of attack, since Democrat  
Clinton used the same criticism against Republican President Bush 
in 1992 -- that Bush was too cozy with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are clearly uncomfortable with the turn of events.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., joined conservative Sen. Jesse  
Helms, R-N.C., in urging that China not be permitted to join the 
World Trade Organization now. 
</P>
<P>
	And not a single Democrat spoke or voted against a resolution --  
passed unanimously by both chambers -- designed to pressure the 
administration into sponsoring a resolution condemning China's 
human rights record at this month's meeting in Geneva of the U.N. 
Human Rights Conference.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Gray Wolves Hit Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Four endangered Mexican gray wolves have  
been freed to roam the Apache National Forest, the first of their 
breed released this year in efforts to restore the animals in their 
natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Two adults and two pups born last year were released Monday  
after spending two months in an acclimation pen at Turkey Creek 
north of Clifton, near the New Mexico line about 160 miles east of 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``These wolves were fairly anxious to run free. One of the  
wolves was out before the biologists could retreat from the pen,'' 
said Dave Parsons, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
Mexican gray wolf recovery program, 
</P>
<P>
	The wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern  
Mexico. Two other adults have been free since December, but the 
program got off to a rocky start in 1998 when five of 11 animals 
released were shot to death. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for another 11 wolves to be put into the wild this  
spring during the breeding season. That includes a pair that will 
be carried by pack mules in specially built crates in mid-April 
into the Blue Range Primitive Area in eastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	That pair will be directly into the roadless area without any  
transition period, Parsons said. ``It gives us a chance to put 
wolves in a much more remote area, deep in the Blue Range,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the animals being released will have fluorescent collars, so  
hunters can distinguish them from coyotes, and radio transmitters 
so biologists can track them. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal and state wolf program has changed its approach in  
its second year after criticism from ranchers and other local 
residents. Most of the release sites will now be more remote, there 
will be more law enforcement agents in the areas and there will be 
a greater effort to alert residents, forest users and groups such 
as hunters' organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the animals released in 1998, one wolf is missing and  
presumed dead, and three other females were returned to captivity. 
Two males whose first mates were among the five killed were 
recaptured; one has been released a second time and the other's 
re-release is pending.

<HEADLINE> Factories, Housing Show Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Single-family housing construction hit a  
20-year high and even the nation's beleaguered factories showed 
unexpected strength in February as the remarkable U.S. economy 
turned in another stellar performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic news cheered Wall Street investors, pushing  
the Dow Jones industrial average briefly through the historic 
10,000-mark shortly after trading opened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unstoppable U.S. economy just won't quit,'' said Bruce  
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that construction of  
single-family homes rose 1.1 percent in February to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units, the best showing since 
December 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, housing construction dipped 0.6 percent, reflecting a  
drop in apartment building, but the 1.80 million annual rate for 
total home building was down only slightly from a 12-year high of 
1.81 million units set in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that output at the  
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a better-than-expected 
0.2 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories, which have been hard-hit by a loss of export markets  
because of the spreading global economic crisis, managed a 0.2 
percent gain, led by a 1.8 percent surge in production of 
computers, computer chips and communications equipment. Output in 
these high-tech categories is up 26 percent over the past 12 
months, bucking a trend in the rest of manufacturing that has seen 
production cutbacks and job losses totaling 337,000 over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Output in the mining industry was up 0.4 percent as gains in  
coal mining offset weakness in oil and gas drilling. Output at the 
nation's utilities was down 0.6 percent, reflecting a 
warmer-than-usual February. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory output advance prompted some analysts to say the  
worst of the Asian crisis may be over for U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had words of hope  
for the other part of the economy that has suffered from the global 
turmoil -- farming. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the economy's overall performance ``impressive,''  
Greenspan told an audience in San Francisco that he believed 
farmers were weathering their current problems much better than the 
1980 farming crisis. He said they would be in good position to take 
advantage of rising world demand when the one-third of the world in 
recession does recover. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving above the 10,000 milestone in early trading, the  
Dow gave up those gains, ending the day at 9,930, down 28 from 
Monday's record close. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of manufacturing and farming, the U.S. economy has  
continued to forge ahead, powered by strong consumer demand. Most 
analysts had expected the total economy, as measured by the gross 
domestic product, to slow sharply from last year's 3.9 percent 
rate. But Steinberg said the recent strong economic reports were 
prompting him to revise his forecast upward to match last year's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy continues to walk its way through the  
mine fields,'' said Robert Dederick, economist at Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's factories operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in  
February, the lowest capacity utilization rate in 6 1/2 years. The 
absence of production bottlenecks is one reason inflation has 
remained well behaved. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom in housing has been credited to strong job growth and  
low inflation. The absence of inflationary pressures has allowed 
the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, which has 
translated into low mortgage rates for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mortgage rates have been rising for the past six weeks  
and now stand at a 10-month high of 7.11 percent for 30-year 
mortgages. But analysts said housing should remain strong for the 
first half of the year even with the slightly higher mortgage 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing report showed applications for building permits, a  
good indication of future trends, rose 2.7 percent for 
single-family homes to an annual rate of 1.31 million units, the 
highest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the biggest housing gain was posted in the Northeast,  
where construction shot up 35.7 percent in February. Starts also 
rose in the Midwest, by 8 percent, but they fell 15.9 percent in 
the West and were down 2.5 percent in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said the  
good economy was helping homeowners meet their mortgage payments. 
The mortgage delinquency rate fell to 4.24 percent during the final 
three months of 1998, the best showing since 1996.

<HEADLINE> House Pays Tribute to Dimaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid tribute Tuesday to New York  
Yankee star Joe Dimaggio, who died last week at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	A House resolution, passed by a voice vote, honored Dimaggio  
``for his storied baseball career, for his many contributions to 
the nation throughout his lifetime, and for transcending baseball 
and becoming a symbol for the ages of talent, commitment and 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dimaggio ``was a man of grace and class and of dignity; he was a  
modern-day American icon, a hero and a gentleman,'' said Rep. Ben 
Gilman, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Dimaggio and the New York Yankees are like treasures that  
you take for granted,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``The 
class that he brought not just to the Yankees, not just to New 
York, but to America, is something you have to see and you have to 
feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., who represents the Hollywood, Fla., area  
where Dimaggio spent his final years, recalled how the Hall of 
Famer devoted his time and money to the Joe Dimaggio Children's 
Hospital he founded in the city.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Assail Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday assailed  
House legislation that would make it tougher for people to erase 
their debts in bankruptcy, reigniting a debate over the welfare of 
single mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton played a leading role in the debate last  
year, when the White House threatened to veto a House-passed 
bankruptcy overhaul bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. Mrs. Clinton, along with consumer groups and some 
Democrats, complained that the bill would make single mothers and 
children who are owed support from bankrupt fathers take a back 
seat to credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the new House bill would have ``a devastating impact  
on the thousands of women who turn to bankruptcy courts to collect 
alimony and child support from former husbands'' who have sought 
bankruptcy protection, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, testified 
Tuesday at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson Lee is chairwoman of a congressional caucus on  
children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., and other  
Democrats opposed to the bipartisan bill, as the commercial and 
administrative law subcommitee opened three days of hearings on the 
legislation backed by credit card companies and retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors, led by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., say it  
gives highest priority among debts to child support and alimony 
payments, putting them ahead of credit card debt and other 
obligations. But Democratic opponents maintain that the bill, by 
barring certain credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, 
would force single mothers to compete for payment with big credit 
card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, meanwhile, said the Clinton  
administration's position on bankruptcy legislation ``is a really 
big question mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said White House aides recently told him they want such  
legislation and are willing to negotiate, but they can't promise 
anything because Clinton might veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a very good negotiating position for them to be  
in,'' he told a group of corporate credit managers. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said recently that the  
administration, which supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws, 
needed to examine this year's legislation to determine whether it 
strikes a balance between the legitimate needs of debtors and 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, with Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and  
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, proposed Tuesday a new version of 
legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real reform should address a number of factors such as  
irresponsible (consumer spending), lax bankruptcy laws and 
lawyer-run bankruptcy mills,'' Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to pick up the tab for bankrupts who walk away  
from their debts,'' he said. ``Businesses have to raise prices on 
products and services to offset bankruptcy losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would allow federal bankruptcy  
judges to determine case by case a debtor's ability to repay. 
</P>
<P>
	But in addition, an IRS standard would be used to estimate  
living expenses and calculate whether the payback could be 25 
percent or more of the total debt within three years. In that case, 
the debtor could be forced into a Chapter 13 reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> Hale Takes Plea Bargain in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- Retired Army Maj. Gen. David Hale,  
accused of sexual improprieties with the wives of his subordinates, 
struck a deal under which he will plead guilty to some charges in 
exchange for a reduced sentence, his lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against the former deputy inspector general for  
the Army had earlier led to changes in Pentagon rules barring top 
officers from retiring while facing charges of impropriety or 
criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea agreement was accepted by Hale and Army prosecutors,  
said his attorney, Frank Spinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale will enter his plea on Wednesday before a military judge to  
seven counts of conduct unbecoming an officer -- including having 
four improper relationships with the wives of subordinates -- and 
one count of making false official statements. Spinner said he 
won't plead guilty to any non-consensual sexual offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale will face a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison. Under  
the initial 17 charges, he had faced the possibility of 56 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News, citing unidentified military sources, said Hale agreed  
to plead to eight felony counts in return for a 30-day jail 
sentence and a $75,000 fine. Col. Melanie Reeder, a Fort Lewis 
spokeswoman, said she could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 53, was allowed to retire with honor in February 1998  
after four months as a deputy inspector general, despite suspicions 
about alleged improprieties while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced last year when The Washington Times  
reported that a woman named Donnamaria Carpino had accused Hale of 
forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in Turkey while 
her husband, an Army colonel, was posted there. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also accused of having improper relationships with the  
wives of subordinate officers in Turkey as well as Virginia, Maine, 
Connecticut and Nevada. The alleged relationships occurred from 
1996 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Defense Secretary William Cohen tightened retirement  
rules for top officers after some congressmen complained that 
Hale's quiet retirement represented a double standard when people 
of lower rank were court-martialed over such allegations.

<HEADLINE>  Oklahoma Coach Remembers His Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson credits former  
Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote for giving him his start in 
coaching. Heathcote says he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson was at Michigan State in 1979, working on a master's  
degree. A former small-college player and the son of a basketball 
coach, Sampson went to Heathcote, told him he was interested in 
coaching and asked if there was anything he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed an extra guy hanging around doing nothing like I  
needed a hole in the head, so I told him no,'' Heathcote said. ``He 
comes in the next week and asks me again. Then he comes in two days 
later and asks me again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself if a guy is this interested and this eager,  
it must mean something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was right. Sampson spent about 1 1/2 years as a graduate  
assistant under Heathcote, then went to Montana Tech, Washington 
State and finally Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he will lead the Sooners into the NCAA Midwest  
regional semifinals against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the greatest attribute a coach can have is integrity,  
and that's what Jud is to me,'' Sampson said. ``I can't tell you 
what he meant to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson's first job at Michigan State was to help with the  
junior varsity. Heathcote remembers Sampson sticking around nearly 
every day to watch the varsity practice as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he would go into the coaches lounge afterward,''  
Heathcote said. ``Occasionally, he would ask a question. Most of 
the time he would stay in the background. He was like a sponge, 
soaking up knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson noted Heathcote's attention to detail, his work ethic,  
his intensity and his passion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jud was in his 60s and Jud still made bed check every night at  
his basketball camp,'' Sampson said. ``I still think that that's 
important. If you're going to run your basketball camp, you make 
sure you do bed check at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your name's on the brochure, you do the work. Jud was like  
that until he retired, and I always appreciated the way he ran his 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Sampson became coach at Montana Tech, he took over a team  
that had gone 5-22. His first-year record was 7-20, with three 
victories coming as the result of an opponent using an ineligible 
player. Early on the morning after the final game, Sampson's phone 
rang. It was Heathcote. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't say hello, doesn't say how you doing,'' Sampson  
said. ``He goes, `Kel?' I say yeah. He says, `This is Jud. Hey, how 
does it feel to be the only coach in America that could take a 
program like Montana Tech from obscurity to oblivion?' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Jud.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sampson went on to have three straight 20-win seasons at Montana  
Tech before being hired as an assistant at Washington State. One of 
his endorsements came from Heathcote, a Washington State alum. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson became head coach there in 1986 and stayed there seven  
years. One of his victories came against Heathcote at a tournament 
in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt so bad on the sideline in my life because I  
started thinking about I had to walk down the sideline and shake 
Jud's hand, because I knew how badly he took losses,'' Sampson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his fifth year at Oklahoma, Sampson and Heathcote remain  
close. Sampson and Heathcote talk about once a month, whether it's 
basketball season or not. Heathcote has followed Sampson's career 
closely. He was thrilled when Sampson upset Arizona last week to 
end a string of five straight first-round NCAA tournament losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Heathcote's former team, seeded No. 1 in the  
regional, will be favored to beat his former pupil. But Heathcote, 
who will be watching from his Washington home, wouldn't be 
surprised if 13th-seeded Oklahoma upsets the talented Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He defines roles very well and gets kids to play within  
themselves,'' he said. ``Maybe sometimes they don't feel they get 
to do what they can really do, but in the long run that pays off.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Slump Hits Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The number of bids for offshore petroleum  
tracts in the Central Gulf of Mexico fell sharply Tuesday and 
experts cited low oil prices as well as industry consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Minerals Management Service said it received 273 bids  
on 207 tracts from 58 companies, far below last year's tally of 
1,188 bids on 794 tracts from 75 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The tracts are off the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and  
Alabama. The bids will be opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of low oil prices and consolidation of major  
companies in the petroleum industry probably were the two major 
factors behind the decreased bidding, said Barney Congdon, an MMS 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting geology is still there and there are still a  
lot of leases to be bought, but the time is just not right,'' 
Congdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, crude oil prices were near 20-year lows of  
around $10 per barrel. Prices have since risen to above $14 a 
barrel in part due to an agreement last week by leading oil 
producers to reduce overall production by 2 million barrels a day. 
But some analysts are skeptical that producers will stick to the 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry activity on offshore leases generally lags behind such  
actions as the production agreement by the oil exporters, Congdon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though oil prices were depressed for last year's Central  
Gulf sale, companies submitted $810.4 million in high bids for 
tracts, just off the 1997 record of $824.1 million. In 1997, 
companies submitted 1,790 bids on 1,032 tracts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, development has lagged because of the prices, Congdon  
said. Companies have up to 10 years to develop the tracts, 
depending upon their depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few years, we've been leasing tremendous amounts  
of tracts that have not yet been developed,'' Congdon said. 
``They're stocked up now. But they would have probably come to the 
table more vigorously if the price wasn't so low. That's the secret 
to this.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Approves Parking Co. Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department gave its blessing  
Tuesday to a merger of the nation's two largest parking companies, 
provided the companies sell off their interests in parking garages 
or lots in 18 cities in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Parking Corp. and Allright Holdings Inc. signed a  
settlement filed in federal court Tuesday. The Justice Department 
had planned a civil lawsuit to block the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust regulators feared that without the divestitures, the  
merged company would have near-monopoly power over off-street 
parking in key downtown areas of several big cities, and could have 
set prices and services as it wished. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreed-upon divestitures will ensure that consumers who  
drive into the central business districts will not suffer as a 
result of this merger,'' antitrust chief Joel Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are required to divest or end their interest in  
about 18,000 spaces in 74 off-street parking lots, decks or 
garages, including some in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, 
Dallas, Miami, Denver and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also requires the merged company to sell or end  
interest in facilities in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, 
Knoxville and Memphis, Tenn.; Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, 
Texas; Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla.; and Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Central and Allright announced their proposed merger last  
September, said Central's chief financial officer, Stephen Tisdell. 
The two companies began negotiating the divestiture plan in 
January, Tisdell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Central, based in Nashville, controls more than 1 million  
parking spaces in more than 2,400 facilities. The company had 
revenues of $223 million in fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Allright, based in Houston, operates more than 2,300 parking  
facilities with more than 600,000 spaces.

	CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- Linda and Lyle Bowlin are mounting a  
modest challenge to bookselling giant Amazon.com -- and 
demonstrating, perhaps, the democratic power of the Internet -- from 
the comfort of their own home.

and now a professor of small-business development at the University 
of Northern Iowa, has been selling books over the Internet, first 
as a hobby that involved only self-help books, now as a business 
that supplies best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin found he could buy from Amazon.com's same wholesalers for  
about the same price if he ordered at least five copies of the same 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	And with his 18-year-old daughter doing the accounting, his wife  
doing the shipping and Bowlin managing the Internet site, their low 
overhead meant they could sell for less than Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman cited  
Bowlin's business -- positively-you.com -- as an testament to the 
power of the Internet and evidence that some Internet stocks are 
overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't 20,000 people who can produce software like  
Microsoft, but there are 20,000 who can set up bookstores or 
vitamin stores or video stores,'' Bowlin says. ``That's where the 
stock market missed the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin says his startup costs were about $2,500.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales have grown from about $400 a month to $4,000 a day. Books  
lie in neat rows across the living room floor, boxes of padded 
mailing packages are stacked ceiling-high against a wall, and the 
coffee table doubles as a shipping table. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't my hobby, this is work,'' Mrs. Bowlin laments as  
she places books in mailing packages and slaps handwritten mailing 
labels on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it is difficult to say what Bowlin's success proves  
and what effect such businesses will have on big Internet stocks. 
But one analyst says it llustrates how the Internet allows almost 
anyone to compete with big, established businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're online, you are immediately a multinational  
company in the sense you have mulitnational reach,'' said Robert 
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. ``But it 
also means that established companies have to take competition from 
places they never dreamed of and companies that perhaps did not 
exist a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin's business volume is nowhere near Amazon.com's 1998 sales  
of $609 million and he admits that he alone will not compete 
head-to-head with the bookseller. But with an estimated $24 billion 
book market, there is plenty of room for others like himself, 
Bowlin says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 5,000 independent booksellers out there and  
with a little extra investment they can be incredibly successful,'' 
Bowlin says. ``En masse, they pose a real threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Hooks, a computer systems and science professor at Pace  
University in New York, says Internet stock is not overvalued 
because it represents the expected earnings of the Internet of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Hooks says, ``the buying public is not interested in  
transacting business with people they don't know. That's a large 
hurdle for mom-and-pop shops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin, who is also director of the Small Business Development  
Center at UNI, plans to hire people and move the business out of 
the house soon. He says he is weighing offers to go public that 
could quickly make him a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an entrepreneur,'' Bowlin says. ``There's nothing wrong  
with that.''

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Menem Seeks Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Taking up an opposition  
challenge, President Carlos Menem said Tuesday he would support a 
referendum on whether he can seek an unprecedented third term in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, currently barred by the constitution from running again  
this year, said such a referendum must be binding. He announced no 
date for the vote, but predicted victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to hold a plebiscite, we're going to win,'' the  
68-year-old leader announced in a speech here, his strongest 
statement to date that he wants to run for president one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem's declaration follows a weekend call by the opposition  
Alliance coalition for a non-binding referendum on whether the 
Argentine leader can bid for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential election is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 24.  
The Alliance wants the referendum held within three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem said in July he wouldn't seek another term, but recently  
hinted he was the only Argentine leader capable of steering the 
South American country amid global economic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem sounded every bit like a presidential candidate as he  
addressed cheering Peronist party supporters on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said referendum ``would have to be binding, and if it is  
binding and we win this plebiscite, I will have to be the candidate 
for the Peronist Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menem's archrival within the party, Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo  
Duhalde, said Argentines should be allowed to decide if Menem can 
run again. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president were to win a plebiscite, I will respect the  
will of the people,'' Duhalde said, adding that if Menem loses, the 
president must ``respect the decision of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Menem would be included in a Peronist  
Party primary set for May 9. Duhalde has been considered the 
front-runner for the party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Argentines said they would not look kindly on Menem trying  
to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	``A third term seems like a very bad idea to me. I've been a  
longtime supporter of Menem, but I don't agree with his trying to 
change the constitution. I think it would be a very bad gesture 
politically,'' said Leonardo Burro, a 50-year-old worker. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pablo Ramirez, a 39-year-old accountant, said he would  
welcome giving Menem another chance, noting he had tamed 
hyperinflation and economic chaos shortly after beginning his first 
term in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good idea for Argentina that Menem stay in office,  
especially for our economy if nothing else,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Family Backs Giuliani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's family on Tuesday backed a  
proposal to rename the West Side Highway in honor of the New York 
Yankees slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sharply worded letter, DiMaggio's lawyer accused Gov.  
George Pataki of showing poor taste by turning the idea into a 
nasty political spat on the day DiMaggio died. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Mr. DiMaggio who said `yes' to the renaming of the West  
Side Highway, and that is all that counts,'' DiMaggio's lawyer, 
Morris Engelberg, wrote in a letter to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``His grandchildren and I will do whatever is necessary to carry  
out his approval of the renaming of the West Side Highway,'' 
Engelberg wrote in the letter, dated Monday. ``We feel, as Joe did, 
that this honor and recognition came from your heart to him in his 
final days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter represented a stinging rebuke for Pataki, whose  
administration had suggested the idea of renaming the Major Deegan 
Expressway, which runs near Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, for 
DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had been campaigning since January to have the West  
Side Highway in Manhattan renamed for the ballplayer, and he went 
so far as to have a highway sign bearing DiMaggio's name shipped to 
him in his final days in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The competing proposals created a rift between City Hall and  
Albany on the day DiMaggio died, March 8. It was the latest 
disagreement in the flinty relations between the mayor and the 
governor, which have persisted for years. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's ``grandchildren and I are deeply concerned by  
Governor Pataki's action,'' Engelberg said. ``To use Joe DiMaggio's 
name to further any political objective is inappropriate, and to 
attempt to do so at this time -- so soon after his death -- is, in 
our opinion, in extremely poor taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Mr. DiMaggio's grandchildren nor I will sanction  
Governor Pataki's ... use of Mr. DiMaggio's name to be used in a 
political battle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the letter became public, Pataki officials said they would  
support renaming the West Side Highway for DiMaggio. But aides 
privately accused the mayor's office of having a hand in 
Engelberg's letter in an effort to embarrass the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the attorney was deliberately and grossly  
misinformed about the governor's intentions,'' Pataki spokesman 
Michael McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really very sad they feel this way, because it's just not  
true,'' responded Colleen Roche, the mayor's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued by Pataki's office endorsing the West Side  
renaming, Pataki made no mention of the disagreement with Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative aides in Albany said the Assembly could endorse a  
resolution as soon as Wednesday renaming the highway, which runs up 
Manhattan's West Side. 
</P>
<P>
	City Hall and Albany have had other disagreements over the  
Yankees. The increasing friction comes at a time when Giuliani has 
been considering a run for U.S. Senate, and Pataki is thought to 
want a spot on his party's national ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Pataki disclosed he favored keeping the Yankees in  
the Bronx at a time when the mayor was touting a West Side railyard 
in Manhattan as a potential home for a new Yankee Stadium. The West 
Side Highway runs near the railyard. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on a new home for the Yankees, whose  
lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Amtrak Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Rescue crews climbed through the  
twisted hulk of an Amtrak train today, hoping to find survivors 
after a fiery derailment killed at least five people and injured 
more than 100 others taking a ride on the City of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 21 people were missing and feared dead, said Mike  
Harshbarger, the Bourbonnais fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 188 of the 214 people on the train had been accounted  
for at hospitals and shelters. It was unknown whether the missing 
were all passengers. The train had 18 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to go to sleep. Then all of the sudden everything  
just started crashing and catching on fire and people hollering and 
running. It was awful,'' said Blanche Jones, a passenger from 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We was trying to get out. We couldn't get out, couldn't find a  
way out. That was the most devastating thing of all,'' Jones said 
as she limped out of a school that served as a temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the grace of God, I just went down a stairway and found a  
way to get out and let everybody know how to get out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans, careened off the  
tracks shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday after it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars at a crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago. The truck was leaving a nearby Birmingham Steel 
Co. facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The windows rattled,'' said Don O'Dell, who lives a block away  
from the scene and was watching TV when he heard the crash. ``We 
got up and looked around to see what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members clambered atop overturned cars and two derailed  
engines -- one was split in half -- searching through an eerie, smoky 
haze for trapped passengers. Firefighters doused flames on one of 
the engines and another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ramsey, chief of the fire department in nearby Herscher,  
said eight cars derailed, with three of them ending up on their 
sides. Amtrak officials said two engines and 11 cars derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Joseph Beard said most of the injured were in a  
sleeper car, which Amtrak officials said was behind the engines and 
a baggage car. Some of the rescuers peeled off their coats for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said 101 people were taken to two hospitals in  
nearby Kankakee, and at least 11 were in critical condition. One 
was airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition of the truck driver wasn't immediately known,  
Beard said, though the cab of the truck was not struck by the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were investigating whether gates and  
lights -- which were flashing after the accident -- were working 
before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were  
also being called to the scene.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Survivors Describe Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- The train lights had been dimmed, there  
was nothing to see outside the windows and 17-year-old Anna Fulson 
was preparing to sleep after a long ski trip. Then came a 
shuddering jolt. A bang. A screech of twisting metal. Finally, 
flames and cries of pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hear screaming,'' Miss Fulson said hours after  
clambering out of the Amtrak train that struck a semitrailer Monday 
night. ``You could feel the car derailing. ... It was like in slow 
motion. Everything was turning over. Luggage was falling. And you 
were being slammed against the ceiling and walls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Fulson was among 15 Mississippi teens and three chaperones  
returning from a 10-day Canadian ski trip when their train, 
Amtrak's City of New Orleans, derailed at a crossing 50 miles south 
of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 14 people were killed and at least four others were  
missing and feared dead. More than 100 of the 216 passengers and 
crew were transported to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the ski group were riding in a double-decker car  
immediately behind the shattered sleeper car where all the dead 
were found. Leaking diesel fuel ignited and set that car on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lead locomotive hit the truck and derailed, the cars  
behind it also jumped the tracks and began to fold together like an 
accordion. One locomotive smashed through the sleeper car. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were lying on the ground,'' said Melissa Watson, 14,  
one of the Mississippi group, who was playing cards in the club car 
when the train derailed. ``You could hear children scream, `Where 
is my mom?' You could hear parents scream, `Where are my 
children?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred about 9:30 p.m. as many of the passengers  
heading from Chicago to New Orleans were preparing for sleep. Some 
were listening to Walkmans; others were gossiping. Many teens had 
put on T-shirts and sweatpants. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Bump. Bump. Bang. Bang. A twisting motion. A hurtling crash that  
flung some of the passenger cars onto their sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, total darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	Someone flicked on a cigarette lighter every few seconds in the  
toppled teens' car. Boys in the group forced open an escape window 
above their heads. They began pulling out the girls, who used the 
train seats as makeshift ladders. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl fumbled around to find her glasses among heaps of  
clothes and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like your worst nightmare of what could happen on a  
train,'' said Christina Bomgaars, 15. ``You can't imagine the 
terror of not knowing if you're above water, if you're on a cliff, 
or if you're going to roll over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys told them not to panic, but to move fast. And they did.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had some idea they were scared our car was going to catch  
fire soon,'' said Miss Bomgaars, who recounted the night as she sat 
with her friends in the lounge of Lees Inn, a nearby hotel that had 
taken in crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In another car toward the rear of the train, two women from  
Melbourne, Australia, on a monthlong journey across the United 
States were watching a movie when the train suddenly screeched to a 
jarring halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Griffiths, a 28-year-old advertising executive, was tossed  
about in her seat but her passenger car remained upright. 
</P>
<P>
	She had minor rib bruises, but started handing out towels to  
people who were bleeding and blankets to children -- items provided 
by rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were horrible injuries,'' she said, recounting how she  
saw some people struggling to breathe, others bleeding profusely 
and one little boy with part of his ear cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Her friend, Daniella Bauman, a 28-year-old graphics designer,  
feared another traveling companion might have been killed, but 
tracked down the woman at a hospital later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was better than winning the lottery,'' said a joyous Miss  
Bauman. ``We just grabbed each other and hugged. It was such a 
beautiful moment. After seeing that horrible sight, I was just 
thinking, `How could anyone survive?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Many survivors called family and friends to reassure them they  
were fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bomgaars phoned her parents, near Jackson, Miss., when she  
arrived at the hospital. She was not injured, though the experience 
shook her up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes your so aware of how short life is and how quickly it  
can be gone,'' she said. ``You don't have to do anything. You just 
have to be in the wrong place. God was watching over us.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of First Lady's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Hillary Rodham Clinton's videotaped grand jury  
testimony, taken April 28, 1998, in Washington and played Tuesday 
at Susan McDougal's trial in Little Rock, Ark.: 
</P>
<P>
	HICKMAN EWING, deputy independent counsel: Now, I would ask you,  
as these investigations have gone on over the last several years, 
would you monitor these investigations? In other words, would you 
keep up generally with what was going on? 
</P>
<P>
	MRS. CLINTON: Just very generally. I mostly relied upon my  
attorneys to keep up with the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Did you, have you -- again, I guess one of the questions was,  
what were you familiar with at the time and have you learned of 
this loan, a $30,000 loan, or a $27,000 loan, the Whitewater 
Development Corp. through your examination of various documents 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	A: I don't know what I knew back in 1980, '81, and I don't know  
that I paid attention if this has ever been shown to me since then. 
I don't have any recognition or knowledge of it. It's signed by 
James McDougal. I can't tell you any more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So, I take it, it was true that as of October of '82, the  
corporation was owned by you and your husband and Mr. McDougal and 
Mrs. McDougal? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, I think it probably would be fair to say that. There's  
been a lot of confusion about who owned stock and who didn't have 
stock issued. But certainly I believed at the time that the assets 
of Whitewater were the land and then the escrow contracts, and 
that, you know, we were liable on the notes of the underlying 
obligation. But, we had no involvement in the running of the 
business and didn't know anything about what went on on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: But was it your understanding, in essence, that the Clintons  
and the McDougals were 50-50? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes, that was my understanding.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Next going to show you a document that has been marked as  
Exhibit 10, and this is a cashier's check, drawn not on Madison 
Bank and Trust, but Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan, dated Nov. 15, 
1982. It says, pay to the order of Bill Clinton, in the amount of 
$27,600. Again, it is a cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
	If you will look, at the bottom of that page is the carbon copy  
or the bank copy they would keep. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on the back, there is a stamp that indicates it is credit  
to the account of the named payee, and then it says Madison Bank 
and Trust, Kingston, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't have the underlying documents of that bank, except to  
say that it appears that this check, payable to Bill Clinton, 
retired the indebtedness to the Whitewater Corp. We just went over 
the minutes, where Mr. McDougal stated that he was going to move 
that loan within 30 days. That loan was paid off within 30 days by 
this instrument here. Again, this is the copy. We have the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
	But my question to you is, did you know that that loan was being  
paid off by a check to your husband? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Are we still talking about the loan I took out in--  
</P>
<P>
	Q: No, Ma'am.  
</P>
<P>
	A: -- 1980?   	
</P>
<P>
	Q: No. I'm talking about, if you will get the context here, in  
the minutes, which are marked as Exhibit 9 -- 
</P>
<P>
	A: Uh-huh.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. McDougal said there is a loan to a corporation which is  
owned by the Clintons and the McDougals. And because of -- that 
loan will be moved within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan that is paid off was the loan to the Whitewater Corp.  
This is separate from your $30,000 loan in your name. This is a 
loan to the Whitewater Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The records reflect that this check which you have before you,  
Exhibit 10, was sent to the Madison Bank and Trust, and it was 
credited and paid off the loan to the Whitewater Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, that loan that Mr. McDougal referred to in the  
minutes was paid off by this instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	A: I'm sorry, Mr. Ewing. I don't know anything about this.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: OK. Now, have you had an opportunity to look at the books and  
records of the Whitewater Corp.? In other words, Mr. Charles James 
kept some books from time to time and he would record various 
obligations of the corporation. Have you ever seen on the books and 
records of the Whitewater Corp. a $27,600 entry that would 
correspond with the amount that is in this check that appears to be 
payable to your husband? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Mr. Ewing, I never spent any significant time at all looking  
at the books and records of Whitewater. I have absolutely no memory 
of seeing any such entry. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: All right. I hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 11.  
Whereas Exhibit 10 was a copy of an original check, what I have put 
before you is a microfilm copy that is not real good. It looks like 
there's a couple of copies here. And the amount, this is a check 
drawn on the James B. McDougal Trustee account at Madison Guaranty. 
It has a date of 8-1-83 and the written amount there is $5,081 and 
82-hundreths dollars, signed S.H. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	I will tell you that the $27,600 check payable to Bill Clinton  
is represented in certain records of Madison Guaranty as a loan to 
Bill Clinton. The loan was there until August of 1983. At that 
time, that $27,600, plus interest, was paid off through a check to 
Chris Wade for $25,000, plus this is the remainder of it, this 
$5,081 check signed by apparently Mrs. McDougal. And, if you note, 
someone has written there, for ``Payoff Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it appears that the records reflect that the $27,600 check  
paid off the Whitewater obligation. And then through two other 
instruments, that 27,600 was paid off by this check and funds 
advanced to Chris Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, do you know anything about this?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No, I do not, Mr. Ewing. I've never seen these documents  
before and I have no information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Do you know why Susan McDougal would not say why she wrote  
``payoff Clinton'' on there? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I have no information whatsoever.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Insomnia in Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Older people with insomnia got more long-term  
help from eight weeks of psychotherapy than they did from eight 
weeks of sleeping pills or a combination of the two, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychotherapy -- called cognitive behavioral therapy --  
involves changing people's habits, such as spending too much time 
in bed. It also addresses erroneous beliefs, such as the notion 
that everyone needs eight hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``With eight treatment sessions, most of the time, I think we  
can help people,'' said Charles Morin, a clinical psychologist at 
Laval University in Quebec whose study was published in today's 
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 78 adults whose average age was 65 and  
whose chronic insomnia was not caused by any underlying physical 
problem. Morin said similar research in younger adults has had the 
same outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were divided into four groups. One received 90  
minutes a week of group therapy; another received eight weeks of 
treatment with a prescription sleeping pill; a third got an 
eight-week combination of therapy and sleeping pills; the fourth 
received a dummy pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the combination treatment appeared to work best,  
reducing nighttime awakenings -- the typical problem in older people 
-- by 65 percent, compared with a 55 percent reduction in the 
psychotherapy group and a 47 percent reduction in the 
sleeping-pill-only group. 
</P>
<P>
	But after two years, ``only behavioral treatment provided  
durable changes,'' the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who got medication alone fell back to their initial levels  
of sleeplessness. And to the researchers' surprise, those in the 
combination group had mixed experiences, with some worse than they 
were at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	Morin was unsure why, but said sleeping pills -- even if combined  
with psychotherapy -- may make people vulnerable to relapse by 
leaving them feeling at a loss when not taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most sleeping pills are designed to be used on a short-term  
basis,'' Morin said. ``Here, we pushed the limit a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An expert who did not take part in the study said Morin's  
findings confirm other research. But he said the type of 
psychotherapy that helps is not yet widely practiced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there that market themselves as  
counselors, but not that many clinicians know how to offer 
cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia,'' said Dr. Jed Black, 
director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic in Palo Alto, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE> GM To Pay $8M for Faulty Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The U.S. Attorney for the southern district  
of Indiana announced Tuesday that General Motors Corp. and its 
former subsidiary, Allison Engine Co. of Indianapolis, have agreed 
to an $8.15 million settlement over faulty aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The parts in question were manufactured and delivered by Allison  
and sold to the United States Air Force for use on C-130 aircraft. 
In 1991, the Air Force determined that certain airplane blades 
Allison had produced for T56 turbine engines on C-130 aircraft did 
not comply with blueprint requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's settlement requires General Motors to pay the United  
States $6.39 million, which represents the total settlement less 
$1.76 million that the company expended as payment to produce kits 
to fix problems with the blades. The blades were ultimately 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors owned Allison at the time of its contract with  
the Air Force. The Indianapolis company was later sold and is now 
owned by Rolls Royce.

<HEADLINE> Food Council Releases Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House food safety task force will  
continue to study structural changes to ``strengthen the federal 
food safety system'' but stopped short of endorsing a 
recommendation for a single food safety chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Council on Food Safety, in a report released  
Monday, made clear that establishing a single voice on food safety 
issues posed challenges in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foodborne disease problems may also be waterborne disease  
problems,'' said the council, which is made up of officials from 
the departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Health and Human 
Services. ``Other programs, particularly research and education 
programs for food safety, often do not operate as separate 
activities within the agencies but rather draw on the strength from 
one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences in August issued a report,  
saying that ``Congress should establish a unified, central 
framework for managing food safety programs, headed by one official 
with control of resources for all federal food safety activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton created the council to review the report's  
findings and develop a national strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAS report gave examples such as a food safety council with  
a chair appointed by the president with control of all resources; a 
lead agency for food safety and an independent food safety agency 
at cabinet level. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some lawmakers and consumer groups, have  
complained about the current fragmented system of 12 agencies with 
various food safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Most food safety responsibilities are handled by the Agriculture  
Department, which is in charge of meat and poultry and certain 
fresh produce issues, and the Food and Drug Administration, which 
oversees other foods. But agencies like the Environmental 
Protection Agency and Commerce Department also have a role. 
</P>
<P>
	The council said development of a national strategy to address  
food safety is already underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The council is confident that its comprehensive strategic plan  
will be a major step toward creating a seamless food safety 
system,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. food is considered the world's safest, up to 9,000  
Americans die every year from food poisoning, and millions are 
sickened.

<HEADLINE> NY Railroad Mulls Cell Phone Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The club car. The dining car. The  
sleeper car. Why not a railroad car for those who can't hush up on 
their cell phones? 
</P>
<P>
	The Metro-North Railroad is considering designating separate  
cars for cellular phone users, who often intrude on the reading, 
sleeping and thinking of their fellow travelers by talking loudly 
into their little phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``For reasons that we can't figure out, people are hollering  
into their cell phones,'' Metro-North spokesman Dan Brucker said 
Monday. ``They're talking as if this were the beginning of the 
telephony age and you had to shout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad, which takes passengers between Grand Central  
Terminal and New York City's northern suburbs, lately has been 
averaging half a dozen complaints per week about loud phone calls, 
Brucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happened to me a couple of times,'' James Said of White  
Plains said as he waited for a train to take him to work in New 
York. ``If the train is noisy and they have to shout, they're being 
obnoxious and they don't know it. You have to give them a look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman complained to the railroad after finding herself  
surrounded by five people on cell phones. Another passenger 
resorted to turning on a tape recorder in front of a lawyer who was 
talking loudly to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your attorney-client privilege is no longer privileged,'' the  
rider said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the railroad is just asking cell-phone talkers to keep  
their voices down. But Brucker said one solution being considered 
is ``having a train car dedicated to cellular phone users -- an 
all-talking train car, the way we used to have a smoking car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, this raises little problems like free-speech  
issues,'' Brucker said. ``How do we enforce it, tell people they 
can't talk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Nightingale of Greenburgh said he doesn't use his cell  
phone while riding the train to and from work in the city, but he 
stood up for the rights of those who do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just talking,'' he said. ``Last time I looked you were  
allowed to talk on the train.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Sen. John Chafee Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- There is little doubt about John  
Chafee's legacy: a litany of laws that have cleaned up the nation's 
air and water. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate and Environment and Public Works  
Committee has left his fingerprints on every piece of environmental 
legislation adopted in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a tireless champion of our environment, helping to  
lead the fight against global warming, promoting wetlands 
conservation and crafting legislation for clean air and safe 
drinking water,'' President Clinton said of the moderate 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chafee's announcement Monday that he will not seek a fifth  
term next year has environmentalists wondering who will continue 
his conservation efforts in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the lands he fought to protect, Senator Chafee is widely  
admired and completely irreplaceable,'' said Carl Pope, executive 
director of the Sierra Club in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee helped craft the Clean Air, Clean Water and Safe Drinking  
Water Acts, and has received many awards from environmental groups 
for conservation matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they write the history books, they will talk about  
Theodore Roosevelt and Senator John Chafee when it comes to 
advancing environmental protection,'' said Curt Spalding, executive 
director of Save the Bay, which worked with Chafee to clean up 
Narragansett Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee's aides say that, in addition to pushing bills to cut the  
emissions of greenhouse gasses and provide funding for estuary 
protection, Chafee's biggest task through 2000 will be finding a 
senator to take over a leading role on environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	If Republicans hold control of the Senate in 2000, his successor  
as chairman of the environment panel would be Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, a fellow New Englander but considerably more 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to name other leading pro-environment Republicans, Allen  
Mattison of the Sierra Club paused for a long while. ``I don't know 
of anyone who can pick up that baton right away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old Chafee said he simply wanted to come home. A  
three-term governor and four-term senator, Chafee has been the most 
successful Republican politician in generations in a state that is 
overwhelmingly Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	He bucked GOP orthodoxy on issues ranging from abortion to  
health care. Most recently, he was one of five Republicans voting 
to acquit President Clinton on both impeachment counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Democrats were cheered by Chafee's retirement, they were  
stung by the announcement in Nevada that former Gov. Bob Miller 
will not run for the Senate. Party elders had courted Miller to run 
for the seat being vacated by Democrat Richard Bryan. Former GOP 
Rep. John Ensign is already in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the current Senate but must  
defend 19 of the 33 seats on the ballot in 2000. Chafee is the 
second Republican to announce retirement plans; three Democrats 
have done so. 
</P>
<P>
	During the remainder of his term, Chafee said he will ``do all I  
can to ensure that we pass on to our children and to future 
generations a green and pleasant land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said his major efforts will be pushing legislation to  
provide $315 million over five years for coastal habitat 
restoration projects Chafee also has been a leading advocate of 
legislation to have businesses cut levels of air pollutants blamed 
for causing the Earth's temperature rise.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Giant Buys So. Cal Dairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDUSTRY, Calif. (AP) -- Dean Foods Co., the nation's largest  
dairy processor and distributor, is buying Alta Dena Certified 
Dairy for an undisclosed figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, announced Monday, would require approval from  
regulators, which is expected within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry-based Alta Dena, owned by Bongrain North America, has  
about $200 million per year in Southern California sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Foods, based in Franklin Park, Ill., will keep the Alta  
Dena name and products, including milk produced without the use of 
growth hormones, said William McManaman, Dean's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Dean products, such as single-serving flavored milks, will  
be marketed locally under the Alta Dena name, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure we got into California in a large way  
because California is both the largest producing state and the 
largest consuming state, and we felt it was a great opportunity,'' 
McManaman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Dean bought family-owned Berkeley Farms of Hayward.  
It also owns American Store Co.'s dairy business, which supplies 
milk and ice cream to Lucky Stores in California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups were skeptical of the idea of consolidating  
California's dairy market, where milk prices are among the highest 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little competition already at the supermarket  
level on milk, and this makes it even worse,'' said Elisa 
Odabashian, a policy analyst with Consumers Union in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Raise Prices Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Analysts say some of the blame for the latest  
round of airfare hikes can be placed on rising fuel costs, though 
high demand for tickets is just as important a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the airline industry upped their business  
fares about 1 percent and their leisure fares by about 3 percent, 
the second price increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they continue with this momentum, we could see the highest  
rates in many moons,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of BestFares.com 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines started the latest round of increases last  
Thursday with a 1 percent increase in business fares and 3 percent 
for leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airfare increases by an individual airline usually don't stick  
unless other major competitors follow suit, which is exactly what 
happened over the weekend. The increases come on top of those 
imposed in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a flight from New York to Los Angeles booked 21  
days in advance that cost $562 on Jan. 1 now costs $602, according 
to Bestfares.com, Parsons' Web site. The same flight booked on 
short notice -- as many business travelers do -- rose from $1,836 to 
$1,890. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have now boosted leisure fares 7 percent this year  
and business fares are up 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines played down fuel costs -- which remain quite  
low-- as the major reason for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly that was a factor, but we were matching the  
others,'' said American spokesman Bill Dreslin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet fuel cost about 36 cents a gallon in the first week of  
March, said a report from the securities firm BT Alex. Brown Inc. 
That's up 7 percent from the previous week, but still down 19 
percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to see a little bit of a creep back up,'' said  
Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin, without providing specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have made five attempts to raise prices so far in  
1999 after relative stability for about 18 months. The air carriers 
were unable to increase prices primarily because Northwest Airlines 
was holding out. Northwest has been having labor problems with 
flight attendants and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, Northwest matched the rise on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	While business travel ticket prices have been rising during the  
last three years, most advance-purchase tickets have fallen, 
meaning average prices have been somewhat stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong U.S. economy has kept demand up among business  
travelers and vacationers and airline profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, for instance, filled a record 73 percent of its  
seats last year. The industry average was 62 percent in 1990, 
according the Air Transport Association, a trade group, but the 
average has increased steadily through the decade. In 1997, the 
average hit 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After a slowdown in the last quarter of 1998, some analysts  
worried that the industry might be in for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, UAL Corp. said its earnings per share would  
be about $1.35 for the first quarter, well above analyst 
predictions of $1.12 as compiled by the research firm First Call. 
Annual profits will be between $10 and $12 a share, UAL said, while 
analysts expected $9.12. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL, the parent company of United, said that economic  
uncertainty present in the fourth-quarter had dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy passenger demand has meant few empty middle seats and few  
alternatives for passengers when a flight was canceled. Passengers 
have been increasingly unhappy with service. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent snowstorm more than 4,500 travelers were  
stranded by Northwest for up to 8 1/2 hours aboard 34 planes unable to 
take off or reach passenger gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then several bills that would strengthen the rights of air  
travelers have been debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is acting to relieve the pressure by buying more  
planes. Even more capacity is expected by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investments like new planes keep up the pressure on airlines to  
raise fares or face lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be concerned about the sizable amount of  
capacity growth that we expect the majors to have in third quarter 
'99,'' said Susan Donofrio, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Experts Want To Keep Smallpox Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Science needs to preserve laboratory specimens  
of the smallpox virus to make sure there is a way to make vaccines 
should the deadly disease ever be used as a bioterrorism weapon, a 
committee of experts says. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than 1,000 years of causing disease, death and  
disfigurement, naturally occurring smallpox was wiped out in 1980 
in a worldwide inoculation effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two laboratory caches -- in Russia and in the United States  
-- remain and the World Health Organization has recommended that 
they be destroyed in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But bioterrorism experts have said in recent months they believe  
the virus has been distributed to other spots in Russia, perhaps in 
places with less effective security controls. 
</P>
<P>
	That information originates with a former high Soviet research  
official, Ken Alibek, who defected to the United States in 1992 and 
testified before Congress last May. Alibek's information has been 
verified by others, according to smallpox experts who spoke at a 
recent bioterrorism conference sponsored by Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	That raises the possibility the smallpox virus could get into  
the hands of those who would try to use it in bioterrorism weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Monday by experts at the National Academy of  
Science's Institute of Medicine recommends that the surviving 
laboratory specimens of smallpox be kept alive as a safety net in 
case the disease breaks out again. 
</P>
<P>
	The study warns that with much of the world's population no  
longer protected by inoculation against smallpox, the virus could 
pose a serious threat. Most Americans below 30 have never had the 
inoculation, and remaining smallpox vaccination stocks could treat 
only about 6 million people. Even those supplies are deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most compelling need for long-term retention ... would be  
the development of anti-viral agents or novel vaccines to protect 
against a re-emergence ... due to accident or intentional 
release,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	An outbreak of smallpox, said the report, ``would likely spread  
widely before being recognized and before appropriate 
countermeasures could be put in place.'' The report noted that an 
airborne spray of the virus ``is considered a serious threat as a 
biological weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox is highly contagious and kills about 20 percent of  
those afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	If the live specimens of smallpox virus are preserved,  
scientists could develop anti-viral drugs that could be used in the 
event smallpox returns or becomes a weapon, the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The development of a new vaccine against the disease also would  
require that virus stocks be kept alive, the study found. Also, if 
science is to learn how to quickly detect smallpox in the 
environment, more research is needed with the live virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the study found that the live smallpox virus is needed  
to learn how the organism attacks the human immune system and how 
the body responds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight of scientific opinion suggests that continuing  
investigation of (smallpox) could lead to new and important 
discoveries with real potential for improving human health,'' the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the committee also admitted that as long as live stocks of  
smallpox exist, a risk remains that the virus could get loose into 
the population, either accidentally or maliciously. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks ... might well outweigh the benefits,'' the report  
said. ``If they are retained, however, they could offer the 
possibility of scientific advances that could not be otherwise 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences, the parent of the Institute of  
Medicine, is a private group of scientists chartered by Congress as 
an adviser to the federal government. The World Health Organization 
has said it plans to review the plan to eradicate the stocks in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	If the smallpox vaccines were eradicated as the World Health  
Organization has recommended, it would be the first time in history 
that people planned and carried out the formal eradication of a 
complete species.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jones Splits From Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CABOT, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Corbin Jones and her husband are living  
separately but plan to remain married, a newspaper reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today quoted Mrs. Jones as saying she and her husband,  
Steven, had been discussing a trial separation ``for some time.'' 
She described them as ``not any different than other couples'' who 
live apart because of different ambitions and interests. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when reached by phone at her mother's house on Tuesday,  
Mrs. Jones told The Associated Press: ``These are rumors, rumors, 
rumors. That's all I have to say. Thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jones, 38, who married Mrs. Jones in 1991, could not be  
reached at his home in California. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said the split came amid disagreements over her sexual  
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton and how to spend the 
$200,000 she received to settle the case. Lawyers split the 
remaining $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones, 33, recently bought a home in Cabot, 30 miles  
northeast of Little Rock. Her new home is about 10 miles from her

<HEADLINE> Apple Reveals Software Blueprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Jobs delighted high-tech mavens  
and hackers Tuesday by making Apple Computer Inc. the first major 
computer company to release the programming secrets behind an 
operating system to software developers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's move, while limited to its software that runs central  
computers, gives a big push to a movement to use the Internet for 
enlisting volunteer programmers and speeding software development. 
The so-called ``open source'' method also is used for Netscape's 
browser software and the Linux operating system for business 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Sun  
Microsystems Inc. jealously guard blueprints to their software to 
surprise rivals with improved features. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple will continue to keep secret its operating system for the  
Macintosh personal computer, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting our source code and the intellectual property  
out there for everyone to see,'' Jobs, Apple's interim CEO, said at 
a news conference at Apple headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs unveiled a $499 operating system, called the MacOS X  
Server, for use by schools, small and medium businesses and 
departments within larger companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The source code package behind the system is dubbed ``Darwin,''  
said Jobs, because ``it's about evolution.'' Source codes are the 
typed instructions that people create directing computers to 
execute programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will work on most new Apple computers, but is being  
packaged with the new Macintosh Server G3, a $4,999 computer for 
people who want to link many computers together. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Raymond, president of a group of programmers called The  
Open Source Initiative, said that Apple's decision to share its 
newest code will ``shake up the computer industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We in the Internet hacker culture want to have access to these  
source codes and Apple really gets it,'' he said. ``Now we'd like 
to see more of their codes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said that Apple will watch how the server source codes are  
used, but that he would like to open codes from more systems in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology experts at universities said that the open source  
code will allow them to customize their networks to Apple's 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new accessibility will allow sites such as MIT the  
ability to bring new technologies to the Macintosh platform 
sooner,'' said Marshall Vale at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Skinhead Convicted in Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A skinhead was convicted of murder and attempted  
murder in the 1997 shooting death of a West African immigrant at a 
bus stop and the wounding of a bystander who came to the victim's 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury reached the verdict against Jeremiah Barnum, 25, on  
Monday. The color drained from his face when he heard the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole  
Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found Barnum guilty of ethnic intimidation.  
</P>
<P>
	Barnum is one of two white men accused in a shooting at a Denver  
bus stop that killed Oumar Dia, an immigrant from Senegal, and left 
Jeannie VanVelkinburgh paralyzed. The other defendant, 21-year-old 
Nathan Thill, is accused of pulling the trigger and will stand 
trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Barnum and Thill killed Dia because he was  
black. Ms. VanVelkinburgh, who is white, was shot after she came to 
the aid of Dia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have anything to celebrate about as the life of Oumar  
Dia is lost forever,'' said Mohamedou Cisse, Dia's childhood 
friend. ``But I am satisfied that justice has been served.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that Barnum had no idea Thill was going to  
open fire. They said Barnum has renounced his racist views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there was any evidence whatsoever that he still  
harbors any of the belief system that he had as a young man,'' said 
defense attorney Peter Bornstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Bornstein said he will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Depleted Timberwolves Shelve Peeler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves put starting guard  
Anthony Peeler on the injured list Tuesday because of a strained 
left calf, a costly loss for a team already struggling in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was injured early in Monday night's 90-83 loss to Utah.  
He is expected to be out at least 10 days, leaving the NBA's worst 
long-range shooting team without its most accurate outside threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler joins swingman Malik Sealy on the injured list. A key  
backup, Sealy sprained an ankle at Golden State last Thursday and 
is expected to be out for another 7-10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Those losses will make the Wolves' adjustment even tougher after  
trading point guard Stephon Marbury to New Jersey last Thursday in 
a three-team deal that brought Terrell Brandon to Minnesota. 
Brandon had a season-high 21 points and six assists in Monday's 
loss, his first start with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves filled Peeler's roster spot by activating reserve  
center Trevor Winter from the injured list.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most Smokers Too Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Despite years of research and publicity about the  
dangers of cigarettes, most smokers don't believe they run a 
higher-than-average risk of heart disease and cancer, a national 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 3,031 people -- 737 of them smokers -- was  
reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A firm commissioned to conduct the 1995 survey found that only  
29 percent of smokers believed they had a higher-than-average risk 
of suffering a heart attack, and only 40 percent believed they had 
a higher-than average risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among heavy smokers -- more than 40 cigarettes daily -- only 39  
percent and 49 percent acknowledged the risks, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks were least appreciated by smokers 65 and older, by  
less educated smokers and by lighter smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigarette smoking causes more preventable deaths from  
cardiovascular disease and cancer than any other modifiable risk 
factor,'' said the authors of the report, Dr. John Z. Ayanian and 
Paul D. Cleary of Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smokers who quit reduce their risk of these conditions and  
prolong their lives substantially, but approximately 48 million 
U.S. adults continue to smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for a consumer education group concerned with health  
risks said the survey belies a popular belief, supported by the 
tobacco industry, that adult smokers know and accept the risks of 
their habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with `They know that it's dangerous' is now we're  
hearing that everything is dangerous -- pesticides, plastics, cell 
phones, NutraSweet, gasoline, the insidious chemicals in our water 
and air,'' said Dr. Gilbert L. Ross, medical director of the 
American Council on Science and Health. He said people tend to file 
such warnings away and not think about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, tobacco IS dangerous,'' he said. ``Tobacco, or smoking,  
kills 500,000 people in this country every year, and God knows how 
many worldwide. That's the message that we want to get across.''

<HEADLINE> Two Face China Smuggling Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two men have pleaded innocent to charges they  
plotted to sell to China equipment vital to missile guidance 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Yao Yi of Beijing and Collin Xu, a  
naturalized Canadian citizen from Montreal, tried to buy fiber 
optic gyroscopes from a Massachusetts defense contractor and ship 
them to China, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say China has been bidding to enhance the  
accuracy of its long-range weapons with high-tech American 
equipment, the export of which is rigidly limited by the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyroscopes are used in navigational systems for missiles,  
``smart'' bombs and aircraft guidance systems. They also can be 
used to stabilize weaponry, the U.S. attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Denner, an attorney for Yao, said his client was simply  
caught up in a series of misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a spy,'' Denner said Tuesday. ``He's part of a new  
breed of Chinese entrepreneurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denner said the gyroscopes were meant for a high-speed railway's  
navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu, who is also charged with conspiracy and money laundering,  
has been held without bail since his arrest Feb. 11 in Boston. Yao 
is being held pending a decision on his bail. He was arrested Feb. 
22 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and $1.25  
million in fines. Yao faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 
fine.

<HEADLINE> Salmon Ruling May Have Wide Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bob Oke has seen this sort of fuss over  
endangered species before, back when the spotted owl was headline 
news. He says the federal protection just given to Northwest salmon 
is a much bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the Endangered Species Act gets involved in protecting  
these salmon, we will think that all the hardship caused by the 
spotted-owl listing was nothing at all,'' said Oke, a Republican 
state senator from Port Orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service on Tuesday listed nine  
salmon runs -- seven in Washington, including the once-mighty Puget 
Sound wild chinook run, and two in Oregon -- as threatened or 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a decision widely praised but one that could affect  
millions of people across the Northwest, from Seattle to Portland, 
Ore., 300 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The consequences are ``going to trickle right down to  
everybody,'' said Eleanor Thornton of Forks, a logging town on the 
Olympic Peninsula that was devastated by the 1990 listing of the 
northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the state's 5.6 million people depend on  
watersheds essential to the Puget Sound chinook, said Curt Smitch, 
Gov. Gary Locke's adviser on salmon issues. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is not the first time an urban area has been listed  
as habitat under the Endangered Species Act, the potential effect 
here is ``unprecedented,'' Smitch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish are at risk every time a person builds a home or  
parking lot too near a stream, pumps too much water from rivers or 
the ground, flushes a toilet into a substandard sewage-treatment or 
septic system, or wastes electricity generated by hydropower dams 
that block spawning rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	All those actions will come under new scrutiny, beginning in two  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be huge in terms of potential costs to home builders  
and eventually to home buyers,'' said Kelly Ross, director of 
government affairs for Oregon's Homebuilders Association of 
Metropolitan Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing could even have implications on the region's  
high-tech manufacturers, which produce runoff that's almost always 
warmer than streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher temperatures can harm aquatic life by reducing dissolved  
oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to control runoff into streams where the salmon spawn  
could lead to reductions in the amount of land available for 
logging and home building, and affect the fertilizers and 
pesticides people spray on their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials also predicted that hydropower generators  
and waste-treatment operators will spend millions to meet the new 
regulations and ultimately pass those costs on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The listings are expected to further slow an already depressed  
sport fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fishing is primarily why people have their boats here,'' said  
Tom Cromie, who may lose his job at the Point Defiance Marina in 
Tacoma after 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this won't mean a shortage of salmon for consumers. Many  
retailers rely on farm-raised salmon, said Harry Calvo, manager of 
Pure Food Fish Market in Seattle's Pike Place Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without farmed salmon we wouldn't be in business,'' Calvo  
said.

sector yesterday. BankBoston gained a mere 1/8 to close at 47 1/16, 
and Fleet fell 2 9/16 to 42 3/16. But the merger stimulated talk of 
further consolidation in the sector, and pushed up shares of 
industry powerhouses like J.P. Morgan, which rose 3 3/8 to 125 3/8. One 
of the strongest sectors yesterday was the airline industry, which 
implemented fare increases that will push up the price of a 
business fare about 1 percent and a leisure fare about 3 percent. 
UAL, which also indicated its first-quarter earnings will top 
analysts' expectations, was the biggest gainer, rising 6 11/16 to

<HEADLINE> Federal Judges Seeking Pay Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's federal judges, frustrated over  
the effects of inflation on their salaries, are trying a new tack 
with Congress: They're backing a pay hike for the president. Well, 
really the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Judicial Conference, the federal court system's  
policymaking arm, voted Tuesday to ask Congress to raise the 
$200,000 annual salary the nation's presidents have been paid since 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, any presidential salary increase  
approved by Congress would not take effect until the winner of the 
next presidential election took office. 
</P>
<P>
	The static $200,000 salary ``has created a compression'' for  
other high-level federal jobs, W. Terrell Hodges, a federal trial 
judge in Florida, told reporters after the 25-judge conference 
ended its daylong meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president's fixed salary has served to hold down  
what judges, members of Congress and senior executive-branch 
officials such as Cabinet secretaries are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each judge's annual salary is worth about $22,000 less today  
than it was in 1992,'' Hodges said, adding that the conference did 
not recommend a specific new salary level for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal trial judges are now paid $136,700 a year, appellate  
judges get $145,000, associate Supreme Court justices are paid 
$167,900 and the chief justice receives $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges, planning to ``vigorously seek'' a bigger  
presidential salary, are working under a deadline. Unless the 
president's salary is adjusted before Jan. 20, 2001, it will remain 
fixed at $200,000 at least until the next presidential oath of 
office on Jan. 20, 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the judicial conference voted for the first  
time to recommend that the president and Congress not fill a vacant 
judgeship -- one of three vacancies on the 15-judgeship federal 
trial court in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators, most notably Charles Grassley of Iowa, have  
called for reconsidering the workloads and needs of the various 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing what Congress asked us to do,'' Hodges said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the conference also is recommending that one trial court  
judgeship not be filled if any vacancy occurs in the federal trial 
courts for Delaware (4 judgeships), Wyoming (3) or the southern 
district of West Virginia (5).

slammed into a truck loaded with steel bars at a crossing Monday 
night, derailing several cars and engines and catching fire. At 
least five people were killed and more than 100 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 20 other people were missing and were believed to be  
trapped in the wreckage, said Chief Mike Harshbarger, fire chief of 
the Bourbonnais Fire Protection District. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,''  
he said. By 4:45 a.m., 188 of those on board had been accounted for 
at hospitals and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers climbed atop overturned cars and engines  
searching for passengers who may have been trapped on the New 
Orleans-bound train, the City of New Orleans. The lead engine was 
split in half and burning, along with one train car, when emergency 
crews arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had two cars on fire right away and also they were  
dealing immediately with extrication,'' said Alan Ramsey, chief of 
the fire department in nearby Herscher. 
</P>
<P>
	Six cars and two engines derailed, with three of them ending up  
on their sides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don O'Dell, who lives a block away from the crash, was watching  
television when he heard the collision at about 9:40 p.m. ``The 
windows rattled. We got up and looked around to see what was going 
on,'' the 36-year-old said early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's engines and cars were scattered over the tracks,  
with smoke pouring out several hours after the crash, 50 miles 
south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Joseph Beard said most of the injured were in a  
sleeper car, which had been following behind the engine and two 
baggage cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition of the truck driver was not known, Beard said.  
However, the cab of his truck did not collide with the train and 
was intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 101 injured people were taken to St. Mary's  
Hospital and Riverside Medical Center in Kankakee. The injured 
included one person with an amputated foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed St. Louis, captain of Bourbonnais Fire Protection District,  
said the tractor-trailer came out of the nearby Birmingham Steel 
Company and was loaded with steel bars used for reinforcing 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they were investigating whether gates and lights  
at the crossing -- which were flashing after the accident -- were 
working before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the  
crash, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bulls Coach Status' Still Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate to  
coach the New Jersey Nets, has no immediate plans to return to the 
NBA, his agent said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time, Phil is enjoying time with his family at  
a time in the year when the (NBA) schedule used to prevent it,'' 
agent Todd Musburger said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired from the Chicago Bulls at the conclusion of last  
season, Jackson, 53, said he planned to spend at least a year away 
from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Jackson has been living in upstate New York, making  
appearances on the lecture circuit and consulting with presidential 
hopeful Bill Bradley on the early stages of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``His plans have not changed, and although he continues to keep  
up with developments in the NBA, he is not at this point looking to 
return any time soon. If that changes, we will be happy to make it 
known,'' Musburger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets have reportedly sought out Jackson to gauge his  
interest in taking over the team. Coach John Calipari was fired 
Monday, and Don Casey is running the team on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets general manager John Nash said Tuesday that because the  
Nets do not have a No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft, they could 
wait until midsummer to decide upon a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers also do not have a permanent coach, and  
Jackson's name has come up in speculation over who might end up 
with that job. Kurt Rambis is currently coaching the Lakers on an 
interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has a career coaching record of 545-193 in nine seasons.  
His teams went to the playoffs each year, going 111-41 with six 
titles.

	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Muhammad Ali is in the middle of a fight  
over the rights to the boxer's life story. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's former adviser and the son of his ex-lawyer say they share  
the rights with Ali, and they're suing in federal court to stop a 
Columbia Pictures film about the heavyweight champ. The movie is 
set to star Will Smith.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Won't Oppose Hoffa Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- James P. Hoffa may be closer to taking over the  
leadership of the Teamsters union despite an opponent's legal 
challenge of his election victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, which has investigated the union for  
years amid charges of corruption and mob influence, said in a 
letter last week to U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein that 
Hoffa's victory in the December election need not be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa defeated Tom Leedham after a campaign finance scandal  
overturned incumbent Ron Carey's 1996 re-election and barred him 
from running again. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's office said  
Hoffa's critics were misguided to suggest the election should not 
be certified. The critics said they wanted to protect the integrity 
of a 1989 consent decree meant to rid the union of the influence of 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The union was forced to sign the decree to avoid racketeering  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter noted that the court-appointed election officer's  
role under the consent decree ``is to ensure a fair, honest and 
open election process, not to pass judgment on a candidate's 
character or fitness for office.''

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Nix Kosovo Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Brushing aside Western pressure and NATO threats,  
Serbs said Tuesday they won't accept the Kosovo peace plan that 
rival ethnic Albanians have agreed to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting up new obstacles to the proposed deal during the second  
day of peace talks near the Arc de Triomphe, Serbs were demanding 
amendments to a U.S.-sponsored plan -- significant changes that 
foreign mediators called unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic said his side refuses the  
key part of the plan -- having NATO troops implement it -- and would 
sign only the political provision ``under the precondition'' that 
the mediators ``accept all of our complaints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milutinovic's comments at the Paris peace talks brought closer  
the prospect of NATO airstrikes against Serbia. Western nations 
sponsoring the talks have said the military and political 
components of the peace plan are inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing Serb negotiators of backtracking, U.S. State Department  
spokesman James P. Rubin said ``time and patience clearly are 
running out'' and that the Serbs must decide ``whether they want a 
peace agreement rather than a catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, meanwhile, three villages were reported ablaze as  
Serb-led government forces pushed ethnic Albanian rebels deeper 
into a snowy mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are negotiating in good faith, the Serbs are engaged  
in police and military activity in Kosovo,'' said Veton Surroi, a 
member of the ethnic Albanian delegation at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian leadership agreed to sign onto the peace  
plan Monday, making good on a pledge they gave mediators Feb. 23 
when the first round of the talks recessed at Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sign that all ethnic Albanian factions are not united,  
hard-line rebels in the northern part of Kosovo accused their 
negotiators in Paris of selling out on the goal of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it is very easy for them to accept a compromise ...  
because it wasn't their friends who were killed and whose dying 
wish was for our people to fight until Kosovo is free,'' said the 
Podujevo sector commander of the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander, who goes by the nom de guerre ``Remi'' and has  
been an outspoken critic of the plan, made his statement in 
Tuesday's edition of the Albanian-language newspaper Koha Ditore. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats inside the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the Serbs had proposed a list of amendments that would 
radically limit Kosovo Albanian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	A Western diplomat said the proposals would significantly change  
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomats said if there was no progress soon with the Serbs,  
the negotiations may end by Friday. The United States and its 
Western allies will then have to decide about possible military 
intervention to end the Kosovo bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would give the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo  
wide political autonomy, while keeping the province within Serbia's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan provides for 28,000 NATO troops, including up to 4,000  
Americans, to enforce it -- a provision Serb-led Yugoslavia will not 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reject foreign troops,'' Milutinovic said.  
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is co-chairing the  
talks along with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, praised 
the Albanian side for showing ``real courage'' in promising to sign 
onto the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the Serb side to show the same courage,'' Cook said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite international pressure, the Serbs continued to dismiss  
the Albanian plan to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unilateral signing does not mean anything,'' Milutinovic said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether NATO bombing of Serbia was now more likely, he  
responded: ``This is not out of the question, but we are not afraid 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in Kosovo, a province in Yugoslavia's republic of  
Serbia, has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 300,000 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting has picked up since the first round of talks ended,  
with the two sides apparently vying for position ahead of a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. refugee officials said at least 9,000 people have been  
driven out of their homes since Monday alone. The scale of fighting 
is at its highest level since an October cease-fire, UNHCR 
spokesman Kris Janowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that could bring further trouble to the talks,  
Yugoslavia asked Interpol to assist in the arrest of the head of 
the ethnic Albanian delegation, Hashim Thaci. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Thaci is wanted for murder in connection with  
the Kosovo rebellion, the state-run Tanjug news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges End to Info Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman is  
urging the Clinton administration to stop allowing U.S. scientists 
based at nuclear weapons labs to travel abroad for scientific 
exchanges until the government completes a probe into the possible 
loss of nuclear secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the president of the United States ... should  
put a moratorium on the exchange of people coming into our labs and 
our scientists going to their labs and perhaps giving them 
information,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ``As we stand here, 
our labs are not as secure as they should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby's remarks came Monday as concern grew on Capitol Hill  
about an espionage investigation into the possible leakage to China 
of sensitive nuclear weapons design information by a scientist at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged espionage took place in the mid-1980s but an  
investigation was not begun until 1995. The subject of the probe, a 
Taiwanese-born scientist, was only fired from his job this year. 
That raised questions about laxity by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby spoke followed a closed-door meeting with CIA Director  
George Tenet, who briefed Senate Intelligence Committee members on 
his appointment of a retired admiral to review the agency's own 
intelligence damage assessment of what secrets may have been lost 
to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is perhaps just the tip of an iceberg. We need security  
at our national labs. ... It has been too loose, too long, and it's 
too important,'' Shelby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey D-Neb., the committee's vice chairman, cautioned  
that the espionage case in question stemmed not from an exchange of 
scientists but from the alleged acts of a single employee. But he 
agreed that security procedures at the labs must be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that considerably more needs to be done,'' Kerrey  
said. ``This is something that is potentially a very serious 
situation that has damaged the security of the United States of 
America considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet's appointment of retired Adm. David Jeremiah appeared  
aimed at adding an air of independence to an inquiry buffeted by 
partisan politics. Republicans have accused the Clinton 
administration of acting too slowly when the potential espionage 
problem emerged. Several GOP lawmakers and Republican presidential 
candidates have called on Clinton's national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, as well as Clinton, has defended the administration's  
actions. Berger emphasized that the alleged espionage occurred 
during a previous administration, and refused to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet said Jeremiah would provide an independent review of the  
work being done now by a multiagency intelligence team. Last year, 
a study led by Jeremiah identified problems that contributed to the 
intelligence community's failure to adequately warn of nuclear 
testing by India. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiral Jeremiah is the perfect person to lead such a  
review,'' Tenet said. ``His credentials are impeccable and his 
credibility is unquestioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah's panel of outside experts will examine work begun in  
mid-February within the intelligence community into whether the 
fired scientist at Los Alamos provided China with technology that 
could be used in developing a multiwarhead nuclear weapon. China 
has yet to field such a weapon, but a document obtained by U.S. 
intelligence in 1995 indicated that China had knowledge of 
technology similar to the W-88, a U.S. multiwarhead nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese-born computer scientist Wen Ho Lee was fired from his  
job at Los Alamos a week ago amid suspicions that he leaked secrets 
to the Chinese in the 1980s. Lee has not been charged with any 
crime, and Newsweek magazine said the FBI now believes it has 
virtually no chance of making a case against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began its investigation in 1996, and Republicans have  
accused the administration of dragging its feet by allowing Lee to 
continue working at Los Alamos long after the initial suspicions 
arose. 
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence damage assessment was ordered based on the  
recommendation in a classified report by a House select committee 
headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., which looked into a 
variety of charges that sensitive U.S. weapons and missile 
technology has been leaked to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby's committee is holding hearings this week on the  
espionage case involving Los Alamos. In the House, members are 
demanding public release of the classified, 700-page Cox committee 
report on technology transfers to China.

	``Live at Luther College'' (BMG/RCA) -- Dave Matthews/Tim  
Reynolds	

</P>
<P>
	Dave Matthews' lack of linear songwriting irks critics who loved  
the pop aspects of his band's earlier work. The fact remains he can 
really write a tune, as this bare-bones concert with friend and 
collaborator Tim Reynolds shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is -- as Matthews' hit goes -- it is ``Too Much.''  
Twenty-three cuts of songs with nothing but two acoustic guitarists 
can't help becoming tedious. Fans will wait in vain for the jazz 
and blues interludes that are the calling card of Matthews' full 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been better just to present the gems from the  
show, such as the guitar play on ``Tripping Billies'' and the 
touching vocals of ``Crash Into Me.'' Other songs, like ``Cry 
Freedom,'' suffer from ho-hum performances -- always the pitfall of 
showcasing one entire show. There are also far too few new songs or 
covers. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert does show the power of the songs themselves, as well  
as Matthews' voice -- which has taken some undue criticism lately. 
Overall, though, this is a disc for true fans and guitar 
aficionados.

	``Come On In'' (Fat Possum) -- R.L. Burnside  

</P>
<P>
	``Cool'' is overused. It's a shame because this disc is cool.  
</P>
<P>
	Disorienting, fresh, inaccessible, confusing, genre-busting, a  
potential breakthrough, a fusion of 1990s roadhouse blues and hip 
hop. And cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Spearhead was an urban rap band that cut into blues. Here, a  
long-ignored Mississippi blues hero, Rural L. Burnside, goes the 
other way, surrendering his latest work to the massive intrusion of 
producer Tom Rothrock. He sampled, mixed and amplified the sounds 
to such a degree, one imagines old Rural being perplexed and 
surprised at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnside's ``Come On In,'' recorded live, is the blues bedrock  
of the disc. Rothman's sampling takes over, twisting the track 
through various incarnations, all of them entertaining. Harmonica 
veteran Lester Butler joins in for a scorching duet, ``It's Bad, 
You Know,'' one of the best tracks recorded by anyone in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Go into this disc prepared, but by all means go.

	``Live in New York City'' (Gadfly) -- Black 47  

</P>
<P>
	Black 47 is another refugee on the trail of broken careers  
created by the fast-moving music business of the 1990s. This 
politically charged Irish-American rock band from New York City, 
whose music is a messy mixture of loud guitar, beat box, horns and 
uilleann pipes, had great promise. Perhaps they were too Noo Yawk, 
their stance too confrontational, to sell bundles of discs. 
</P>
<P>
	The band is best enjoyed in a sweaty, beer-soaked bar. This,  
their first live album, presents Black 47 in just that setting, on 
St. Patrick's Day, no less. Black 47 opens the disc with a Bob 
Marley cover and closes with Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling Stone,'' 
and in between presents the best of leader Larry Kirwan's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally the music loses something in translation for people  
who are not there: The fine ``Different Drummer'' is spoiled by its 
rendering at twice the normal speed, and Kirwan's whiny voice can 
be grating. Yet this disc ably captures the sheer ambition and 
spirit of Black 47. On the liner notes, Kirwan and his mates sound 
a little dispirited at not being able to break through to a wider 
audience and having to peddle this disc on an independent label. 
Fortunately, Black 47 leaves it all behind when the band hits the 
stage.

	``Collin James and The Little Big Band II'' (Warner Music  
Canada) -- Collin James 

</P>
<P>
	It's the ``II'' that gives Collin James away as no  
swinger-come-lately to the jump blues-swing revival. The Canadian 
guitarist released Little Big Band I in 1993. Number two picks up 
where the first ended. 
</P>
<P>
	James blends modern rock and blues elements with old big-band  
classics and jump tunes, such as Cab Calloway's ``C'mon With the 
C'mon,'' Ray Charles' ``Mary Anne'' and Jimmy Wilson's ``Jumpin' 
From Six to Six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sound is horn fat and hollow body clean. James' straight-up,  
slightly underplayed voice is a good match for the simple 
arrangements. The result is a good time that makes you hope the 
band makes a stop in your town.

<HEADLINE> Dow Hits 10,000, Then Slips / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average briefly broke  
through 10,000 today, a feat made possible by nearly a decade of 
steady economic expansion and a growing enthusiasm for technology, 
especially the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials cleared the milestone at 9:50.50 a.m. EST,  
and climbed as high as 10,001.78, a gain of 43.01. But the run at 
rarified heights was fleeting, and the Dow almost immediately gave 
ground. It wound up down 28.30 at 9,930.47, according to 
preliminary figures, leaving it 69.53 points shy of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators were mixed in active trading that was above  
Monday's pace but far from record volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders cheered and waved their arms in celebration on the floor  
of the New York Stock Exchange as the milestone was passed. Some 
held up both hands with their fingers spread to signify 10 as in 
10,000. After the roar, the revelry lasted only about 30 seconds 
before traders and clerks returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The average of 30 blue-chip stocks took almost a year to gain  
the final 1,000 points in its charge, after passing 9,000 on April 
6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990s bull market was all but written off last summer and  
early autumn. The Dow and broader indicators plummeted after 
Russia's economic crisis sent shocks through world markets already 
wary because of worries that Asia's turmoil would deepen and that 
financial unrest would engulf Latin America. The Dow fell below 
7,500 as recently as Oct. 8, but stocks rebounded on a series of 
three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow got a lift today from an upbeat earnings forecast from  
Union Carbide, one of the Dow's components. Wall Street's 
best-known indicator also has been pumped up by its own momentum, 
including a spurt of more than 700 points in the past two weeks. By 
reaching five digits, the Dow is now up nearly 9 percent this year 
on top of an unprecedented four straight years of double-digit 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The march toward 10,000 actually began in the early in 1990s  
when the U.S. economy began a remarkable upward line of growth 
combined with low inflation and interest rates that kept consumers 
spending and corporate profits rising. The rise of personal 
computers and technology improved Corporate America's productivity 
even as manufacturing jobs steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got an additional boost in the past year through the  
explosion of enthusiasm for moneymaking on the Internet as hundreds 
of companies to put a ``dot.com'' after their names, expecting a 
big payoff by selling everything from Furby dolls to stocks on the 
World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was turbo-charged by a recent perception that the  
troubled economies of Asia and Brazil may be bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenal market,'' said Ralph Acampora, director  
of technical research, Prudential Securities. ``It's not the level 
of 10,000; it's the quality of stocks ... GE and Merck and American 
Express. If we're investing in blue-chip America, it can't be bad. 
You should be singing `God Bless America.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Acampora forecasts the Dow will reach 11,500 by the end of this  
year and said it could double within eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	But several investors said that while they were cheered by the  
Dow's performance, they wondered how far above 10,000 the bull 
market could climb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me a little more cautious because it's a hype number,  
a magic number, that everyone's expecting,'' said Andrew Jablonski, 
42, a graphic designer from Yonkers, N.Y., as he emerged from a 
Fidelity Investments office on New York's Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jablonski said he is putting more money into more conservative  
investments now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people will look closer, and this honeymoon  
mood will have to be checked with reality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For some pessimists, two of the main causes of the rally could  
be its undoing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the strong economy gets too strong, there will be a shortage  
of labor and materials, the inflation rate will rise, interest 
rates will go up and the market will fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise the current craze for the Internet could go bust if the  
market starts demanding that many of these red-hot, but so-far 
profitless companies start earning money.

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Top 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average topped the  
10,000 mark for the first time today as stocks continued their 
long, steady climb. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103-year-old index of 30 blue-chip stocks passed the  
historic milestone just under 21 minutes into the session after 
flirting with 10,000 over the past few days. But the 41.23-point 
gain that propelled the Dow past 10,000 evaporated within moments. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was at 9,941.57, down 17.20.  
The index fluctuated in and out of positive territory throughout 
the morning.. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Union Carbide helped the index to its strong start  
with an upbeat earnings forecast this morning. Its shares rose 1 1/2 
to 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, which have profited mightily from the run  
of the bull market, also rose. Analysts said those gains were 
clearly motivated more by takeover speculation than the market 
euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate news aside, the Dow was really moved by the momentum  
of the past few days. On Monday, the index came within 30 points of 
10,000 before settling back in the final hour of trading. The Dow 
is now up nearly 9 percent this year on top of an unprecedented 
four straight years of double-digit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally of the blue-chip stocks has heartened analysts who  
grew jittery last year when volatile technology stocks led the 
market higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones industrial  
average, three -- General Electric, Merckand United Technologies -- 
hit 52-week highs today, while several others are near their peak 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several of the Dow components have languished in recent  
months, including Boeing, which has been plagued by production 
problems and weak growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators followed the Dow's pattern, shedding  
early gains soon after the Dow hit 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.32 at 1,304.94, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 2.62 at 
2,433.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 236.9 million shares, 
well above Monday's sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.41 at 613.81, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.88 at 717.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economy has helped fuel the race to 10,000. In Tokyo,  
the Nikkei Index rose 1.9 percent to its highest close since last 
August, as investors there celebrate more signals that the 
financial crisis there has eased. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets, however, were mixed. In afternoon trading,  
Germany's DAX index was up 0.42 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.24 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Offers Africa Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harking back to his journey to Africa a year  
ago, President Clinton urged the world's richest nations Tuesday to 
relieve the debt burden of Africa's poorest countries. ``Let us 
move beyond words, and do what needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a meeting of African government officials, Clinton  
said he would propose that the world's largest industrialized 
nations work together on a plan to forgive an additional $70 
billion in debt held by developing nations when he goes to the 
annual Group of Eight economic summit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to ensure that no country committed to fundamental  
reform is left with a debt burden that keeps it from meeting its 
people's basic human needs,'' Clinton said. ``The more debtor 
nations take responsibility for pursuing sound economic policies, 
the more creditor nations must be willing to provide debt relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was welcomed by the African officials, who have  
long said the debt makes it harder for them to build upon economic 
development that comes their way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of growth, Mr. President, are still absorbed in  
large part by debt repayment. It is time, then, to go to the heart 
of the matter, debt cancellation,'' said Burkina Faso Foreign 
Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo, chairman of the Organization of 
African Unity's council of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke as his wife -- who paved the way for his  
visit to Africa -- prepared to make her third trip to the continent. 
Hillary Rodham Clinton departs Saturday for an 11-day goodwill tour 
of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
	During a tribute by the United States Agency for International  
Development, Mrs. Clinton said she hoped her latest trip would 
teach Americans about the culture and history of the region's 
Arabs, and -- as in the Clintons' sub-Saharan travels -- promote them 
as ``closer friends and partners in building a better future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Egypt, the first lady will celebrate the 20th anniversary of  
the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty. She said she wanted to highlight 
Tunisia's ``enviable'' record on women's rights and Morocco's 
``unique experiment with political pluralism'' and religious 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	To finance the debt relief package, Clinton suggested selling  
some of the gold reserves held by the International Monetary Fund, 
an idea the United States had not embraced before now. Britain, 
Germany and France all have proposed recently that the 103 million 
ounces of IMF gold be tapped to provide funds for a debt relief 
initiative by the IMF and World Bank. The gold reserve has a 
current market value of $34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a saying by the Kanuri people of west-central Africa --  
``Hope is the pillar of the world'' -- Clinton said it is possible 
for Africa to experience the same type of economic transformation 
that has taken place in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with latitude and longitude, or religion  
or race. It has everything to do with an equal chance and smart 
decisions,'' Clinton said. ``The last decade proves that hope is 
stronger than despair if it is followed by action. Let us move 
beyond words, and do what needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president tried to assure the ministers that, even though  
the trade proposals he advocated during his Africa trip have yet to 
materialize, the United States is committed to Africa ``for the 
long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is saying it will be easy, but we are resolved to help  
lower the hurdles left by past mistakes,'' Clinton said. ``For too 
much of this century, the relationship between the United States 
and Africa was plagued by indifference on our part. ... We must end 
that by building a better common future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had hoped he could back up his rhetoric with the African  
Growth and Opportunity Act, the trade legislation he pushed last 
year. But the bill, which seeks to promote growth by forgiving debt 
and lowering tariffs on some African imports, is stuck in the House 
Ways and Means Committee due to a dispute over costs, and Clinton 
again urged lawmakers to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many friends of Africa in Congress, and many strong  
opinions on how best to help Africa,'' Clinton said. ``I hope they 
will quickly find consensus. Africa needs action now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debt relief plan was one of the goals Clinton explained to  
the U.S.-Africa Ministerial Partnership for the 21st Century, a 
three-day conference on the burgeoning relationships between the 
United States and sub-Saharan nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from 46 sub-Saharan countries were invited to the  
meeting -- the first of its kind. Also invited were representatives 
of four North African nations: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.

<HEADLINE> The Meadowlands Bids To Keep Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- With two of its tenants clamoring  
for accommodations in different cities, the operators of the 
Meadowlands sports complex on Tuesday proposed a new, privately 
financed $212 million arena for basketball and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arena would sit next to Giants Stadium, while the  
existing home to the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils would be 
demolished to make room for a privately financed, $165 million 
sports-themed entertainment, dining and retail venue. 
</P>
<P>
	No financing has yet been arranged for the most ambitious  
project in the 23-year history of the complex, totalling nearly 
$400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams, which are being offered a piece of the action in  
return for being among the investors, had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans asks taxpayers to provide $72 million in  
infrastructure improvements, such as additional parking and new 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils and Nets have already introduced plans for new arenas  
-- the Nets in Newark and the Devils in Hoboken. All three plans 
seek some public money, so Gov. Christie Whitman has some influence 
over the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, on a South American trade mission, issued a statement  
Tuesday calling the Meadowlands plan ``an effective blueprint'' for 
bringing the complex into the 21st century and protecting taxpayer 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	She also wants to keep the state's five professional teams in  
New Jersey. All are now based at the Meadowlands complex: the 
Giants, Jets and Major League Soccer MetroStars in Giants Stadium 
and the Devils and Nets in the Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meadowlands proposal includes more private suites and  
improved lighting for the stadium, estimated to cost less than the 
$43 million spent on recent renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's special advisor on the Meadowlands, Richard S. Mroz,  
participated in the presentation, and said the governor will be 
analyzing the plan and hopes to reach a consensus with the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has made no commitment to spending public  
money on any plan, and wants to see how much private money is 
available before setting a limit on taxpayer levy, Mroz said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Nets and Devils do decide to leave East Rutherford, the  
Meadowlands would forego the new arena, but still raze the existing 
arena and build the sports-themed venue, said Dennis Robinson, 
president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the 
semi-public agency that operates the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be fine with Newark deputy mayor Alfred Faiella, who  
is working with the new owners of the Nets to bring the team -- and 
the Devils -- to the state's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our project would revitalize a whole downtown and be linked to  
mass transit, and I don't know that you could do that at the 
Meadowlands,'' Faiella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadowlands planners envision a two-mile rail spur to the Bergen  
Line of NJ Transit, but it has no funding yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that deficiency, the planners described the Meadowlands,  
which also includes a harness track, as nearly unique because it 
has so many major sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainment venue, along with a plaza between the new  
arena and Giants Stadium, would create a place where fans and 
families could come any time, as well as before and after games, 
said architect Ron Turner. His firm, whose credits include Boston's 
Fleet Center, was retained by the sports authority to assess the 
future of the Meadowlands complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its conclusions: the current arena did not merit  
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Planners also estimate that the enhanced Meadowlands would  
produce $82.2 million in tax revenue, up 40 percent from 1998, and 
provide 12,750 full-time jobs, compared to 7,590 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said that it would take three to four years to complete  
the improvements -- after financing was in place and talks with the 
Devils and Nets bore fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets and Devils agree that the 17-year-old arena does not  
have enough luxury boxes and other amenities that make money for 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned new arena has about the same number of seats as the  
old one -- 19,000, depending on the game -- but up to 100 luxury 
suites, compared to 29 in the current building, and 2,666 club 
seats, compared to none now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets have escape clauses in their lease in 2001 and 2004,  
while the Devils' lease expires in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams released outlines for their new arenas last week.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nets want both teams under one roof -- a $300 million,  
18,500-seat basketball and hockey arena they want to build on 40 
acres in downtown Newark that needs $100 million in public 
financing. The plan also includes a 30,000-seat stadium for the 
MetroStars, an office building, a hotel and parking decks. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils owner John J. McMullen has insisted he can go it alone,  
with just $30 million from the state, for a $270 million riverfront 
18,500-seat arena in Hoboken that includes movie theaters, 
restaurants and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson and some other experts concede a single-sport venue can  
succeed, but all agree a two-sport building has a better chance.

	Dow Hits 10,000, Then Falls  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average passed 10,000  
for the first time today as the stock market continued its long, 
steady climb. But the blue chips were unable to hold their gains, 
and they ended their historic day with a modest loss. The 
103-year-old index reached the milestone nearly 21 minutes into the 
session, having flirted with 10,000 over the past few trading days. 
The Dow made it to 10,001.78; then its gains evaporated. It ended 
up falling 28.30 to end the day at 9,930.47. NYSE decliners led 
advancers 1,672-1,305. The Nasdaq was up 7.83 at 2,439.27.

	Greenspan Hails U.S. Farming  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many farmers are suffering from sharply  
sinking prices for their products, but U.S. farming as a whole 
appears well-positioned to benefit when Asian and other economies 
around the world begin to recover, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said today. Amid many upbeat economic signs, including 
the Dow Jones industrial average cracking the 10,000 barrier for 
the first time, Greenspan devoted a speech in San Francisco to what 
he called ``one of the more notable soft spots'' in a U.S. economy 
he termed both impressive and robust.

	Renault May Buy Nissan Stake

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French car maker Renault offered today to buy a  
controlling 35 percent stake in Japan's debt-ridden Nissan Motor, 
saying it is ``convinced of the merits of a strategic alliance.'' 
Such an alliance -- which would create the world's fifth-largest 
automaker -- would give Renault a premier distribution system in 
Asia as well as access to Nissan's superior technology in engines, 
suspension, batteries and fuel cells. Nissan, in turn, would get a 
desperately needed cash infusion, better European distribution and 
management talent. Nissan shares rose 5/16 to 7 13/16.

companies, far below last year's tally of 1,188 bids on 794 tracts 
from 75 companies. The tracts are off the coasts of Louisiana, 
Mississippi and Alabama. The bids will be opened tomorrow.

fraud in their ranks, the European Union's chief executive and 19 
other senior officials resigned early today, throwing the powerful

effort aimed as much at the 2000 elections as at this session of 
Congress. Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., introduced legislation that would ``sunset'' the current

aiming to leave Social Security surpluses untouched, cut taxes and 
boost defense and education spending. The measure, by Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is intended to paint the

<HEADLINE> Bonds Get a Boost From Dow 10k / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Treasury bond prices rose modestly Tuesday  
as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the central 
bank was unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also drew a boost from the historic, although brief,  
crossing of 10,000 by the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32  
point, or $6.56 per $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.47 percent from 5.52 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering a speech in San Francisco, Greenspan said the  
``economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying 
considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook.'' 
Traders interpreted that to mean he isn't likely to push for an 
increase in Fed interest rates to slow the economy and fight 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said bonds benefited from expectations that the  
stock market will drop sharply with the Dow at 10,000, prompting 
investors to shift money into bonds as a safe haven. After reaching 
10,001.78 in the morning, the index of 30 blue-chip stocks ended 
the day down 28.30 at 9,930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Tuesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose between 1/16 and 3/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities rose between 5/32 and 9/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.8 
points from late Monday to 1,290.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills eased to 4.53 percent from  
Monday's Treasury auction, while the discount fell 0.05 percentage 
point to 4.42 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.66 percent, as 
the discount fell 0.04 percentage point from the auction to 4.49 
percent. One-year yields fell to 4.72 percent as the discount fell 
0.02 percentage point to 5.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.81 percent from 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 11/32 to 124 29/32. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.19 percent from 5.20 percent late Monday.

<HEADLINE> NBC Wins Week's Nielsens Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC won last week's Nielsen Media Research derby  
by being the only major network to maintain its season average 
during a week where the prime-time schedules were clogged with 
reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had a 9.0 rating and 15 share for the week, Nielsen said  
Tuesday. CBS was second with an 8.6 rating and 14 share, ABC had a 
7.8 rating and 13 share and Fox had a 6.2 rating and 10 share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' with one of the relatively few original series  
episodes to air last week, was the most-watched show. NBC's foray 
into reality television, ``World's Most Amazing Videos,'' finished 
a solid 28th for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Season leader CBS slipped to second place for the week, largely  
because its prime-time schedule was pre-empted by college 
basketball on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sacrifice the network was willing to make. CBS had its  
second-best week of the season among young men, a demographic it 
covets because of its popularity with advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three newsmagazines finished among the week's top 10 shows,  
which generally happens when there are a lot of reruns. In a battle 
of news stars, an ABC John Stossel special, ``Teens: What Makes 
Them Tick,'' narrowly outrated NBC's Geraldo Rivera report, ``Back 
to Bedlam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Strange World,'' an ``X-Files''-inspired replacement  
series for ``NYPD Blue,'' had poor ratings in its premiere, 
finishing a distant 89th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another show on the danger list: NBC's sitcom ``Caroline in the  
City,'' which finished 79th for the week despite airing an original 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks showed the reruns because it's the lull after a  
``sweeps'' month, when ratings are watched closely to set 
advertising rates. Among the developing networks last week, the WB 
had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, UPN had a 2.0 rating and 3 share, and 
Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with an 8.5  
rating and a 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with 
an 8.3 and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.5; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.3; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: 
Seasons of Love, Part 2,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' 
NBC, 12.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.9; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 11.2.

	Dow Tops 10,000 Then Falls Back  
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Traders cheered and waved their arms in  
celebration on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow 
Jones industrial average topped the 10,000-mark for the first time 
at 9:50 a.m. EST today, gaining 43.01 to 10,001.78. Soon after the 
milestone was passed, the Dow quickly retreated. Just before 3 p.m. 
EST, the Dow was down 9.99 at 9,948.78. NYSE decliners led

	Thirteen Die in Amtrak Derailment  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- At least 13 people died and more than  
100 were injured last night when an Amtrak passenger train collided 
with a truck loaded with steel at a crossing 50 miles south of 
Chicago. Rescue workers today sifted through the remains of a 
sleeper car, searching for survivors. All of the dead were aboard 
the double-decker car, which was pierced by one of the engines and 
then set afire by leaking diesel fuel. The train, which was 
carrying a total of 216 passengers and crew, was headed from 
Chicago to New Orleans when it slammed into the truck and careened

given 22 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted on a slew of fraud

<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood is expected to miss the entire  
1999 season because of an elbow injury, leaving the Chicago Cubs 
without the pitcher who dazzled baseball last year. The NL Rookie 
of the Year, who last May struck out 20 batters against Houston, 
damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during his 
spring training debut against Anaheim on Saturday. The Cubs said 
more tests were needed on the 21-year-old right-hander to determine 
the extent of the injury. However, they assume he will need surgery 
and will not be able to pitch until next year.

<HEADLINE>  Kentucky Gets Ready for Wally World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The tattoo on Wayne Turner's left bicep  
shows a globe and the words ``Wayne's World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean, however, that Turner or any other member of  
the Kentucky team thinks he is the sole answer to Miami of Ohio 
forward Wally Szczerbiak, better known as ``Wally World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message Tuesday from coach Tubby Smith and the Wildcat  
players was that if Kentucky (27-8) is to beat Miami (24-7) in 
Friday's third-round NCAA tournament game in St. Louis, it will be 
with a team effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one individual can beat a team,'' center Jamaal Magloire  
said when asked whether Szczerbiak can singlehandedly beat 
Kentucky, as he did in scoring 43 points in a first-round win over 
Washington. ``Granted, he's a good player. But no one player can 
beat us. No one player can beat a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, Kentucky was coming off a 3-4 February and a  
fourth straight Final Four trip for the Wildcats seemed unlikely. 
Now, the Wildcats are 5-0 in March and two wins away from a trip to 
St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	After juggling starting lineups and substitution patterns for  
most of the regular season, Smith has settled into a rotation where 
he rests starters Scott Padgett, Heshimu Evans, Wayne Turner, 
Desmond Allison and Michael Bradley about four or five minutes into 
each game and sends out a whole new second unit of Magloire, 
forwards Tayshaun Prince and Jules Camara and guards Ryan Hogan and 
Saul Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good time for us to try and press'' opposing teams,  
who usually don't have the same depth as Kentucky, Smith said. 
``We're hoping we can fatigue them a bit and then bring the first 
unit back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to wear people down with our bench strength.''  
</P>
<P>
	The tactic has served Kentucky well in the postseason. In the  
SEC championship game against Arkansas and again Sunday in the 
Wildcats' second-round NCAA win over Kansas, the second unit came 
off the bench to rally Kentucky from early deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak and the 10th-seeded RedHawks up next, fresh off  
their upset of second-seeded Utah, Smith said he did not plan any 
major changes to his basic ball-line, containment defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't used any gimmick defenses all year long,'' he said.  
``We're going to try to do something out of our regular man-to-man 
defense to try to limit his (Szczerbiak's) touches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak equally skilled at posting up and stepping  
outside for the perimeter jumpshot, as well as a strong passer and 
defender, Smith said there is no glaring weakness for the Wildcats 
to attack. The coach said he likely will try several different 
players on Szczerbiak, including senior forwards Padgett and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any one thing you can do to shut him  
down,'' he said. ``We'll just try to deny him the ball as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Padgett said there's more to Miami than Szczerbiak.  
Point guard Rob Mestas is a calm floor leader and skilled at 
distributing the ball, Smith said. Guard Damon Frierson is 
averaging 13.1 points per game and the entire team is skilled at 
getting Szczerbiak open for shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than anything, they feed off of when other teams  
go to double Wally,'' Padgett said. ``They have a team. It's not 
just Wally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Szczerbiak, the 6-foot-9 Padgett possesses inside-outside  
versatility, as he showed down the stretch in the Kansas game. He 
hit a 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime, nailed another long 
jumper to open the overtime, and then went inside to get to the 
foul line and make five free throws in the extra session as 
Kentucky won 92-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett said he has tried to focus on his post play in recent  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I post up, the more opportunities I get to get to the  
free-throw line,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Kentucky Gets Ready for Wally World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The tattoo on Wayne Turner's left bicep  
shows a globe and the words ``Wayne's World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean, however, that Turner or any other member of  
the Kentucky team thinks he is the sole answer to Miami of Ohio 
forward Wally Szczerbiak, better known as ``Wally World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message Tuesday from coach Tubby Smith and the Wildcat  
players was that if Kentucky (27-8) is to beat Miami (24-7) in 
Friday's third-round NCAA tournament game in St. Louis, it will be 
with a team effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one individual can beat a team,'' center Jamaal Magloire  
said when asked whether Szczerbiak can singlehandedly beat 
Kentucky, as he did in scoring 43 points in a first-round win over 
Washington. ``Granted, he's a good player. But no one player can 
beat us. No one player can beat a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, Kentucky was coming off a 3-4 February and a  
fourth straight Final Four trip for the Wildcats seemed unlikely. 
Now, the Wildcats are 5-0 in March and two wins away from a trip to 
St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	After juggling starting lineups and substitution patterns for  
most of the regular season, Smith has settled into a rotation where 
he rests starters Scott Padgett, Heshimu Evans, Wayne Turner, 
Desmond Allison and Michael Bradley about four or five minutes into 
each game and sends out a whole new second unit of Magloire, 
forwards Tayshaun Prince and Jules Camara and guards Ryan Hogan and 
Saul Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good time for us to try and press'' opposing teams,  
who usually don't have the same depth as Kentucky, Smith said. 
``We're hoping we can fatigue them a bit and then bring the first 
unit back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to wear people down with our bench strength.''  
</P>
<P>
	The tactic has served Kentucky well in the postseason. In the  
SEC championship game against Arkansas and again Sunday in the 
Wildcats' second-round NCAA win over Kansas, the second unit came 
off the bench to rally Kentucky from early deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak and the 10th-seeded RedHawks up next, fresh off  
their upset of second-seeded Utah, Smith said he did not plan any 
major changes to his basic ball-line, containment defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't used any gimmick defenses all year long,'' he said.  
``We're going to try to do something out of our regular man-to-man 
defense to try to limit his (Szczerbiak's) touches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak equally skilled at posting up and stepping  
outside for the perimeter jumpshot, as well as a strong passer and 
defender, Smith said there is no glaring weakness for the Wildcats 
to attack. The coach said he likely will try several different 
players on Szczerbiak, including senior forwards Padgett and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any one thing you can do to shut him  
down,'' he said. ``We'll just try to deny him the ball as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Padgett said there's more to Miami than Szczerbiak.  
Point guard Rob Mestas is a calm floor leader and skilled at 
distributing the ball, Smith said. Guard Damon Frierson is 
averaging 13.1 points per game and the entire team is skilled at 
getting Szczerbiak open for shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than anything, they feed off of when other teams  
go to double Wally,'' Padgett said. ``They have a team. It's not 
just Wally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Szczerbiak, the 6-foot-9 Padgett possesses inside-outside  
versatility, as he showed down the stretch in the Kansas game. He 
hit a 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime, nailed another long 
jumper to open the overtime, and then went inside to get to the 
foul line and make five free throws in the extra session as 
Kentucky won 92-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett said he has tried to focus on his post play in recent  
games. 
</P>

	``The more I post up, the more opportunities I get to get to the  
free-throw line,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Progress of Women's Rights Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women used to get arrested outside the White  
House for pushing for their rights. Now the feminists were welcomed 
in, embraced by the warm glow of the East Room, to celebrate a 
century of advancement and ponder what comes next. 
</P>
<P>
	By most accounts, tomorrow's problems didn't sound nearly as  
daunting as yesterday's when President Clinton, his wife and a 
crowd of scholars and activists gathered Monday evening to take 
stock of women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Where once women could not vote, waitresses were barred from  
working at night for the better tips, and married women were 
essentially treated as property, now they face many choices -- ``a 
constant stream of choices,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	They must choose whether to take the big promotion if they have  
a young child, she said. Or whether to try to come back into the 
work force after many years at home and risk being treated 
unfairly. Today's options are many, she said, but they ``exact 
consequences down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour ``millennium evening,'' part of a series of White  
House events showcasing American culture and ideas, was mainly 
about looking back at the history of women's community activism and 
political struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Evy Dubrow, one of the pioneer women activists of the ladies'  
garment union of old, pointed out that her sister, Mary, was 
arrested for picketing the White House before women were fully 
enfranchised in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	But a question from the public, taken from a correspondent who  
was following the discussion on the Internet, served as a reminder 
that women still face fundamental repression in some parts of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he'd do to help the women barred from work, education  
and much self-expression by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the 
president said he hopes to do more to highlight their plight, and 
favorably contrasted the treatment of women in Iran -- another 
fundamentalist Islamic state -- with the strictures imposed by the 
Taliban. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is simply not acceptable to say that this is nothing more  
than an expression of religious convictions,'' he said of 
Afghanistan. He noted ``there were hundreds of women candidates'' 
in Iran's recent municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton mostly listened, but stepped in to settle one question  
as scholars mused about the size and significance of the gender 
gap. ``You're looking at it,'' he said, meaning himself and his 
greater success in drawing votes from women than men. ``I would not 
be here if it did not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions were led by Ruth J. Simmons, a granddaughter of  
sharecroppers who now is president of Smith Collage; Rutgers labor 
historian Alice Kessler-Harris; and Nancy Cott, a Yale history 
professor and editor of a Young Oxford History of Women series. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton lamented how feminism, while meaning nothing more  
than a belief in equal rights, has become a label that women shy 
away from. ``That word has taken such a beating,'' she said. ``The 
language is attacked -- not so much the underlying concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Ms. Cott said she worries her students think feminism  
means ``hating men or not shaving your legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in any such movement, she said, people cast off the language  
of the old struggle when they are closing in on their goals. ``It's 
part of the promise of America,'' she said. ``They tend to want to 
forget the past.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Suisse Profits Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss banking group Credit Suisse's  
profit soared in 1998 despite heavy losses in Russia incurred by 
its Credit Suisse First Boston unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were at the top end of analysts' expectations. In  
early trading Tuesday, Credit Suisse shares were up 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank earned 3.1 billion Swiss francs ($2.74 billion) in 1998  
compared with 397 million francs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said it was difficult to compare the results  
because of a number of one-time charges and gains in each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross operating profits for 1998 were 6.6 billion francs ($4.5  
billion), down from 7.1 billion for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the company's five divisions showed profits, although  
Credit Suisse First Boston recorded a loss of 221 million francs 
($151 million), which the company blamed on the collapse of the 
Russian market, where the investment bank had a dominant position. 
In 1997 the division made a profit of 1.57 billion francs. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse Group chief executive Lukas Muehlemann said  
Tuesday that the bank's business has started well in 1999, 
including a profit contribution from Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the group will continue to reduce risk in Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	Muehlemann also ruled out the chances of a big merger for Credit  
Suisse in the near future, although he added the ``picture may 
change'' if the global banking sector continues to consolidate 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Thornburgh, currently the chief financial officer of  
CSG, has been appointed vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston 
from April 1. His place as the group's chief financial officer will 
be taken by Philip Ryan, currently chief financial officer of 
Credit Suisse Asset Management, who will become a member of the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The group employs more than 62,000 people worldwide, almost half  
of them in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Girl Sentenced for Bashing Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A high school girl has been sentenced  
to 2 1/2 to seven years in prison for bashing her pregnant teacher in 
the head with a hammer last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalise Salvatto, 16, attacked her social studies teacher Dawn  
Jawrower in a Yonkers classroom, hitting her twice with a 
carpenter's hammer. The teen-ager told police she was angry because 
Mrs. Jawrower had gone to her parents about her poor grades, 
causing her to miss the prom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jawrower, who suffered a fractured skull, said that she has  
almost fully recovered and that her baby, a boy now 3 months old, 
is fine. She has returned to teaching in another school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Salvatto pleaded guilty to assault.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really bad for what I've done,'' she said Tuesday,  
weeping. ``I felt worse when I found out you were pregnant. If I 
could take it back I would, in a second. ... I just want you to 
forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jawrower told a judge that her son, Nicolas, is ``a  
constant reminder of what she did to me,'' added that Miss Salvatto 
``needs to get help. ... She has a lot of potential and she needs 
to find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has ordered psychiatric counseling.

<HEADLINE> Jet Navigator To Face Fewer Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine Corps has dropped  
involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide charges against the 
navigator of the jet that severed an Italian ski gondola cable last 
year and killed 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., will be tried  
only on charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct 
justice when his general court-martial begins Thursday. Each charge 
carries a maximum of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the charges were dropped Monday, Schweitzer faced more  
than 200 years prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes less than two weeks after a jury acquitted  
the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, of 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter and one count each of destruction of military and 
private property, dereliction of duty and improper flight planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, like Schweitzer, still faces obstruction charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unreasonable to continue with these charges  
against the navigator in light of the pilot's acquittal,'' said Lt. 
Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Forces Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's acquittal outraged Italians and renewed calls to ban  
Americans from NATO air bases in Italy. After the accident in 
February 1998, residents of the Italian Alps around Cavalese 
complained that jets regularly flew recklessly near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to drop charges against Schweitzer drew immediate  
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cermis, case closed,'' read the front-page headline in Italy's  
La Repubblica daily over an account that began: ``For American 
military justice, the tragedy of (Mount) Cermis doesn't have any 
guilty parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate official reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one step backwards for these people who are  
trying to find justice and closure, so they can move on with their 
lives,'' said John Eaves Jr., an attorney who is representing 
relatives of some of the accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families not only want someone held responsible for  
the deaths of their loved ones but need to be financially 
compensated by the U.S. government, as the ski resort was, Eaves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction charges accuse Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo,  
Calif., and Schweitzer of hiding and later destroying a videotape 
Schweitzer shot during the flight. Ashby testified at his trial 
that Schweitzer took the tape and later told him it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape was shot with Ashby's camera, but Schweitzer put  
the camera away before the jet was far into the low-level training 
route from the NATO air base at Aviano, Ashby said. During closing 
arguments, a prosecutor hinted that the tape was shot during 
reckless flying just before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	All four crewmen in EA-6B Prowler anti-radar jet were charged  
after the mishap. Pace dropped all charges against two other 
crewmen after a judge said there was little evidence to warrant 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE>  Nets Can Calipari After 3-17 Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- John Calipari, whose season began with strong  
hopes and quickly turned to ``misery'' with a 3-17 start, is out as 
coach of the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired Monday after just 2 1/2 years and replaced by  
assistant Don Casey, whose stint begins with tonight's game against 
the Toronto Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say this about pro basketball: If you're a good group of  
guys and you're winning, there is no better gig in the world,'' 
Calipari said. ``But if you're losing and you have a few bad seeds, 
I can't explain to you misery like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was appointed interim coach while the Nets pursue former  
Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson. Jackson has said he would like to 
return to the NBA, but it's unclear if he's interested in the Nets 
or would move up his timetable to coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari had two years and $6 million remaining on his  
five-year, $15 million contract. He was offered a consulting job 
with the team, although he did not say if he would take it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	With his team beset by poor play and injuries and his players  
unhappy with his ``in your face'' style of coaching, Calipari's 
ouster had been widely anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying so hard to change his style,'' team owner Lewis  
Katz said. ``I don't know that there was a determining factor, but 
it was pretty obvious that he was in his misery as he watched the 
season slip away when there had been such high expectations at the 
start of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and co-owner Finn Wentworth met with Calipari after  
Sunday's 102-76 nationally televised loss at Miami. Calipari didn't 
accompany the team to Toronto, but flew separately to inform the 
players of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal said, ``Thank you'' and that's about it,'' Jayson Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games. Only the Los Angeles Clippers 
(1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari reshaped  
a mediocre University of Massachusetts and took it to a Final Four. 
He was then given the power to change the Nets from a laughingstock 
into a winner, and made some progress. But this season dissolved in 
a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and team president Michael Rowe flanked Calipari at a news  
conference Monday, with Katz calling Calipari a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown says he will offer Calipari a job  
as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was the head coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89  
season and has spent the last three seasons as Calipari's top 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets' problems began on opening night when point guard Sam  
Cassell sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games after that, 
and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and later Doug 
Overton at the point. Williams, the All-Star center, has played 
with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season, although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In 2 1/2 years, look where it is. Four or five years 
ago, no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm OK with that. I don't own the 
team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the losing 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very blessed man,'' Calipari said. ``I 
came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn around 
an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like  
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.''

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Tape Part of McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
previously secret Whitewater testimony was shown in court today in 
the trial of one of the Clintons' former business partners, Susan 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was not present as the judge allowed Mrs. McDougal's  
defense attorney to preview 40 minutes of Mrs. Clinton's videotaped 
testimony in open court. U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. 
ruled earlier today that prosecutors could show the tape to the 
jury after the preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure of Mrs. Clinton's secret testimony in 1998 about  
Whitewater revives the troublesome political issue as she is 
considering a run for the U.S. Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape began with deputy prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing Jr.  
explaining the independent counsel's authority and asking Mrs. 
Clinton if she understood that her testimony could be used against 
her. The first lady, wearing a yellow suit, appeared serious, 
nodding and occasionally smiling slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In allowing the tape, the judge agreed with Kenneth Starr's  
prosecutors that McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos had opened the door 
to showing Mrs. Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos suggested Thursday in questioning FBI agent Mike Patkus  
that prosecutors had never bothered to ask questions of the first 
lady that the investigators now want Mrs. McDougal to answer about 
a disputed two-decade-old loan in the name of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett stressed that Mrs. Clinton's testimony  
is not being shown to prove the truth of what the first lady said, 
but simply to show that the prosecutors did ask her questions about 
a $27,600 loan in her husband's name and how the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton testified in a deposition in Washington on April  
25, 1998, two days after Mrs. McDougal appeared before the 
Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock and refused to answer 
questions. Mrs. Clinton's videotaped testimony was shown to the 
grand jury in Little Rock on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony has been secret for nearly a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers said two parts of Mrs. Clinton's  
testimony would be shown -- a section of about 35 minutes and 
another of about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In prosecution papers obtained by The Associated Press, Starr's  
office suggested Mrs. Clinton's testimony on Whitewater 
transactions made it more critical than ever for Mrs. McDougal to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The videotape will show that the first lady testified that she  
had no knowledge or information about either'' a $27,600 loan made 
in Bill Clinton's name in 1982 or a $5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. 
McDougal in 1983 and used to pay off part of the Clinton loan, said 
the prosecutors' papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at the 1996 trial of the McDougals and  
then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker that he never had taken out a loan at the 
McDougals' savings and loan. Prosecutors say the $27,600 loan in 
Clinton's name, which they discovered in 1996, was used to pay off 
a $30,000 Whitewater debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' court papers said the videotape will establish  
the importance of questions posed to and answered by Mrs. Clinton 
and prepared for'' Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to correct what they said was the false  
impression left by defense questioning of FBI agent Michael Patkus 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus said he didn't think Mrs. Clinton had been asked at her  
videotaped deposition of April 25, 1998, about the loan from James 
and Susan McDougal's savings and loan made out to Bill Clinton and 
the check on a James McDougal account, payable to Madison Guaranty, 
and bearing the notation ``payoff Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, is on trial on two counts of criminal  
contempt and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to 
answer grand jury questions Sept. 4, 1996, and April 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her ex-husband, James, who died in prison last year,  
were business partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater land 
development venture in Arkansas from 1979 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal claims she has no information pertinent to the  
case. She says she refused to answer questions because she believed 
Starr would twist her words around and use them to suit his own 
agenda or would charge her with perjury if he did not like what she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also alleges that Starr's deputies have used false  
information from her ex-husband and David Hale, a former judge and 
businessman, to pursue their investigation of her and the Clintons.

<HEADLINE>  Nets Can Calipari After 3-17 Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- John Calipari, whose season began with strong  
hopes and quickly turned to ``misery'' with a 3-17 start, is out as 
coach of the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired Monday after just 2 1/2 years and replaced by  
assistant Don Casey, whose stint begins with tonight's game against 
the Toronto Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say this about pro basketball: If you're a good group of  
guys and you're winning, there is no better gig in the world,'' 
Calipari said. ``But if you're losing and you have a few bad seeds, 
I can't explain to you misery like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was appointed interim coach while the Nets pursue former  
Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson. Jackson has said he would like to 
return to the NBA, but it's unclear if he's interested in the Nets 
or would move up his timetable to coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari had two years and $6 million remaining on his  
five-year, $15 million contract. He was offered a consulting job 
with the team, although he did not say if he would take it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	With his team beset by poor play and injuries and his players  
unhappy with his ``in your face'' style of coaching, Calipari's 
ouster had been widely anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying so hard to change his style,'' team owner Lewis  
Katz said. ``I don't know that there was a determining factor, but 
it was pretty obvious that he was in his misery as he watched the 
season slip away when there had been such high expectations at the 
start of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and co-owner Finn Wentworth met with Calipari after  
Sunday's 102-76 nationally televised loss at Miami. Calipari didn't 
accompany the team to Toronto, but flew separately to inform the 
players of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal said, ``Thank you'' and that's about it,'' Jayson Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games. Only the Los Angeles Clippers 
(1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari reshaped  
a mediocre University of Massachusetts and took it to a Final Four. 
He was then given the power to change the Nets from a laughingstock 
into a winner, and made some progress. But this season dissolved in 
a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and team president Michael Rowe flanked Calipari at a news  
conference Monday, with Katz calling Calipari a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown says he will offer Calipari a job  
as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was the head coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89  
season and has spent the last three seasons as Calipari's top 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets' problems began on opening night when point guard Sam  
Cassell sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games after that, 
and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and later Doug 
Overton at the point. Williams, the All-Star center, has played 
with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season, although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In 2 1/2 years, look where it is. Four or five years 
ago, no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm OK with that. I don't own the 
team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the losing 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very blessed man,'' Calipari said. ``I 
came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn around 
an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like  
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Programmer Wants To Go Younger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's incoming programming chief wants his new  
network to attract younger people, something he knows about from 
his work at the WB. 
</P>
<P>
	Garth Ancier was appointed president of NBC Entertainment on  
Monday. Scott Sassa, who's had that job since last fall, was 
promoted to president of NBC West Coast, succeeding Don Ohlmeyer, 
who will remain with the network as a senior consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier said he wants the median age of NBC's viewers, now at 43,  
to drop to 38. Younger viewers tend to be more attractive to 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is in position to unseat NBC as the season leader in  
television ratings this year, though the race is still close. NBC 
has been hurt by the loss of ``Seinfeld'' and NFL football, though 
its audience is generally more attractive to advertisers than 
CBS's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier's appointment was anticipated for several months. He  
announced in December that he would leave the WB, which he helped 
build into a minor success story with programs like ``Dawson's 
Creek'' that appealed to teen-aged viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier, 41, officially joins NBC on May 10, after his contract  
with the WB expires. 
</P>
<P>
	He's worked with Sassa in the past at Fox. Ancier said he  
anticipated he would concentrate on programming while Sassa pays 
more attention to the business of running the network's 
entertainment division.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Africa Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed to expand  
debt relief for impoverished African nations, saying the United 
States is firmly committed to building a new relationship with the 
continent that will ``lower the hurdles left by past mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One year after his historic visit to Africa, Clinton sought to  
assure African government ministers that he is working to fulfill 
the promises he made there by declaring a U.S. commitment to Africa 
``for the long haul'' and offering a plan to forgive an extra $70 
billion in debt owed by the most heavily indebted, poor nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too much of this century, the relationship between the  
United States and Africa was plagued by indifference on our part,'' 
Clinton said. ``We have been too separate and too unequal. We must 
end that by building a better common future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also pressed Congress to approve his African trade  
initiative, a plan he touted so heavily during his six-nation tour. 
That legislation has been hung up in Congress practically from the 
moment Clinton returned from his trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is saying it will be easy, but we are resolved to help  
lower the hurdles left by past mistakes,'' Clinton said. ``There 
are many friends of Africa in Congress, and many strong opinions on 
how best to help Africa. I hope they will quickly find consensus. 
Africa needs action now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debt relief plan was one of the goals Clinton explained to  
the U.S.-Africa Ministerial Partnership for the 21st Century, a 
three-day conference on the burgeoning relationships between the 
United States and sub-Saharan nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkina Faso Foreign Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo, chairman of  
the Organization of African Unity's council of ministers, said debt 
relief is vital but may be insufficient, because the economic 
growth Africa has experienced has not brought ``noticeable 
improvement'' in the living conditions of ordinary Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of growth, Mr. President, are still absorbed in  
large part by debt repayment,'' Ouedraogo said. ``It is time then 
to go to the heart of the matter, debt cancellation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting is the first of its kind, and the largest.  
Officials from 46 sub-Saharan countries were invited, as well as 
representatives from four North African nations: Algeria, Egypt, 
Morocco and Tunisia. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled 
to depart this weekend on a goodwill tour of those nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Monday that the many workshops and  
sessions are expected to yield a ``blueprint document'' that will 
outline how to move forward on several fronts, from education to 
debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're past simply the vision,'' said Susan Rice, assistant  
U.S. secretary of state for African affairs. ``We're into roll up 
our sleeves and let's figure out where we go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had hoped that the African Growth and  
Opportunity Act that Clinton pushed last year would have been 
approved by now. But the bill, which seeks to promote growth by 
forgiving debt and lowering tariffs on some African imports, is 
stuck in the House Ways and Means Committee due to a dispute over 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond trade, the African ministers will discuss building  
democracy, resolving conflicts, trade, investment, agriculture and 
AIDS. They also will make informal contacts about wars and other 
disputes in Sierra Leone, Congo, Angola and Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
	But foremost, they will look for signs of a solid U.S.  
commitment to combat the spread of AIDS and support African 
peacekeeping forces in volatile Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to talk about some dollars there? I doubt it,''  
said Mel Foote, director of the U.S.-based advocacy group 
Constituency for Africa. ``If we let a country like Sierra Leone go 
down the tubes, everybody is watching that. There are a lot of 
people wondering how serious we are. How do we show that we're 
serious if we don't respond to some of this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Jackson, Clinton's envoy for democracy in Africa, said the  
president hopes to find a number of ways to reduce the grim impact 
AIDS is having in sub-Saharan nations, including joining with other 
allies in a multinational campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``African development policy must deal with the impact of AIDS  
both as a physical issue as well as an economic issue,'' Jackson 
said. ``Western allies must immediately mobilize resources, 
medicines and education in some emergency way, as we did with 
poverty in Ethiopia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said today's gathering underscores the  
new U.S. commitment shown in Clinton's trip -- as well as in 
journeys taken by Mrs. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Cabinet 
members -- to make inroads into the traditionally stronger influence 
of former colonial powers France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluded from today's gathering were Sudan, on the State  
Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, and Somalia, 
which has no central government. Libya received no invitation 
because the United States considers it a terrorist state.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Oklahoma State Star Is Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) -- Terry Miller, a former Oklahoma State  
running back who was a runnerup in the 1977 Heisman Trophy voting, 
has been charged with fraud for his alleged dealings with a 
McAlester bank four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors allege that Miller knowingly devised a  
scheme to defraud The Bank N.A. by submitting false invoices. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller would then receive advance funds from the bank under a  
$1.5 million agreement it had with Miller's Oklahoma City-based 
wholesale sportswear distributorship, Sports Nut Inc., according to 
the information filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of Oklahoma in Muskogee, 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. assistant attorney general Jeff Gallant said Miller has yet  
to appear in court on the one count of bank fraud and has not 
waived indictment. Gallant would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records indicate that Miller, who was not available for  
comment, has not been arrested, and no court date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	While at Oklahoma State, Miller was one of the pre-eminent  
running backs in the nation. He gained 1,680 yards rushing in his 
senior year, finishing second in the 1977 Heisman voting to Earl 
Campbell of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran for 1,714 yards in his junior year, receiving the most  
Heisman votes of any underclassman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Buffalo Bills' first-round pick in the 1978 draft. He  
replaced O.J. Simpson in the Bills' backfield and gained 1,060 
yards as a rookie. Injuries ended his career a few years later.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Verdict in Immigrant Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An alleged skinhead is facing life in prison for  
gunning down a West African immigrant and leaving a bystander who 
tried to help paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah Barnum's face went white after he was convicted Monday  
of first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder for the 
1997 shootings. The Denver District Court jury had deliberated less 
than two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, a first-degree murder conviction carries a  
mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. Prosecutors 
said they would not seek the death penalty. Defense attorneys vowed 
to appeal 
</P>
<P>
	Barnum, 25, is to be sentenced April 30.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have anything to celebrate about as the life of Oumar  
Dia is lost forever,'' said Mohamedou Cisse, a childhood friend of 
Dia, who worked as a Hyatt Hotel bellhop. ``But I am satisfied that 
justice has been served.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnum and Nathan Thill, who have ties to the skinhead movement,  
were charged with killing Dia at a Denver bus stop in November 
1997. They were also accused of shooting Jeannie VanVelkinburgh, a 
bystander who tried to help Dia and was left paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill, 21, is accused of pulling the trigger and will be tried  
on identical charges next month. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Barnum and Thill  
killed Dia because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys argued that Barnum didn't know Thill would  
open fire. They said Barnum is a changed man who has renounced his 
previously held racist views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there was any evidence whatsoever that he still  
harbors any of the belief system that he had as a young man,'' said 
Peter Bornstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found Barnum guilty of ethnic intimidation and  
first-degree assault.

<HEADLINE> Frontrunner Nearing Iditarod Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley's runaway victory in the 1999  
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race moved closer to reality Tuesday, but 
behind him a challenge was heating up for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., mushed his 12-dog team into the  
White Mountain checkpoint at 7:46 a.m. Alaska time (11:46 a.m. 
EST). White Mountain, a few miles inland from the Bering Sea, is 77 
miles from the finish line in the historic Gold Rush town of Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	Iditarod rules require an eight-hour rest stop in White  
Mountain, so Swingley won't be back on the trail until late Tuesday 
afternoon. Travel time to Nome is expected to take at least 10 
hours, putting the soon-to-be winner into town in the wee hours 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley will be rewarded for his effort with $54,000 in prize  
money and a new pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	More than six hours back was three-time Iditarod champion Martin  
Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, and not far behind him and closing was 
Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, who has won the 1,100-mile race 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser left the Koyuk checkpoint at 2:15 a.m. with nine dogs, and  
Swenson pulled out at 5:17 a.m. with 11 dogs. Koyuk is 170 miles 
from Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to catch Martin,'' Swenson said. ``I don't know if  
that's reasonable, but he seems to be going quite a bit slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Buser was as much as eight hours up on Swenson, and  
on Tuesday he was apparently feeling the pressure. He dashed 
through Elim, 48 miles up the trail from Koyuk, at about 8:30 a.m. 
with no rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The normally buoyant Buser was forced to drop six of his 16 dogs  
early in the race, among them his best leader. Doing that so soon 
demoralized him and his finely tuned team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I dropped the dogs, I was down in the dumps,'' he said  
in Unalakleet. ``I tried not to let the (remaining) dogs catch 
that, but it's hard when you're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours behind Swenson were Vern Halter of Willow, Alaska,  
and Charlie Boulding of Manley, Alaska. Four more Alaskans were a 
couple of hours further back -- John Baker of Kotzebue, Paul 
Gebhardt of Kasilof, Jeff King of Denali Park and Ed Iten of 
Kotzebue. 
</P>
<P>
	King, the defending Iditarod champion, has long since given up  
any aspirations to keep up with Buser or Swenson. His team of eight 
dogs was fourth into Unalakleet, less than two hours behind 
Swenson, but in need of a much longer rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the risk of sounding smug, I really don't care if I'm fifth  
or 15th,'' King, a three-time race winner, told KNOM radio. ``I'd 
be doing this differently if I was in a position ... to be one of 
the potential winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were more financially motivated to move up in the final  
standings. Fifth place pays about $31,000, while 15th about 
$11,000. The Iditarod is the world's richest sled-dog race, with a 
total purse of $450,000. Prize money is paid to the first 20 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six teams were out of Shaktoolik, about 60 miles before Koyuk.  
Among them was Linwood Fiedler of Willow, Alaska, who was resigned 
to the fact that his team of nine dogs was losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody in this group that I'm going to catch,''  
Fiedler said after arriving 12th in Unalakleet amidst a large clump 
of mushers. He was 14th out of Shaktoolik. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine of the 56 mushers who started March 6 in Anchorage  
remained on the trail. Bringing up the rear were a trio of race 
rookies still heading north on the frozen Yukon River -- Dario 
Daniels of Bird Creek, Alaska, and Judy Currier and Shane Goosen, 
both of Wasilla, Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Salmon Ruling May Have Wide Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The government's move to protect salmon in the  
Pacific Northwest could affect logging, home-building and lawn 
fertilizing -- and could even mean higher rates for water and power. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service on Tuesday listed nine  
wild salmon populations -- seven in Washington, including the 
once-mighty Puget Sound chinook, and two in Oregon -- as threatened 
or endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of protecting salmon habitat are ``going to trickle  
right down to everybody,'' said Eleanor Thornton of Forks, a town 
on the Olympic Peninsula that was devastated by logging 
restrictions imposed after the 1990 listing of the northern spotted 
owl. 
</P>
<P>
	The action by the National Marine Fisheries Service covers the  
salmon populations in seven ``runs'' in Washington and two in 
Oregon, in bodies of water from Washington's Puget Sound to 
Oregon's Willamette Valley, 300 miles away. It includes the 
Northwest's largest cities: Seattle and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Washington's 5.6 million people depend on  
watersheds essential to the Puget Sound chinook, said Curt Smitch, 
Gov. Gary Locke's adviser on salmon issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In other endangered species cases affecting urban areas --  
falcons and certain cactus in Southern California, for example -- 
``people have been able to set aside certain land areas to protect 
a species,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the threatened salmon live where we live, and  
they live in the water, which goes everywhere,'' Smitch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to control runoff into streams where the salmon spawn  
could lead to reductions in the amount of land available for 
logging and home building, and affect the fertilizers and 
pesticides people spray on their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be huge in terms of potential costs to home builders  
and eventually to home buyers,'' said Kelly Ross, director of 
government affairs for Oregon's Homebuilders Association of 
Metropolitan Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing could even have implications on the region's  
high-tech companies, which produce runoff that's almost always 
warmer than streams. Higher temperatures can harm aquatic life by 
reducing dissolved oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a general recognition that there is more work to  
do,'' said Mike Salsgiver, Oregon government affairs manager for 
Intel, the computer chip giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also predicted that hydropower generators and  
waste-treatment operators will spend millions to meet the new 
regulations and pass those costs on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The listings won't take effect for about two months, allowing a  
``cooling-off period'' and a chance for federal agencies to rewrite 
regulations, said Brian Gorman of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' said  
Pat Nibler, operations manager for Prograss, a lawn and landscaping 
company in Wilsonville, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's federal action also is likely to mean new limits on  
both commercial and sport salmon fishing and Tom Cromie, who has 
worked at the Point Defiance Marina in Tacoma for 25 years, fears 
he could lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our whole operation revolves around salmon fishing. ...  
Fishing is primarily why people have their boats here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is going to go down the tubes,'' said sports angler

	But it's not likely to mean consumers won't find salmon at the  
grocery store, since retailers have become reliant on farm-raised 
salmon, said Harry Calvo, manager of Pure Food Fish Market in 
Seattle's downtown Pike Place Market.

<P>
	``Without farmed salmon we wouldn't be in business,'' Calvo  
said.

<HEADLINE> AMEX Boss To Head Thermo Electron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Richard F. Syron is stepping down as  
chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange and 
will become chief executive of the medical instruments and 
equipment maker Thermo Electron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Syron, who was formerly president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Boston, became head of the American Stock Exchange in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be leaving that post in June, seven months after the  
Amex became a division of the National Association of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thermo Electron, he will replace George N. Hatsopoulos as  
chief executive. Hatsopoulos, 72, has headed the company since 
founding it in 1956. He will remain as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Syron, 55, has been a director of Thermo Electron since  
September 1997. He also will be president of Thermo Electron. Arvin 
Smith, now the president, will stay with the company as an advisor. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Watertown, Syron was recruited for the Federal  
Reserve post in 1989 by Hatsopoulos, who had been a Federal Reserve 
Bank board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Syron was chief executive of the Federal Home Loan Bank of  
Boston before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Thermo Electron has 25,000 employees, and had sales last year of  
$3.9 billion. But profits have dropped, and the company is being 
reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday that its first quarter profits would be  
about 15 cents a share, short of the 19 cents that analysts had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Thermo Electron created companies around technologies it  
developed, and then sold minority interest in them to the public, 
retaining 60 to 90 percent ownership It has 23 such companies and 
plans to reduce that to 16 by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatsopoulos said Syron was chosen to succeed him after the  
company hired a search firm and interviewed more than 30 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``My health is very good, but I got tired of working 70 hours a  
week,'' Hatsopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an extraordinary opportunity,'' said Syron.  
</P>
<P>
	Hatsopoulos's brother, John Hatsopoulos, 64, retired in January  
as president of Thermo Electron. He will remain as vice chairman.

<HEADLINE> It's Been a Dark Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- This is supposed to be baseball's time of  
hope and optimism. Instead, it's turned into a spring training full 
of sickness and severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Torre, Andres Galarraga and Mike Lowell diagnosed with  
cancer. The death of Joe DiMaggio, and a minor league pitcher 
killed in a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Moises Alou wrecking his knee, Kerry Ligtenberg throwing out his  
elbow. And now, Kerry Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think about all the wonderful things that happened in  
baseball last year -- McGwire and Sosa, Kerry Wood having his great 
rookie year and Joe Torre winning 114 games with the Yankees -- and 
you wonder if things are trying to balance out now with a lot of 
bad things,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said after Tuesday's 
game against Kansas City in Haines City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the rash of ill fortune has become topic No. 1 in some  
spring locker rooms, more so than talk about the early exhibition 
home runs hit by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always injuries in spring training, but I've never  
seen so many stars get hurt,'' Detroit outfielder Luis Polonia said 
in Lakeland, Fla. ``There have been a lot of big names this year. 
It's unfortunate, but that's how life goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood became this spring's latest victim when the Chicago Cubs  
learned their 21-year-old pitcher would probably miss the season 
because of an elbow injury. The setback not only took away the 
team's strikeout ace, but robbed baseball of one of its most 
exciting phenoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman said at Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta lost Galarraga last month on the same day pitchers and  
catchers were to report to camp. The first baseman, who hit .305 
with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs, will miss the season because of 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also will be minus Ligtenberg for at least a month,  
and possibly the whole year. Coming off a rookie season in which he 
recorded 30 saves, Ligtenberg partially tore a ligament in his 
right elbow while pitching in a game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker and the Astros are trying to make up for the loss of  
Alou, expected to miss most of the season, if not all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star outfielder, who hit .312 with 38 homers and 124  
RBIs, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last 
month when he fell off a treadmill at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' camp has been subdued. First, Joe DiMaggio  
died. Then, Torre disclosed he had prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 victories and the  
World Series championship, will undergo surgery Thursday. He did 
not set a date for his return, though he managed to maintain his 
humor in discussing his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned to someone that now I know why all of those bloop  
singles fell in last year,'' he said in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, a rookie third baseman traded by the Yankees to the  
Florida Marlins last month, was diagnosed with testicular cancer a 
few days before he was supposed to start workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major league pitcher Ken Robinson was killed in a car  
crash on Feb. 28, shortly before he was to report to Arizona's 
minor league camp. He was buried in his Diamondbacks uniform, and a 
teammate, John Rosengren, was indicted on a manslaughter charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Cleveland pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews were killed  
and Bob Ojeda was injured in a boating accident on Little Lake 
Nellie near the Indians' camp in Winter Haven, Fla. The crash came 
during the team's only off-day at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, Robin Ventura broke his right ankle in a gruesome  
slide at home plate, and did not come back to the Chicago White Sox 
until after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Angels pitcher Matt Keough was hit in the head by a  
line drive off the bat of San Francisco's John Patterson while 
sitting in the dugout. Keough, in camp as a non-roster player, 
underwent brain surgery. He recovered but never pitched again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryne Sandberg and Chipper Jones also sustained serious injuries  
in previous springs and St. Louis pitcher Scott Radinsky, then with 
the White Sox, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease at camp in 
1994.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Co-Owner DeBartolo Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The 49ers lost co-owner Eddie DeBartolo for at  
least another year and San Francisco's hold on the 2003 Super Bowl 
also appears to be slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who withdrew from active ownership of the team  
because of legal problems, was fined $1 million and his banishment 
was extended through the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Tuesday cited conduct detrimental  
to the NFL in imposing the sanctions on DeBartolo, who pledged to 
abide by the league's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's action leaves the 49ers under the control of  
DeBartolo's sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and her husband, John 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said DeBartolo could be reinstated a year from now but  
also could be fined an additional $4 million fine if he violates 
terms of his agreement with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's a friend of mine,'' Denver Broncos owner Patrick  
Bowlen said. ``I'm sorry for his difficulties. I look forward to 
having him back as an owner in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with plans for the 49ers' new stadium stalled, the  
NFL appeared ready to take the 2003 Super Bowl away from San 
Francisco. Tagliabue said the issue would be taken up later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision hasn't been made, but sources attending the NFL  
owners meetings said Tuesday the lack of progress toward building a 
replacement for aging 3Com Park forced the league to look elsewhere 
to stage the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said San Francisco's hold on the game was tenuous.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to play a Super Bowl there but we're not going to do  
it until we get a new stadium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego and Phoenix were among the cities mentioned as an  
alternate host for the league's marquee event should the NFL yank 
the game out of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's right to be host of the Super Bowl was  
contingent on construction of the stadium. Soaring cost estimates 
and months of tumult within the 49ers' inner circle left the 
project in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	York, a senior vice president of the family-run Edward J.  
DeBartolo Corp., who also has joined the 49ers' front office, said 
the team still hopes to build a stadium. But he conceded the 
project might not get on track in time to rescue the Super Bowl for 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told if we pick it up we can still get ready, but  
you've got to recognize that this is going to be one of the more 
expensive, if not the most expensive, stadiums built,'' York said. 
``It is more important to make the right decisions and do the right 
thing for both the 49ers and the city than it is to start tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the important thing is we're committed to a stadium,  
but I can't put a timetable on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the second time the NFL took the Super Bowl away  
from San Francisco. The city was supposed to have the 1999 
championship, but approval by league owners was contingent upon an 
estimated $26 million in renovations to 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pumping the money into upgrades, however, the 49ers  
pushed for a new stadium, and in June 1997 voters approved a $525 
million measure for a new stadium and shopping mall next to 3Com 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With the imposition of formal sanctions, DeBartolo was further  
isolated from the team he ran for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew as active owner in December 1997 after becoming  
entangled in a Louisiana gambling fraud case, and his attempts to 
regain control of the team have been rebuffed amid a growing rift 
with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	York said the two siblings at one time were close to an  
agreement that would have returned control of the team to 
DeBartolo, but that deal now appears dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Denise has the reins and she's committed to keeping  
the team and running it,'' York said. ``For the good of both 
parties, both Eddie and Denise need to have a resolution, because 
their business interests are different and they go along different 
paths. So it's going to be best for the two of them to be 
separated, business-wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony and was fined $2 million and placed on probation. BeBartolo 
also agreed to testify against his friend and former Louisiania 
Gov. Edwin Edwards and others charged in an alleged 
influence-peddling scheme involving the awarding of a riverboat 
gambling license.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Not Ready for PGA Tour Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- He blasted his drive down the 16th fairway  
and hit a 7-iron to four feet for eagle at the Bay Hill Club. That 
wasn't nearly enough to get Michael Jordan thinking about a second 
career in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my taste of what it's like to be in the PGA atmosphere,  
and I don't think I want that,'' Jordan said after the Bay Hill 
pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time since he announced his retirement from  
basketball that Jordan teed it up with the pros. He played three 
rounds in the Bob Hope Classic in January with Charles Barkley and 
Roy Green. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he played with someone with whom he shares a lot in  
common -- Arnold Palmer. Both are among the most popular their sport 
has known, both are always willing to ham it up for a delighted 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a treat to play with him,'' Jordan said. ``If you  
ever try to pattern your career after someone, look at Arnold. I 
have a lot of respect for him. It didn't take much for him to get 
me down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clowning started as soon as they walked on the first tee.  
Jordan had his picture taken with Palmer's grandson as Palmer 
looked on in mock disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want your picture taken with me, Sam,'' Palmer told  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan ripped his drive down the middle on the 18th, only to  
watch country singer Amy Grant hit her drive alongside him from the 
forward tees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she outdrove you,'' Palmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who hasn't played since injuring his finger on a cigar  
cutter five weeks ago, said he was nervous on the first tee with 
about 2,000 people watching, but played better on the back nine. 
Along with his eagle, he made a par on the 18th (net birdie) to 
give their team a 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``In basketball, I have all the right skills and I perfected  
those skills,'' Jordan said. ``Here, I'm in a game that you can't 
perfect it. You can lose it as quick as you get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RANKING HONOR:* The Official World Golf Ranking, long an enigma  
that rarely had much value except for endorsement contracts mainly 
for European players, is getting more attention with each passing 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	First, it determined the 64-man field for the $5 million Match  
Play Championship. Then, Augusta National decided to give the top 
50 invitations to the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will announce  
the Mark H. McCormack Award, which will go to the player who has 
been ranked No. 1 for the most weeks during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The award is named after the IMG president, who first published  
the rankings in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOST AND FOUND:* When Charles Raulerson made a double-eagle at  
Doral with a 6-iron from 202 yards, his wife Liza -- also his caddie 
-- wanted him to save the ball as a keepsake. But Raulerson has a 
superstition about keeping a ball in play after a birdie or better, 
and two holes later sliced his tee shot into the water hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry. His wife went out the next morning and found the  
ball embedded in the bank. She knew it was his Strata because of 
the markings, which includes a purple stripe in honor of his 
college days at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I've got it, we won't lose it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL DAY:* Glen Day, a slow-talking Southerner with the a  
reputation for slow play, says he made an effort to pick up the 
pace and believes it has contributed to lower scores and more money 
-- nearly $1.3 million last year, his best ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make up my mind what kind of shot I am going to hit and then  
hit,'' Day said. ``That does not always guarantee it's going to be 
better, but it gives you an opportunity to hit a better shot. I 
played real, real slow, and it's something that I needed to work 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I was working on that, I found that making up my mind,  
hitting shots ... I played better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he keeps that up, it won't be long before he sheds his  
nickname -- ``All,'' as in All Day. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PGA SITES:* The PGA Championship, after going 54 years between  
stops in Washington state, will return to Sahalee Country Club near 
Seattle in 2010. By that time, Vijay Singh, who won his first major 
at Sahalee in August, will be three years away from the senior 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America also awarded the 2009 PGA Championship to  
Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn., which already has 
been picked to hold the 2002 PGA and likely will get the 2015 Ryder 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA will never be accused of not looking ahead. With the  
exception of the 2007 PGA, every U.S.-based Ryder Cup and PGA 
Championship site has been decided through 2011. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Mark O'Meara made his Masters champions dinner menu  
official Tuesday: Sushi during the cocktail party, steak and 
chicken fajitas for the main course. ``Hopefully, all the guys will 
like it,'' he said. ... Tom Watson says he will play the senior 
tour almost exclusively next year, but his entire schedule will be 
comprised of no more than about 20 tournaments. ... Maxfli is 
starting to show commercials aimed at capturing the obsession with 
golf -- practice swings in airports, elevators, even football 
fields. Among those doing the ``Air Swing'' in the new spots are 
John Elway, with coach Mike Shanahan looking on. ... 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONEY MATTERS:* A year ago, John Huston led the money list with  
$646,490 in seven events concluding with the Honda Classic. That 
would be good for 12th place this year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Tom Kite is the only player who has won all  
four tournaments that currently make up the Florida swing. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``Basketball is good. You get good money,  
guaranteed contracts. In golf, you've got to earn it.'' -- Michael 
Jordan, speaking to Arnold Palmer's 11-year-old grandson.

<HEADLINE> Chafee's Son To Run for Senate Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The son of retiring Republican Sen. John  
Chaffee announced Tuesday that he will seek his father's seat in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Chaffee, the mayor of Warwick, said he will try to pick  
up where his father left off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do everything possible to run a successful U.S.  
Senate race,'' the younger Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Chaffee announced Monday that he would not seek a  
fifth Senate term in 2000. A former three-term governor of Rhode 
Island, Chaffee, 76, was Secretary of the Navy before he became a 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, he  
also has carved out a record that consistently wins the praise of 
national environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects, it's a goal that might seem unattainable to  
contribute in the way that he has,'' said Lincoln Chafee, 45. ``But 
conversely, it's also a great inspiration to bring honor to the 
name as he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Chaffee, like his father, is known as a moderate  
Republican in predominantly Democratic Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> 'Dawson' Gay Story Taken in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was something striking about the public's  
reaction when a character in ``Dawson's Creek'' came out as gay at 
the same time the show's creative leader revealed his homosexuality 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking, because the reaction was virtual silence.  
</P>
<P>
	No loud protests from outraged church or conservative groups. No  
``Yep, I'm Gay!'' magazine cover. No celebrities treating it as a 
crusade. No ponderous essays about what it means to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	No one could have missed it when Ellen DeGeneres and her  
character on ``Ellen'' came out two years ago. So it may be her 
most lasting legacy that on ``Dawson's Creek,'' a provocative gay 
story line in a popular teen-age drama series is causing barely a 
ripple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dawson's Creek,'' on the relatively little-watched WB network,  
may fly below the radar screen of many of society's guardians. But 
although DeGeneres had a higher profile, what has been happening on 
``Dawson's Creek'' over the past month has far greater meaning for 
what social critics would call impressionable youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good sign, and I'm thrilled about the lack of  
controversy,'' said Kevin Williamson, the show's creator. ``I was 
kind of expecting this. I was hoping, at least, that the climate 
was better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson considers ``Dawson's Creek'' autobiographical, with  
each character emphasizing some aspect of his personality. Dawson 
is the Spielberg geek who sees life as a film. Joey has 
Williamson's sarcastic side. Pacey is the jokester and Jen is the 
rebel. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Jack, a new character portrayed by actor Kerr Smith,  
stands for Williamson's sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the moment we brought him on, we knew he was going to  
eventually come out of the closet,'' he said. ``I wasn't always 
sure what would be the best, most powerful way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first inkling came when Jack read a poem in his high school  
class that hinted at an attraction to men. He quickly became a 
target for harassment when someone spray-painted an antigay epithet 
on his locker. Jack wrestled with his feelings, finally declaring 
his homosexuality to his outraged father. 
</P>
<P>
	The story finds its texture in the reactions of those around  
him. Jen's religious boyfriend objects to Jack and is lectured by 
her previously one-dimensional grandmother on the nature of caring. 
The response of Joey to her boyfriend declaring he's gay is largely 
unexplored territory for television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parents Television Council, a conservative media watchdog  
group, didn't alert its members to the story. Many people concerned 
about sexual content on television aren't even aware of what's been 
happening on ``Dawson's Creek,'' said Mark Honig, its executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring up the fact that there are homosexuals in society is  
not something to rant and rave about at this point,'' he said. 
NBC's sitcom ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' about a homosexual man and his best 
friend, a heterosexual woman, met with the same nonreaction when it 
debuted last fall.

	Honig's group may feel differently if Jack starts dating men, he  
said. ``With all the other problems on `Dawson's Creek,' this is 
just one to throw into the batch,'' Honig said. He mentioned 
Pacey's affair with a teacher and the show's frequent sexually 
charged dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jack confronted his sexuality was the idea of one of the  
show's writers, who knew someone who came out through a poetry 
reading in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somebody's story, but not mine,'' Williamson said. ``I  
had a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told his parents he was gay in his 20s and, unlike  
Jack, was lovingly accepted. His homosexuality didn't become public 
until the past month, not because he was hiding it, he says, but 
because nobody asked him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, who cares?'' he said. ``I'm a storyteller and the  
minute people start reading about my personal life, I think that 
takes the power away from my storytelling. Whatever help I can 
bring to the gay evolution I think is best done through my 
storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson met with Smith early in the TV season to tell him  
what was going to happen but has since left the actor to portray 
Jack in his own way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that there are teen-agers who are going through  
exactly the same thing that Jack is going through,'' Smith said. 
``If we can shed some light on things or help some people, then 
that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Smith said, after watching the episode where Jack told  
his father he was gay, a teen-age boy posted a message on the 
Internet saying that he had immediately made the same announcement 
to his own dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson's already mapping out stories for a third season of  
``Dawson's Creek,'' although it's not certain that he'll be around 
to guide it. Contract talks haven't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also continuing to introduce characters that reflect his  
life. Pacey's girlfriend, Andie, is a manic overachiever who's not 
quite together emotionally, which Williamson said is a lot like 
he's been the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best stories are always the personal ones, the ones that  
come from inside of yourself, and that's what I try to remember 
when I sit down to write,'' he said. ``I just hope the audience 
responds to Jack and accepts him the way the characters do in the 
show.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Group Requiring Outside Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress debates new rules for HMOs, the  
private sector is taking another step of its own to guarantee one 
of the most popular proposals: the right to appeal denials to 
outside experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest HMO accrediting group released new  
standards today that, for the first time, require HMOs to live by 
whatever decisions are made by appeal panels outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both supporters and critics of managed care have come to support  
external appeals as a way to assure consumers they won't be 
unfairly denied treatment for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even business leaders who disdain federal mandates acknowledge  
that many consumer complaints could be resolved if they could be 
taken to independent experts who do not work for the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	And some opponents of HMO regulations have taken to supporting  
external review as a way of arguing against more burdensome federal 
regulations, such as new rights to sue HMOs in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Committee on Quality Assurance, which accredits  
about half of the nation's health maintenance organizations, plans 
to require these independent reviews beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The accreditation group was releasing proposed details today for  
public comment, part of a set of requirements HMOs must meet in 
order to win accreditation. Many large employers look for the 
accreditation in choosing an HMO for their workers. The committee 
will issue final rules by July and they will take effect in July 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new proposals for accreditation include requiring HMOs to  
consult the proper specialists in reviewing complaints during the 
internal appeal that precedes any external review. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also wants to require HMOs to allow patients to  
stay with their doctors during a course of treatment for up to 90 
days, even if the doctor is dropped from the health plan's network. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all HMOs allow patients to appeal decisions denying  
payment for care, but often the reviews are handled by people who 
work for the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, though, some large insurance companies,  
including Aetna-U.S. Healthcare, have said they will allow their 
customers to appeal to outside boards that will have final say over 
what is covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, the HMO trade group, the American Association  
of Health Plans, said it will urge its members to adopt external 
appeals. The group also said it could accept federal legislation 
requiring it. 
</P>
<P>
	The quality committee said it hopes to move the debate along.  
``It's obviously something that's in the wind,'' said Margaret E. 
O'Kane, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, O'Kane said, the group wants to assure that  
HMO appeal processes are done right. 
</P>
<P>
	``As usual, the devil is in the details,'' she said. ``We want  
to be sure that ... it's really an independent and credible 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO trade group said it is also concerned about the details,  
though it supports the idea in concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another important private-sector voice lending its  
support to the idea of outside review,'' said Susan Pisano, AAHP 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18 states already require health plans operating inside  
their borders to offer external appeals, but those requirements 
only apply to plans regulated by states. Many large employers use 
health plans that fall under federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Committee for Quality Assurance accredits about 310  
of the nation's 630 HMOs and point-of-service health plans, 
including the largest. Those 310 plans serve about three-quarters 
of all Americans in HMOs.

<HEADLINE> Boot Company CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Justin Industries' chairman and chief  
executive, John Justin, is stepping down from the top jobs at the 
company that makes Western boots and building supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin, 82, a former Fort Worth mayor and civic promoter, said  
Monday he will remain on the board of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin had told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram less than two weeks  
earlier that he wanted to remain at the helm of Justin Industries, 
which has suffered from sluggish financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not name a successor. Justin said he and the  
board of directors hope to name a replacement by April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin is the company's largest shareholder, controlling more  
than 20 percent of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But several of the eight board members said they had been  
discussing Justin's departure in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the long, booming stock market, shares in Justin have  
plunged over the last six years. After peaking at $25 a share in 
1993, the stock closed Monday at $10.9376, down 6 1/4 cents a share, 
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to boot brands Justin, Tony Lama and Nocona, the  
company owns Acme Brick Co., Featherlite Building Products, 
American Tile Supply and Trades Technologies.

<HEADLINE> Delaware Lawyer Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Angry, sinister, controlling and  
malignant -- a judge described Thomas Capano as all of that and then 
sentenced the former attorney and political adviser to die for 
killing his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee lashed out at Capano from  
the bench Tuesday before sentencing him to death by injection for 
murdering Anne Marie Fahey in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant fully expected to get away with murder and, were  
it not for his own arrogance and controlling nature, may well have 
succeeded,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added that it was Capano's own behavior -- his need  
``to show everyone that he was in charge'' -- that led to his 
downfall. He set a June 28 execution date, though years of appeals 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano sat silently as the sentence was read. When he was led  
from the courtroom back to Gander Hill Prison, he mouthed to family 
members, ``It will be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, was convicted Jan. 17 after a three-month trial that  
exposed lurid details about some of Delaware's most prominent 
figures. He now becomes the 18th person on death row in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of a wealthy and influential Wilmington family, Capano  
admitted to dumping Ms. Fahey's body in an ice chest off the New 
Jersey coast. 
</P>
<P>
	But he testified that another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, had  
accidentally shot Ms. Fahey in a jealous rage and said he got rid 
of the body to protect himself and Ms. MacIntyre. She denied the 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge noted that when Ms. MacIntyre told prosecutors that  
Capano asked her to buy him a gun before Ms. Fahey's disappearance, 
he attempted -- from prison -- to have her house burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a ruthless murderer who feels compassion for no one,''  
said Lee. ``He is a malignant force from whom no one he deems 
disloyal or adversarial can be secure, even if he is incarcerated 
for the rest of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in his trial sided with prosecutors who argued Capano  
killed Ms. Fahey, Gov. Thomas Carper's scheduling secretary, 
because she wanted to end their secret, three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed, saying it was a crime of control, not passion.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee said that Capano ``systematically and contemptuously  
degraded'' everyone involved in his trial -- including his own 
attorneys, whose advice he ignored when they advised him not to 
take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano also insulted prosecutors and glowered at witnesses, Lee  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is anything we could say that Judge Lee  
didn't say,'' said state prosecutor Ferris Wharton. ``In the end, 
he made the right decision and we're very grateful for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capano family made no comments after the sentence was read.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey's family -- which has filed a wrongful death suit  
against Capano -- did not take a position on whether he should be 
executed. But Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, said: ``The 
judge summed up in 12 minutes what we've been feeling for two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano attorney Joseph Oteri said he will appeal the sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Erin Reilly, a juror who attended Tuesday's hearing, agreed with  
the judge's order. ``He never showed remorse,'' she said of Capano. 
``That was the biggest thing. He never said he was sorry.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Freemen Leader Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- A federal judge slapped stiff prison  
sentences on the leaders of the Montana Freemen on Tuesday as ``a 
loud and clear message to those who pass this hatred and ugliness 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freemen leader LeRoy Schweitzer drew 22 1/2 years, which his lawyer  
said amounted to a life sentence for the 61-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top figures among the anti-government extremists were  
sentenced to as many as 15 years, but two women -- wives of Freemen 
-- received sentences equal to the time they already served while 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer and six other defendants refused to enter the  
courtroom, continuing to demonstrate their scorn for the 
government. They were able to watch the proceedings via TV from a 
holding cell after U.S. District Judge John Coughenour declined to 
have marshals bring them in by force. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Freemen were convicted in two trials last year. They and  
their followers were accused of trying to undermine the nation's 
banking system by issuing thousands of bogus checks totaling 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen members of the of the anti-government group,  
living on a farm on the plains of Montana, held FBI agents at bay 
for 81 days in 1995 before surrendering without a shot being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was convicted of charges including conspiracy, bank  
fraud, threatening a federal judge, illegal possession of firearms 
and participating in the armed robbery of an ABC crew covering the 
Freemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sentenced Daniel Petersen Jr., probably the No. 2 man  
in the Freeman hierarchy, to 15 years in prison and ordered him to 
pay restitution of $39,845. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney O. Skurdal, 46; and John P. McGuire, 61, were also  
sentenced to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale M. Jacobi, 57, a former Canadian police officer, received  
13 years, nine months; Richard Clark, 12 years; and William 
Stanton, three years, four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnes Stanton, William Stanton's wife, and Cherlyn Petersen,  
Daniel Petersen's wife, were released. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to maintaining they are not subject to federal or  
state laws, the Freemen also claimed that God intended white people 
to rule the earth, that blacks are animals and Jews are descendants 
of Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour referred to those beliefs by saying the sentences  
were intended to ``send a loud and clear message to those who pass 
this hatred and ugliness around, and who encourage others to 
participate in these illegal schemes. Be forwarned: Your personal 
liberty is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal court system, convicts must serve virtually the  
entire sentence with little or no time off for good behavior.

<HEADLINE> Dog Gets Day in Vermont Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH ROYALTON, Vt. (AP) -- Not every dog has its day in court.  
</P>
<P>
	Billy is an exception.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost two years ago, the German shepherd broke her collar and  
ran away from her home in the town of Wolcott. A month later, 
another family adopted the dog from an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Billy's original owners -- represented by the American Civil  
Liberties Union -- are fighting the shelter in Vermont's Supreme 
Court to get her back. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, on Tuesday, a day in which the state's highest court  
heard arguments in a multimillion-dollar utility rate case, the 
five justices also listened to impassioned debate over the fate of 
the 6-year-old dog. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices thought Billy's case was so interesting that they  
decided to hold the hearing at the Vermont Law School so students 
could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The court must decide whether Billy will stay in her new home or  
return to her original owners, Chasidy Lamare and Charles Arnold, 
who tried to reclaim her 34 days after she ran away. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower-court judge ruled against the couple, forcing their plea  
to the Supreme Court, Vermont's only appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lost your dog and you showed up to claim it and the  
persons who had it ... refused to give it back to you for no valid 
reason ... would you think that that was right or wrong? We think 
that was wrong,'' ACLU lawyer Clarke Atwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy's saga began on June 3, 1997, when she was given to the  
Wolcott dogcatcher after she was nearly hit by a car. The 
dogcatcher posted signs around town. Nine days later, he gave the 
dog to a shelter, the North Country Animal League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolcott town ordinance says the dogcatcher can keep the dog,  
give it away or destroy it after seven days in custody. A lawyer 
for the North Country Animal League says the shelter was abiding by 
the ordinance when it had the dog spayed and gave it away after 
keeping it for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the owners and we had found it a suitable home. We  
felt that that was the most important thing and in the best 
interest of the animal,'' shelter attorney Jeff Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwell, however, argued that the town did not do enough to  
advertise the lost dog or allow enough time to pass to dissolve 
ownership. He said the dog falls under the lost property statute, 
which requires finders to advertise more extensively and wait 90 
days before transferring ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog's new owners are not involved in the case and refuse to  
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems it would be a no-brainer for you to just send the dog  
back to the old house,'' Justice James Morse told Lively. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lively said officials at the North Country Animal League  
were suspicious of Ms. Lamare and Arnold when they showed up at the 
shelter a day before Billy was adopted. The couple had never 
contacted the dogcatcher or the humane society, gave the wrong age 
of the dog and had no photos of what they called their beloved pet. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Lamare and Arnold had the dog's American Kennel  
Club registration, they were told to fill out an application to 
adopt her. Two days later, they were told they were not suitable 
for the dog, Atwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices gave no indication of when they would rule. When  
they do, they might be able to cite one of their own cases as 
precedent. In 1997, after hearing from two owners who each claimed 
they owned the same dog, the justices ruled that dogs do not fall 
under the lost property statute.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Pro Chief Rooney To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Tim Rooney, the New York Giants'  
director of pro personnel since 1985, is retiring June 1, the NFL 
team announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an opportunity to stay, but I decided this is the right  
time to make this move,'' Rooney, 57, said in a statement. ``I've 
been involved in football since I started as a high school coach in 
1964 and now I am going to be able to do all the things that I 
haven't been able to do since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney was responsible for evaluating pro personnel, making  
recommendations on acquisitions and scouting upcoming opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to the Giants, Rooney held similar jobs with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers (1972-79) and Detroit Lions (1979-84). He was a 
part of five Super Bowl champions, the Steelers in 1974, '75 and 
'78, and the Giants in '86 and '90. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't overstate how valuable he has been to me,'' Giants  
coach Jim Fassel said. ``Tim is the kind of behind-the-scenes 
professional that a franchise needs to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney's uncle, Art, was the founder of the Steelers.

<P>
	Starr's office proposed to introduce ``perhaps 30 minutes'' of  
Mrs. Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony today at Mrs. 
McDougal's trial, said deputy prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing Jr. Mrs. 
McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, was expected to object. 
</P>
<P>
	In prosecution papers obtained by The Associated Press, Starr's  
office suggests Mrs. Clinton's testimony on Whitewater transactions 
at issue in the trial make it more critical than ever for Mrs. 
McDougal to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The videotape will show that the first lady testified that she  
had no knowledge or information about either'' a $27,600 loan made 
in Bill Clinton's name in 1982 or a $5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. 
McDougal in 1983 and used to pay off part of the Clinton loan, say 
the prosecutors' papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing said the videotape will establish the importance of  
questions posed to and answered by Mrs. Clinton and prepared for 
Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. to allow  
testimony from Mrs. Clinton, prosecutors want to correct what they 
say was the false impression left by defense questioning of FBI 
agent Michael Patkus last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing noted Monday that Patkus said he didn't think Mrs. Clinton  
had been asked about the loan from James and Susan McDougal's 
savings and loan made out to ``Bill Clinton'' and the check on a 
James McDougal account, payable to Madison Guaranty, and bearing 
the notation ``payoff Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the prosecution and defense couldn't simply stipulate  
that Mrs. Clinton had been asked about the transactions, Ewing said 
he would not comment. He also would not say Monday what Mrs. 
Clinton said in her deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton gave the testimony at the White House on April 25,  
and it was played several days later to the Whitewater grand jury 
here. The testimony had not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, is on trial on two counts of criminal  
contempt and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to 
answer grand jury questions Sept. 4, 1996, and April 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her ex-husband, the late James McDougal, were business  
partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater land development 
venture in Arkansas from 1979 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal claims she has no information pertinent to the  
case. She says she refused to answer questions because she believed 
Starr would twist her words and use them to suit his own agenda or 
would charge her with perjury if he did not like what she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also alleges that Starr's deputies have used false  
information from her ex-husband and David Hale, a former judge and 
businessman, to pursue their investigation of her and the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals owned the savings and loan, and Clinton testified  
at a 1996 trial of the McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker that 
he did not receive a loan from Madison. Prosecutors allege the 
money was used to pay off a $30,000 Whitewater debt from 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's trial began March 8 and is expected to continue  
into early April.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Videotape To Be Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's trial  
ruled today that prosecutors can show 40 minutes of Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's previously secret videotaped grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the objections of Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, U.S. District  
Judge George Howard Jr. agreed with Kenneth Starr's prosecutors 
that McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos had opened the door to showing 
Mrs. Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos suggested Thursday in questioning FBI agent Mike Patkus  
that prosecutors had never bothered to ask questions of the first 
lady that the investigators now want Mrs. McDougal to answer about 
a disputed two-decade-old loan in the name of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett stressed that Mrs. Clinton's testimony  
is not being shown to prove the truth of what the first lady said, 
but simply to show that the prosecutors did ask her questions about 
a $27,600 loan in her husband's name and how the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton testified in a deposition in Washington on April  
25, 1998, two days after Mrs. McDougal appeared before the 
Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock and refused to answer 
questions. Mrs. Clinton's videotaped testimony was shown to the 
grand jury in Little Rock on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony has been secret for nearly a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers said two parts of Mrs. Clinton's  
testimony would be shown -- a section of about 35 minutes and 
another of about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's legal team was reviewing the videotape this  
morning before it was to be played in court later today.

<HEADLINE> Renault Offers To Buy Nissan Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French automaker Renault moved to bolster its  
global reach with an offer Tuesday to buy a controlling 35 percent 
stake in Japan's debt-ridden Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, synonymous here with mass-market cars, and Nissan,  
known for its trucks, Z-cars and Infinity luxury sedans, might make 
an unlikely team, but both companies suggested the benefits of a 
link up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said it hoped the deal could be concluded by the end of  
March, the close of Japan's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed, but the market value of such a stake  
would be around $3.4 billion and it would not be unusal for a bid 
to include a premium. A Nissan executive in New York, speaking 
Monday on condition of anonymity, said Renault is expected to 
invest more than $4 billion in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks seventh in the world in production of cars and  
truck, and Renault is 11th, according to Ward's Automotive 
International, an industry newsletter. If the two were completely 
combined -- which has not been proposed -- the business would rank 
fourth in terms of production and fifth in terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance would give Renault a premier distribution system in  
Asia as well as access to Nissan's superior technology in engines, 
suspension, batteries and fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's No. 2 automaker would, in turn, get a desperately needed  
cash infusion, better European distribution and management talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renault is now convinced of the merits of a strategic alliance  
between Renault and Nissan,'' a brief statement from the French 
automaker said following unanimous approval of such a deal by its 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	A main condition of the alliance would be Renault's acquisition  
of an equity stake of Nissan of ``approximately 35 percent,'' the 
statement said. If it acquires more than 33.4 percent of Nissan, 
Renault would have veto power over Nissan's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan President and Chief Executive Officer Yoshikazu Hanawa  
said such an alliance would enable the two companies to 
``complement each other and create synergies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore ... we have decided to negotiate exclusively with  
the French motor company,'' working out conditions in the days 
ahead and an agreement by March 31, a statement by Hanawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nissan board is to meet Friday. Renault's plans would still  
have to be approved by a Renault Employee Council. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how much of Nissan's debt Renault has offered to  
take on. Analysts say Renault will have to consolidate at least a 
quarter of Nissan's $20.96 billion in interest-bearing debt to seal 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Renault would appoint a chief operating officer  
to Nissan who would handle the Japanese automaker's day-to-day 
operations and have a seat on Nissan's board, Japan's leading 
financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault is expected to name two additional members to Nissan's  
board. It was unclear whether Nissan would increase its board size, 
or replace existing directors with Renault's picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's Hanawa and Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman,  
hammered out the agreement over the weekend in Paris, just after 
the collapse last week of Nissan's negotiations with 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has struggled to turn around sagging market share with  
family sedans like the Altima and minivans like the Quest. The 
company's North American operations lost $700 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault dabbled in the U.S. market in the 1950s and 1960s, and  
owned American Motor Corp. and the famous Jeep brand before the 
former Chrysler Corp. bought it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault wiped its balance sheet clean of debt in 1998 and built  
up a cash cushion estimated at $8.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Harbaugh Ready for Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- If Jim Harbaugh has any of that ``Captain  
Comeback'' magic left, the San Diego Chargers are eager to tap it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings something that we didn't have, both experience and  
winning in the NFL,'' star linebacker Junior Seau said when he 
heard that the Chargers, 5-11 last year, had agreed to terms of a 
trade with Baltimore that will bring them Harbaugh. ``It's a step 
in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way was cleared Tuesday when the Ravens got Scott Mitchell  
from the Detroit Lions for two draft picks. All that's left for the 
Harbaugh deal to go through is for his contract to be redone to fit 
under the Chargers' salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure it's already banged out,'' Harbaugh said  
Tuesday evening. ``All I've been thinking about is having a 
lightning bolt on the side of my helmet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said Tuesday that it should be just a matter of days  
for the contract to be reworked. Harbaugh's agent, Steve Forest, 
said things were ``pretty imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh is under contract for $3.25 million for 1999, but his  
deal must be reworked so it can fit under San Diego's salary cap. A 
source familiar with the negotiations said Harbaugh would be given 
a two-year contract worth approximately $2.75 million, which 
includes a minimal signing bonus, plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have agreed to send the Ravens a conditional  
fifth-round pick in next year's draft for Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Ravens hired Brian Billick as coach, they gave  
Harbaugh permission to talk other teams. He called new Chargers 
offensive coordinator Geep Chryst, who was on Chicago's staff when 
Harbaugh was with the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got real excited about talking to him and knew I wanted  
to go out there,'' Harbaugh said. ``I was pretty much blown away by 
the situation out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and Chryst went out on the practice field and started  
going through drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a great time,'' Harbaugh said. ``It just seemed like a  
good team to be around. It sounds like fun to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers hope that adding Harbaugh will liven up one of the  
NFL's least productive offenses. Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan 
combined to throw 34 interceptions and just 10 touchdown passes 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Riley said he already envisions Harbaugh as the  
starter for the season opener, with Leaf remaining on the bench to 
watch and learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need any guarantees,'' said Harbaugh, who struggled  
last year with finger and elbow injuries. ``My goal in coming to 
San Diego is to contribute to the team winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh is known for his toughness.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice we have a guy that has the tenacity that Jim  
Harbaugh has,'' Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's expected to complement the defense, which ranked No. 1  
last year overall and against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh found out how tough the Chargers defense was last year,  
when the Ravens got just eight first downs and 161 total yards in a 
14-13 loss at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think certainly in San Diego, all the elements are there,''  
Harbaugh said. ``I mean, they always have been a good defense, but 
last year, basically we were trying to figure out how to get a yard 
against them. It was a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh was nicknamed ``Captain Comeback'' during the  
Indianapolis Colts' surprising playoff run following the 1995 
season, which began with a 35-20 wild-card victory in San Diego. 
The Chargers haven't been back to the playoffs since.

<HEADLINE> Women's Groups Lobby Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Quality, affordable child care. Fair pay.  
Social Security reform. Insurance coverage for contraception. An 
end to violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
	These issues, and more, drew hundreds of women from 35 states to  
the first Women's Equality Summit, which ended Tuesday with a 
lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to say to the members of Congress is, either you  
listen or you are not going to be here again,'' Gloria Steinem, the 
founder of Ms. Magazine, said at a news conference in the breezy 
outdoors steps away from the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today to persuade them to do the right thing,''  
added Steinem, also the president of Voters for Choice. ``It is 
long, long, long overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and  
Education Fund, said women, more and more, are being called upon to 
make critical decisions in the running of their households as well 
as in the voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds of women with children under age 6 work  
outside the home, which makes access to quality and affordable 
child care a must, Rodgers added. 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers advocated a national system of child care.  
</P>
<P>
	``We must fight for and win a national child care program,''  
said feminist pioneer Betty Friedan. ``That must be our priority as 
we head into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said President Clinton could issue an executive order to get  
such a program started. 
</P>
<P>
	A speech by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was the highlight  
of Monday's session, which focused on the effects of Social 
Security reform on women. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit was hosted by the National Council of Women's  
Organizations, which claims to represent more than 5 million women 
through more than 120 groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said that while these issues hurt women more, they  
ultimately affect everyone and should really be seen as ``human 
issues.'' And she dismissed suggestions that advocating them will 
lead to the ``feminization of politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm not against that,'' said Mrs. Clinton -- who is  
thinking about running next year for a Senate seat in New York -- as 
the mostly female audience laughed. ``Don't get me wrong. But I 
think it is fairer to say that we are attempting to bring about the 
humanization of politics.''

<HEADLINE> 'Dawson' Gay Story Taken in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was something striking about the public's  
reaction when a character in ``Dawson's Creek'' came out as gay at 
the same time the show's creative leader revealed his homosexuality 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking, because the reaction was virtual silence.  
</P>
<P>
	No loud protests from outraged church or conservative groups. No  
``Yep, I'm Gay!'' magazine cover. No celebrities treating it as a 
crusade. No ponderous essays about what it means to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	No one could have missed it when Ellen DeGeneres and her  
character on ``Ellen'' came out two years ago. So it may be her 
most lasting legacy that on ``Dawson's Creek,'' a provocative gay 
story line in a popular teen-age drama series is causing barely a 
ripple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dawson's Creek,'' on the relatively little-watched WB network,  
may fly below the radar screen of many of society's guardians. But 
although DeGeneres had a higher profile, what has been happening on 
``Dawson's Creek'' over the past month has far greater meaning for 
what social critics would call impressionable youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good sign, and I'm thrilled about the lack of  
controversy,'' said Kevin Williamson, the show's creator. ``I was 
kind of expecting this. I was hoping, at least, that the climate 
was better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson considers ``Dawson's Creek'' autobiographical, with  
each character emphasizing some aspect of his personality. Dawson 
is the Spielberg geek who sees life as a film. Joey has 
Williamson's sarcastic side. Pacey is the jokester and Jen is the 
rebel. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Jack, a new character portrayed by actor Kerr Smith,  
stands for Williamson's sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the moment we brought him on, we knew he was going to  
eventually come out of the closet,'' he said. ``I wasn't always 
sure what would be the best, most powerful way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first inkling came when Jack read a poem in his high school  
class that hinted at an attraction to men. He quickly became a 
target for harassment when someone spray-painted an antigay epithet 
on his locker. Jack wrestled with his feelings, finally declaring 
his homosexuality to his outraged father. 
</P>
<P>
	The story finds its texture in the reactions of those around  
him. Jen's religious boyfriend objects to Jack and is lectured by 
her previously one-dimensional grandmother on the nature of caring. 
The response of Joey to her boyfriend declaring he's gay is largely 
unexplored territory for television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parents Television Council, a conservative media watchdog  
group, didn't alert its members to the story. Many people concerned 
about sexual content on television aren't even aware of what's been 
happening on ``Dawson's Creek,'' said Mark Honig, its executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring up the fact that there are homosexuals in society is  
not something to rant and rave about at this point,'' he said. 
NBC's sitcom ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' about a homosexual man and his best 
friend, a heterosexual woman, met with the same nonreaction when it 
debuted last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Honig's group may feel differently if Jack starts dating men, he  
said. ``With all the other problems on `Dawson's Creek,' this is 
just one to throw into the batch,'' Honig said. He mentioned 
Pacey's affair with a teacher and the show's frequent sexually 
charged dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jack confronted his sexuality was the idea of one of the  
show's writers, who knew someone who came out through a poetry 
reading in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somebody's story, but not mine,'' Williamson said. ``I  
had a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told his parents he was gay in his 20s and, unlike  
Jack, was lovingly accepted. His homosexuality didn't become public 
until the past month, not because he was hiding it, he says, but 
because nobody asked him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, who cares?'' he said. ``I'm a storyteller and the  
minute people start reading about my personal life, I think that 
takes the power away from my storytelling. Whatever help I can 
bring to the gay evolution I think is best done through my 
storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson met with Smith early in the TV season to tell him  
what was going to happen but has since left the actor to portray 
Jack in his own way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that there are teen-agers who are going through  
exactly the same thing that Jack is going through,'' Smith said. 
``If we can shed some light on things or help some people, then 
that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Smith said, after watching the episode where Jack told  
his father he was gay, a teen-age boy posted a message on the 
Internet saying that he had immediately made the same announcement 
to his own dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson's already mapping out stories for a third season of  
``Dawson's Creek,'' although it's not certain that he'll be around 
to guide it. Contract talks haven't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also continuing to introduce characters that reflect his  
life. Pacey's girlfriend, Andie, is a manic overachiever who's not 
quite together emotionally, which Williamson said is a lot like 
he's been the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best stories are always the personal ones, the ones that  
come from inside of yourself, and that's what I try to remember 
when I sit down to write,'' he said. ``I just hope the audience 
responds to Jack and accepts him the way the characters do in the 
show.''

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Insomnia in Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Older people with insomnia got more long-term  
sleep improvement from eight weeks of psychotherapy than they did 
from eight weeks of sleeping pills or from a combination of the 
two, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychotherapy -- called cognitive behavioral therapy --  
involves changing people's habits, such as spending too much time 
in bed, as well as their erroneous beliefs, such as the notion that 
everyone needs eight hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``With eight treatment sessions, most of the time, I think we  
can help people,'' saod Charles M. Morin, a clinical psychologist 
at Laval University in Quebec. His study was published in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 78 adults whose average age was 65 and  
whose chronic insomnia was not caused by any underlying physical 
problem. Morin said similar research in younger adults has had the 
same outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were divided into four groups: one received 90  
minutes a week of group therapy; another received eight weeks of 
treatment with a prescription sleeping pill; a third got an 
eight-week combination of therapy and sleeping pills; the fourth 
received a dummy pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the combination treatment appeared to work best,  
reducing nighttime awakenings -- the typical problem in older people 
-- by 65 percent, compared with a 55 percent reduction in the 
psychotherapy group and a 47 percent reduction in the 
sleeping-pill-only group. 
</P>
<P>
	But after two years, ``only behavioral treatment provided  
durable changes,'' the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who got medication alone fell back to their initial levels  
of sleeplessness. And to the researchers' surprise, those in the 
combination group had mixed experiences, with some worse than they 
were at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	Morin was unsure why, but said sleeping pills -- even if combined  
with psychotherapy -- may make people vulnerable to relapse by 
leaving them feeling at a loss when not taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most sleeping pills are designed to be used on a short-term  
basis,'' Morin said. ``Here, we pushed the limit a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An expert who did not take part in the study said Morin's  
findings confirm other research. But he said the type of 
psychotherapy that helps is not yet widely practiced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there that market themselves as  
counselors, but not that many clinicians know how to offer 
cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia,'' said Dr. Jed Black, 
director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic in Palo Alto, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE> Milk Price Drop Jolts Dairy Farms / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Dairy farmer Martin Marburger has no choice  
but to lose money with the severe plunge in dairy prices this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep all the cows, we'll lose money,'' said the  
80-year-old head of Marburger Farm Dairy Inc. north of Pittsburgh. 
``If you take 30 percent off your income and your costs stay the 
same, you can't possibly meet your bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who enjoyed all-time high milk prices when supply lagged  
behind demand last year are experiencing the downside now in 
Pennsylvania, the nation's fourth-largest milk producing state 
behind California, Wisconsin and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The federally calculated base price of milk dropped by 37  
percent in March, the sharpest decline from one month to another in 
the industry's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most dramatic price swing ever experienced,'' said  
Joel Rotz, dairy specialist with the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are receiving $10.27 per hundred pounds of milk -- the  
same level as in the early 1980s -- down from last month's base 
price of $16.27. 
</P>
<P>
	``That price pays the farmer for his labor and his whole  
operation,'' said Marburger, whose ancestors established his farm 
in 1842 in Evans City, Butler County. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm -- one of 10,200 in Pennsylvania -- started producing  
milk in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some 150 cows, and we buy milk from 60 other farms. I  
don't know what we'll do, except lose money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers do have a cushion waiting for them. Congress included  
$200 million for dairy producers in last year's emergency farm aid 
package. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is still deciding how 
to distribute the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The stress caused by last year's severe drought in California  
and Texas last year caused cows to either stop producing milk or to 
produce less. With supplies down, milk prices jumped to $17.34 per 
hundred pounds by December. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the oversupply of milk has reduced prices.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dunn, a Pennsylvania State University professor of  
agricultural economics, said economists and farmers knew supply 
would catch up with demand as states recovered from the drought, 
but no one expected such an abrupt price decrease. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kopp -- who cares for 140 cows with his brother, Jay, at a  
farm near Harrisburg -- said the plunge means he's back to breaking 
even or losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotz said Pennsylvania's dairy industry is lobbying the state  
Legislature to let the state join the Northeast Interstate Dairy 
Compact, which is designed to protect farmers from fluctuating milk 
prices. Membership in the compact must be approved by the 
Legislature and Congress, Rotz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are in trouble for the short term,'' he said. ``Even  
if the compact passes, we still need approval from Congress, which 
is not expected until late summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn said farmers need not panic by laying off workers and  
selling cows. Economists predict the price will stabilize at about 
$12 per hundred pounds which, combined with low feed corn costs, 
will let farmers stay afloat and make money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing is just how fast it fell,'' Dunn said. ``It  
doesn't look like 1999 will be a bad year for dairy.''

<HEADLINE> NIreland Politicians Arrive In D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Divided by their politics but united in  
horror, many of Northern Ireland's leaders paid silent tribute 
Tuesday to a prominent lawyer slain by anti-Catholic terrorists 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing -- the most high-profile assassination in Northern  
Ireland in more than a year -- came as virtually all of the 
province's key politicians, and scores of backroom figures and 
Belfast lobbyists, converged on Washington for St. Patrick's Day 
meetings with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping that U.S. intervention can help keep last year's Good  
Friday peace accord from falling apart, politicians from all shades 
of opinion warned that lawyer Rosemary Nelson's killers were really 
trying to sabotage their own compromise-building effort in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who killed Rosemary Nelson did so because they thought  
it would destroy the Good Friday agreement,'' said British Northern 
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, who called the lawyer killed Monday 
``a brave woman who stood up for what she believed in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an awards ceremony in her honor Tuesday, Mowlam led the  
minute's silence to Nelson, then told the gathering they stood 
``within a hair's breadth'' of forming a joint Protestant-Catholic 
government for Northern Ireland, the long-elusive vision of the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But speaking beside her, the two Protestant and Catholic  
politicians charged with leading that government -- Ulster Unionist 
Party leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labor Party 
deputy leader Seamus Mallon -- offered conflicting messages on the 
way to solve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble insisted that Protestants wouldn't accept a place in  
government for the Irish Republican Army's affiliated party, Sinn 
Fein, unless the IRA starts disarming first, something the outlawed 
group refuses to do. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone tries to force Sinn Fein into the government  
``prematurely,'' Trimble said, ``it won't last the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mallon, whose moderate party competes with Sinn Fein for  
Catholic votes, suggested that the IRA should simply promise to 
start disarming at a specific date following the government's 
formation, since any weapons handover this month was ``extremely 
unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the government could be formed and made to work, Mallon  
predicted, other contentious issues such as paramilitary 
disarmament would be exposed as ``important of themselves, but not 
important enough to prevent the operation of the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown between Trimble and Sinn Fein over IRA weaponry --  
with Mallon, Mowlam and Clinton each seeking somehow to narrow the 
ground between them -- faces a potential make-or-break deadline of 
April 2, this year's Good Friday, after which all sides predict the 
political climate would only worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, leading his party's unprecedented  
12-politician blitz of 35 American cities with a message blaming 
Trimble for the crisis, was due to arrive in Washington by way of 
Savannah, Ga., later Tuesday for a dinner and awards ceremony 
honoring Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams and Trimble were scheduled to have separate meetings with  
Clinton on Wednesday, and possibly meet together themselves after a 
White House awards ceremony honoring former Maine Sen. George 
Mitchell, chairman of the Belfast peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mowlam noted that both Adams and Trimble ``have a justification  
for their positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein was legally right, she said, to argue that the accord  
doesn't make an IRA weapons handover as an explicit condition for 
Sinn Fein's eligibility for office. It only calls for Sinn Fein to 
``use whatever influence it may have'' to achieve the IRA's 
complete disarmament by May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But she noted that Protestant hatred of the IRA had already  
split Trimble's party dangerously down the middle, making ``a 
gesture'' from the IRA a minimum political necessity for Protestant 
participation in the government. A start to IRA disarmament wasn't 
``a precondition'' in the accord, Mowlam said, ``but it is an 
obligation.''

<HEADLINE> Railroad Crossings Pose Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crash investigators know well the Illinois  
railroad crossing where an Amtrak train collided Monday with a 
truck hauling steel, igniting a deadly fireball. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1964, three people have been killed and four injured in  
seven accidents at the McKnight Road crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., 
according to state and federal records. In each case, a train 
struck an automobile or a truck as it crossed the tracks, despite 
the crossing gates and warning lights that the site has gained over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's impatience or inattention, Americans in general are  
not good about stopping, looking and listening at railroad 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had the deadliest record of any state between 1991 and  
1998, with 380 deaths at railroad grade crossings, according to the 
Federal Railroad Administration. Illinois was second, with 288 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 514 other people were killed nationally as they  
walked along railbeds or otherwise trespassed on railroad lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't think this stuff happens anymore, but  
unfortunately it does,'' said Marmie Edwards, spokeswoman for 
Operation Lifesaver, a government-sponsored group that works to end 
rail deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that the fines for running a train signal are still  
low in much of the country. They range from $10 to $100 in Oklahoma 
to up to $500 in Illinois. Some states have no fine at all for 
trespassing on train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 245 Amtrak trains were involved in accidents reportable  
to the Federal Railroad Administration, according to Amtrak. They 
caused 1,020 crew injuries and 266 passenger injuries, most of 
which were minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the reportable accidents, 183, or 74 percent, were  
attributable to motor vehicle operator inattention or impatience. 
Of those accidents, 114 occurred at crossings with active warning 
devices, such as gates, flashing lights and bells. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, 50 people died in collisions with Amtrak trains  
at highway-rail intersections. Amtrak trains struck and killed 69 
other people who were deemed to be trespassing on Amtrak rail line. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's fatal crash, 88 passengers had died in Amtrak's  
27-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its heft, an eight-car passenger train traveling at  
79 mph -- a standard Amtrak speed -- takes over 6,000 feet to stop. 
The train involved in Monday night's collision was 16 cars in 
length, or twice as big, and was authorized to travel at 79 mph in 
Bourbonnais, according to Amtrak officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A 150-car freight train traveling at a routine 50 mph needs  
8,000 feet to stop, or about 1.5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Amtrak unveiled its new high-speed service that will  
start serving the Northeast Corridor by November or December. 
Equipped with technology that allows them to tilt through turns, 
the new Acela trains will operate between Washington, New York and 
Boston at top speeds of 150 mph, trimming travel times to 2 1/2 to 
three hours per leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The route that will be used has no grade crossings south of New  
Haven, Conn., according to Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington. There 
will be one crossing in Massachusetts, one in Rhode Island that 
will be used only by emergency vehicles and 11 in eastern 
Connecticut that Amtrak is working to make safe for high-speed 
trains, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the gala unveiling, Amtrak officials stressed the safety of  
the trains, saying they exceeded the standards of high-speed trains 
in use in Europe. Regular Amtrak riders agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to be in an accident, I'd probably rather be in a  
train rather than any other vehicle. If you hit a car or a truck, 
the train usually comes out OK,'' said Steve Grande of Fullerton, 
Calif., a train reviewer who has ridden more than 126,000 miles 
with Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I was once in a train that hit a car, and I didn't  
even know we had hit anything until after we stopped.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Top 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average broke through  
10,000 today, a feat made possible by nearly a decade of steady 
economic expansion and an ever-growing enthusiasm for technology, 
especially the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials cleared milestone at 9:50.50 a.m. EST, then  
gave a little ground and headed lower. It was down 18.59 at 
9,940.18 within minutes of breaking 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders cheered and raised their arms in celebration on the  
floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the milestone was passed. 
Some held up both hands with their fingers spread to signify 10 as 
in 10,000. After the roar, the revelry lasted only about 30 seconds 
before traders and clerks returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The average of 30 blue-chip stocks took almost a year to gain  
the final 1,000 points in its charge, after passing 9,000 on April 
6, 1998. The 1990s bull market was all but written off last summer 
and early autumn as it plummeted after Russia's economic crisis, 
only to rebound on a series of three interest rate cuts by the 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow got a lift today from an upbeat earnings forecast from  
Union Carbide, one of the Dow's components. Wall Street's 
best-known indicator also has been pumped up by its own momentum, 
including a spurt of more than 700 points in the past two weeks. By 
reaching five digits, the Dow is now up nearly 9 percent this year 
on top of an unprecedented four straight years of double-digit 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The march toward 10,000 actually began in the early in 1990s  
when the U.S. economy began a remarkable upward line of growth 
combined with low inflation and interest rates that kept consumers 
spending and corporate profits rising. The rise of personal 
computers and technology improved Corporate America's productivity 
even as manufacturing jobs continued a steady shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got an additional boost in the past year through the  
explosion of enthusiasm for moneymaking on the Internet as hundreds 
of companies to put a ``dot.com'' after their names, expecting a 
big payoff by selling everything from Furby dolls to stocks on the 
World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was turbo-charged by a recent perception that the  
troubled economies of Asia and Brazil may be bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenal market,'' said Ralph Acampora, director  
of technical research, Prudential Securities. ``It's not the level 
of 10,000; it's the quality of stocks ... GE and Merck and American 
Express. If we're investing in blue-chip America, it can't be bad. 
You should be singing `God Bless America.' ''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Executes Man for 1982 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMMS, Ill. (AP) -- A man accused of taking part in the  
kidnappings, rapes and mutilation murders of 18 women was executed 
by injection early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kokoraleis, 35, sighed three times, licked his lips and  
appeared to be speaking quietly to himself before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death for one of the killings -- the 1982  
murder of Lorraine Ann Borowski, 21, who was abducted on her way to 
work at a real estate office. Her mutilated body was found in a 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys unsuccessfully argued that Kokoraleis was  
coerced into confessing. They also argued that new information cast 
doubt on the credibility of confessions by two co-defendants who 
accused Kokoraleis. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution comes against a backdrop of renewed debate over  
the death penalty in Illinois, prompted largely by the exoneration 
of two condemned inmates last month alone. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the discussion was muted by the horrifying details  
of what authorities say was his role in a cult blamed for the 
killings of as many as 18 Chicago-area women in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokoraleis, who had been sentenced to life in prison for another  
murder, was the first prisoner executed at a new 
super-maximum-security prison in southern Illinois.

<HEADLINE>  Frontrunner Nearing Iditarod Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley's runaway victory in the 1999  
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race moved closer to reality Tuesday, but 
behind him a challenge was heating up for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., mushed his 12-dog team into the  
White Mountain checkpoint at 7:46 a.m. Alaska time (11:46 a.m. 
EST). White Mountain, a few miles inland from the Bering Sea, is 77 
miles from the finish line in the historic Gold Rush town of Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	Iditarod rules require an eight-hour rest stop in White  
Mountain, so Swingley won't be back on the trail until late Tuesday 
afternoon. Travel time to Nome is expected to take at least 10 
hours, putting the soon-to-be winner into town in the wee hours 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley will be rewarded for his effort with $54,000 in prize  
money and a new pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	More than six hours back was three-time Iditarod champion Martin  
Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, and not far behind him and closing was 
Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, who has won the 1,100-mile race 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser left the Koyuk checkpoint at 2:15 a.m. with nine dogs, and  
Swenson pulled out at 5:17 a.m. with 11 dogs. Koyuk is 170 miles 
from Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to catch Martin,'' Swenson said. ``I don't know if  
that's reasonable, but he seems to be going quite a bit slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Buser was as much as eight hours up on Swenson, and  
on Tuesday he was apparently feeling the pressure. He dashed 
through Elim, 48 miles up the trail from Koyuk, at about 8:30 a.m. 
with no rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The normally buoyant Buser was forced to drop six of his 16 dogs  
early in the race, among them his best leader. Doing that so soon 
demoralized him and his finely tuned team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I dropped the dogs, I was down in the dumps,'' he said  
in Unalakleet. ``I tried not to let the (remaining) dogs catch 
that, but it's hard when you're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours behind Swenson were Vern Halter of Willow, Alaska,  
and Charlie Boulding of Manley, Alaska. Four more Alaskans were a 
couple of hours further back -- John Baker of Kotzebue, Paul 
Gebhardt of Kasilof, Jeff King of Denali Park and Ed Iten of 
Kotzebue. 
</P>
<P>
	King, the defending Iditarod champion, has long since given up  
any aspirations to keep up with Buser or Swenson. His team of eight 
dogs was fourth into Unalakleet, less than two hours behind 
Swenson, but in need of a much longer rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the risk of sounding smug, I really don't care if I'm fifth  
or 15th,'' King, a three-time race winner, told KNOM radio. ``I'd 
be doing this differently if I was in a position ... to be one of 
the potential winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were more financially motivated to move up in the final  
standings. Fifth place pays about $31,000, while 15th about 
$11,000. The Iditarod is the world's richest sled-dog race, with a 
total purse of $450,000. Prize money is paid to the first 20 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six teams were out of Shaktoolik, about 60 miles before Koyuk.  
Among them was Linwood Fiedler of Willow, Alaska, who was resigned 
to the fact that his team of nine dogs was losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody in this group that I'm going to catch,''  
Fiedler said after arriving 12th in Unalakleet amidst a large clump 
of mushers. He was 14th out of Shaktoolik. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine of the 56 mushers who started March 6 in Anchorage  
remained on the trail. Bringing up the rear were a trio of race 
rookies still heading north on the frozen Yukon River -- Dario 
Daniels of Bird Creek, Alaska, and Judy Currier and Shane Goosen, 
both of Wasilla, Alaska.

Among them was Linwood Fiedler of Willow, Alaska, who was resigned 
to the fact that his team of nine dogs was losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody in this group that I'm going to catch,''  
Fiedler said after arriving 12th in Unalakleet amidst a large clump 
of mushers. He was 14th out of Shaktoolik.

	Forty-nine of the 56 mushers who started March 6 in Anchorage  
remained on the trail. Bringing up the rear were a trio of race 
rookies still heading north on the frozen Yukon River -- Dario 
Daniels of Bird Creek, Alaska, and Judy Currier and Shane Goosen, 
both of Wasilla, Alaska.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blaming Shutdown on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican fund-raising letter highlights a  
controversy many in the party would rather forget -- the twin 
government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee, seeking to raise $5 million  
for an ad campaign supporting the GOP's budget proposal this year, 
sent out fund-raising letters blaming the shutdowns in 1995 and 
1996 on President Clinton and suggesting another shutdown this year 
might be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not let the Clinton-Gore shutdown strategy paralyze  
reform for another two years,'' says the GOP fund-raising letter, 
signed by RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter's assignment of blame to Clinton comes in the face of  
polls and election results showing that Americans blamed the 
Republicans for the budget stalemate, easily re-electing Clinton in 
November 1996 and shrinking the GOP's House majorities in 1996 and 
1998. Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich, who was House speaker at 
the time, called the Republican actions ``throwing an interception 
straight into the other team's defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some federal agencies and national parks closed after Clinton  
vetoed the spending bills that would have kept them open because he 
objected to provisions in the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gingrich had come on the scene promising very radical changes  
in the political system,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the 
Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ``This looked like it 
was in that mode. It clearly backfired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said the GOP has been unfairly  
blamed for the government shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party certainly takes issue with the fact that the  
president seems to be disavowing any responsibility for that 
shutdown when it was his veto power that led to the government 
shutdown in the first place,'' Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to point that out and we want to make sure the  
president doesn't get away with any of his budgetary smoke and 
mirrors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incoming Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew  
called the Republican fund-raising letter ``revisionist history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blaming President Clinton for the government shutdown is like  
blaming President Roosevelt for Pearl Harbor,'' Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	But with both sides poised to revisit the thorny budget disputes  
this year, Republicans may have an advantage in getting their side 
of the story out early, GOP consultant Eddie Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's best we set out and make sure we don't get beat up on it  
again,'' Mahe said. ``It's what we call inoculation.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Vow To Add Border Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Senate Republicans pledged Tuesday to  
overrule the Clinton administration and add 1,000 new Border Patrol 
agents next year. They accused the White House of raiding 
immigration enforcement accounts to fund other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication is that we will put them back in'' the  
budget, said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has been a 
sharp critic of the Clinton administration's decision not to seek 
the 1,000 agents, as Congress ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., questioned whether the $600 million  
sought by the administration to expand its politically popular 
cops-on-the-streets program was coming at the expense of the Border 
Patrol -- a contention the White House denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the question of the administration: 'What is the  
responsibility of the federal government?''' said Gregg, who chairs 
the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Justice Department 
and its agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it to defend the borders or is it to put a police officer  
on the street in Epping, N.H.? I happen to think it's to defend the 
borders. If the town of Epping wants a new police officer, that's 
great. But that's the town of Epping's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his subcommittee's hearing on INS' 2000 budget, Gregg  
accused the administration, which has long trumpeted the 100,000 
police officers put on the streets, of ``a press conference 
approach to law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg's stance was endorsed by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be putting that money against that which is a  
purely federal obligation rather than against what the states and 
local governments already have the responsibility of doing,'' Kyl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House and Justice Department officials denied any linkage  
between the 100,000 police program and Border Patrol funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg is ``flat-out wrong,'' said White House spokesman Barry  
Toiv. ``We found reductions elsewhere in the budget to finance the 
president's initiative to put additional police on the streets of 
our communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv defended the administration's performance on immigration.  
``Believe me, this administration has been the first administration 
to take this issue seriously,'' he said. ``And we will gladly stand 
on our record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have been up in arms at the  
administration's decision not to seek 1,000 Border Patrol agents 
next year as directed by the 1996 immigration law. At a hearing of 
Gregg's subcommittee Tuesday, they questioned INS Commissioner 
Doris Meissner repeatedly about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Meissner and Attorney General Janet Reno have said  
their concerns over tremendous growth in the Border Patrol led to 
the decision not to seek new agents next year. Nearly 40 percent of 
all agents in the nearly 9,000-person force, which has doubled 
since 1993, have less than two years on the job. Meissner didn't 
reiterate that position Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are able to deal with this level of growth,'' she said.  
``We have been able to attract very high-quality personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, she acknowledged that the INS and the Justice  
Department had requested money for the 1,000 agents in their fiscal 
2000 budget submissions, but were overruled within the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration did make the decision in this budget round  
to take a breather for a year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment drew a sharp retort from Kyl. ``Nobody else at the  
border is taking a breather,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler on Wednesday will formally  
unveil a compact car powered by fuel cells that seats five people, 
goes 280 miles before refueling and travels as fast as 90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Called NECAR 4, the concept car is the latest demonstration of  
fuel cell-powered vehicles that automakers plan to bring to market 
by 2004. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity to 
power a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car sold in Europe,  
the NECAR4 accelerates easily from 0 to 30 mph, can go as fast as 
90 mph and travels 280 miles without refueling, Chrysler said. It 
also is a zero emissions vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fuel cell cars have zero or near zero emissions, depending  
on their fuel source. That makes fuel cells a favorite among 
automakers trying to comply with California's standard of zero 
emissions by 2003 for 10 percent of the cars sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gas-powered cars is not imminent. NECAR 4 is  
powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass marketing 
since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. It also is 
1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent gas-powered car. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be replaced  
with NECAR X, which would run on methanol. Methanol contains 
hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power fuel 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide use of methanol-powered fuel cells would require a  
network of methanol pumping stations. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's Ferdinand Panik said NECAR 4 was a major  
breakthrough because the fuel cell technology was small enough to 
fit in a compact car. The fuel cells were stacked underneath the 
car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen tank took up some space in 
its small trunk.

<HEADLINE> France Details WII Handling of Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France published an inventory of World War II  
documents Tuesday that detailed the systematic persecution of Jews 
and the looting of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until now, the records of France's pro-Nazi Vichy regime have  
been accessible to historians and researchers, but rarely to 
victims or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fantastic, it's unhoped for,'' said Jean Laloum, author  
of a book on the destruction of Jews living in working-class 
eastern Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ordered the archives be  
opened to the public ahead of the scheduled declassification in 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, filling 6,422 cartons, come from the General  
Office of Jewish Affairs -- established in 1941 to apply the 
discriminatory measures banning Jews from most professions and from 
owning property. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most sensitive documents are letters of denunciation  
-- which Vichy leader Philippe Petain regarded as an act of 
patriotism -- and administrative haggling over whether someone was 
Jewish or not. French racial laws were even more strict than 
Germany's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very delicate situation, but we decided to go ahead  
and publish everything,'' said Paule Rene-Bazin, head curator of 
the 20th century division of the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75,000 Jews, including 12,000 children, were deported from  
France to Nazi death camps between 1941-44, and only 2,500 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Belaval, director of the National Archives, told  
reporters that two-thirds of the documents pertain specifically to 
the forced sale of Jewish property to non-Jewish ownership, and 
include details on 60,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents come from the Office of Restitution, founded in  
1945 to return assets to survivors or their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Belaval said it is not known how many civil servants working in  
the General Office of Jewish Affairs were punished after the war. 
But Xavier Vallat and Louis Darquier, two of the office's most 
anti-Semitic chiefs, were tried and convicted of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	The inventory, which is on sale for $50, comes as a French panel  
of experts is preparing a report on the widespread looting of 
Jewish assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings include evidence of bank accounts and  
insurance policies frozen since the 1940s, as well as the transfer 
of Jewish-owned stocks and bonds to France's national deposit bank.
