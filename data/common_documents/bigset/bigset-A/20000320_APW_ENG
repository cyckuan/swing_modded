<HEADLINE> Taiwan Shares Down Amid Uncertainty  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The uncertainties gripping Taiwan shook
its stock market today, with many shares falling as far as possible
on fears of a war with China but a few rallying on hopes
President-elect Chen Shui-bian might forge greater economic ties
between the rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The government stepped in and bought shares to help contain the
damage, but warned investors it could not keep buying indefinitely
against a tide of selling.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei shares finished with a loss of 2.6 percent -- bouncing
back from an early drop of 3.2 percent in the first session since
Saturday's vote that will end more than a half-century of
governance by the ruling Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were able to drop only as much as 3.5 percent under
emergency measures announced Sunday night by Finance Minister Paul
Chiu -- and most companies listed on the Taipei exchange fell by the
maximum from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's Weighted Price Index lost 227.22 points, closing at
8,536.05.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood was not entirely gloomy. Despite massive red ink in
much of the stock market, shipping companies rallied on Chen's
comments that he would like to see Taiwan and China agree on direct
air and sea links.
</P>
<P>
   People and goods traveling between the two now must pass through
an outside destination -- often Hong Kong -- which costs businesses
time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Shares also dipped in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index was
off by almost 1 percent late Monday morning after falling even
further from the start on war worries.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating Taiwan's political upheaval seemed like a market
threat of similar magnitude to the devastating earthquake in
September that closed share dealings for several days, Chiu decided
to halve the normal 7 percent limit for one-day stock drops for the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu did not alter the daily limit of 7 percent increases,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said it would intervene and buy shares if
necessary to try to protect prices and the Taiwan dollar -- and the
central bank moved quickly to stabilize the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Amid heavy foreign exchange dealings -- with investors dumping
the Taiwanese currency and the central bank buying it -- the Taiwan
dollar was off by only a fraction of a percentage point at the rate
of 30.795 to the U.S. dollar early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government also intervened and bought shares, Vice
Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang appealed for investors to stay
calm and accept the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If traders keep selling, Taiwan could not indefinitely keep
buying, Yen warned.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that after a day or two of serious
drops, investors might sense some good buying opportunities, as
they have so often in the past when Taiwan faced various calamities
and the market overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's win has stirred concerns of aggravated tensions with
China, which is disturbed by his party's pro-independence stance.
China views Taiwan as a rebel province and says it must reunify
with the mainland at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is how many days of steep selling we're going to
see,'' said Peter Kurz, the top executive in Taiwan for Wall Street
investment bank Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The big sellers may have bailed out last week, when Taiwan spent
the equivalent of $3.3 billion to contain a share slide.
</P>
<P>
   China responded to Chen's election by issuing a conciliatory
wait-and-see statement -- which stood in stark contrast to Beijing's
earlier saber-rattling -- and that could help prevent a massacre on
the market.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani wraps up two-day campaign swing upstate  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani accused his Senate rival's
campaign of trying to deflect attention from a successful upstate
swing by accusing him of trying to hide a campaign contribution
from a weapons maker.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign on Sunday pointed out that
Giuliani was given $1,000 by a gun manufacturer whose business was
incorrectly listed in Giuliani campaign filings as ''Bushmaster
Farms'' instead of ''Bushmaster Firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dyke was George W. Bush's finance chairman in Maine but
he resigned in July, saying he didn't want his support for Bush to
become an issue for anti-gun activists. Dyke's company manufactures
automatic weapons for government agencies, semiautomatics for
public use and a rifle widely used in shooting competitions. His
company was sued by a Los Angeles police officer wounded during a
high-profile gun battle with bank robbers armed with semiautomatic
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, accused the New
York City mayor of trying ''to hide a contribution from an assault
weapons manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded after marching Sunday in Buffalo's St.
Patrick's Day parade, where he completed a two-day, five-county
campaign swing upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had ''no idea'' who Dyke is, the mayor said he would
withhold a decision on whether to return the $1,000 contribution
until after he had reviewed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of 150,000 contributors excuse me if I don't know all of
the names of the contributors,'' he told reporters. ''This has been
a terrific weekend for us so in order for you not to focus on the
terrific reception I got at the Erie County parade here in Buffalo,
they pick out some obscure name ... What was it a thousand-dollar
contribution? I guess we've raised now $13 or $14 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown that while the number of undecided
voters in the race between Giuliani and Clinton is miniscule, it is
largest in upstate New York, traditionally the most conservative
region of New York, but a place where residents tend to be
suspicious of things New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Parade officials made it tough for Giuliani to get close enough
to change any minds in Buffalo, though, advising him not to stray
from his place in line to shake hands even as Democratic Mayor
Anthony Masiello sprinted freely about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, it's a Democratic city,'' Giuliani said at the parade's
end, where dozens of supporters held campaign signs and chanted
''Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to be too happy about this reception so
they're going to try to find ways to step all over it. The Clintons
are and the Democrats here,'' he said. ''This is a terrific
reception for a Republican candidate in a Democratic city and when
I go home I will know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before hitting Buffalo, Giuliani had breakfast with veterans in
Chemung County. On Saturday, he marched in a St. Patrick's Day
parade in Onondaga County, went to Jefferson County to attend
Watertown's Irish Festival, visit a gas station and speak at a
community forum. In Oneida County later Saturday, Giuliani visited
a rural gas station and spoke at a volunteer fire company's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, he continued his complaints about the
Clinton administration's failure to bring down high home heating
oil and gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year has gone by and he still hasn't stood up to OPEC,''
Giuliani said in Buffalo. President Clinton's call Saturday for
congressional approval of legislation to establish an oil reserve
for the Northeast, the mayor said, ''wouldn't have any impact on
anything for about six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has oil reserves that he can sell right now and he's not
doing it,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives in India  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- President Clinton opened the first trip
of an American president to poverty-ridden Bangladesh on Monday but
scrubbed a showcase visit to a rural village because of security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant sun and humid heat greeted Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright as they stepped off Air Force One after
the flight from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, a Muslim nation of 120 million is the most densely
populated country in the world and one of the poorest, with a per
capita income of about $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written for the Times of India, Clinton saluted
Bangladesh for ''making great strides lifting citizens out of
poverty, raising the status of women, strengthening democracy,
standing against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   A 21-gun salute boomed as Clinton walked down a red carpet to an
arrival ceremony, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and President Shahabuddin Ahmed. A military band played the
national anthem of the United States and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people, many of them schoolchildren wearing
different color uniforms and waving American and Bangladeshi flags,
lined Clinton's motorcade route.
</P>
<P>
   The road from the airport to town, about six miles, was cleared
of all traffic and police, troops and paramilitary forces were
posted with automatic weapons every 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first stop was a meeting with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before starting the daylong trip to Bangladesh, the
White House canceled a stop at the village of Joypura, about 20
miles from the capital of Dhaka. Presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart cited concerns raised by security experts and another
official said there were fears about taking the president by
helicopter over a dense, tropical forest where security could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton was confining his visit to Dhaka and meet with
Joypura villagers there.
</P>
<P>
   Also before his arrival, protesters in New Delhi burned an
effigy of the president. In the northern region of Kashmir, police
beat back separatists seeking to reach New Delhi and draw attention
to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied to South Asia by his daughter Chelsea
and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. Hillary Rodham Clinton
stayed home to campaign for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's six-day journey to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
brought him to one of the poorest regions of the world struggling
with population growth, malnutrition, illiteracy and poor health.
Adding to the suffering, India entered the new century with more
AIDs cases than any other nation -- 4 million people are HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, the protesters chanted, ''Death to Bill Clinton.
Death to the imperialism of multinationals.'' While most Indians
welcome Clinton's visit, several nationalist and communist groups
protest that he will push American economic interests at India's
expense. In Kashmir, Indian police lobbed tear gas against the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend most of his time in India -- five cities in
five days -- seeking a new relationship to replace Cold War
suspicions. Bangladesh was a side trip at the start, and the
president will make a short stop in military-ruled Pakistan on his
way home.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say there is a possibility Clinton will
stop in Geneva to meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on March 26,
but the chief of staff, John Podesta, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, Clinton planned to salute its efforts to combat
poverty and build an inclusive democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his session with the prime minister, Clinton also
had meetings scheduled with the opposition leader, and a state
dinner. He was expected to offer $97 million in food aid for
Bangladesh and $84 million in grants to support clean-energy
projects in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, White House spokesman Mike
Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for foreign policy achievements as his presidency
winds down, Clinton has been frustrated in trying to promote peace
in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. He faces huge obstacles,
as well, in trying to narrow differences between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   They have fought two wars over the last half century over rival
claims for the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. They clashed again
last summer when Pakistan-based fighters seized mountain peaks
inside India. More than 1,000 combatants died before Clinton
persuaded then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to withdraw
the forces.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring world pressure, India and Pakistan both tested nuclear
devices in 1998, dramatically heightening the stakes of their old
feud. Clinton acknowledged the dimensions of the threat when he
described the region as ''perhaps the most dangerous place in the
world today because of tensions over Kashmir and the possession of
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
neither side has deployed nuclear weapons. ''That's an important
step not taken,'' he said. But neither is willing to sign a nuclear
test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has pledged to press for nuclear restraint, the
administration has sketched modest goals for his trip.
</P>
<P>
   India and the United States are to sign a ''vision statement''
outlining the goals and principles that should guide the
relationship. White House officials say the visit to India is long
overdue, delayed because of political turnover in India and then
the nuclear tests in 1998.

<HEADLINE> St. Lucia Eliminated in Shootout  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   One day after Grenada became the first team
eliminated in World
Cup qualifying, another Caribbean island, St. Lucia, was the first
country knocked out by a penalty kick shootout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suriname won the shootout 3-1 after each country took 1-0
victories in the home-and-home first-round CONCACAF series.
</P>
<P>
   Suriname's Alberto Doesburj scored the only goal of the game in
the 80th minute. Because St. Lucia won the first game by the same
score on March 5, an overtime was played to decide the winner.
</P>
<P>
   After the overtime ended scoreless, Suriname's Benny Kiansi,
Orlando Grootfaam and Werner Blackson scored in a shootout against
goalie Abraham Mentor. Valencius Joseph was the only St. Lucian
kicker to get one past Surinamese goalie Roel Tempo.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent and the Grenadines completed a rout of the U.S.
Virgin Islands with a 5-1 victory Sunday. That followed an earlier
9-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing five starters who were playing abroad, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines dominated. Striker James Chewitt had
four goals.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent will next play . Kitts on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Also finishing off a one-sided series was Bermuda, which romped
past the British Virgin Islands 9-0 for a 14-1 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   At Hamilton, the hosts scored seven second-half goals. Stephen
Astwood and substitute John Barry Nusum led with two goals apiece
to advance to a series with Antigua and Barbuda.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas advanced by beating Anguilla 2-1 for a 5-1 aggregate
total.
</P>
<P>
   On a soggy home field in Nassau, Bahamas striker Anton Haven
shot the ball over the head of goalie Ryan Liddie from 40 yards in
the 16th minute. Kevin Davies scored the deciding goal in the 77th
minute off a pass by Peron Major.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla's only goal came in the 40th minute on a penalty kick
by midfielder Richard O'Conner. He got the score on his second try
after his first attempt was called back for jumping the referee's
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas faces Haiti next.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti defeated Dominica 3-1 for a 7-1 aggregate. Haitian striker
Golman Pierre scored a hat trick, getting all three in the second
half after Dominica took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba advanced 4-0 with a scoreless tie at the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In a game moved to Port-of-Spain, Trinidad because of volanic
activity on Montserrat, the Dominican Republic beat Montserrat,
3-1. The Dominicans advanced with a 6-1 aggregate and will play
Trinidad and Tobago in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central America round-robin, Panama beat Nicaragua 2-0
and Guatemala defeated Belize 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Panama pressed on offense throughout, getting an early
goal from Mario Mendez and a late one by Julio Cesar Dely Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   In a game moved to Honduras because of current political
conflicts between the two countries, Guatemala won it in the 76th
minute on Ruddy Ramirez's goal. Fredy Garcia also scored for
Guatemala, in the 33rd minute, while Emory Nunez got Belize's goal
in the 40th minute in stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game took place in the northern city of San Pedro Sula
after FIFA ruled it be played in neutral territory because of the
''dangerous border situation between the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tions have been involved in a border dispute for more than 100
years.

they can fully explain Friday's fire involving members of the Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God. As many as 470 people were killed in
either a mass suicide or murder. Circumstances surrounding the deaths -- who the
dead were and how the fire was started -- remain foggy. Little was known about
the cult, although it appeared to incorporate Christian beliefs and local
farmers said it was led by a former prostitute. Syncretic Christian religious
sects are mushrooming across Africa as many people become disillusioned with the

<HEADLINE> Nobody Can Explain Russia's Leader  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- When Russians were asked to compare Vladimir Putin
to an animal by pollsters, most people had the same response: a fox
or a wolf -- cunning, elusive and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The jarring comparison symbolizes how many Russians admire Putin
as a strong leader and how little they know about the man. There is
even less to explain his meteoric rise to the top of the Russian
government and what looks like certain victory in March 26
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin remains as much a riddle to Russians as he does to'' the
rest of the world, said Thomas Graham of the Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter to Russian voters, angry and disillusioned
by years of chaos and corruption. They believe Putin can end the
lawlessness infecting Russia by doling out bare-knuckle justice.
And they don't seem too worried about just how far he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, far fewer, see Putin as a specter from the Soviet past.
Critics say the ex-KGB officer is masquerading as a democrat and
that he will bring back the iron rule of the secret police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of the future president's inner circle look like his
twin brothers -- all lean, neat, with officers' bearing, faces
absolutely devoid of any expression and empty glazed eyes,'' the
liberal weekly Itogi said.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark poker face, Putin denies he will be a
dictator as calmly as if he were declining an offer of coffee. But
he is vague about his plans beyond saying he will continue reform
while increasing state controls.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about Putin cuts across every group and class. Some
democrats say Putin is a reformer, others claim he is a fascist.
Communists say Putin will wreck Russia with market reform, while
some reformers fear he will choke free enterprise. Some people find
him strong and inspiring, to others he is menacing, and some say he
is bland.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's background has been turned inside out for insights to
explain the man who could lead Russia for a decade and who will
have his finger on the nuclear trigger. The digging has produced
many questions and few answers.
</P>
<P>
   Short, slender, with blond hair and penetrating blue eyes, Putin
comes across as stern, often cold. ''Frankly speaking, I do not
experience any internal conflict, vacillation or torment,'' he once
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people seem to have known Putin in the past, or are not
willing to say much if they did. Those who work with him now all
sound as if they are reading the same script, praising Putin as
bright and hardworking. Nobody offers personal details, or claims
to be a friend or intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to soften Putin's image, aides have trickled out a few
personal details. He has a wife, two children and a poodle and is
said to be a devout Christian. But it was film of Putin, a judo
black belt, flipping opponents that really grabbed public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a well-disciplined person, and discipline is what our
country needs most of all,'' said Lyuba Belova, a worker at a
factory Putin visited.
</P>
<P>
   The one part of his past that Putin seems happy discussing are
his years in the Soviet secret police, which at its height killed
and imprisoned millions. He says the KGB's work was deplorable, but
praises its skill.
</P>
<P>
   In an unspectacular 15-year KGB career, Putin worked against
dissidents in the Soviet Union and as a spy in the former East
Germany. Putin says his KGB chiefs considered him a bit reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't and I didn't think that I had a decreased sense of
danger, but psychologists came to this conclusion having followed
my behavior for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's career blossomed after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
when he says he was free to show his true feelings and back
democratic reform. In a few years, he shot from obscurity to the
top for reasons that are not clear, although he seemed to have a
knack for pleasing powerful bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where corruption allegations have tainted many
prominent people, there is no evidence that Putin tried to enrich
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Putin rose through bodies with unsavory records. He
was a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, a city that become a byword
for corruption; worked in the Kremlin's finance agency, the focus
of corruption allegations involving ex-President Boris Yeltsin's
family; and was regarded as a hard-liner when he headed the KGB's
successor, the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   With no clear accomplishments and largely unknown, Putin was
named prime minister by Yeltsin in August 1999. Four months later,
Yeltsin resigned, saying Putin was the best man to defend Russia's
young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry that charmed Putin's superiors worked with many
ordinary Russians. Almost overnight, Putin became the most popular
politician in Russia, hailed for his handling of the war against
separatists in Chechnya and his talk of tough rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin enjoys such broad support because people don't know what
kind of person he is, and they pin their expectations on him,''
said Boris Nemtsov, a former prime minister. ''As people get to
know Putin, they will become more sober.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Religious Clash Continues  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID COPELAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TERNATE, Indonesia (AP) -- Achmad Kala, a 71-year-old Muslim,
used to like his Christian neighbors. Then one day last year, they
turned on him, killed six members of his extended family, burned
his house and forced him to flee his village.
</P>
<P>
   He now lives in a squalid abandoned warehouse on another island
in the Malukus archipelago in eastern Indonesia. It is dirty,
stinking and hot, and flies crawl across the faces of many of his
15 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although life as a refugee is horrible, Kala says he would
rather stay where he is than return home and risk being caught
again in the violent sectarian struggle that has killed more than
2,000 people since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no end in sight to the violence that has
gripped Indonesia's Maluku and North Maluku provinces, which were
known as the Spice Islands during colonial days.
</P>
<P>
   Though the death toll has tapered off, the conflict appears to
be far from over. A community once touted as a model of religious
tolerance in multicultural and multiethnic Indonesia is split along
deep psychological and physical fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people are in refugee camps across the
archipelago, and there appears little hope for reconciliation
between the Christian and Muslim communities.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was first spilled 14 months ago after a minor scuffle
between a Christian bus driver and his Muslim conductor. But
tensions between the two communities date back to the 15th century,
when Dutch, Portuguese and English traders competing for control of
the spice trade brought Christianity with them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, tension has been partly fueled by the migration
into the region of tens of thousands of Muslims, upsetting
Christians who worry about becoming a minority in one of the few
places in Indonesia where they are a majority. About 90 percent of
Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Iskandar Djae, a senior official in the local government in
Ternate, capital of North Maluku and home to an estimated 70,000
refugees, said the only way to end the bloodshed is peace talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that neither side is willing to talk now and that
the national government in Jakarta is doing little to encourage
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got an absolute massive problem here,'' he said. ''And I
can't see any end to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts at peace have come to nothing. Last May, the
two sides signed a peace accord, but fighting broke out two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   In December, President Abdurrahman Wahid visited the region and
told residents they had to find peace themselves rather than look
to the central government for answers. New fighting erupted the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows precisely how many people are being killed
daily or what is really happening on many of the 1,000 islands in
the far-flung archipelago. Some are simply too dangerous to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Action Against Hunger, one of the few international relief
groups operating in the region, has food distribution centers on
only a few of the main islands. The agency's Maluku director, Denis
Menigon, said it was too risky elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the military escorted a reporter into Jailolo town on
Halmahera Island, where much of the fiercest fighting has taken
place. Apart from dozens of soldiers patrolling the streets and
manning road blocks, the town that once had 5,000 inhabitants was
virtually deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every mosque and church was destroyed, and 90 percent of
the houses and other buildings were burned-out shells.
</P>
<P>
   A military officer on Halmahera said his platoon had prevented
five major clashes between Christians and Muslims the past two
months. But he said there was little the armed forces could do to
impose a peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to keep them apart to stop them from fighting,''
said Lt. Efran, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
''That's all the army can do.''

<HEADLINE> Foca Trial To Begin in The Hague  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Some of the rape victims were as
young as 12. Prosecutors say the Bosnian Muslim women were detained
in a local high school, a sports hall and private homes and
sexually assaulted nightly by soldiers and paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Foca trial, which starts today at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, marks the first time an international court will judge a
case about sexual enslavement. It is part of an attempt by U.N.
prosecutors to make wartime sexual assault one of the most grievous
and punishable crimes under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Radomir Kovac, Dragoljub Kunarac and Zoran Vukovic are charged
with up to 50 counts of rape, torture, enslavement and outrages
upon personal dignity in the Foca case, named after the
southeastern Bosnian city where the crimes allegedly took place.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, former fighters on the Bosnian Serb side, have
pleaded innocent to the war crimes and crimes against humanity
charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants set up the
''quasi-brothels'' or ''rape factories'' in the summer of 1992
where dozens of women were detained. Nightly, women allegedly were
brutally beaten and forced to have sex with soldiers and
paramilitaries. They were gang-raped, tortured, and often forced to
give birth, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 rape victims are expected to testify at the trial
with privacy measures such as screens and voice scrambling. In
court documents, the women are identified with witness codes such
as FWS-48, FWS-50 and FWS-75.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say many victims suffered permanent physical harm in
addition to the lifetime mental torment caused by their sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Although Foca was the most notorious case of systematic rape in
the 1992-95 war, there were reports of rape by all sides in dozens
of camps across Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a European Community commission estimated 20,000 rape
victims in the conflict. The Bosnian government put the figure at
50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav tribunal was established by the U.N. Security
Council in 1993 after the discovery of Bosnian camps where
prisoners were murdered, raped and tortured. Judges have handed
down sentences of up to 45 years to 14 defendants from all sides of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The only previous known prosecution of forced prostitution
occurred in 1948 in Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. A Dutch
colonial court tried Japanese military defendants for raping Dutch
women prisoners during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Pope Heads to the Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- In the first papal visit to the Holy Land
in 36 years, John Paul II embarks on a highly personal pilgrimage
today that will see him retrace the footsteps of Jesus from birth,
to baptism to crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong journey through Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
territories was born out of the pope's desire to see Christendom's
holiest sites in this millennial year, though the mission will be
freighted with much broader religious and political significance in
this volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   Several sacred places on the pope's itinerary suffer from
modern-day disputes, and the pontiff's tour is viewed as a unique
opportunity to ease historical friction among Christians, Jews and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul would prefer to focus on religion and sidestep the
region's political turmoil, but simply by setting foot in contested
Jerusalem he becomes an actor in the long-running feud between
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''With deep emotion I will go to the places in which the Word
became flesh, lived and was resurrected for our salvation,'' John
Paul said Sunday at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. ''May this
visit, inspired only by religious motives, bring hoped-for fruits
for the good of the entire church.''
</P>
<P>
   Due largely to political sensitivities, no pontiff has set foot
in the Holy Land since Pope Paul VI visited in 1964. The Vatican
and Israel had no diplomatic ties, and the two sides were so
estranged that Paul VI never mentioned Israel by name in public.
</P>
<P>
   The political map was also very different at the time. East
Jerusalem, with many holy sites, belonged to Jordan until it was
taken by Israel three years later in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul was set to leave Rome today for Jordan, where he's
sure to receive a warm greeting from many of the country's 130,000
Catholics, who make up 3 percent of the population in an
overwhelmingly Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian King Abdullah, the country's Muslim clerics and
ordinary citizens also have been enthusiastic supporters of the
pope's visit, and his two days in the kingdom are not expected to
be as sensitive as his five days in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to go out in the streets to welcome the pope,'' Nabil
Haddad, priest at the Melkite Greek Catholic Church told
worshippers Sunday in Amman. ''Take your Muslim brothers along with
you and have women ululate and sigh when they see him, for he is a
blessed man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian capital was quiet Sunday, the final day of the
five-day Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, and there were no visible
signs of increased security on the lightly traveled streets.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is to look out today from atop Mount Nebo, where
tradition says that Moses first saw the promised land. The
following day, the pontiff will head to the east bank of the
languid Jordan River, where some scholars believed Jesus was
baptized by John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the relatively low-key ceremonies in Jordan,
Israel is planning its biggest security operation ever in
preparation for the pope's arrival Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, police said suspected right-wing Jewish extremists
vandalized the helipad where the papal helicopter is to land,
spray-painting swastikas and slogans such as ''Pope Out'' and
''Where were you during the Holocaust?''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Jewish leaders welcome the pope's visit and his
statements promoting reconciliation among faiths, but they would
like him to go further in acknowledging the church's past
discrimination against Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jerusalem's chief Muslim cleric has turned down the
pope's invitation to participate in a public dialogue among
Muslims, Jews and Christians, citing the unresolved political
dispute over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel controls all of the city, but the Palestinians are
seeking to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   For the pope, there's no escaping the controversial sites.
</P>
<P>
   He will tour Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus -- and a town
Palestinians consider central to their envisioned state.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth, where Jesus spent his boyhood, includes a square where
plans to build a mosque have sparked tension between Christians,
Muslims and Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the entire visit could come on the final day,
Sunday, when the pontiff will work his way through the narrow stone
lanes of Jerusalem's Old City to sites revered by all three
religions.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul will visit the Western Wall, believed to be the only
surviving remnant of the Jewish Second Temple. In a show of
solidarity with Muslims, the pope also will go to the adjoining
Haram as-Sharif, site of the magnificent Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   And the pope will conclude his pilgrimage at Christianity's
holiest site, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Six Christian
communities share the church, believed to be the spot where Jesus
was crucified, buried and rose from the dead.

<HEADLINE> Senegal Opposition Leads Election  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Excited supporters of opposition
presidential candidate Abdoulaye Wade danced and sang in the
streets of the capital today after unofficial results showed him
leading the incumbent in a run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   But with no official returns announced, a foreign election
observer cautioned it was too early to call a winner.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction from President Abdou Diouf's party, which
has ruled for 40 years. However, truckloads of paramilitary police
were quietly deployed overnight around the presidential palace and
other key government installations in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although at least one foreign election observer said late Sunday
it was too early to say who had won, journalists at Senegal's
popular private radio stations were broadcasting early returns
gathered from individual voting stations in the cities, which
showed Wade leading Diouf.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary official results were not expected until Tuesday or
later.
</P>
<P>
   During the first round of voting on Feb. 27, Diouf won 41
percent with good rural returns, while opponent Wade trailed with
30 percent on the strength of strong urban support.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, Wade has won the backing of five of the six
other opposition candidates from the previous round.
</P>
<P>
   Wade told journalists early today that he was not yet claiming
victory, but believed ''strongly that I have won this election.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a day of liberation, a dawn of a new era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 supporters danced and sang Senegalese pop songs
outside Wade's home in suburban Dakar while thousands of others
honked horns and raced through the streets in cars, motorcycles and
on foot carrying posters and flags.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the campaign headquarters of Diouf's Socialist Party
was nearly abandoned Sunday evening, although a worker said the
party was confident of making up for urban losses in villages and
towns of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were a test of Senegal's reputation as one of
Africa's most peaceful, democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of violence, ballot theft and other irregularities
around the country marred Sunday's vote. Several injuries and
dozens of arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Cesar Sibailly, an Ivorian election observer from the
Association of African Jurists, said late Sunday that it was too
early to say who had won -- or whether the results would be fair.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he and other observers were satisfied that
voting had taken place relatively openly and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the showdown, Wade accused Diouf of preparing to
fix the elections and warned of a spontaneous revolution by angry
voters if he lost.
</P>
<P>
   After voting in the capital, Wade, 70, who describes himself as
a liberal, told his supporters Sunday not to initiate violence but
to fight back if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned Senegalese to ''remain vigilant'' for ''serious
election anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although turnout figures were unavailable, there appeared to be
fewer voters in Dakar than during the first round. Some voters had
been unable to return on time from Muslim festivities in other
parts of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's backers say he should be re-elected because under his
leadership Senegal has become one of Africa's most stable nations
with a vibrant trading economy despite few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Diouf of fostering a corrupt elite and ignoring
the country's poor since he became president in 1981. In recent
years, unemployment and crime have increased in the coastal
capital.

<HEADLINE> Maine Syrup Industry Changing  </HEADLINE>
By ANN S. KIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOWHEGAN, Maine (AP) -- Working amid the steam and loud hum of
the evaporator is Jeremy Steeves' favorite part of his family's
maple syrup businesses. He constantly checks the levels of the pan,
the temperature and sugar level as watery sap is transformed into
golden syrup.
</P>
<P>
   This is a busy time for maple syrup producers like Steeves in
Somerset County, where an estimated 1 million sugar maples are
tapped in the thick North Woods stretching to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of intense because the sap's running. You have to
keep things going,'' he said. ''There's always that urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerset, which produces 90 percent of Maine's maple syrup and
more than any other county in the United States, has
single-handedly propelled Maine's syrup production to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   And maple syrup producers like Steeves hope to boost the profile
of Maine, which ranks third behind Vermont and New York for maple
syrup production in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people don't even know they make syrup in Maine,''
Steeves said outside the sugar shack at Strawberry Hill Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The market for syrup has grown over the last 15 years as
producers have started selling overseas, particularly in Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Overall production in North America has grown from around 3.5
million gallons to 6.5 million gallons since the mid-1980s, the
Quebec Maple Syrup Producers Federation says.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, production has grown from 113,000 gallons in 1993 to
187,000 gallons last year, and so many taps are being added that
some Mainers see the day when they surpass New York's production.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet taste evokes picture-postcard images of sturdy Yankees
hauling buckets of sap and cooking it over wood fires.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is more prosaic. The sap flows in miles of practical
blue plastic tubing that runs from tree to tree. It flows into
larger tubes and pipes before being pumped up to the stainless
steel evaporator.
</P>
<P>
   The fires are fueled by oil, which slashes the costs of chopping
and hauling wood and makes the temperature easier to control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't do all this business with pails,'' says John
Steeves, Jeremy's father. ''It would be like using a rowboat to go
to England. It's just not practical.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 7,000 taps, Strawberry Hill Farm is considered small
for a commercial operation in a county where some producers have
100,000 taps.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset County had more than 710,000 taps listed in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's 1997 census, and as much as a quarter
of production may go unreported, said Aubrey Davis, director of the
New England Agricultural Statistics Service in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The county with the most taps in Vermont, Franklin, has about
452,000 and St. Lawrence County in New York has about 152,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though syrup is big business, the basic idea is the same --
remove enough water from about 40 gallons of sap to turn it into
one gallon of syrup. Some producers put the sap through a reverse
osmosis machine that pushes the water out of the sap. Others, like
the Steeves, boil it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sap is boiled in an evaporator, it's as thin as water
and just a bit cloudy. With just 2 percent to 4 percent sugar,
there's only the faintest bit of sweetness. As the sap moves
through the machine, water is removed and the color turns to its
familiar amber.
</P>
<P>
   Precision counts because there's a window of only about 30
seconds between the time the water is cooked off and the syrup
turns to sugar, Jeremy Steeves said. And if the syrup burns, it
ruins the custom-made pans, which could take more than six months
to replace.

<HEADLINE> US Airways' Strike Deadline Near  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a strike deadline less than a week away,
US Airways flight attendants are back at the bargaining table in a
final attempt to resolve a three-year contract dispute with the
nation's sixth largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations aimed at preventing a walkout began Friday, and the
carrier is threatening to shut down if a strike occurs. The talks
are being supervised by Ernest DuBester, chairman of the National
Mediation Board, which oversees labor disputes in the
transportation industry. Negotiations are expected to continue
until an agreement or the strike deadline -- 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday
-- is reached.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who can legally block the walkout
temporarily, also will be kept up to date on the proceedings. But
officials said the administration has no plans currently to
intervene while the mediation board does its work.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways Executive Vice President Lawrence Nagin said, ''We
are singularly focused on reaching an agreement that is fair both
to the flight attendants and to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Association of Flight Attendants sent a letter
to US Airways investors last week in an attempt to build outside
pressure on the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than sit down and negotiate a fair contract with the
flight attendants, US Airways is planning to hurt its employees,
hurt its passengers and hurt its investors by shutting the airline
down,'' said the letter, signed by Lynn Lenosky, president of the
union's US Airways council.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 US Airways flight attendants are working under a
contract that expired at the end of 1996 and gave them their last
pay raise, of 4 percent, at the beginning of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants are permitted to strike if no agreement is
reached after a 30-day cooling-off period, which runs through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that if a strike does occur, attendants
probably would not walk off the job en masse. Rather, they would
target selected routes with impromptu walkouts that could surprise
management and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants have released a list of 49 routes that could be
affected, including Washington-Boston, San Francisco-Philadelphia
and New York and Orlando, Fla. Other major airlines serve all of
the targeted routes, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways serves destinations in 38 states and the District of
Columbia, as well as Canada, Europe, Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways would have the right to replace striking flight
attendants, but unpredictable strike tactics could make that
difficult. Airline officials say they will shut down all operations
to avoid subjecting customers to disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ''US Airways simply cannot risk losing our customers'
confidence,'' executives said in a Feb. 23 letter to employees. In
case of a shutdown, the letter said, all workers -- except flight
attendants -- would continue to be paid ''for as long as is
financially feasible.'' The Arlington, Va.-based airline has nearly
45,000 workers who could be furloughed.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is advising concerned customers to contact its ticket
agents or their own travel agents. Nagin said the airline has
planned to make alternative arrangements for passengers or
compensate them on a case-by-case basis should problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for US Airways attendants is $17,145 a year,
while those at the top of the pay scale, with 14 years seniority,
earn $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants are resisting the airline's proposal to put them
under a pay-and-benefits formula based on what its biggest
competitors offer, plus 1 percent. Other unions representing US
Airways workers have accepted the formula, which the company says
must be applied across the board to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants argue that management has not clearly
spelled out how the formula would affect their pay and fear it
could result in erosion of some benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's last airline shutdown because of a labor dispute
was in 1998, when Northwest Airlines was grounded for two weeks,
furloughing nearly 30,000 employees when its pilots struck.
</P>
<P>
   In Northwest's case, Clinton stopped short of using his
authority to stall a transportation strike for 60 days. Instead, he
dispatched aides who ultimately coaxed the two sides back to the
bargaining table. But in 1997, he ordered striking American
Airlines pilots back to work almost instantly.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Human Rights Meeting To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- China and Chechnya promise to be two of the
toughest challenges for the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission
as it begins its annual six-week session.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen war and Chinese clampdowns are among issues that
will be drawing dozens of foreign ministers and other top officials
from as far away as Pakistan, Chile and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
have joined about 30 cabinet level officials in signing up just for
the first week, which begins today.
</P>
<P>
   Two top human rights organizations, Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch, have urged the commission to risk provoking the
ire of Russia and China, two of the most powerful nations that will
be involved in behind-the-scenes lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   However, countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia have avoided
outright condemnation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are quite a few untouchables'' at the commission,
Isabelle Scherrer, Amnesty's representative at the United Nations
in Geneva, told reporters last Friday. ''China has been one for
many years ... and we'll see whether this year the commission can
finally break its deadlock.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government took the unusual step this year of
announcing well in advance -- on Jan. 11 -- that it would propose a
resolution criticizing China, citing what it said was a continued
deterioration in Beijing's rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts to rebuke China have failed in the face of
heavy lobbying by Beijing with developing countries, which dominate
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, which last year refrained from backing a
China resolution, has yet to announce a policy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty and Human Rights Watch say China is pressing its most
concerted crackdown on dissent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the opening session this year will be U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson, who visited China earlier this month
and plans to visit Moscow and Chechnya starting March 31.
</P>
<P>
   She has said China's violations of freedom of speech, religion
and association have worsened in the past year. During her visit,
she failed to get China's agreement on a program of technical
cooperation to help it ratify two key human rights treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, however, has said China's
human rights situation has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also has expressed concern about the large number of
civilian casualties in Russia's campaign against Chechen rebels as
well as alleged torture and other abuses. Russia has denied
allegations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty also says the commission should discuss conditions in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations that will be discussed by the commission will
include such countries as Iran, Iraq, Myanmar and Cuba, all of
which were criticized last year.

<HEADLINE> Allies Rebuke NRA Leader's Words  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some influential Republicans who have
traditionally supported the National Rifle Association sought to
dissociate themselves from recent remarks by an NRA leader about
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre remained
unrepentant Sunday about his contention last week that Clinton is
''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my comments that if this administration would
enforce the federal law they'd save lives, and they're not doing
it,'' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said
LaPierre's remark about the president was not ''terribly helpful to
trying to reach a consensus on a very difficult issue'' that
Congress continues to struggle with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an extreme statement,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said on
CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''I wish it hadn't been said.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' Former President Ford said gun control
requires ''reasonable compromise,'' adding: ''You can't take the
hard-line, NRA position -- that's a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, traveling with Clinton in
India, said there had been ''an appalling silence from political
leaders over the last week, particularly the Republicans who are
the NRA allies'' to repudiate LaPierre's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration will ''keep the pressure on in
every possible way'' to persuade Congress to pass gun safety
measures, Clinton domestic policy aide Bruce Reed said on ''Fox
News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the nation's largest gun manufacturer, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, agreed to make its handguns more childproof by installing
safety locks and developing ''smart gun'' technology that limits a
gun's use to its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre discounted the deal's importance, saying there was not
much new in it. Reed disputed that and credited the company with a
''courageous decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's president, actor Charlton Heston, said the British
owners of Smith &AMP; Wesson do not place the same value on the Second
Amendment's right to bear arms as do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not comfortable about the Brits telling us how to deal
with our Bill of Rights,'' Heston told ABC. ''I think we settled
that in 1776, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking laws to require safety locks on all handguns,
ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and require
background checks before a weapon could be purchased at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed separate versions of the bill
but have not found a compromise. A sticking point is how to handle
background checks for gun buyers. Clinton wants a 72-hour waiting
period. Many Republicans and the NRA favor instant checks, or
24-hour checks at most.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, LaPierre came under criticism for his assertion
last week that Clinton ''has blood on his hands'' in the death of
former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong was shot to death last summer by a white supremacist
who had failed a background check but was not arrested. LaPierre
said lax law enforcement by the administration was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Byrdsong's widow, Sherialyn, called
LaPierre's comments ''appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly do not in any way think my husband's blood is on
your hands,'' she wrote, ''and I applaud your efforts.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Scandals a Novel Inspiration  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The senator was evidently corrupt by nature.
The younger woman who declined his offer of marriage concluded he
could no more separate right from wrong than a colorblind man could
distinguish red from green.
</P>
<P>
   The avaricious lawmaker was Sen. Silas P. Ratcliffe, the
fictional creation of Henry Adams, the disillusioned grandson and
great grandson of two U.S. presidents whose moral rectitude was
unquestioned even by their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' 1880 novel, ''Democracy'' -- he published it anonymously --
grew out of the author's cynical despair over the murk of
corruption that had fouled American institutions in the roaring
years after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Ratcliffe at his most candid: ''If Washington were
president now he would have to learn our ways or lose the next
election. ... If virtue won't answer our purpose we must use vice,
or our opponents will put us out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy'' was an early contribution to an ever-increasing
procession of Washington novels, fictional explorations of the
front parlors and back rooms of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain and his co-author, Charles Dudley Warner, are
commonly credited with inventing the breed in their 1873 novel,
''The Gilded Age,'' a book that gave its name to an era. In its
pages, Sen. Abner Dilworthy is portrayed as ''a pious hypocrite, a
sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulates temperance movements,
prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities, missionary
enterprises, all for his private benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a character explains just how much a congressional
appropriation actually costs from the money available to buy it:
</P>
<P>
   ''A majority of the House committee, say $10,000 apiece; a
majority of the Senate committee, the same each, -- say $40,000; a
little extra to one or two chairmen ..., say $10,000 each --
$20,000; and there's $100,000 of the money gone, to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors have mined the fools' gold of Washington with unflagging
persistence ever since, discovering a rich vein from which to
extract novels and murder mysteries and spy thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Just to leaf through a few mysteries that choose the Senate as a
backdrop is to find fictional murder victims strewn under the
chandeliers: stuffed under a grating in the Senate basement,
slumped in a Senate subway car, stabbed at a crowded Senate
reception, gunned down in mid-speech on the Senate floor itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thriller writer Tom Clancy did in almost everyone that mattered
by slamming a jumbo jet into the House chamber during a joint
meeting of Congress. Having further novels to write, he spared his
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Truman Daniel, President Truman's daughter, has made
Washington institutions and neighborhoods settings for all of her
long series of murder mysteries, starting with ''Murder in the
White House,'' a best seller in 1980, and ''Murder on Capitol
Hill'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother seems to have a strong opinion, often bad, of almost
everyone in Washington,'' her son, Clifton Truman Daniel, said in a
memoir. ''That's why she writes these murder mysteries, so she can
kill them all off, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent cases of Capitol murder occurs in the
opening chapters of ''Juneteenth,'' Ralph Ellison's 1999 posthumous
exploration of the American racial divide in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Race-baiting Sen. Adam Sunraider is in full voice on the Senate
floor when a man rises in the public gallery, and fires as the
senator asks himself, ''Is it me? Am I his target?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, members of Congress began writing mysteries
and thrillers set in the territory they know best, sometimes taking
a shot at a favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regular senators are going to eat me alive,'' says a new
female senator in ''Capitol Offense,'' the 1996 novel by Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and co-author Marylouise Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give 'em heartburn,'' a friend replies. ''Anyway, you're not
irregular. You're just a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Around here, that's fairly irregular,'' the senator replies.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. William S. Cohen, now secretary of defense, has
written a number of Washington mysteries, including ''Murder in the
Senate'' and ''The Double Man,'' with former Sen. Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Drury, who first knew the Senate as a journalist, wrote a
long series of Washington novels, most based in the Senate. One,
''Mark Coffin, USS,'' published in 1979, gave this description of
the principal occupation of a one-industry town:
</P>
<P>
   ''In Washington, politics, the company business, went on --
Enormously Interesting, Excruciatingly Vital, Intensely Passionate,
Terribly Involved, Frightfully Self-Centered and Self Hypnotized --
as always.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury's ''Advise and Consent,'' nearly everyone's favorite
Washington novel, centers on a titanic struggle to confirm a
nominee for secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   And when it is over, this final paragraph:
</P>
<P>
   ''So they rode on, old friends from the Senate together carrying
their country's hopes, while below America sped away, the kindly,
pleasant greening land about to learn whether history still had a
place for a nation so strangely composed of great ideals and uneasy
compromise as she.''

<HEADLINE> Charge Against Clinton Possible  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel wrapping up the
investigation of President Clinton says he has not ruled out filing
criminal charges and is bringing in investigators from the FBI and
other agencies to help him decide.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Sunday, Robert Ray said he has not
determined Clinton's possible criminal liability. It was the first
time he publicly discussed the possibility that the president might
be prosecuted in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., has held Clinton in civil
contempt for 10 alleged lies in a sworn deposition that ''no
reasonable person would seriously dispute.'' The president's affair
with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, led to perjury and
obstruction of justice charges on which he was impeached in 1998.
The Senate voted not to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray announced last week that he found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing by White House officials or first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the 1996 ''Filegate'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said Sunday on ABC's ''This Week'' that he made that
decision after finding no evidence of ''dissemination for partisan
political purposes'' of hundreds of files of Republican former
White House employees that the FBI was ordered to deliver to
Clinton staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that decision, Ray said the five-year, $50 million
investigation that began with former Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's look at the Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings is
far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has sworn in two new attorneys, will be hiring others and is
bringing in investigators from the FBI and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am anticipating making judgments about whether or not it is
appropriate to bring prosecutions,'' he said. ''I intend to have
the assistance of experienced people, experienced prosecutors, to
help me make those judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is -- as the public is well aware -- a matter involving
the president of the United States in connection with the Lewinsky
investigation,'' Ray continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country went through the matter of impeachment. The
judgment was made by the country that it was not appropriate to
remove the president from office,'' he said. ''It is now my task as
a prosecutor, with a very limited and narrow focus, to determine
again whether crimes have been committed and whether ... it is
appropriate to bring charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray promised that his investigation will be fair and thorough,
adding: ''There is a bigger issue here, and the bigger issue is yet
to be vindicated. And the issue to be vindicated is that no person,
including the president of the United States, is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy referred a request for comment
to Clinton's personal counsel. Presidential lawyer David Kendall
did not return a message left at his office Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told ABC he does not think Ray is
conducting a partisan investigation, but he said many Americans
feel enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''My basic view is that the common-sense view of the American
people is the right view, which is the president has been punished.
He has the mark of Cain on his forehead he could never erase,''
Schumer said. ''And that we ought to ... go on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the Lewinsky investigation is not the only one left on
his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my judgment based upon the several mandates that we have
... to arrive at reasoned and considered judgments with respect to
each, and when those decisions are made to release them ...
eventually to the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he should be finished ''during the course of this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that risks involving the legal process in politics,
specifically Mrs. Clinton's campaign for the Senate from New York.

<HEADLINE> Ridge Again Veep Prospect  </HEADLINE>
By JIM STRADER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- After Gov. Tom Ridge led George W. Bush
on an early morning run along the Susquehanna River, the Texas
governor was asked about his Pennsylvania counterpart's fit as a
''running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to take the bait, joking that Ridge was simply his
''jogging mate.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors' playfulness last summer was among the first signs
of election season ''veepstakes'' speculation, with Ridge a strong
Republican vice presidential prospect, just as he was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his friendship with Bush -- and with his father,
former President Bush -- Ridge offers some potential pluses for the
White House ticket, but also a few drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most attractive would be Ridge's popular leadership in
Pennsylvania, likely to be a major swing state in November, where
he is serving his second and final term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ridge would make good political sense,'' said Larry Bartels, a
political science professor at Princeton University, who views
Pennsylvania as a fall battleground.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Ridge has been successful on economic development,
welfare reform and enacting a number of crime bills. He has won
limited changes in education, seeing charter schools and academic
standards approved but failing to gain legislative support for
tuition vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   He also would be an interesting choice because of his views on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is Roman Catholic, but he believes in abortion rights -- a
stance that could help Bush move to the political middle after
courting conservative Republicans to defeat Arizona Sen. John
McCain for the presidential nomination. Bush opposes abortion, but
he would allow exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when
continuing the pregnancy would jeopardize a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Bartels said the difference of opinion could produce grumbling
among GOP hardliners but that Ridge's selection could broaden the
ticket's appeal by moving it away from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge boasts working-class roots, a Harvard degree earned on
scholarship, decorations for combat service in Vietnam, a part-time
career as a prosecutor and 12 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A political moderate, he has demonstrated ability to reach
independents in Pennsylvania, a valuable asset given how those
voters helped boost McCain in the early GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumbered Republicans 54 percent to 41 percent in
the Erie-based congressional district that sent Ridge to Washington
in his last election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole looked at Ridge as a
possible running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said he ''raised some reservations'' about joining the
ticket, even as Dole narrowed his list of prospects, but did not
withdraw his name. Dole wound up choosing Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was that winnowing-out process,'' Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the governor has remained aloof, careful not
to betray too much interest in the No. 2 spot while not quite
discouraging speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's far too early,'' Ridge said. ''It is the politics of June
or July that will dictate the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, he said Bush has a ''very deep bench''
from which to choose, including ''strong and supportive
governors,'' members of Congress and people outside government.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said he would not automatically say ''Yes'' if Bush popped
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''There'll be some political matters that have to be weighed,''
he said. ''At the end of the day, it will be as much a personal
decision, a family decision, as a political one. ... I enjoy being
governor.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Says GOP Must Make Peace  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Ford says George W. Bush and
John McCain must heal the wounds of their bitter campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination if the party is to have a chance
of winning back the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The 86-year-old GOP elder statesman said victory also requires
that Bush, who emphasized his conservatism in defeating McCain,
bring the party back toward the center, as Ronald Reagan did in
1980 to defeat President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview aired Sunday, Ford also speculated
that McCain, a senator from Arizona, would agree to be Texas Gov.
Bush's running mate if Bush asked properly. McCain has said
repeatedly that he would not run for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Republicans are going to win, Bush and McCain have to
get together. And I'm an optimist. I think they will,'' Ford said
on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''And I can be very frank with my
Republican friends: Unless they move back into the middle, and have
a big-tent philosophy, they'll continue to lose the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said McCain, by attracting hordes of new, largely
independent and less conservative voters to GOP primaries, ''did a
great favor to the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning nine of 13 Republican contests on Super Tuesday,
March 7, and earlier primaries, notably South Carolina's, Bush
emphasized his conservative credentials to appeal to the party's
right. Some analysts contend he portrayed himself as far more
conservative than he is, which could make a more centrist position
in the general election difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his experience in his nomination campaign against
Reagan in 1976, Ford said he thinks Bush has left himself
sufficient flexibility. Ford narrowly defeated Reagan, then lost
the general election to Jimmy Carter, who then lost to Reagan in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan ''was to the right of me, but when he came to 1980, he
moved over toward the middle, and his friends on the right ...
didn't abandon him,'' Ford said. I think the Bush supporters could
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In prescribing ''reconciliation and a good, strong
partnership,'' the former president said Bush and McCain must
realize ''that politics is a tough, tough arena. And you don't hold
grudges if you want to win the big ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he said: ''Bush has to be magnanimous. He has to
modify some of his views in order to accommodate the views of
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the running-mate question, Ford said: ''I suspect that if
Governor Bush asked him on a patriotic, Republican request, Senator
McCain would probably say yes.''

<HEADLINE> New York FBI chief, expert in organized crime, retiring  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lewis Schiliro is putting away his FBI badge
after 25 years of helping to dismantle the mob, track terrorists
and steer the FBI into a shrinking world where the next case might
be 3,000 miles away or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to chase fugitives over fences. Today, we chase them
through cyberspace,'' the head of the FBI in New York said in an
interview shortly before his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro noted it's largely due to FBI Director Louis Freeh,
once his roommate at the FBI academy in Quantico, Va., that the
agency is now fighting terrorism and white-collar crime worldwide
in coordination with foreign police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Agents now travel all over the world ... . For us it was a big
deal if we went into New Jersey,'' Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the top experts on organized crime -- testifying 11
days at the trial of mob boss John Gotti -- and as an assistant
director of the FBI heads the agency's largest field office, in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh called Schiliro ''the very best of the FBI,'' saying the
agency has benefited from ''his street experience, his judgment and
his unbending reflection of the highest ethical values.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White of the Southern District in New York
also praised Schiliro. ''In his own self-effacing way he has
successfully handled some of the FBI's biggest and most difficult
cases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Schiliro's cases were the World Trade Center bombing, the
crash of TWA Flight 800 and the pursuit of Osama bin Laden and the
terrorists he allegedly led to carry out the deadly bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer whose father was a plumber, Schiliro joined the FBI in
Cleveland in 1975, a time when terrorism seemed a problem only in
faraway lands and organized crime had more power than the mayor in
some parts of New York.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the city just as the FBI was beginning an assault on
organized crime, targeting leaders of New York's five Mafia
families with federal racketeering laws that allowed life sentences
for operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro discovered that the mob had such a tight grip on the
city that it was impossible to put up a building, open a restaurant
or collect garbage without paying a bribe to the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you did not make payoffs to the right unions, your cement
would not be poured or your bricks would not be delivered,'' he
said. ''You would have to become part of the corruption. If you
didn't play ball, you would get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro, a reserved man, made his mark against the Mafia more
than a decade ago when he supervised the FBI's work in the famous
Pizza Connection case, in which mobsters delivered drugs along with
pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of successful cases over the last 25 years, the
FBI has largely demystified the mob, relying heavily on electronic
surveillance to convict crime figures with their own words. It also
pierced the wall of silence around the Mafia's hierarchy; now it's
not uncommon for organized crime's ''soldiers'' to snitch on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a life sentence without parole is one of the FBI's
most powerful weapons. It was used, for example, to convince
Gambino family underboss Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano to
admit two dozen murders and help put his boss, John Gotti, behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro says that with constant prosecution, the Cosa Nostra
can be reduced to a street gang with little more influence than any
bunch of disorganized thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mafia is trying to redefine itself, looking for
white-collar partners for illegal Wall Street stock schemes and
tapping Russian organized crime for its expertise in international
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have forced them out of their traditional areas,'' said
Schiliro, adding that the mob's power has been reduced in the
construction, carting and garment industries, as well as in trade
unions and the Fulton fish market.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will look for new ways to make money,'' he said. ''That
is why we see them in health care fraud, penny stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking back on it, we waged a good battle,'' said Schiliro.
''But we haven't won yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro, 51, plans to work at MBNA, a major credit card company
based in Wilmington, Del. He said he decided to retire early, at
the end of March, partly for financial reasons; this fall he will
have a daughter entering medical school, a son entering college and
another daughter, an attorney, getting married.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he will miss the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a front row seat to the best show on Broadway,'' he
said. ''I would not change anything in my career. I just wish it
had lasted longer.''

<HEADLINE> How India Strike Disrupted Deal  </HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Just ask Data Magfur whether
Bangladesh's repeated political strikes are good for business.
</P>
<P>
   Magfur's chance to start a shoe leather export business was
ruined by one such strike. He is just one of many Bangladeshis who
suffer when transportation and business shuts down as opposition
parties try to cripple the country to force new elections. Business
leaders say the strikes, which can leave foreign investors hunkered
in their hotels for fear of street mobs, are sapping the country's
potential for economic growth and discouraging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   There were 30 such strike days last year and five so far this
year. An opposition alliance led by Khaleda Zia is trying to force
out the government of Sheikh Hasina, who used the same tactics
before she was elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   American business is interested in investing in Bangladesh,
particularly in its undeveloped natural gas fields, and President
Clinton's visit today will focus attention on the potential of one
of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Magfur, 27, runs his father's pesticide business but had a plan
to start his own leather export company. His prospective German
clients were in Dhaka on Feb. 2 when a strike was called, and they
lost interest quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had an appointment with a German business team at the office
of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry,'' Magfur told The
Associated Press. ''One of the German businessmen, I was told, was
interested in buying leather products from Bangladesh.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was both excited and nervous. This was my first business
negotiation on my own,'' he said. ''But all my hopes faded the
moment I read in the newspapers that the opposition had called for
a general strike that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Magfur lives in Uttar, 12 miles from the Motijheel commercial
district where he was to meet the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I refused to give up,'' he said. ''I hired a rickshaw to
travel all the way to Motijheel. It took me nearly two hours, a
30-minute journey by car.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I reached the chamber's office I was told that the
meeting was canceled. The Germans could not come out of their hotel
because of the strike,'' he said. ''They were leaving the next day.
I became desperate and rescheduled my meeting with them at their
hotel in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the meeting occurred, he said, the Germans were more
interested in talking about the strike and fears of future
disruptions. ''The Germans wanted to know more about our political
situation than my business proposals,'' said Magfur.
</P>
<P>
   One of the visitors asked Magfur if it was safe to do business
in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hardly had any good answer. I tried to reassure him. But I
guess he was not convinced. The businessmen returned home learning
bad things about our country. That's what I concluded watching
their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the pesticide business is suffering losses
because of the frequent strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Because pesticide is linked to the crop season, ''we can sell it
only six months in a year,'' said Magfur. ''So we need to supply
the chemicals to the farmers when they need them.''
</P>
<P>
   The five strike days in February stopped shipping at an
important time, Magfur said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have already lost some business,'' he said. ''Last year we
lost at least 20 percent of our business because of strikes.''

<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Five youths working a clean-up crew along a
busy highway were killed Sunday afternoon when a speeding van raced
off the interstate and slammed into them.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth was critically injured.
</P>
<P>
   The six youths were among a group of 45 juvenile offenders, ages
14 through 17, who had been sentenced to work for the Clark County
Youth Services Department.
</P>

   The victims were hit by a white Ford minivan driving northbound
when it ran off Interstate 15 near the Las Vegas Motor Speedway,
just north of the downtown area, said Nevada Highway Patrol Sgt.
Steve Cabrales.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old driver was transported to University Medical
Center for minor injuries, then she was taken into custody and
jailed for investigation of driving under the influence involving
controlled substances and felony reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Sons of the Legion Takes Up Slack  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- As state commander of the Sons of the
American Legion, Edward Marsden attends meetings at Legion posts
across New Jersey. But if members adjourn for some beers, he parts
company. At 16, he's too young to sit at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Marsden is a busy young man -- Boy Scouts, a junior ROTC program,
part-time work at a pizza parlor. But the Sons of the Legion,
devoted to the legacy of America's war veterans, is his principal
after-school passion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my friends are supportive. They think it's cool,''
Marsden said. ''And some are like, 'Why are you wasting your time
with that?'''
</P>
<P>
   As World War II veterans across the country die at a rate of
1,000 per day, the Legion is struggling to keep its membership
close to 3 million. The Sons of the Legion, with 7,000 members in
New Jersey and 230,000 nationwide, has helped revitalize some
Legion posts that otherwise might have faced cutbacks and closure.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons was founded in 1932, when families of World War I
veterans did not anticipate another world war. Since 1982, when
membership was 60,000, its ranks have increased every year.
Strongholds of Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania have more than 20,000
members each.
</P>
<P>
   In Toms River, a town of 7,500 near the coast of east-central
New Jersey, the Sons shares facilities with American Legion Post
129. Relations between parent and offspring are cordial, though
legionnaires in some posts mistrust the Sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest fear they have is that we're going to try to take
over,'' Marsden said. ''But we're not. We're there to help them
with stuff they can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Esposito, grandson of a World War I bugler and member of
the Sons' National Executive Committee, said some legionnaires
underestimate the benefits of having a branch of the Sons at their
post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can tend bar for them, do all the maintenance, sweep the
parking lots. We can go to their house, cut their grass for them,''
said Esposito, 38, of Rockaway, N.J. ''A lot of these old-timers
don't see it that way. They think we just want their buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the Sons are in their 30s and 40s. Any male of
any age can join if directly descended from a soldier who served
during any of America's 20th century wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the few organizations you can belong to from birth
to death,'' said Edward's father, Thomas Marsden. He was enrolled
in the Sons as a 6-year-old by his stepfather, a Navy Seabee during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was growing up, it was a big thing to go with Dad to
the Legion post, and fix up stuff, sit around and bull with other
people,'' said Thomas Marsden, now 45.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I fell in love with -- the family aspect, the
patriotic aspect, helping the community. I brought my kids into the
Sons for the same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marsdens are three-generation Sons. Edward's 14-year-old
brother, Lukasz, is chaplain of the local squadron; two of their
nephews, 4-year-old Thomas Gray and 8-month-old Christopher Gray,
have been lifelong members.
</P>
<P>
   Edward first campaigned to be state commander in 1998, as a
14-year-old, and was defeated by an adult rival after incurring
some resentment over his age.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a disadvantage at times,'' he said. ''People would ask
if I was eligible to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran again in 1999, and prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's interesting is that I'm this young and doing something
that 40-year-old men want to do,'' Edward said. ''They look at me
as a cute kid and say, 'How the heck did he do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Age also has affected his relations with World War II veterans
he has met at Legion posts and VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them, they look back at the war, and they don't want
to say a thing about it,'' Edward said. ''I don't blame them...
They look at you and go, 'How can you know about the war when
you're only 16.' I tell them I've learned a lot through ROTC, the
Legion, Boy Scouts, and they almost understand.''
</P>
<P>
   One topic legionnaires are eager to discuss is Edward's future.
He hopes to go to the U.S. Naval Academy and then join the Marines;
his Legion friends from other service branches aren't shy in
suggesting alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The adjutant of the American Legion in New Jersey, Vietnam
veteran Ray Zawacki, has worked with Edward frequently over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good feeling to see kids like that,'' Zawacki said.
''More of America's youth should be involved in programs like
these.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marsden clan was out in force for a testimonial dinner March
11 celebrating Edward's year as state commander. Legion and Sons of
the Legion dignitaries, including some Edward befriended on his
many out-of-state trips, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the proudest person at the dinner was Edward's mother,
Pat, who says too many Americans have allowed patriotism to become
unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patriotism, and pride in one's country -- they don't just get
wished on you,'' she said. ''Our family is pretty hooked.''

<HEADLINE> Episcopal bishop takes a turn as a congressional intern  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thomas Shaw is not your average Capitol Hill
intern.
</P>
<P>
   He's a 54-year-old Episcopal bishop, leading a 90,000-strong
diocese in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who draws stares as he hustles around the Capitol in a
long black robe, a heavy crucifix hanging from his neck, is
believed to be the first clergyman to be a congressional intern.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to learn more about the role of religion in government
while working for Rep. Amo Houghton, a Republican from western New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to know how Washington works because I really want the
Episcopal church to have the most effective voice possible,'' Shaw
said, his calm, quiet tones almost drowned out by the clatter in
Houghton's office.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton and Shaw became friends 20 years ago when Houghton was
leading his family's Fortune 500 company, Corning Inc., which makes
glass and ovenware. Houghton, who once considered becoming an
Episcopalian priest, attended retreats in Cambridge, Mass., where
Shaw is a monk.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw eventually presided over the marriage of Houghton and his
wife Priscilla, joking that Houghton was the only Republican for
whom he had asked his congregation to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes me feel good, because you only pray for sinners,''
Houghton said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Houghton said Shaw approached him about coming
to Washington after last year's impeachment battle. He recalled his
reaction as, ''My gosh, that would be a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   He allows that Shaw is not treated like a typical intern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect him to open the mail and run errands,'' the
seven-term lawmaker said. ''I want to make sure he sees, hears and
rubs shoulders and is conversant with some of the issues we deal
with every day down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's interest in religion and politics isn't new. Early last
year, as the battle over President Clinton's impeachment raged in
Washington and bombs rained down over Kosovo, Shaw called Houghton
and asked how the church should respond.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up holding a vigil and dialogue attended by some 400
people at St. Paul's Cathedral in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were confused,'' Shaw said. ''It's always important for
Christians to come together and pray during times of great
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Houghton saw Clinton's impeachment as having deeply
religious themes -- sin, forgiveness and redemption. Houghton was
one of only a handful of Republicans who voted against impeachment,
pushing instead for a strongly worded censure.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton praised Shaw as the only church leader he knew who
would hold open discussions on hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church cannot just consider itself doing its job if it has
a solid congregation,'' Houghton said. ''It's got to reach out into
the world and relate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw started his job Feb. 17, about the time religion took
center stage in the Republican presidential primary, with John
McCain claiming Christian conservatives had too much influence in
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he ''doesn't put a lot of stock'' in the political
rhetoric involved in that debate. But he added he disagrees with
the focus that people in the Christian right place on issues like
prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think fundamentally whether we have prayer every day
in public schools is going to make a big difference in social
change in this country. I do think that if the government and the
churches were to join together to eradicate racism in this country
it would make a huge difference,'' said Shaw, who recently
accompanied Houghton to a civil rights march in Selma, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that march was Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. Lewis, a civil
rights activist, is co-chairman with Houghton of the Faith and
Politics Institute, a nonpartisan, interfaith group set up to
provide political leaders with opportunities for moral reflection
and spiritual community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what Amo is doing in having the bishop here is
tremendously important,'' Lewis said. ''The church needs to know
what's going on here in Washington. He will go home and spread that
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw will ends his month-long internship at the end of March and
will return to Boston. Until then, he is absorbing all he can,
especially on two issues dear to him: children living in poverty
and relief for the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to know what's happening in the world,'' Shaw said.
''That means we have to be out there in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Bangladesh Capital  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- President Clinton abruptly canceled
travel plans that would have taken him by helicopter to a village
in densely crowded, impoverished Bangladesh and instead delivered
encouragement for a young democracy and a multimillion dollar aid
package in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The first American president to ever visit this largely Muslim
country, Clinton received a 21-gun salute as he and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright arrived to a red-carpet greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy security was obvious, with many soldiers with rifles
standing alongside the airport runway, and closely spaced along the
route into town.
</P>
<P>
   A military band played the national anthems of both nations on a
bright, humid morning. And Clinton's motorcade route, as he
traveled to the office of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was lined
with thousands of uniformed school children, many waving small
American flags.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the visit, Clinton canceled the planned
centerpiece of his one-day trip to Bangladesh. The 90-minute trip
to the village of Joypura was billed as an opportunity to visit a
school for girls and a thriving ''microcredit'' lending operation
that makes small, targeted loans to entrepreneurs and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was scraped at the last minute on the advice of the
Secret Service. The White House cited a ''credible'' threat of
danger from flying over dense, unguarded forest and rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written for today's editions of the Times of
India, Clinton praised Bangladesh for ''making great strides
lifting citizens out of poverty, raising the status of women,
strengthening democracy, standing against terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began his six-day visit to South Asia -- a region
he has called ''perhaps the most dangerous in the world'' -- on
Sunday in New Delhi, India.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to India after today's visit to Bangladesh and will
spend most of the rest of the week there, stopping briefly in
Pakistan on his way out of the region.
</P>
<P>
   A possible short meeting on the way home in Geneva to meet with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to discuss the Israeli-Syrian peace
process is also under consideration, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first visit of an American president to the
predominantly Muslim country since it was created in 1971. Because
of a Cold War alignment with Pakistan, the United States originally
opposed the creation of Bangladesh, formerly known as East
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns arose almost as soon as Clinton arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Air Force One touched down in New Delhi, protesters
in the capital burned a cloth-and-straw effigy of the president. In
the northern region of Kashmir, police beat back separatists
seeking to reach New Delhi and draw attention to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, about 300 leftist students burned an effigy
of Clinton at Dhaka University to protest his visit. At least 15
students were injured in a clash with police.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist and Islamic groups believe Clinton's visit to Bangladesh
is an attempt to pressure the government to award lucrative deals
to American companies for gas and oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Although one of the world's poorest countries, Bangladesh is
rich in energy reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the Joypura visit, Clinton planned to meet in the
capital with Joypura villagers brought in by bus. He also canceled
a planned wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial honoring those who
died in the war of independence against Pakistan, an event that
also required a helicopter trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a package of new U.S. aid for the region. The
White House said the money includes $84 million over four years for
Bangladesh, India and Nepal to promote clean-energy projects; $97
million in food assistance for Bangladesh; and $6 million to help
protect Bangladesh's rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   On his visits to India and Pakistan, Clinton hoped to persuade
the world's two newest-declared powers to scale back their weapons
and missile programs and to sign an international test-ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, which has some nuclear power capability, ratified
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty earlier this month. Neither India
nor Pakistan have yet done so, although neither have the United
States, Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh plans to ask Clinton to forgive $700 million in U.S.
government loans.
</P>
<P>
   The country, which lies almost entirely on delta land, is one of
the world's most densely populated, with 125 million people packed
into an area the size of Wisconsin. It also faces the grim reality
of annual cyclones and floods that kill hundreds and wipe out crops
and homes. And feuding political parties hamstring economic
recovery by calling weeks of general strikes each year. The strikes
are intended to destabilize the government and force early
elections.

<HEADLINE> Sammy the Bull accused of giving up his new life to return to theold  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano is back
behind bars, and this time his family has gone down with him.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged along with his ex-wife, Debra, and children, Karen
and Gerard, with operating a drug ring that distributed the illegal
stimulant Ecstasy in Phoenix with the help of a posse of suburban
street punks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an opportunity to develop his own little crime family
in a place that had no organized crime,'' says Phoenix police
spokesman Jeff Halstead.
</P>
<P>
   For some mob experts, however, the idea that Gravano would
return to a life of crime is bewildering. That he would oversee a
family run drug gang is simply strange, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a killer and a gangster, but he was against drugs and
he always denigrated John Gotti and other gangsters who brought
their own children into the life of crime that he and Gotti
chose,'' says Jerry Capeci, author of three books on New York's
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to be someone who was smart enough, sharp enough,
savvy enough to make it without getting back into the life. And I
still haven't been convinced that it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the guy FBI agents and prosecutors had
fawned over, dubbing him ''the most significant witness in the
history of organized crime'' for testimony that led to 37 mob
convictions. Even the federal judge who sentenced Gravano thought
he detected a ''very significant change'' in him.
</P>
<P>
   Author Peter Maas, who interviewed Gravano dozens of times for
the bestseller ''Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life
in the Mafia,'' also believed Gravano had the tenacity and talent
to make it legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   He says that when he and Gravano last spoke at length, about a
year and a half ago, the former Mafioso chatted proudly of the life
he was creating in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he'd gotten a job as a laborer in a construction
outfit. He said, 'I want to learn how they do construction out
here.' That sounded like pure Gravano to me,'' Maas says. ''My
understanding was that he was doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was, for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, 55, served just five years in prison after admitting
his participation in 19 murders and testifying against Gotti, the
New York City-based boss of the Gambino crime family now in jail
for life. Gravano was released in 1995 and, under the alias Jimmy
Moran, relocated to Arizona by the Witness Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, the same year his life story hit bookstores,
Gravano dropped out of the program and settled into a modest
apartment in Tempe, Ariz., a college town in the Phoenix metroplex.
He found work in construction, a trade he'd learned during his New
York Mafia days. Eventually he started his own firm, Marathon
Development, and launched Creative Pools, a pool construction
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's wife had divorced him when he entered the Witness
Protection Program. ''I was never part of that part of your life,''
she said at the time, ''and I'm not going to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by 1996, Debra and daughter Karen had moved into a
4,400-square-foot house just nine miles from Gravano's apartment.
Their son, Gerard, also bought a house in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Debra, 46, opened an Italian restaurant. Gerard, 24, who shares
his father's stocky frame and cropped brown hair, began working for
Gravano, building and maintaining pools. Karen, 27, went to work as
the pool company's office manager and her fiance, David Seabrook,
also took a job there while living with her and their baby at her
mom's house.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the elder Gravano, only Gerard has a known criminal
record -- a 1999 conviction for trying to mail marijuana to a friend
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Gravano family was starting anew.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are hardworking people,'' says Gravano's lawyer, Larry
Hammond. ''This was a guy who was in search of -- and had largely
found -- a life in which he could do his own work and do it well.
Was he craving some kind of new underworld empire? I just think
that's utter fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Police call it fact, with one interesting twist.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't responsible for bringing his family into the drug
trade, they say. Rather, they allege that Gerard lured his dad back
into the life and brought his mother and sister along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Gerard had befriended 23-year-old
Michael Papa, a fellow New Yorker who began distributing Ecstasy at
dance parties in the Phoenix area in late 1998 or early 1999. Papa
allegedly bought the pills for $6-$8 apiece and sold them for as
much as $30. But his supply was limited, authorities say, because
of low capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gerard conveys the financial lucrativeness of this whole
scenario to Sammy,'' says Jim Molesa, spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano joined the scheme last fall, Molesa says, becoming the
brains and money behind the operation. Karen's boyfriend helped
Gerard and Papa with distribution, along with dozens of their
friends, while Debra and Karen were enlisted for bookkeeping,
Molesa says. And he alleges Debra's restaurant was used to launder
drug proceeds, while the women's home was used for storage.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gravano's direction, the ring brought in about $500,000 a
week, with Gravano receiving at least half, Molesa says. For his
assistance, he says, Papa received 15 percent of Gravano's
construction business, which became little more than a front for
the drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they found 13 pills believed to be Ecstasy in
Debra's house along with a suspected drug ledger indicating money
amounts and the word ''pills.'' Also seized were $93,000 in cash
and an arsenal of weapons, including three loaded handguns, a
shotgun, a rifle, a revolver in the master bedroom dresser and a
handgun in the family room.
</P>
<P>
   More pills were taken from Gerard's home, authorities said. In
Gravano's apartment, police found marijuana, a telephone voice
changer, three loaded handguns and $1,940. A bulletproof vest was
pulled from the trunk of his Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   The family members have pleaded innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's lawyer maintains his client ''had a strong bias
against drugs and the use of drugs.'' Furthermore, he says, Gravano
''had been the manager of perfectly appropriate businesses -- the
kind of businesses that most people would be proud to say were
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got news for you,'' Molesa counters. ''A crook is a
crook. And if they've got the opportunity to make a buck, they're
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra and Karen Gravano are free while awaiting trial. Gerard
Gravano remains jailed in lieu of $100,000 bond in a county jail.
Five miles away, on the maximum security floor of another jail,
Sammy Gravano sits alone in a 10-by-8 cell, unable to post his $5
million cash bond.
</P>

   The snitch who sang to the feds isn't talking to reporters.

<HEADLINE> 'Brockovich' Holds Court in Movies  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Add legal heavy-hitter to Julia Roberts' list
of box-office accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich,'' Roberts' drama about a pollution lawsuit,
premiered as the nation's top movie with $28.2 million in its
opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The sci-fi rescue thriller ''Mission to Mars,'' last weekend's
No. 1 movie, slipped to second place with $10.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The horror story ''Final Destination'' opened in third place
with $10.2 million. The movie is about a youth whose premonition
about an exploding plane saves himself and other passengers but
prompts the Grim Reaper to stalk them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' is based on the real-life story of a
California legal clerk who leads a crusade against Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric over tainted water.
</P>
<P>
   The role was a bit of a risk for Roberts. She has made a string
of romantic hits, including last year's ''Notting Hill'' and
''Runaway Bride,'' but has had trouble finding an audience in
dramas such as ''Mary Reilly'' or ''Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' drew critical praise and was marketed
wisely, with movie ads highlighting the humor and sharp tongue of
Roberts' character.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no surprise when Julia Roberts is No. 1 at the box
office, given her track record,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie
admissions. ''This proves why she's the top female draw, right now,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in 2,847 cinemas, the movie averaged an impressive
$9,905 a theater, compared with $3,562 in 3,060 theaters for
''Mission to Mars'' and $3,943 in 2,587 theaters for ''Final
Destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film also minimizes the
courtroom drama and keeps the focus on Roberts, who plays an
impoverished, lowbrow mother of three who cusses constantly and
wears sexy outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a superstar, and this is what superstars are all
about,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal,
which released ''Erin Brockovich.'' ''People like her not only in
romantic pictures, but she can take a true story like this and turn
it into pure entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars continued to boost business for ''American Beauty,''
which crossed the $100 million mark. It took in $2.9 million for a
total of $102.7 million. That was up nearly $28 million since
''American Beauty'' scored a leading eight Oscar nominations on
Feb. 15, including best picture, actor and actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cider House Rules,'' with a best picture nod and six other
nominations, added $2.4 million this weekend and has grossed $45.7
million, double its take before the Academy Award nominations came
out.
</P>
<P>
   Another best picture nominee, ''The Sixth Sense,'' was expected
to pass ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and become one of the 10
top-grossing movies of all time soon after next Sunday's Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sixth Sense'' took in $1.2 million over the weekend,
putting its 33-week total at $288.4 million. That was up about $9
million since the Oscar nominations and just $2 million shy of the
gross for ''The Empire Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $28.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Mission to Mars,'' $10.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Final Destination,'' $10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''My Dog Skip,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Ninth Gate,'' $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''American Beauty,'' $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Cider House Rules,'' $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Snow Day,'' $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''The Tigger Movie,'' $1.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Town Slowly Dying  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMELLE, Ala. (AP) -- This tiny town is dying, but not for the
reason many expected.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Emelle was ground zero in a controversy over the
sprawling hazardous waste landfill just outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the landfill would poison the entire region if it
leaked, slowly wiping out life. The TV show ''60 Minutes'' paid a
visit, along with legislators, other leaders and activists. A
former state attorney general dubbed the site ''America's pay
toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental outrage didn't succeed in closing what was then
known as the nation's largest hazardous waste dump, but a state tax
and a series of federal regulations decimated business during the
'90s, wiping out nearly 340 jobs. Most of the trucks that used to
roll north along Alabama 17 to the dump quit coming.
</P>
<P>
   The change has all but killed Emelle, population 63, located in
rural west Alabama just a few miles from the Mississippi state
line.
</P>
<P>
   The only grocer retired a couple of years ago and no one opened
a new store. An old gas station sits empty with a ''For Sale'' sign
in the window. City Hall -- a stucco building paid for with
hazardous waste dumping fees -- is locked and virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you run out of gas here, you're out of gas,'' said resident
Rosie Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of business at the Waste Management-owned landfill,
which opened in 1977, was good for the town environmentally,
according to postmaster Janet Hutcherson.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way to replace the lost jobs, because Emelle
proper doesn't have a single business. Most people work at least 15
miles away in York or Livingston, or even farther away in
Tuscaloosa or Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt a lot of people,'' said Hutcherson.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill manager Rodger Henson has been at the facility since it
was known by its old name, Chemical Waste Management, a now-closed
division of Waste Management. Employment that peaked at 420 is down
to 83.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been great to have the business without the
controversy, but that didn't happen,'' said Henson.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, the landfill took in nearly 800,000 tons of
hazardous waste annually. The site is safe, Henson says; there has
never been a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Jimmy Evans, who used the ''pay toilet''
nickname, investigated the landfill and tried to get it closed, but
the effort failed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only 120,000 tons a year are now buried at the
landfill, a decline of about 85 percent from earlier. Henson
attributes the drop primarily to a $51-a-ton fee that legislators
imposed in 1991 on most waste buried there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the highest tax of any facility like ours in the whole
land,'' said Henson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tax increase, declining tonnage meant less state
revenue. The landfill generated $35 million in taxes for the state
in the 1991 budget year, but less than $1.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law also changed. Companies were required in the early
'90s to reduce the amount of hazardous waste they produced, and
other regulations barred companies from dumping materials that once
were commonly buried at Emelle, such as solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Bradley has served three terms on the City Council in part
because no one else will run and worries about what will become of
her town. She hopes the landfill holds tight and keeps its deadly
contents away from her children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jobs or not, we're stuck with that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Hit by Yet More Flooding  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A river in northern Mozambique burst
its banks after a week of torrential rain, adding to the
devastation caused by weeks of floods in other parts of the
impoverished southeast African country.
</P>
<P>
   The flooded Messalo River in Gabo Delgado province severed the
main road 70 miles from the Tanzanian border on Sunday, said
Silvano Langa, head of the country's national disaster management
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my knowledge no lives are at immediate risk, but crops have
been lost,'' he said. No further details of the extent of the
damage were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Langa expected the level of the normally tiny river to subside
as soon as the rains stopped. He said that until then people living
north of the river would be cut off from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flooding completed a picture of devastation in
Mozambique, where the north had been the only region of the country
spared since rivers began to overflow in early February. The
government has confirmed that 492 people died in the floods, but
more bodies could be found as flood waters recede.
</P>
<P>
   Langa said rising water levels in the central Save and Buzi
districts -- already hard hit -- were again a cause for concern, but
because most people already evacuated their homes for higher ground
last month, not many people were thought to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   There were also worries about rising flood waters in the
southern Limpopo and Komati river basins after heavy rains fell
along the rivers' upstream reaches in neighboring South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Weather Bureau forecast more light showers
over Mozambique and neighboring countries to the west before an
expected clearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as the British military began a phased withdrawal
of helicopters flying aid to hundreds of thousands of flood victims
in southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies hope to secure commercially owned helicopters and
aircraft to deliver food as other foreign militaries scale down
their relief operations.
</P>
<P>
   While trucks were increasingly being used to get food to an
estimated 360,000 flood victims housed in aid camps, helicopters
were still needed in areas where roads washed away by the floods
made movement of relief supplies impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The World Food Program will this week launch a special
operating appeal to the international community to contribute
civilian aircraft to distribute relief beyond the end of March,''
said Abby Spring, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a massive multinational aid effort to feed flood
victims, thousands of Mozambicans were still going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, scores of children with swollen bellies and orange
hair -- symptoms of malnutrition -- were seen among the several
hundred residents of a makeshift camp near the southern town of
Macia.
</P>
<P>
   The camp was set up in early February and is accessible by road
from the capital, Maputo, 50 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were being fed Sunday, and a church group from the
South African town of Nelspruit arrived in a convoy of
4-wheel-drive vehicles and distributed bread, corn and other
supplies.

<HEADLINE> Galilee Awaits Arrival of Pope  </HEADLINE>
By HUGH A. MULLIGAN, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   TABGHA, Israel (AP) -- A few days before Pope John Paul II's
visit, fishermen on the Sea of Galilee dropped off a half dozen
huge catfish at the Franciscan monastery hugging the shore.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't approach the miraculous catch that Peter hauled in
here at the Lord's bidding in the gospel story, but Father Jerome
was delighted, and so was his all-white cat, Bianco.
</P>
<P>
   ''These fishermen don't eat catfish because the Jews deem them
unclean,'' said the friar from Ghana, carving barbecue-size cutlets
with a long knife. ''They are very kind and know we will enjoy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Jerome is custodian of the shrine of the Primacy of
Peter, where in John's gospel the risen Christ cooked a fish
breakfast over a charcoal fire for his disciples and conferred the
leadership of his church on the fisherman who became the first
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of German pilgrims gathered at the rock called the
''Table of Christ'' where in 1964 photographers with police in wet
pursuit plunged into the lake to capture Paul VI on his knees in
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now a third pope, proclaiming the third Christian millennium,
would soon be visiting the holy sites in Galilee, recalling so many
of the teachings and miracles attributed to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are nervous, but we will be ready,'' another Franciscan,
busy painting the gate at the traditional site of Peter's house in
Capernaum, called down from a stepladder.
</P>
<P>
   A guide in a brown cowled habit told pilgrims from San Francisco
one of those playful irreverent jokes that friars love to
jump-start their audience's attention: ''Here the Lord cured St.
Peter's mother-in-law, then he immediately left home to follow
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests in hard hats and Roman collars running around with
clipboards seemed quite nervous at the altar site above the Mount
of Beatitudes where John Paul II was scheduled to celebrate an
outdoor Mass for an estimated 100,000 faithful on Friday. A few
days before, a canvas roof had collapsed, and work fell behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In the gospel story, Christ fled here to escape the crowds
hoping to see him perform a miracle. It was on this lovely
hillside, now blooming with the first approach of spring in the
Holy Land, that he told his disciples the meek would inherit the
earth, the poor the kingdom of heaven, that mourners would be
comforted and the hungry filled.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog vendor Danny Laghan, who immigrated to Israel 10 years
ago from Woodmere, Long Island, concerned himself with filling
hungry construction workers. ''You bet, I'd like to see the Pope,''
he enthused. ''For free, I'll serve him a real kosher hot dog,
blessed by a higher authority. Others pay seven shekels ($1.75).
He's a good man, this pope, a man of peace. Shalom to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny lives with his wife and three children in new housing in
the nearby ancient village of Korazim, which Jesus denounced in
Matthew's gospel for failing to repent after witnessing him cure
the blind and the sick.
</P>
<P>
   All throughout the Holy Land, the past and present seem to meld
into a seamless garment woven millennia ago by ordinary people. In
Nazareth, at the top of a winding narrow lane in the souk, the Arab
market, a whining buzz saw proclaimed the premises of the carpenter
Waleed Daher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make fine furniture of oak and mahogany for the high society
of Nazareth, whoever has the shekels,'' he boasted with a laugh.
His business is just a few steps from St. Joseph's monastery, built
over the site where tradition holds that Joseph had his carpentry
shop when Jesus was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Waleed complained that there used to be dozens of carpenters in
the souk, making ''blue baby cradles for tourists,'' but rising
rents have driven them out in favor of upscale fashion boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The noon angelus bell rang out from the Basilica of the
Annunciation, where on Saturday the Pope will celebrate Mass on the
feast day of the Angel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she was to
be the mother of God.
</P>
<P>
   At exactly the same instant, loudspeakers over a nearby mosque
called Muslims to midday prayer, reminding the Christian tourists
that Nazareth in Galilee, the boyhood home of Jesus, is a
predominantly Arab city. Controversy has flared after Israeli
authorities gave permission to build a new mosque almost in front
of what is considered the largest Christian church in the Middle
East and one of the most sacred Christian shrines.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks crackling in the narrow streets were not for the
papal visit, but for the four-day Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican flags hang from Nazareth's many convents and pilgrim
guesthouses, but the banner across Paul VI Street, Nazareth's main
thoroughfare named for his visit here in 1964, does not welcome
John Paul II. It was left hanging from a strike of municipal
garbage collectors who had not been paid in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Business is very bad,'' complained street peddler Saleh
Qumsieh, selling head scarfs, ''just like Mary wore,'' and
''genuine shepherds' flutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We ordered T-shirts with the Pope's picture, but none have
arrived yet,'' he said. ''My brother-in-law already is selling them
in the market in Amman. In this country, you need a miracle just to
do business.''

<HEADLINE> Mission Celebrates Swallow Return  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) -- The famous swallows were few
and far between, but tourists were out in force to hear the mission
bells ring and celebrate the birds' annual return.
</P>
<P>
   Only six of the white-breasted birds swooped through the grounds
of the crumbling Mission San Juan Capistrano on Sunday as an
estimated 20,000 watched the birds wing back from their winter home
in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to see the birds, we want to see the birds. Were
they here yesterday?'' asked John Grottodden, 27, an engineer from
Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers welcomed the crowds because admission fees and
revenues from T-shirts and snow cones will help fund a
rehabilitation project, underway since 1991 and still $4 million
short of its $10 million goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials blame scaffolding that rings much of the
building and the construction crews that labor there for a scarcity
of swallows in recent years, though they insist the birds can still
be spotted at dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Mission administrators also blame a southern Orange County
development boom for pushing the swallows out of their natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tried to coax the birds Sunday by scattering ladybugs
on the mission's rose bushes and by making mud puddles -- ''swallow
wallows'' -- for nest-building. They also built fake ceramic nests
to trick the birds into thinking there were friends nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that in the early years of the mission, which was
constructed in 1776 and nearly destroyed by an earthquake in 1812,
untold thousands of swallows blackened the skies around St.
Joseph's day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope that when the rehabilitation project is complete
two or three years from now, the birds will return in larger
numbers. And they have faith that the birds will never stop coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a strange phenomenon of nature that they really do head
back to Capistrano,'' said Gerald J. Miller, mission administrator.
''They've been doing it for thousands of years.''

<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Holly Holland scored 21 points and Deanna
Jackson added 20 as Alabama-Birmingham built a big second-half lead
and held on to upset Mississippi State 78-72 Sunday night in the
West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Lady Blazers (21-12) will play No. 2 Rutgers in
the regional semifinals in Portland next Saturday. UAB had never
won an NCAA women's tournament game before this year.
</P>
<P>
   LaToya Thomas, the nation's top-scoring freshman in the regular
season at nearly 21 points per game, led third-seeded Mississippi
State (24-8) with 26 points, but fouled out with 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs were bigger and faster, but were hurt by foul
trouble. Second-leading scorer Jennifer Fambrough picked up her
fourth foul just 2:06 into the second half and played a total of 12
minutes, scoring five points.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who scored a career-high 32 in Friday's 80-79 overtime
win over sixth-seeded Oregon, started slowly but used her long arms
to get shots over Thomas in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Her baseline drive, followed by Holland's 3-pointer, finished an
11-0 run and put the Blazers ahead 60-41 with 8:05 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs rallied, getting within 70-65 on a layup by Angela
Harris with a minute left. But the Blazers hit their free throws
and held onto the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Holland matched Thomas with 12 points in the first half as UAB
took a 39-28 lead. Holland also played solid defense and helped
feed Jackson and center Michelle Smith in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   A turnaround jumper by Thomas pulled Mississippi State to 23-21,
but Jackson's sister, Lisa, started an 8-0 run with a short jumper,
two free throws and a 3-pointer to push the lead to 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Smith added 17 points for UAB, which shot 58 percent from the
field, and Deanna Jackson had 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had 17 points for the Lady Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Blazers played in front of more people the past two
games at McArthur Court than they did all season in Birmingham. The
two-session attendance was 10,510, while the Blazers drew 9,085 in
12 home games at Bartow Arena.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Shepherd had 19 points, including five 3-pointers in her
second straight big NCAA tournament game, as the Lady Lions
advanced to the Midwest Regional semifinals with a 75-69 win over
Auburn on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really shows the growth of what these kids have been able
to do,'' Penn State coach Rene Portland said. ''To go from nothing
(in 1997) to the NIT champions (in 1998) to the second-round last
year, and now to the regionals -- that's what they're supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Penn State was 15-12, tied for sixth in the Big Ten and

   Third-seeded Iowa State (27-5) fell behind by eight points early
and was down 11 in the second half before finally finding the
shooting touch that has made the Cyclones one of the best offensive
teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Then they pulled away from the sixth-seeded Illini (23-11) in
the final 4{ minutes.

</P>
<P>
   The Colonials got Notre Dame's All-American center Ruth Riley
into foul trouble early but did little else right.

semifinals for the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's (25-6), the seventh seed, shot 23 percent and made
just 13 field goals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Younger Sorenstam Wins at Phoenix  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Forget what you hear about those emotionless
Swedes. There were plenty of tears when Charlotta Sorenstam won her
first LPGA tournament at the Standard Register Ping.
</P>
<P>
   And she did it Sunday by beating arguably the two best golfers
in the world -- her sister Annika and Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was solid as a rock,'' Webb said. ''I just hope she takes
it easy on herself now. She knows she can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's bid to become the first in 22 years to win four
consecutive LPGA tournaments died in a sand trap on the 16th hole.
Before her loss, she had won all four tournaments she entered this
year -- three LPGA events and the non-tour Ladies Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta Sorenstam, at 26 three years younger than her more
famous sister, pulled away from a tie after 15 holes to defeat Webb
by two strokes. Charlotta wrapped it up with a 15-foot birdie putt
on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to do it in style,'' she said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Then Charlotta burst into tears, first hugging her father Tom,
then Annika, who also brushed away a tear as she walked off the
green. There were hugs from Charlotta's husband and from her
in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The hug from mother will have to wait. She is to arrive from
Sweden later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''She played awesome,'' Annika said, still crying. ''I'm so
proud of her. She's always been in my shadow, and now she broke
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta, who lives in nearby Scottsdale, shot a 4-under-par 68
in the final round for a 72-hole total of 12-under 276 on the
sun-baked course at The Legacy Golf Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Webb was 2-under 70 on Sunday to finish at 10-under-par 278.
Annika Sorenstam, who started the day tied for the lead with her
sister and Webb, was a distant third at 7-under 281 after a
final-round 73.
</P>
<P>
   Webb needed to win two more in a row to tie the record of five
straight set by Nancy Lopez in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed a little bit about that, especially for the
LPGA,'' Webb said, ''but I'm not going to have near as much
attention next week, so I might be able to concentrate a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta, known by her family as ''Lotta,'' said that while the
victory is wonderful, she knows her sister will always be the more
famous of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never felt I've been in her shadow, but I guess I've been
and I'm always going to be,'' she said. ''No matter how many
tournaments I win, I'm always going to be her sister. There's no
way around that. I don't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Charlotta was sorry to see Webb's streak end, because
if it kept going, it would bring Tiger Woods-like attention to the
women's tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be nice for Karrie to win because she would
match Tiger,'' Charlotta said, ''but I wanted to stop her, though.
That's what I thought, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, the defending Standard Register champion, hit her tee shot
within 2 feet of the pin on the par-3, 165-yard 15th for a birdie
to pull even with Charlotta at 11-under with three holes to play.
It could have been worse. Charlotta was in the bunker on the 15th,
but hit a great shot out of the sand to save par.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-4, 389-yard 16th, Webb hit her second shot into the
bunker behind the green. On her shot out of the sand, she shanked
it badly, leaving it on the fringe some 40 feet from the hole. She
got down in two for a bogey, while Charlotta sank a tricky 8-foot
putt for par to take a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th, Webb hit her second shot into the sand, but
recovered nicely to leave herself just 16 feet for a birdie. She
missed the putt, and Charlotta made hers to cinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the two tied with three holes to play, the odds seemed to
favor Webb, who is far more experienced in such pressure
situations. Just last month, she tied Annika Sorenstam with a
birdie on the 18th hole at the Hawaii Ladies Open, then beat her
with a birdie on the 18th again in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Charlotta didn't crumble in the clutch, and it was Webb who
made the fatal error.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I should have been feeling more pressure,'' Charlotta
said. ''But I just felt like we were playing match play, the two of
us. I'm surprised I kept it together.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Finds a New Way To Win  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The thrilling playoff in Hawaii. The
spectacular comeback in Pebble Beach. By those standards, Tiger
Woods' victory in the Bay Hill Invitational was a snoozer.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it was any less spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Going head-to-head against the No. 4 player in the world, Woods
put on a clinic Sunday and whipped Davis Love III by four strokes,
matching Woods' largest margin of victory since his 12-stroke romp
in the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember how he used to grade himself? He about an A-minus
right now, every week,'' said Love, who also finished four back in
the Tour Championship. ''I might go next week and shoot 15-under
and win, but he's been doing it week after week after week after
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mentally, right now, he's got the advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a tight swing, he still hits it farther than most -- 36
yards longer than Love on one hole. He has a 2-iron that he rips
off the tee with alarming precision and the distance of most
players' driver. He has control of his distance with his approach
shots. He has a short game to die for.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he has so many victories, 18 overall in a career that
began just under four years ago, and 10 of those coming since in
the last 10 months. What Woods really wants is another green
jacket, and that will have to wait a couple of week.
</P>
<P>
   But he is certainly headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't make a bogey in the final 34 holes under tough,
tricky winds at Bay Hill. He led by at least two strokes from start
to finish and wound up with a 2-under 70, a serviceable score that
turned out to be all he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm heading in the right direction for Augusta,''
Woods said. ''Hopefully, my game is peaking towards that.
Hopefully, next week I'll have some signs that I'm actually playing
a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   That can't be good news for the rest of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Woods now has won 10 times in his last 16 PGA Tour events, and
he has won 23.7 percent of his starts since turning pro in August
1996. He also hasn't finished lower than 18th in a stroke-play
event in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of fun to go out there and compete and know that
you have a chance to win the tournament,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks from experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 13th consecutive time on tour, and 15th time around
the world, that Woods had at least a share of the 54-hole lead and
went on to win. It also was the third straight time since November
he faced Love and experienced little pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured if I could go out there and stay away from the big
number and just make a lot of pars, that would put a little
pressure on Davis,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Love started the day two strokes behind and never got any
closer. He birdied the 18th hole for a 2-under 72 and finished
second in Arnold Palmer's tournament for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Kendall had a 67 and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   The final round was essentially match play between Woods and
Love, and the result was about as resounding as when Woods beat him
5 and 4 in the semifinals of the Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes turned into a 5-stroke advantage after just four
holes. Love made bogey from the bunker, another bogey when his
approach bounced into the rocks guarding the water, and what felt
like a bogey when he couldn't make birdie on the par-5 fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just making silly mistakes,'' said Love, who has gone
nearly two years without winning. ''You're not going to beat Tiger
Woods playing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to beat Woods is to play like him.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a tough lie in the rough on the first hole, his
delicate chip ran over the lip, and he made the 6-footer coming
back for par. And he made no serious blunders after that.
</P>
<P>
   Love's last hope came after birdies on the 10th and 11th cut the
lead to two, but he found the bunker on the 12th hole with a 3-iron
and couldn't get up-and-down to match Woods' birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my chance,'' Love said. ''And I didn't take advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods earned $540,000, pushing his season total to over $2.5
million, which is more anyone made all of last year except for him
and David Duval. He goes to The Players Championship this week, his
final event before the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will be thinking about Augusta. He's been thinking about
the next major ever since the new year started.
</P>
<P>
   It obviously hasn't been that big of distraction.

<HEADLINE> Maier Wins 4 Titles at World Cup  </HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORMIO, Italy (AP) -- Hermann Maier led an Austrian domination of
World Cup titles, becoming only the third skier in Alpine ski
history to win four crowns in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a terrific skier, who still can win a lot in the coming
years,'' said three-time Olympic champion Alberto Tomba, who won
his only World Cup overall title and two discipline titles in the
cup finals here in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Maier, who found international fame only three years ago, has
already captured two Olympic golds and two world titles.
</P>
<P>
   In Bormio, he clinched his second World Cup overall crown in
three years, along with the downhill, super-G and giant slalom
titles.
</P>
<P>
   He equaled the four World Cup titles in one season set by ski
greats Jean-Claude Killy and Pirmin Zurbriggen.
</P>
<P>
   Maier also became the first skier ever to reach 2,000 points in
the overall World Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
   Maier, whose aggressive and fearless style sometimes resulted in
spectacular spills, said he was especially proud of his first cup
title in downhill, the most beloved discipline in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Maier finished second to teammate Hannes Trinkl in Wednesday's
speed race, collecting the points he needed to fight off a comeback
attempt by Italy's Kristian Ghedina.
</P>
<P>
   In the super-G, dominated by Austrian skiers throughout the
season, Maier collected four wins in seven races.
</P>
<P>
   In giant slalom, he had three wins and two second places, but
captured the title by only three points, ahead of teammate
Christian Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   Without Maier, slalom specialist Benjamin Raich led a 1-2-3
Austrian show of the giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian women also had their share of glory, adding three more
titles to Austria's loot.
</P>
<P>
   Renate Goetschl captured the super-G and overall titles,
succeeding injured teammate Alexandra Meissnitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Michaela Dorfmeister, second to Goetschl overall, took the giant
slalom title as Austria grabbed seven crystal globes out of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Regina Hauesl beat Goetschl by only five points for
the women's downhill crown.
</P>
<P>
   Haeusl fell in the finish line area and broke her right leg
after capturing decisive points for a ninth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The slalom titles both escaped Austria's clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian veteran Kjetil Andre Aamodt, a speed specialist who
developed a winning technique between the gates, took the men's
globe and Slovenian Spela Pretnar took the women's.
</P>
<P>
   The last women's slalom of the season threw back into the
limelight American Kristina Koznick, who won her second consecutive
World Cup race following a slow season start.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old skier from Burnsville, Minn., had an impressive
4-2-1-1 finish in the last events, but could not match Pretnar's
winning total of 645 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Slovenian woman had four season wins.
</P>
<P>
   Two other U.S. wins were earned by Daron Rahlves in consecutive
downhills at Kvitfjell in February.
</P>
<P>
   The American downhiller placed 10th in the discipline standings
behind seven Austrians, Italy's Ghedina and Canada's Ed Podivinsky.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Mark Langston Retires  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Mark Langston had a bad game for the final time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The four-time All-Star allowed four runs in the seventh inning
of the Cleveland Indians' 10-9 loss to the Kansas City Royals on
Sunday, giving up a three-run homer to Mike Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Langston then borrowed a cell phone from teammate Chuck Finley
and called his wife to tell her he is retiring after 16 seasons in
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relief from the standpoint I know I gave it my all, but
the sadness is leaving what you love,'' said Langston, who allowed
12 earned runs in nine innings during six appearances this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love going out and competing. Physically, I feel good. I
pushed it all the way to the end. It just didn't work out between
the white lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A seven-time Gold Glove, Langston finished with a 179-158 record
and 3.97 ERA in 16 seasons with Seattle, Montreal,
California-Anaheim, San Diego and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, Mike Sweeney homered twice and drove in
five runs for Kansas City, but also committed a pair of
first-inning errors at first base in the game at Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar, a six-time All-Star, was struck on the top of the
head by Carlos Beltran's backswing in the fifth, but sustained only
a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City outfielder Todd Dunwoody badly sprained his right
ankle while trying for a diving catch of Roberto Alomar's fly to
shallow center in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, Venezuela, John Rocker was booed when he waved his
cap to the crowd before the Atlanta Braves' 6-4 loss to Tampa Bay
in the finale of a two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't blame them,'' the controversial reliever said. ''I
said many foolish things, and it is fair that a lot of people are
mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, suspended for the first two weeks of the season by
commissioner Bud Selig for disparaging foreigners, homosexuals and
minorities in a magazine interview, was visibly affected by the
crowd's disdain.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd booed, he lowered his gaze and put his cap back
on. Still, he was taking the reaction in stride.
</P>
<P>
   When four enthusiastic children approached him requesting
autographs on their baseballs, Rocker said, ''Things like this
encourage me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One day,'' he said, ''I'll be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said his performance Saturday, when he allowed five of
six batters to reach base and allowed three of Tampa Bay's five
runs, was not caused by the booing. He said he is having trouble
with his grip two outings into the spring.

   In Mesa, Ariz., Kerry Wood's reconstructed right elbow was given
an OK by Dr. Michael Schafer. On Saturday, Wood started for the
first time since reconstructive elbow surgery last April, giving up
one hit in one inning against a Chicago White Sox split squad.

<HEADLINE> Toy Effects on Children Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Rock 'n' Roll Ernie looks cool with his shades and
leather coat. And as advertised, the stuffed toy based on the
Sesame Street character also bangs out a tune or two when you push
the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   But Wheelock College education professor Diane Levin says Rock
'n' Roll Ernie isn't such a great toy. He was created specifically
to rock, she said, so kids don't stretch their imaginations and get
bored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the analysis, Ernie is a huge seller.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, about 150 academics, toy marketers and
retailers gathered at Wheelock for what organizers said was the
first-ever conference for those who sell toys and those who study
the effects toys have on kids.
</P>
<P>
   By discussing such topics as Ernie's apparent contradictions,
organizers hoped to narrow the gulf between researchers and the toy
industry.
</P>
<P>
   They also hoped to get both sides thinking about how play
affects a child's development, how toys influence play and how to
create more toys that will be both educational and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there can be an intersection,'' said Robin Sayetta,
who markets the Discovery Channel's Exploration toy line.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Playing for Keeps 2000'' conference was conceived by
Wheelock professor Edgar Klugman and John Lee, founder of Learning
Curve International, which sells developmental toys.
</P>
<P>
   Lee on Saturday compared toy researchers and sellers to two
groups on opposite sides of a playground who never interact,
despite common interests.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that has to change. Toys are relentlessly
advertised, and parents often aren't able to screen what ads their
children are seeing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, neither parents nor toy makers always
appreciate how important play is to a child's development.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, building toys with Legos allow kids to conceive
projects, solve problems and improvise. But toys such as Ernie,
which are based on TV characters, direct kids toward conclusions
that fit the framework of the show, and don't allow their minds to
stretch. Violent toys can be worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In her talk, Levin demonstrated a wrestling doll for ages four
and up that begs for mercy when you twist its arm and complains
when you smash its nose.
</P>
<P>
   A segment by anti-toy violence activist Daphne White featured
guns galore and a deadly toy worm, intended for all ages, whose
packaging promises the user can ''wreak havoc on your enemy in a
game of revenge and mean-minded cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   White said that's how children learn to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really saturating our kids' world with violence,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Public concern over youth violence has opened doors for
discussion with toy manufacturers. And concern about corporate
responsibility has proven that environmentally or socially
conscious products will sell, said Patrick Rafter, spokesman for
the Waltham-based online toy vendor toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   But as activists clamor for changes, Sayetta said they need to
remember that toy companies must make profits, and not all would
agree on the dangers of toys such as the complaining wrestling
doll.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she said, concessions can't be one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the beginning of a dialogue,'' Sayetta said.
''Maybe this is just putting it on the radar screen.''

<HEADLINE> Flames 3, Oilers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The Calgary Flames fell behind early,
and looked to be on their way to their seventh consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Flames fought back from a two-goal deficit and beat
the Edmonton Oilers 3-2 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so early in the game that we felt we wouldn't have any
trouble coming back,'' Calgary's Jason Wiemer said. ''Obviously,
the way things have been going lately, it could've been 'Here we go
again.' But it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiemer scored at 8:09 of the third period, capping the Flames'
comeback in a game that featured five power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Wiemer back-handed a rebound over the pad of Edmonton goalie
Tommy Salo on a power play after Salo stopped Phil Housley's shot
from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Hamrlik opened the scoring for Edmonton 2:48 into the
game, his 100th point as an Oiler, and Ryan Smyth extended the lead
63 seconds later with his 100th NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we needed this game tonight,'' Calgary's Jarome Iginla
said. ''Being down 2-0, nobody hung their heads on the bench and we
got a big bounce at the end of the first.''
</P>
<P>
   That bounce was Robyn Regehr's point shot that went in off
Edmonton defenseman Igor Ulanov with just four seconds remaining in
the opening period to tie it 2-2. Iginla scored Calgary's first
goal at 12:55 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both units were getting shots through and creating chances,''
said Iginla, who has 35 points in his last 26 games. ''We found
ways to get it to the net. They got two power-play goals too, but
our penalty-killing came up big at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers couldn't capitalize with a man-advantage late in the
third, and were denied by Flames goalie Fred Brathwaite with Salo
on the bench in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary has won three straight against Edmonton and leads the
season series 4-1-0. The victory gave the Flames 71 points, five
behind San Jose for eighth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers failed to gain ground on the idle Colorado Avalanche,
who lead Edmonton by two points in the Northwest Division
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely think we let up on them,'' Edmonton's Bill Guerin
said. ''Our intensity level dropped right off and we didn't get it
back until the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some reason, we always come up lame against them. They've
got a gritty hockey team, so if you lay back they're going to beat
you.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Village Visit Canceled  </HEADLINE>
By PARVEEN AHMED, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nearly 50 flights were disrupted at the
international airport, the capital's main roads were closed all day
and villagers who planned to show President Clinton around their
town instead had to travel to the capital city to see him.
Clinton's side trip to the village was scrapped out of concern for
his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 12,000 policemen, soldiers and paramilitary troops in
green camouflage stood on rooftops and every 30 feet or so along
the streets where Clinton's motorcade passed.
</P>
<P>
   American and Bangladeshi military jets roared over the capital
Sunday on practice runs, generating sonic booms and a protest from
the Mayor Mohammad Hanif.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties concerned should not make the people frightened by
such bangs without prior notice,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Bangladeshis found alternate ways into the city
after police declared main roads off-limits except to those with
special security passes. Doctors at Bangabundu Medical University
Hospital on the motorcade route were given passes allowing them to
drive to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have taken Sunday and Monday off as I live on the other side
of town and have to go all around the city to get to work,'' said
Arif Ahmed, who works for a bank in the city center. Some companies
told their employees to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first visit by an American president to this
impoverished, tropical nation, which has had a democratic
government since 1991 after a history of military coups and
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Airport authorities said 46 domestic and international flights
would be delayed during Clinton's landing and takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of leftist parties, opposed to U.S. world trade and
economic policies, planned two demonstrations on Monday, neither of
them near Clinton's route. Students marched several times around
the campus of the University of Dhaka, and leftists said they would
gather to protest at a memorial to the Bangla language.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Clinton's arrival, the White House canceled a
major event of his Bangladesh visit, a trip to the village of
Joypura, to view the results of lending to small enterprises
including dairy production and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter landing pad had been constructed at the edge of the
village and a stage erected near a 100-year-old banyan tree.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said security experts had
raised concerns about Clinton's visit to the village, 20 miles from
the capital. Another U.S. official said there were fears the secret
Service could not guarantee the president's safety if he flew over
dense, tropical forest en route to the village.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers have not detailed any specific threat to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 villagers were bused to the capital, instead, to meet
Clinton at the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand Clinton was also interested in seeing the village
but I don't know why the visit has been canceled,'' said Muhammad
Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank and a lending program that has been
copied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first reaction was, ''I can't go to the villagers and face
them and tell them Clinton is not coming here.''

Clinton Visits Bangladesh Capital

<P>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- President Clinton abruptly canceled travel plans
that would have taken him by helicopter to a village in densely crowded,
impoverished Bangladesh and instead delivered encouragement for a young
democracy and a multimillion dollar aid package in the capital city. The first
American president to ever visit this largely Muslim country, Clinton received a
21-gun salute as he and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived to a
red-carpet greeting. Heavy security was obvious, with many soldiers with rifles
standing alongside the airport runway, and closely spaced along the route into

prosecutors to make wartime sexual assault one of the most grievous and
punishable crimes under international law. Radomir Kovac, Dragoljub Kunarac and
Zoran Vukovic are charged with up to 50 counts of rape, torture, enslavement and
outrages upon personal dignity in the Foca case, named after the southeastern

<HEADLINE> Ala. Mulls Chemical Castration Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PHILLIP RAWLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama lawmakers are considering making
their state the ninth to pass legislation that would allow child
molesters to be chemically castrated as a means of keeping them
from repeating their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon
and Wisconsin already have chemical castration laws on the books.
Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman has been pushing for a similar law every
year since California became the first state in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Under Siegelman's legislation, a judge could order chemical
castration as a condition of probation or parole for a person
convicted a first time for the rape, sodomy, sexual torture or
first-degree sexual abuse of a child under 13. Offenders also could
choose surgical castration instead.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical castration would be mandatory for offenders seeking
probation or parole for a second offense, and those who still pose
a threat at the end of probation or parole would have to keep
taking chemical castration treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments involve taking shots of Depo-Provera, a birth
control treatment for women that reduces testosterone levels -- and
usually sexual desire -- in men. State officials estimate the cost
at $2,400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sex offenders would pay the tab if they could afford it. If not,
the state parole board would cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for crime victims are giving the bill mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Shehane, director of Victims of Crime and Leniency,
considers it worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly don't think it's going to cure all of the ills by
any stretch of the imagination, but doing nothing is worse,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Torie Hilton, director of the Alabama Coalition Against
Rape, fears it will lead to shorter sentences for sex offenders and
will result in a false sense of security because she says studies
show chemical castration is not totally effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''It by no means makes sex offenders safe to be put back in the
community,'' Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hamrick, Siegelman's chief of staff, said shortened
sentences are not the legislation's intent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be watching the parole board very closely because that's
the last thing that needs to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Dillard, spokeswoman for the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles, said the board was supervising 464 people in February who
had committed sex crimes against children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics were unavailable on how many were second-time
offenders, but she said it would be extremely small because most
repeat offenders get life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Jeremy Oden is sponsoring Siegelman's bill in
the House where it is pending. A companion bill has passed the
Senate and is pending in a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying our best to keep these individuals from doing
what they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical castration has attracted media attention for its
successes and its failures. Joseph Frank Smith is an example of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was dubbed the Ski Mask Rapist in Texas, where he was
convicted of raping the same woman twice in 1983, and in 1984
appeared on CBS's ''60 Minutes'' as a success story for chemical
castration. But he quit taking the treatments and was convicted in
1998 of molesting a 5-year-old girl in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thornsley, a criminology professor at Troy State
University, said chemical castration works like birth control: The
effect ends when a person quits taking it.
</P>
<P>
   He said Siegelman's bill should also provide for counseling to
ensure the treatments are successful, although Hamrick said there
isn't enough money for that.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Thornsley said, ''Even if it is minimal treatment,
it is better than nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Standoff Re-Enacted  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- Aircraft circled, tanks rumbled and
combat-garbed shooters fired off rounds at a Texas military base
Sunday in a high-stakes field test to resolve whether federal
agents shot at the Branch Davidians in the waning moments of the
1993 Waco standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The test's participants, emerging from the tightly controlled,
nonpublic test conducted at Fort Hood, said the demonstration had
gone well.
</P>
<P>
   In a hurried post-midnight news conference, the government said
a preliminary review of films from the test by the FBI, the U.S.
attorney's office and a Justice Department expert bolstered their
case. But more extensive examination of test results was planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased to say that this does confirm what we have said
all along,'' said U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford, one of the
government's lead lawyers in ongoing Branch Davidian litigation.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the government has maintained that FBI agents were
not firing at the back of the compound as the siege ended. The test
results, he said, pleased reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our opinion that the flashes are visible and that people
are visible,'' said Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have always insisted that their forces
fired no shots on the siege's final day, when the FBI launched a
tear-gassing operation designed to end the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Branch Davidian plaintiffs suing the government for wrongful
death insist Sunday's field test will confirm their experts'
analysis: that rapid-fire bursts of light appearing on the FBI's
1993 aerial infrared surveillance footage represent gunfire from
government positions into the Davidians' retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we ... show that there are flashes from gunfire, I am
hopeful FBI leaders will acknowledge that guns were fired and the
FBI will find out who fired and on what orders,'' the plaintiffs'
lead counsel, Michael Caddell, said prior to the test at the Army
outpost, 50 miles southwest of the site of the 1993 Waco siege.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have suggested the flashes come from sunlight
glinting off water, metal or other debris strewn on the ground
while the government's tanks pierced the compound's walls to insert
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished
during the fire that consumed their compound several hours into the
tear-gassing operation. The government contends their deaths,
whether from fire or gunshot wounds, came by their own hand. The
plaintiffs argue government gunfire cut off Davidians' only avenue
of escape as the inferno raged.
</P>
<P>
   The field test, ordered by the federal judge presiding over the
Davidians' lawsuit, was designed to determine whether the Forward
Looking Infrared camera is capable of detecting people, debris
heated by exhaust from tanks, sunlight reflections and, of course,
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared experts from both sides will compare the test footage
with the FBI's 1993 tape to determine whether muzzle blasts fired
during the test have similar thermal signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had hoped to air portions of the test video in a Houston
news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Walter Smith barred release of the film,
while permitting discussion of its contents. The judge, calling the
video evidence, said the court's infrared expert will release its
own analysis within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford has acknowledged that infrared technology can detect
gunfire -- a statement Caddell has described as a stunning reversal
of the government's earlier position.
</P>
<P>
   The critical issue, Bradford and other federal officials
contend, is whether the cameras detect people on the ground. No
people were visible on the 1993 infrared tape until after the fire
erupted and FBI agents emerged from armored vehicles to search for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   While the government suggests there can be no shots without
shooters, the plaintiffs argue that gunmen weren't detected because
the temperature of their fire-retardant clothing and body armor was
similar to that of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The test site was overflown by an FBI plane equipped with the
since-upgraded FLIR used at Waco and a Lynx helicopter on loan from
the British Royal Navy outfitted with an infrared camera of the
same generation as the one used in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared cameras captured images of shooters and tank
drivers carrying out the intricately choreographed demonstration.
The field was strategically peppered with debris to simulate the
scene at the compound on April 19, 1993, as tanks rammed into the
sect's rickety wooden structure.
</P>
<P>
   The field test was attended by the special counsel
reinvestigating the government's conduct during the siege's final
day, former Sen. John Danforth. Also among the 25 or so people in
attendance were Smith, congressional investigators and the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rejected news organizations' request for the event to be
public.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet With Syrian Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday that he
would meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva next week to
try to get a Syria-Israel peace process ''back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would make the stop on his way home from his
six-day visit to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He said such a meeting was ''the next logical step.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying he didn't want to ''unduly raise expectations,''
Clinton told reporters, ''I think this is the appropriate thing for
me to do to get this back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confirmed the visit during a joint news conference with
the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, White House officials said such a visit was under
consideration. Asked about it directly, Clinton said, ''I do intend
to do that ... I do intend to go to Switzerland to meet with
President Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was scheduled to take place Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria resumed in December
after a lapse of more than three years. Clinton made frequent trips
from Washington to Shepherdstown, W.Va., to husband a week of
inconclusive talks between Israeli President Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria were supposed to return to the United States
for another round in January, but Syria abruptly scrapped the
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the United States had worked very hard to
restart peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians ''and
they're doing very very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he suggested, it was time to apply a similar effort to the
suspended Syria-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just have to see what comes out of the talks,'' Clinton
said of his meeting with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that, with a resumption of the Syria-Israel talks,
''our objective of having a comprehensive peace can go forward.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Oscars Found in L.A. Trash  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Katherine Hepburn has four. Tom Hanks has
two. But, for a while at least, salvage man Willie Fulgear had more
Academy Awards than he could count.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old man discovered scores of stolen statuettes
intended for next weekend's awards show while searching through
trash bins in the city's Koreatown neighborhood Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got more Oscars than any of the movie stars,'' said
Fulgear, who makes a living salvaging and recycling discarded
items.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five of the gold-plated statues vanished and were presumed
stolen March 10 from a Roadway Express Inc. loading dock in Bell,
the Los Angeles-area community where 4,000 Oscar ballots were
misplaced at a post office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 8{-pound statues were packed in 10 boxes and wrapped
together on one palette, which weighed a total of about 470 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. David Powers said today that investigators checked
with the Motion Picture Academy and verified that Fulgear had
discovered at least 53 of their missing statuettes. He said a
special mark proved they were the true awards.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the stolen Oscars remained unaccounted for, Powers said,
and it was unlikely any of the awards would be returned in time for
Sunday's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were just a matter of recovering the Oscars I'd say
let's open them up right now. But this is a theft, a criminal
investigation, and we have to proceed cautiously,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the show will likely go on. The Motion Picture
Academy placed an emergency order last week for dozens of
replacement Oscars after the theft was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left before business hours at the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences were not immediately returned today.
</P>
<P>
   Police had opened some boxes and placed about 12 of the
statuettes on the ground. They appeared to be in pristine
condition, despite the condition of the soiled, puddle-filled
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he found the statues about 9:30 p.m. Sunday stacked
beside a trash bin. The awards were still wrapped in plastic,
padded with Styrofoam and in individual white boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Planning to move from his nearby one-room apartment, Fulgear
said he literally stumbled over one award while searching for large
packing boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''My foot hit one. It was heavy and I opened it up ... Everybody
knows who Oscar is,'' Fulgear said.
</P>
<P>
   He stuffed the trunk of his car with the boxes and called his
22-year-old son to help him find out what they were doing in the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea how many I had,'' he said. ''I just knew that if
I didn't get them, somebody else would.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he had no idea the Oscars were missing.
</P>
<P>
   A parking lot with a tall wrought iron fence topped with razor
wire surrounded the parking lot, which served a coin-operated
laundry, smog-check station and grocery store. Police did not know
when the trash bins were last emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express, which shipped the statues from the manufacturer
in Chicago, had put up a $50,000 reward to help recover the
statues.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing cost of the statues was about $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he hopes to collect the reward -- he wants to help
his son put a down payment on a home.

<HEADLINE> Allies Rebuke NRA Leader's Words  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some influential Republicans who have
traditionally supported the National Rifle Association sought to
dissociate themselves from recent remarks by an NRA leader about
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre remained
unrepentant Sunday about his contention last week that Clinton is
''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my comments that if this administration would
enforce the federal law they'd save lives, and they're not doing
it,'' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said
LaPierre's remark about the president was not ''terribly helpful to
trying to reach a consensus on a very difficult issue'' that
Congress continues to struggle with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an extreme statement,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said on
CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''I wish it hadn't been said.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' Former President Ford said gun control
requires ''reasonable compromise,'' adding: ''You can't take the
hard-line, NRA position -- that's a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, traveling with Clinton in
India, said there had been ''an appalling silence from political
leaders over the last week, particularly the Republicans who are
the NRA allies'' to repudiate LaPierre's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration will ''keep the pressure on in
every possible way'' to persuade Congress to pass gun safety
measures, Clinton domestic policy aide Bruce Reed said on ''Fox
News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the nation's largest gun manufacturer, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, agreed to make its handguns more childproof by installing
safety locks and developing ''smart gun'' technology that limits a
gun's use to its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre discounted the deal's importance, saying there was not
much new in it. Reed disputed that and credited the company with a
''courageous decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's president, actor Charlton Heston, said the British
owners of Smith &AMP; Wesson do not place the same value on the Second
Amendment's right to bear arms as do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not comfortable about the Brits telling us how to deal
with our Bill of Rights,'' Heston told ABC. ''I think we settled
that in 1776, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that Austria's Glock GmbH
could follow Smith &AMP; Wesson in accepting government handgun
restrictions in exchange for some legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Smith &AMP; Wesson plan, a senior executive with
the U.S. unit of Glock said the company hasn't signed on, but is
considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jannuzzo said Glock is ''still doing the balancing test. We
are still weighing the idea of bleeding to death with legal bills
vs. the cost of complying'' with the government demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal notes that Glock relies largely on sales to police
departments and would be vulnerable to a new government strategy of
having law-enforcement agencies give preference to gunmakers that
sign a version of the Smith &AMP; Wesson settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking laws to require safety locks on all handguns,
ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and require
background checks before a weapon could be purchased at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed separate versions of the bill
but have not found a compromise. A sticking point is how to handle
background checks for gun buyers. Clinton wants a 72-hour waiting
period. Many Republicans and the NRA favor instant checks, or
24-hour checks at most.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, LaPierre came under criticism for his assertion
last week that Clinton ''has blood on his hands'' in the death of
former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong was shot to death last summer by a white supremacist
who had failed a background check but was not arrested. LaPierre
said lax law enforcement by the administration was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Byrdsong's widow, Sherialyn, called
LaPierre's comments ''appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly do not in any way think my husband's blood is on
your hands,'' she wrote, ''and I applaud your efforts.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Katharine Hepburn has four. Tom Hanks has

sdhfcsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Students and staff of Trinity College
were struggling to understand the death of a 22-year-old senior in
what police say was a drug and alcohol binge that left his roommate
from New Jersey critically ill.
</P>
<P>
   Two other roommates have been charged with possession of
narcotics. They were scheduled to be arraigned today in Hartford
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   A school spokeswoman said she did not believe the tragedy was
indicative of widespread drug use among Trinity students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a reactive mode in response to this and we don't
believe we have a drug problem on campus,'' said Linda Campanella,
Trinity's senior vice president for operations and planning.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the death would certainly spark a dialogue between
students and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a lot of dialogue and reflection that comes out
of this. We will try to learn as much as we can from this and act
on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the dead student, Josh Doroff, of Harrison,
N.Y., and his three roommates were drinking and doing drugs in
their dormitory room Thursday night and Friday morning, celebrating
the end of mid-term exams.
</P>
<P>
   Doroff, a political science and economics major, died Friday
afternoon after being taken to Hartford Hospital by friends. The
other stricken student, Clement ''Nick'' Kaupp III, 22, of Mendham,
N.J., was found later by police, unconscious in the room. The
pre-law student was also taken to Hartford Hospital, where he was
listed in critical condition on life support Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokesman James Battaglio said Sunday that Kaupp's
family had asked that no more information be released on his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the students, all seniors, apparently had mixed
prescription anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping pills and a migraine
medication. In addition, they also were drinking and may have taken
heroin, police said. Police said they were trying to learn where
the students obtained the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doroff, the son of Frank Doroff, executive vice president of
Bloomingdale's, was buried Sunday in Valhalla, N.Y., after a
graveside service, according to a spokeswoman for Riverside
Memorial Chapels in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy on Doroff was inconclusive Sunday, pending further
study of tissue and blood samples, said a spokesman for the state
medical examiner's office in Farmington. The toxicology reports
were expected to take about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two other roommates-- William B. Bachman, 21, of South Natick,
Mass., and Joshua B. Eaves, 22, of Downingtown, Pa. -- were arrested
after they were taken to the hospital Friday for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Students are on spring break and classes will not resume until
March 27. A memorial service for Doroff will be held that day at 4
p.m. in the college's chapel. College staff, including counselors,
will be available starting the weekend before classes resume.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 39 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 4-3 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 12 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up two points.
</P>
<P>
   Traders anticipate the market will be more toned-down this week,
after several days of hyper-volatility last week.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for caution is tomorrow's meeting of the
Federal Reserve's policy panel.
</P>
<P>
   And even though a quarter-point hike in short-term rates is
considered close to a sure thing, the likelihood is that investors
will wait until after the Fed announces the hike before staking out
new positions.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some earnings news this week, with numbers later
today from 3-Com.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in Europe have been higher, after Asian markets were

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects ''Racial Balancing'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sidestepping a dispute over racial diversity,
the Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that bars race as a
factor when public school students seek to transfer to another
school.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected the appeal of a Maryland
school district that refused to let a white boy transfer to a
mostly white magnet school from his minority-dominated neighborhood
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''School districts may take voluntary, race-conscious action to
avoid creating racial isolation,'' lawyers for the Montgomery
County Public Schools told the justices. A federal appeals court
disgreed and overturned the school district's action.
</P>
<P>
   Today's court action set no legal precedent, but left intact the
appeals court's ruling that said such ''racial balancing'' is
unconstitutional when not needed to remedy past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling affects all schools in Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of public school districts allow children to be
transferred to different schools through school-choice programs,
magnet schools or charter schools that are publicly funded but
involve less government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of schools have been sued over the use of race in
deciding what transfers will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Eisenberg and Elinor Merberg wanted their son, Jacob, to
attend a magnet school emphasizing math and science when he started
first grade in 1998 in Montgomery County, a suburb of the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   They sued after school district officials barred the transfer
because it would harm the racial diversity of Jacobs' neighborhood
school, Glen Haven Elementary. It was 24 percent white, 40 percent
black, 25 percent Hispanic and 10 percent Asian at the time. White
enrollment had dropped by 15 percent over the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   The magnet school, Rosemary Hills Elementary, was 66 percent
white, 16 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob's parents said the school district's decision violated his
constitutional equal-protection rights. A federal judge refused to
order a transfer, but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck
down the school district's policy last October.
</P>
<P>
   If student transfers lead to schools dominated by one race or
another, ''any racial or ethnic imbalance is a product of private
choices and it does not have constitutional implications,'' the
appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the school district's lawyers said
studies show that desegregated schools aid black students'
achievement and that children who attend integrated schools are
more likely to choose integrated colleges, neighborhoods and work
places.
</P>
<P>
   If students like Jacob are allowed to transfer, his neighborhood
school ''will not only lose diversity but will become all-minority
in the foreseeable future,'' the appeal contended.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's parents urged the court to reject the
school district's appeal. ''Integration can only be pursued as a
result of a constitutional violation, not for its own sake,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Montgomery County Public Schools vs. Eisenberg,
99-1069.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Considers Drug Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify when
courts can overrule arbitrators who require a company to keep an
employee in a safety-sensitive job despite testing positive for
illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear a West Virginia coal company's
argument that an arbitrator wrongly refused to let it fire a heavy
equipment operator who twice tested positive for marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   James Smith worked for Eastern Associated Coal Corp. in the
Madison, W.Va., area when in 1996 he applied for a position as a
heavy equipment operator. The job required a drug test, and his
results were positive for marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   The company fired him, but Smith filed a grievance and an
arbitrator ordered the company to rehire him.
</P>
<P>
   He passed three subsequent drug tests but again tested positive
for marijuana in June 1997. The company fired him, and an
arbitrator again ordered Smith reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator relied on Smith's testimony that a family problem
led to a ''one time lapse'' and that if that were not so, Smith
''will make another misstep with drug use and be caught.'' At that
point he would be fired, the arbitrator said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern asked a federal judge to overturn the arbitrator's
decision, saying there was a ''well defined and dominant public
policy'' against performing safety-sensitive jobs under the
influence of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled against Eastern, and the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Courts ''overwhelmingly defer'' to arbitrators' decisions in
labor disputes, the appeals court said, adding that federal
regulations do not make it illegal to reinstate employees who test
positive for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Eastern's lawyers said federal
appeals courts have disagreed over when courts can overturn such
arbitration awards. Workplace safety is a ''national concern'' and
illegal drug use costs American businesses more than $60 billion a
year, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Mine Workers union's lawyers agreed there is a public
policy against drug-impaired people performing safety-sensitive
jobs, but added that courts approach such matters on a case-by-case
basis. They asked the court to reject the company's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Eastern Associated Coal Corp. vs. United Mine
Workers of America, 99-1038.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 77.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as
investors waited to see whether the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates at its meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 77.95 to 10,673.18.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 0.56 at 1,463.91, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 2.45 at 4,795.68.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were mostly higher today after Lehman Brothers
reported first-quarter earnings well above Wall Street's
expectations. Several other Wall Street firms that are scheduled to
release their earnings this week also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers rose ~ to 92 5/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter rose 2 to 90].
</P>
<P>
   Dow component American Express rose 3] to 147.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in
electronic commerce, plummeted 123[ to 103| after the company
revised its financial results for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Fed's meeting.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, which would be the fifth increase
since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.61 million
shares, compared with 294.96 in Friday's busy session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.03 to 571.74.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 1.9 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Inmate Loses Supreme Court Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today turned down an appeal
by a Louisiana man who won, and then lost, a $1 million award from
jail officials who failed to protect him from gouging out his own
eyes during a psychotic episode.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away James J. Sibley's
argument that a trial jury, not the judge, should decide whether
jail officials were indifferent to his mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was arrested on assault and battery charges in November
1989 and taken to the Vermilion Parish Correctional Center in
Abbeville, La.
</P>
<P>
   After he began showing erratic behavior in his jail cell, a
doctor examined him and concluded he should be taken to a mental
health facility. There was no room at the facility, however, and
Sibley was placed on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   On his fifth day in jail, Sibley was placed in leg shackles
after he was found kicking the door to his cell. On the sixth day,
15 minutes after a deputy had checked on him, the deputy found
Sibley gouging his eyes out with his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   He was blinded in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sibley filed a civil rights lawsuit against Sheriff
Raywood J. Lemaire and deputies Hubert P. Trahan and Freddie Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury ruled against Lemaire and Trahan on the civil
rights claims and against all three men on negligence grounds.
Sibley was awarded $1,050,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, following an appeals court ruling in a similar
case, the trial judge ordered a new trial in Sibley's case and
ruled for the deputies on the civil rights claims.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the
officials were entitled to qualified immunity because Sibley did
not show that they acted with ''deliberate indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Sibley's lawyer said the issue of
deliberate indifference should have been decided by a jury, not by
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Sibley vs. Lemaire, 99-1039.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
squelching a convicted rapist's attempt to get out from under his
designation in Washington state as a sexually violent predator who
should stay locked up even after he served his prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, granting an appeal by state officials, said they
will review Andre Brigham Young's fight against how Washington's
Sexually Violent Predator Statute applies to him.
</P>
<P>
   Young was convicted of five different rapes over a 31-year
period. A day before he was to complete his prison sentence in 1991
for the last of his convictions, state officials sought to have him
committed as a sexually violent predator.
</P>
<P>
   The state law they relied on served as a model for a Kansas law
the Supreme Court upheld in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In that 5-4 decision, the nation's highest court said such
confinement does not violate the constitutional right to due
process and is not double punishment for the same crime. The
confinement, intended to protect society, is civil -- not punitive,
the court said three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, six states had such laws -- Kansas, Washington,
Arizona, California, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But ruling in Young's case last May, a three-judge panel of the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he should have a
chance to prove before a federal trial judge that his confinement
is indeed punitive because he is being denied the ''adequate care
and individualized treatment'' the state law calls for.
</P>
<P>
   The May decision ordered a federal trial judge to reconsider
Young's case.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to derail that reconsideration, the state's lawyers
told the justices that the appeals court's ruling is both
''unworkable in practice'' and unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Seling vs. Young, 99-1185.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Newspaper's Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal in
which the justices were urged to rule that the public and news
media have a constitutional right to attend civil trials even when
some participants want to exclude them.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments by lawyers for
a North Carolina newspaper, The Charlotte Observer.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 years ago when the nation's highest court first ruled
that members of the public and news media have a First Amendment
right to attend criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   Judges may conduct criminal trials, or even portions of them, in
secret only as a last resort to insure fairness and only after
explaining why excluding the public is necessary, the court said in
a landmark 1980 ruling called Richmond Newspapers vs. Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Some lower courts have extended that decision and some Supreme
Court sequels to require access to civil, or non-criminal, trials.
The justices never have, however.
</P>
<P>
   The justices last decided an open-court case in 1993, when they
unanimously struck down a Puerto Rico rule that excluded the public
from preliminary hearings for defendants in felony criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina dispute stems from a doctor's lawsuit against
the operator of two Charlotte hospitals. A. Ron Virmani said
Presbyterian Health Services Corp.'s decision to deny him
privileges at the two hospitals violated its by-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital company in 1996 asked the presiding judge to close
the pretrial hearing held on its request to have the lawsuit
dismissed. The company based its request on a state law that
requires closure of court proceedings and records in cases
involving hospital peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   John Hechinger, a reporter for the Observer, was in the
courtroom when the request for closing the proceedings was made. He
objected and asked that his lawyer be allowed to oppose the
hospital company's request.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected Hechinger's request and had him removed from
the courtroom. The hearing was conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Observer's owner, Knight Publishing Co., challenged the
judge's action, and a state appeals court ruled that he had made a
mistake. The appeals court ordered that a transcript of the hearing
and all documents introduced at it be made available.
</P>
<P>
   After the hospital company appealed, the North Carolina Supreme
Court overruled the appeals court last June. The state's highest
court upheld the state law requiring closure of court proceedings
and records in cases involving hospital peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Observer said the
justices ''should not permit the state's sweeping closure rule to
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are powerful and persuasive reasons, well grounded in
both history and function, for applying the right of access to
civil cases,'' the appeal said. ''Public access to civil
proceedings is a concept at the heart of our judicial tradition
that serves the vital social functions of ensuring the
accountability of our legal institutions and facilitating an
informed citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was supported in a friend-of-the-court brief
submitted by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,
American Society of Newspaper Editors and Society of Professional
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Novant Health Southern Piedmont Region, which
acquired Presbyterian Health Services after the dispute began,
urged the court to reject the Observer's appeal. They said the
state court's ruling was based on ''the public's compelling
interest in the confidentiality of peer review records.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Knight Publishing Co. vs. Novant Health Southern
Piedmont Region, 99-1011.

   Feds To Phase Out MTBE Gas Additive
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has decided to
phase out MTBE as a gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to
public health or the environment, government sources said. MTBE, a
leading oxygenate and octane booster, reduces emissions of smog,
but it has been linked to groundwater pollution in California and
elsewhere. Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, was to announce this afternoon that her agency
will seek to ''significantly reduce or eliminate'' use of MTBEs
under the Toxic Substance Control Act, according to a government
official. The agency also will ask Congress for changes in the
Clean Air Act that will encourage use of ethanol, an additive from
corn, in place of MTBE, another source said.

   Boeing Employees Returning To Work
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- One of the biggest white-collar walkouts in the
country's history has ended with Boeing Co. engineers and technical
workers returning to work today after a 40-day walkout. During that
time, Boeing missed at least 15 airplane deliveries, and work on
some government contracts suffered during the walkout of about
15,000 to 17,000 workers. In its annual report to federal
regulators, filed last week, Boeing said the strike would hurt
financial performance in the first quarter, which ends March 31,
and could affect the second quarter as well. Boeing shares were
down 1 this morning at 37.

   DETROIT (AP) -- Citing strong demand for its Chrysler PT Cruiser,
DaimlerChrysler AG will begin building the retro-styled wagons at a
second factory. DaimlerChrysler said today it would build PT
Cruisers at its Eurostar plant in Graz, Austria, next year. The
plant has the capacity to build 50,000 PT Cruisers a year. The
company also is ramping up production at its plant in Toluca,
Mexico, which has the capacity to build 180,000 vehicles a year.
The first PT Cruisers were scheduled to arrive in dealerships this
month. It already has waiting lists and markups over the sticker
price of $17,000 to $20,000 at some dealers. DaimlerChrysler shares
were down 2 1/16 at 65 3/16.

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV plans
to shed 2,700 jobs, or 7.9 percent of its work force, as part of a
restructuring plan to cut costs and return to profitability. The
measures announced today are intended to offset rising fuel costs,
declining capacity and cheaper air fares which resulted in an
operating loss of $30 million in the latest quarter. The national
carrier will eliminate the jobs over the next 12 months though a
combination of forced job cuts and attrition.

stocks today, with most falling as far as they could on fears of a
war with China. The government intervened and bought shares to help
contain the damage brought on by opposition candidate Chen
Shui-bian's election, but officials warned they could not keep
buying indefinitely if traders keep selling. Prices finished with a
loss of 2.6 percent, and 394 of the 589 companies on the Taipei
stock market dropped the maximum amount. But the mood was not
entirely gloomy. Shipping companies rallied on Chen's comments that
he would like to see Taiwan and China agree on direct air and sea

   Supreme Court Considers Drug Case
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify when
courts can overrule arbitrators on the issue of illegal drug use.
The court said it will hear Eastern Associated Coal Corp.'s
argument that an arbitrator wrongly refused to let it fire a worker
who twice tested positive for marijuana use. James Smith already
worked for West Virginia company when he applied for a position as
a heavy equipment operator. The job required a drug test, and his
results were positive for marijuana use. The company fired him, but
an arbitrator ordered the company to rehire him. Smith tested
positive for marijuana again a year later. The company fired him,
and an arbitrator again sent him back. The arbitrator relied on
testimony that a family problem led to a ''one time lapse.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Overtime for Trainers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight Texas high school sports trainers who
want overtime pay for the long hours they spend treating student
athletes' injuries lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which the
trainers argued that their duties should not be considered
professional work exempt from the federal overtime pay law.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers work an average 60-hour week at the San Antonio
Independent School District. They work to prevent and treat student
athletes' injuries, attend practices and games, and help students
undergo rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers sued the school district in 1996, contending they
were entitled under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act to time
and one-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled that seven of the eight trainers should
not be considered professionals and therefore were entitled to
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Employees can be considered professionals if their work requires
advanced knowledge gained through specialized instruction, and if
they consistently must exercise their own judgment on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judge and
ruled for the school district. Trainers in Texas must have a
university degree as well as specialized training in subjects such
as human anatomy and physiology, and they exercise their own
judgment, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit court said it was not required to defer to a
Labor Department opinion letter that said Kansas athletic trainers
should not be considered professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal acted on today said the appeals court should have
deferred to the Labor Department letter even though it was not a
formal department rule.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Owsley vs. San Antonio Independent School District,
99-1205.

<HEADLINE> Rains Drench Soybean, Grain Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices plummeted in
early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade after
heavier-than-expected weekend rains soaked growing regions in much
of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   After a week-long rally that followed U.S. government warnings
of drought, soybeans dove more than 2 percent immediately after
trading opened today. That erased Friday's gains, which were based
largely on expectations that the Midwest would see a mostly dry
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain fell in key soybean growing areas of Illinois and
Indiana over the weekend. More showers falling today in the eastern
Midwest -- including outside the Board of Trade building in downtown
Chicago -- added to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices took a beating for the same reason, with
expectations for more rain later in the week contributing to the
selling mood.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also tumbled, pressured by the weekend precipitation in
much of the Midwest and the Delta. The storm system expected to
cross the winter wheat belt later in the week helped push prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 6 cents to $2.66\ a bushel; May corn
fell 6 cents to $2.34} a bushel; May oats fell 1{ cents to $1.20{ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 13 cents to $5.24{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were higher in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .55 cent to 72.47 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .33 cent to 83.55 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .45 cent to 70.80 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .17
cent to 93.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarigy Mail-Fraud Charges  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify
whether people can be charged with federal mail fraud for lying
when applying for a state license, such as a permit to operate
video poker games.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear a New Orleans lawyer's argument that
the mail-fraud law does not apply to state licenses that have not
yet been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Carl W. Cleveland and Fred H. Goodson of Slidell, La., were
charged in 1996 with mail fraud, racketeering and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said the two lent money to Goodson's adult
children to operate a video poker business, but that applications
for state licenses concealed the fact that Cleveland and Goodson
were the business' true owners. Prosecutors said the men concealed
their ownership to avoid state assessment of their suitability.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Goodson each were convicted of two counts of mail
fraud as well as money laundering, racketeering and other charges.
Both were sentenced to 10 years and one month in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-fraud charges were based on the state's mailings of the
video poker license and subsequent renewals.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions
last July. The court noted it previously had ruled that state
licenses are considered ''property'' under the mail fraud law,
which bars people from using the mail to fraudulently obtain
property.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear Cleveland's appeal. His
lawyers said other federal appeals courts have ruled that a state
license not yet issued is not considered property under the federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit court's ruling would mean that ''virtually any
alleged misrepresentation in applying for such licenses can be the
basis for federal felony charges,'' Cleveland's appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the court to reject the
appeal, saying Louisiana had a property interest in the video poker
licenses and is entitled to control the source of that money.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Cleveland vs. U.S., 99-804.

<HEADLINE> McCain Returns to Senate  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain, who joked with campaign audiences
that he'd never win a Miss Congeniality award in the Senate,
returned to the Capitol today saying he expected ''a warm
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   A smiling McCain was swarmed by reporters as he approached his
Senate office. The Arizona senator said he planned to catch up on
paperwork and would meet later today with former Sen. Warren
Rudman, the national co-chairman of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to having lunch with all my friends
tomorrow,'' McCain said, referring to the GOP luncheon held
Tuesdays when the Senate is in session. ''I'm told I will be
extended a warm welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, public displays of graciousness are sure to mark his
return as a more formidable political force than when he left. It's
the Senate's way, even though he ran a presidential campaign that
rocked the Republican establishment and used fellow lawmakers as
foils.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suspended his GOP campaign on March 9 and left for a
vacation. Some supporters want him to launch an independent
campaign for the White House, though McCain has been cool to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, McCain pilloried ''establishment''
Republicans and Democrats, saying they are out of touch with
America and beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senators are in conflict every day with each other, in
committee, over issues, in letters, in the media, on the floor,''
said Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., Senate point man for likely GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush. ''But it has a fraternal
nature to it and you have to set the battles ... aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the displays of senatorial courtesy, the Arizona
senator's allies say fellow Republicans will ignore his new
political clout at their own peril.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only two United States senators who have a truly
national constituency. One's name is Ted Kennedy and one's name is
John McCain,'' says former White House chief of staff Ken
Duberstein, a McCain friend and senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said a recent national survey
pointed in the same direction, and that McCain can help GOP
candidates in terms of fund raising and voter support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The congressional (campaign) committee ought to put him on
right away to start doing these swing congressional districts,''
Goeas said. ''He can be a real asset in keeping Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein predicted McCain will be the ''No. 1 Republican''
asked to campaign for Republicans this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''He still may not win Miss Congeniality, but he will win a
popularity contest,'' Duberstein said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made repeated joking references to Miss Congeniality
awards while campaigning, in part to rebut suggestions that he
lacked the temperament to serve in the Oval Office. He has
irritated fellow lawmakers, in part with a personal style that can
be brusque, and with public remarks.
</P>
<P>
   During a Senate debate on campaign finance legislation last
year, he drew fire for posting on his campaign Web site examples of
''pork-barrel'' spending that involved home-state projects eagerly
sought by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And some relationships were frayed during the bruising campaign.
According to numerous associates, McCain is irritated with Sen.
Phil Gramm for comments the Texan made while campaigning for Bush
in South Carolina. McCain supported Gramm in the 1996 campaign,
despite a long-standing friendship with another contender that
year, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Aides are planning McCain's return to public life in Washington
with care.
</P>
<P>
   He'll meet today with political advisers to review plans for a
political action committee that would enable him to raise money to
finance his travels around the country on behalf of his ''reform''
agenda as well as for other candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   He may speak on the Senate floor on Tuesday, possibly on a
reform issue. But no attempt will be made to flesh out his plans
for the coming months ''on his second day back in Washington after
a long campaign and a short vacation,'' according to spokesman Todd
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   It's also has been nearly two weeks since McCain has commented
publicly on Bush, who angered McCain allies last week by saying his
rival hadn't changed his views on reform.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last week, McCain passed word from his South Pacific
vacation spot to GOP Senate leaders that he wanted no public
ceremonies marking his return. ''There were almost as many ideas as
there were people with speed dials'' on their phones, said John
Czwartacki, an aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, aides assume he will be the center of attention after a
presidential campaign that surprised Bush in New Hampshire and in
Michigan and then won four New England states on March 7 before
folding two days later.

<HEADLINE> Court Accepts Water Damage Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it will decide
whether the government can be forced to pay for property damage
caused by water from federally sponsored irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
   The justices voted to use a California dispute to resolve
conflicting rulings among federal appeals courts over what
liability, if any, the federal government faces in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether a 72-year-old federal law, the Flood Control
Act of 1928, immunizes the government from all lawsuits based on
damages caused by allegedly negligent construction and maintenance
of irrigation canals.
</P>
<P>
   Central Green Co., which owns a 1,000-acre pistachio farm in
California's San Joaquin Valley, sued the government over operation
of the Madera Canal, which carries water through the valley and
runs through Central Green's farm in Madera County.
</P>
<P>
   The canal leaks, harming the farm's pistachio orchards and
increasing the company's farming and harvesting costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the lawsuit
must be dismissed because the 1928 law shields the government from
liability ''for any damage from or by floods or flood water at any
place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Central Green's appeal to the nation's highest court says
the law should not immunize the government from lawsuits based on
damages caused by irrigation -- not flood -- waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case ... has nothing at all to do with floods or flood
waters,'' the justices were told.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyers had urged the court to reject
Central Green's appeal. Calling the Madera Canal ''part of a
multipurpose federal flood control project,'' Justice Department
lawyers said, ''The federal government is immune from suit for
property damages caused when flood waters escape from a
multipurpose project with flood control as one of its purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Central Green Co. vs. U.S., 99-859.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 90.98; Nasdaq Down 43.81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose today, but the broader
market held back as nervous investors waited to see whether the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 90.98 at 10,686.21.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 0.82 at 1,463.65, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 43.81 at 4,754.32.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led higher by its technology components.
Hewlett-Packard rose 5 to 142 13/16, and Intel rose 5 7/16 to 135
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   American Express rose 1[ to 144}, but other financial stocks
were mixed. Lehman Brothers reported first-quarter earnings well
above Wall Street's expectations but its shares slipped [ to 91
5/16. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, scheduled to report earnings
later this week, rose 1\ to 89|.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in
electronic commerce, lost more than half of its value. Shares
plummeted 127 13/16 to 98 15/16 after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Fed's meeting.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, which would be the fifth increase
since last June. Higher interest rates generally send stocks lower
because they cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,
said that while he expects a rate increase Tuesday, he believes Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan won't act aggressively for the remainder of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Greenspan does not want to break the back of the best
economic recovery this nation has enjoyed in its history,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 283.34 million
shares, compared with 508.75 in Friday's busy session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.90 to 565.87.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fiat Eying Volvo and Scania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Fiat's Giovanni Agnelli says the Italian automaker,
which last week announced an alliance with General Motors Corp., is
eyeing AB Volvo and Scania AB after regulators blocked the proposed
merger of those two truck makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know the terms that led the antitrust to reject the
operation. We need to see if they could also be applied to us,''
Agnelli, who is honorary chairman of Fiat, was quoted Sunday as
saying by Milan daily Corriere della Sera.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Commission rejected Volvo's planned $6.9
billion merger with rival Swedish truck and bus maker Scania as
anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-member
European Union, said the merger ''would have caused serious
competition concerns by creating dominant positions'' in several
sectors, including the heavy truck and bus markets in Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger, announced in August, would have created the
world's second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, based in Goteborg, owns 45.5 percent of Scania and will
retain its stake for now, according to a statement issued before
the commission made its decision public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not Scandinavian, that's for sure,'' Agnelli told the
Milan newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Fiat and its truck unit Iveco would
most likely bid solely for Scania.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Fiat SpA announced a $2.4 billion alliance last week
aimed at cutting costs by sharing parts and people.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Fiat will swap 20 percent of its Fiat Auto
subsidiary for about 5.1 percent of GM's common stock -- making the
Italian company GM's largest shareholder. Fiat and GM will form
joint ventures in engine building and purchasing that could
eventually involve thousands of workers on two continents.

<HEADLINE> Capitol To Fix Fire Hazards  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' health and safety agency today
ordered the architect of the Capitol to fix fire safety hazards
that jeopardize the lives of lawmakers, their staffs and thousands
of daily visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Compliance issued eight citations directing the
architect to install fire doors, test fire-suppression equipment
and alarms, and train maintenance employees on storage of hazardous
chemicals. The citations cover the Capitol and the office buildings
that house members' offices and hearing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Green, general counsel for the Office of Compliance, said
testing of sprinklers and alarm systems has been ''almost uniformly
disregarded for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The citations are similar to those issued to private industry by
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, except they
don't carry a fine. Each citation aims to fix a specific problem
and sets a date for compliance. The citations allege that the
architect violated the Congressional Accountability Act, which was
passed five years ago to force Congress to comply with many health
and safety laws imposed on the rest of the country. Congress
previously was exempt from compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a January report on fire safety in congressional buildings,
the compliance office found ''the overall level of fire safety to
be far below that of most other American office buildings of
similar size and age.''
</P>
<P>
   The hazards are ''not only a violation of federal law governing
employee health and safety, but also a potential threat to human
life,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman, responsible for
congressional buildings and grounds, has told Congress that his
office is making progress in improving fire safety. But Hantman
cautioned that he must preserve the historic buildings and
complained that lawmakers and their staffs are reluctant to
evacuate their workspace for major renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has proposed providing $15 million to address the fire
safety issue as part of an emergency spending bill for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The citation that applied to the Capitol stated, ''All exit
stairwells are unprotected against fire, smoke or toxic fumes,
posing an undue danger to the lives and safety of occupants during
the period of time necessary for escape.''
</P>
<P>
   In case of fire, the citation said, the open stairwells ''would
provide ready-made chimneys rapidly conveying fire and smoke'' to
the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   The architect's office was ordered to install fire-rated doors
by Sept. 30 where feasible and submit alternatives for other areas
to the compliance office by Sept. 30, 2001. Design and installation
should be completed for all areas of the Capitol by Sept. 30, 2003,
the citation said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that ''none of the required inspection, testing and
maintenance'' had been performed on sprinkler systems, the
architect was ordered to take corrective action within 90 days.
Annual testing of alarm systems also was required, in that case by
June 30.

<HEADLINE> Some NRA Allies Renounce Comments  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some influential Republicans who have
traditionally supported the National Rifle Association sought to
dissociate themselves from recent remarks by an NRA leader about
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre remained
unrepentant Sunday about his contention last week that Clinton is
''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my comments that if the administration would
enforce the federal law they'd save lives, and they're not doing
it,'' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   And Charlton Heston, the NRA president, said today on NBC's
''Today'': ''You guys owe Wayne an apology. He was right and you
guys were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said
LaPierre's remark about the president was not ''terribly helpful to
trying to reach a consensus on a very difficult issue'' that
Congress continues to struggle with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an extreme statement,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said on
CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''I wish it hadn't been said.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' former President Ford said gun control
requires ''reasonable compromise,'' adding: ''You can't take the
hard-line, NRA position -- that's a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, traveling with Clinton in
India, said there had been ''an appalling silence from political
leaders over the last week, particularly the Republicans who are
the NRA allies'' to repudiate LaPierre's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration will ''keep the pressure on in
every possible way'' to persuade Congress to pass gun safety
measures, Clinton domestic policy aide Bruce Reed said on ''Fox
News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the nation's largest gun manufacturer, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, agreed to make its handguns more childproof by installing
safety locks and developing ''smart gun'' technology that limits a
gun's use to its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre discounted the deal's importance, saying there was not
much new in it. Reed disputed that and credited the company with a
''courageous decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston said the British owners of Smith &AMP; Wesson do not place
the same value on the Second Amendment's right to bear arms as do
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not comfortable about the Brits telling us how to deal
with our Bill of Rights,'' Heston told ABC. ''I think we settled
that in 1776, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Glock, Inc., confirmed it is reluctantly considering
following Smith &AMP; Wesson's lead in accepting government handgun
restrictions in exchange for some legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jannuzzo, vice president and general counsel of Glock,
based in Smyrna, Ga., said the decision will be made this week.
Glock is a unit of Glock GmbH of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a cost-benefit analysis to see whether we'll be
staying in business, whether we will totally bleed to death from
legal bills as the result of this blackmail or be accepting the
conditions imposed on us, on the dealers and consumers for the .5
percent of the guns out there that go bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Glock's
intentions, noted that Glock relies largely on sales to police
departments and would be vulnerable to a new government strategy of
having law-enforcement agencies give preference to gunmakers that
sign a version of the Smith &AMP; Wesson settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking laws to require safety locks on all handguns,
ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and require
background checks before a weapon could be purchased at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed separate versions of the bill
but have not found a compromise. A sticking point is how to handle
background checks for gun buyers. Clinton wants a 72-hour waiting
period. Many Republicans and the NRA favor instant checks, or
24-hour checks at most.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, LaPierre came under criticism for his assertion
last week that Clinton ''has blood on his hands'' in the death of
former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong was shot to death last summer by a white supremacist
who had failed a background check but was not arrested. LaPierre
said lax law enforcement by the administration was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Byrdsong's widow, Sherialyn, called
LaPierre's comments ''appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly do not in any way think my husband's blood is on
your hands,'' she wrote, ''and I applaud your efforts.''

<HEADLINE> UN: Poor Nutrition Court Hurt Kids  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Poor nutrition could stunt and handicap 1 billion
children in the next 20 years unless a more focused campaign is
launched to improve feeding, according to a report for the United
Nations published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the independent Commission on the Nutrition
Challenges of the 21st Century, said about a quarter of children in
developing countries -- some 30 million a year -- suffer retarded
growth even before they are born, in the wombs of their
malnourished mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Early undernutrition, followed by weight gain as those in
developing countries adopt Western lifestyles and consumption
patterns, can lead to a virulent form of obesity, which later in
life causes millions in the developing world to develop diabetes,
heart disease, and some cancers, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have completely failed to recognize the extraordinary
interlinkage'' between underweight children and cancers and other
chronic disease in later life, commission chairman Professor Philip
James told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The malnutrition of mothers and children is programming a
whole generation and setting it back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But James said the problem is ''entirely preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cited as an example Thailand, where a relatively
low-cost program of monitoring, education and feeding cut the
proportion of underweight preschool children from 50 percent in
1982 to about 10 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A Costa Rican nutrition program targeted at preschool children
and pregnant and nursing women cut the proportion of undernourished
children under 5 from 45 percent in 1978 to 2 percent today, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
   James said it was cause for concern that 30 million children a
year are born under the recommended minimum birthweight of 5.5
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 million children around the world are stunted or
handicapped in some way due to poor nutrition, and many more are
''sub-optimal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite programs to cut deficiencies in vitamin A, as many as
250 million preschool children still have mild deficiencies of this
vital nutrient, James added.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 243 million adults are severely undernourished, and
the commission said in India alone, more than 80 percent of
pregnant women suffer from anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 million people have escalating obesity and resultant
chronic diseases, including diabetes, which U.N. studies show
afflicts one fifth of those who have been undernourished in the
womb, James said.
</P>
<P>
   The report labeled South Asia the worst-affected region,
followed by sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa,
and Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, made up of academics and health officials from
seven countries, reports to a U.N. subcommittee on nutrition. Its
goal is to eradicate malnutrition by 2020.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Urges Ritalin Caution  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents should use caution in giving their
preschool children Ritalin and other mind-altering drugs, meant to
treat attention deficit disorders, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton said today, making use of her position as first lady to
highlight a matter that troubles many families.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are intended to treat attention deficit disorders, but
''some of these young people have problems that are symptoms of
nothing more than childhood or adolescence,'' Clinton said at a
White House meeting she called with national health and education
officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan she outlined proposes new government warning labels for
the drugs, a national study of their use and a fall conference on
children's mental health.
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted the efforts are not an attack on medical
treatments for children's emotional well-being, some 125 of which
are in the pipeline. ''Some children do have severe emotional
behavioral problems that can be helped by prescription drugs. These
children are waiting for our help and today we are taking important
steps to provide it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that rapid increases in the drugs' use
bears watching. Recent studies show a doubling to tripling of the
number of children under age 4 taking Ritalin, a common brand name
for the stimulant methylphenidate, which is believed to increase a
child's alertness by stimulating the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit disorder, or ADD, usually is diagnosed in
school-age children based on interviews and observed behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of ADD include the restless inability to sit still to
read, study or even watch television. Often a child cannot play in
group games, and a common symptom is the inability to control
impulses. Some mild forms of these symptoms are common in many
children, leading experts to worry that ADD is diagnosed too often.
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities worry that the drugs supplant behavior therapy,
which in many cases might be more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ritalin, more young children are also taking
clonidine, a blood pressure drug used to treat sleep problems
stemming from attention disorders, and antidepressants such as
Prozac. In the federal Medicaid program, prescriptions for
antidepressants have doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health is about to start a
nationwide study of Ritalin use in children under the age of 6,
said Clarissa Wittenberg, communication director of the mental
health arm of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Children at selected sites around the nation will be observed.
Previous study, Wittenberg said, shows that drugs alone are not the
answer to treating children with such disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''While behavioral therapy can be very effective and medication
was most effective, probably the wisest course to go for treating
children is both,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Missing Oscar Statues Are Found  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Katharine Hepburn has four. Tom Hanks has
two. But, for a while at least, salvage man Willie Fulgear had more
Academy Awards than Kate, Tom, Woody, Meryl and Barbra put
together.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old man discovered scores of stolen statuettes
intended for next weekend's awards show while searching through
trash bins in the city's Koreatown neighborhood Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got more Oscars than any of the movie stars,'' said
Fulgear, who makes a living salvaging and recycling discarded
items. He may qualify for a reward.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five of the gold-plated statuettes vanished and were
presumed stolen March 10 from a Roadway Express Inc. loading dock
in Bell, the same Los Angeles-area community where 4,000 Oscar
ballots were misplaced at a post office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 8{-pound statuettes were packed in 10 boxes and wrapped
together on one palette, which weighed about 470 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. David Powers said today that investigators checked
with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and verified
that Fulgear had discovered at least 53 of their missing
statuettes. There were 55 Oscars in the shipment that vanished.
</P>
<P>
   He said a special mark proved they were the true awards. But it
is unlikely any of the awards would be returned in time for
Sunday's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were just a matter of recovering the Oscars, I'd say
let's open them up right now. But this is a theft, a criminal
investigation, and we have to proceed cautiously,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the show will likely go on. The academy placed an
emergency order last week for dozens of replacement Oscars after
the theft was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left before business hours at the academy were not
immediately returned today.
</P>
<P>
   Police had opened some boxes and placed about 12 of the
statuettes on the ground. They appeared to be in pristine
condition, despite the condition of the soiled, puddle-filled
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he found the statuettes about 9:30 p.m. Sunday
stacked beside a trash bin. The awards were still wrapped in
plastic, padded with plastic foam and in individual white boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Planning to move from his nearby one-room apartment, Fulgear
said he literally stumbled over one award while searching for large
packing boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''My foot hit one. It was heavy and I opened it up. ...
Everybody knows who Oscar is,'' Fulgear said.
</P>
<P>
   He stuffed the trunk of his car with the boxes and called his
22-year-old son to help him find out what they were doing in the
trash. The son called police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea how many I had,'' Fulgear said. ''I just knew
that if I didn't get them, somebody else would.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he not heard the Oscars were missing.
</P>
<P>
   A tall wrought-iron fence topped with razor wire surrounded the
parking lot, which served a coin-operated laundry, smog-check
station and grocery store. Police did not know when the trash bins
were last emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express, which shipped the statuettes from the
manufacturer in Chicago, had put up a $50,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman John Hyre declined to say whether Fulgear
would be offered a reward for finding the Oscars. ''This is still
an open investigation, so I think it would be inappropriate for me
to comment now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing cost of the statuettes was about $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he hopes to collect the reward -- he wants to help
his son put a down payment on a home.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Expecting Another Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Madonna announced Monday that she is pregnant with
her second child, this one fathered by her current boyfriend Guy
Ritchie, a British film director.
</P>
<P>
   A brief statement said the prospective parents ''are happy to
confirm the rumors that they are expecting a child at the end of
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be grateful if the media would kindly allow us some
privacy at this special time and we thank you all for your good

</P>
<P>
   Madonna, 41, and Ritchie, 31, met two years ago at a luncheon
given by Sting's wife, Trudie Styler. Their romance was rekindled
when the singer returned to London last fall.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Oil Imports Forecast To Rise  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- China's long-term level of oil imports will
outstrip by three times the country's own forecast, the
International Energy Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures suggest that China will become a far more
influential player in the global oil market and in the oil-rich
Middle East, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''China's economic growth has outstripped its own energy
resources,'' said William Ramsey, deputy director of the IEA, part
of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ''China is an energy superpower second only to the United
States. Meeting its energy needs is one of the most difficult
challenges China will face.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, IEA Director Robert Priddle urged OPEC countries to
release ''substantial'' extra oil supplies to help reduce soaring
prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in advance of the March 27 meeting of the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Priddle said that extra oil
supplies are needed because ''world stocks are at an unusually low
level. We need substantial additional supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil cartel cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day more
than a year ago after prices had plummeted to below $11 a barrel.
Since then, prices have lept as high as $34 a barrel, sending
prices at the pump soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA estimates that there is a shortfall of about 2.5 million
barrels a day and warns that if prices don't fall soon, buyers will
be encouraged to switch to other energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Priddle did not recommend a supply figure that would reduce
prices. However, he said an extra 500,000 to one million barrels a
day are needed to balance supply and demand in the April-June
period, with supplementary levels required to make up the shortfall
in reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA released a report Monday on China's energy situation and
forecast that Chinese imports will rise to eight million barrels a
day in 2020 -- roughly three times China's own estimates. China
currently imports one million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between IEA and Chinese estimates is accounted for
by differences in how new technology, energy efficiency and
offshore development will impact China's demand for oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eight million barrels a day is a high number,'' Ramsey said at
a news conference. ''The market would be concerned with that amount
in a tight oil market but can accommodate it in terms of
availability. It is a matter of setting up new commercial
relationships without conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Global production is predicted to rise from 75 million barrels a
day today to 111 million barrels a day in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   China has tried to exploit its domestic resources, but the IEA
says that the country's economic growth will overwhelm those
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   China is already the world's second largest energy consumer
after the United States. The IEA said China will be the second
largest importer of oil well before 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring demand for international oil will likely see it play a
much greater role in the oil-rich Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an inevitability of increasing dependency on the
Middle East for China,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   China imported 47.5 percent of its oil from the Midwest in 1997,
up from 39.4 percent in 1990, according to IEA figures.
</P>
<P>
   It has already invested in two oil fields in Iraq and has
announced plans for joint ventures in Iran and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   To meet growing energy demands, China will look to diversify its
energy sources, both at home and abroad, said Wu Jianmin, China's
ambassador to France, with natural gas and nuclear energy playing a
greater role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our new strategy is to develop resources in the western part
of China,'' Wu said. ''One of the top priorities is a 2,300-mile
gas pipeline from Shanshan of China to Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador did not comment on the agency's new report.

<HEADLINE> New Cop Series, 'The Beat,' Goes On  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's funny how when you're a cop, your work
slops over into your off hours and back again.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you're Officer Zane Marinelli and your crazy
girlfriend comes calling for you at the precinct house, barging
right into the men's shower to, um, pay you her respects.
</P>
<P>
   Or you're Officer Mike Dorigan and you drop by the hospital to
patch things up with your fiancee, a medical student, then catch
sight of someone being brought in: Hey, isn't that the guy with the
Harley who escaped unhurt from a crackup you handled just
yesterday?
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, life on the beat as captured by ''The Beat,'' a new police
drama from Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, creators of ''Homicide:
Life on the Street'' and ''Oz.'' It premieres Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST
on UPN.
</P>
<P>
   But this series doesn't just focus on day-to-day policing by
Marinelli and Dorigan in the 12th Precinct of Manhattan's scruffy
Lower East Side. ''The Beat'' also represents an EKG of each young
man's private ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ruffalo plays Zane, an Italian-American whose taste for
twisted dames maybe stems from a childhood trauma: His father
killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''His nature is to be happy-go-lucky,'' says Ruffalo, ''but his
experience in life is dark and damaging. There's constant internal
conflict. For me, that's fun. It's playable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Ruffalo is an about-to-be-star who grew up in Virginia
Beach, Va., and San Diego, studied acting in Los Angeles, then won
praise on the New York stage with ''This Is Our Youth'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His film ''You Can Count on Me,'' in which he costars with Laura
Linney (''The Truman Show''), shared top honors at this year's
Sundance Film Festival. And after ''The Beat'' wrapped its first 13
episodes, he jumped into a new off-Broadway play, ''The Moment
When.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo's ''Beat'' costar, Derek Cecil, who has joined him to
chat with a reporter about the series, hasn't had quite such a
hectic time. A New York transplant from Amarillo, Texas, the
27-year-old Cecil was, in his own words, ''living pretty thin'' by
last summer. ''I was wearing the same shirt to every audition.'' He
laughs a big laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The role he so joyfully landed is that of Mike, the mildly
melancholy counterpoint to free-spirited Zane. Mike, an
Irish-American who has been on the force six months less than his
partner's scant 3{ years, prefers to follow the rules and play
things cautious. (One exception: He likes sushi.)
</P>
<P>
   Mike is engaged to lovely doctor-in-training Elizabeth (played
by Poppy Montgomery), with whom he is having premarital spats.
Zane, on the other hand, has his hands full with psycho-squeeze
Beatrice (a bravura performance by Heather Burns, who played Meg
Ryan's bookstore assistant in the film ''You've Got Mail'').
</P>
<P>
   Could anybody be so rash as to ask Beatrice to share an
apartment? Zane is; Zane did. But the lurking charm of ''The
Beat,'' both on and off the beat, is the naivete of its two heroes
-- even when seasoned judgment is desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a cop, you have to take a position of authority even if you
don't know what the hell is going on,'' says Ruffalo. ''Sometimes,
you just have to fake it.'' This is the life that unites Zane and
Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the visual style of ''The Beat'' suggests that life
around them is flying apart. The series is shot with palm-size,
handheld cameras on what seems to be random scraps of film and
tape: Without warning, the full-color filmic look will give way to
grainy, monochromatic video, busting through with immediacy as if
the show had been jammed by an episode of ''Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   On a series where the director of photography sometimes wears
Rollerblades, the actors also enjoy freedom of movement, says
Ruffalo, noting, ''You don't have to hit any marks.'' You just have
to make sure you don't bounce your nose off the lens: ''Sometimes
those cameras are literally 3 inches from your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is shot on the streets of Manhattan, with Mike (that
is, Derek Cecil) at the wheel of the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit one guy in the head,'' Cecil confesses with a sly grin.
''He was a stunt guy and I was supposed to get really close to him
fairly quickly. The side mirror gave him a minor concussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo rolls his eyes the way a partner does.
</P>
<P>
   But ''The Beat'' faces peril even greater than Cecil's driving:
The shifting sands of UPN, a willfully lowbrow network whose
signature drama is currently ''WWF Smackdown!''
</P>
<P>
   Does UPN know what to do with this sassy, inventive cop show?
Will the audience that frequents UPN know what to make of ''The
Beat''?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's kinda cool to be a little bit the underdog,''
Ruffalo ventures bravely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't really think about it until recently,'' says Cecil,
''but now it's become an issue: 'Oh, gee, I'm on UPN.' Because my
family back home doesn't get it.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Administration: Overhaul World Bank  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration put forward today a
package of proposals to overhaul lending activities at the World
Bank and other regional development banks, hoping the effort will
blunt a congressional drive for even more radical changes.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the World Bank and
regional banks such as the Asian Development Bank should refocus
their efforts on providing loans to projects that would help
alleviate poverty in the world's poorest nations but which are not
likely to attract support from commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Summers said that when loans are made to developing countries that
can attract private capital, such as China and Brazil, those loans
should carry higher interest rates than the World Bank charges for
loans to the poorest nations that don't have access to private
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' package of proposals also included recommendations for
the World Bank to put more emphasis on providing support for
medical vaccines to improve health conditions and on projects that
would protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposals for reform at the development
banks followed a similar set of proposals Summers put forward in a
speech in London in December aimed at promoting change at the
182-national International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposals for both the IMF and the World
Bank do not go nearly as far as a blue ribbon advisory commission
appointed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That panel, chaired by economist Allan Meltzer of Carnegie
Mellon University, called for limiting the IMF to providing
short-term emergency loans to countries facing balance of payments
crises.
</P>
<P>
   The Meltzer commission also called on the World Bank to focus on
the use of grants to the world's poorest nations rather than loans,
and halt two-thirds of the lending it now does to better-off
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   While conservative Republicans in Congress embraced the Meltzer
report, Democrats in the House and Senate attacked its proposals as
too extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's reform recommendations are an effort to put
forward a more moderate set of proposals which the White House
hopes will shape the upcoming debate in Congress and at the
upcoming spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not have the power to impose changes on
the IMF and the other multinational lending institutions, but the
size of U.S. voting shares in all of the organizations gives
America a powerful voice in arguing for changes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency,
the World Bank, both of which are headquartered in Washington, the
regional development banks include the Inter-American Development
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said in all the debate, the world should not lose sight
of the important role played by the development banks in promoting
global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strengthening of the world's economic and financial
institutions and the management of global integration are central
policy challenges of our time,'' Summers said in his speech, copies
of which were released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work of the World Bank and the regional development banks
is probably more important now than it has ever been,'' Summers
said. ''As the president has often observed, today the United
States has as much to fear from states that are too weak as states
that are too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that every dollar that the United States
contributed to the World Bank and the other development banks
spurred $45 in lending programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers said it was important that the money be used in ways
that would promote the largest amount of poverty reduction in
countries willing to put in place necessary economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community cannot want reform and stability
more than a country's own government and people do,'' Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Visibility Key for Oscar Nominees  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Warren Beatty flirted with a presidential run
but decided against it. His wife, Annette Bening, is hot on the
campaign trail, though.
</P>
<P>
   Bening is running for best actress at Sunday's Academy Awards
for her role as a shrill, adulterous real-estate saleswoman in the
Oscar front-runner ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Her visibility in Hollywood trade ads and public appearances has
helped pump up Bening's Oscar prospects against those of Hilary
Swank, the critics' darling and the Golden Globe winner for ''Boys
Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bening ''has been at the opening of every Hollywood car wash and
Dairy Queen,'' joked Thomas O'Neil, an Oscar analyst who is writing
a book about movie awards. ''She has been absolutely everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazine covers, talk shows, Hollywood trade conventions, other
awards ceremonies such as the Screen Actors Guild and Directors
Guild -- all are virtual requirements for nominees hoping to go home
with an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Studios pump as much as $2 million into a movie's Oscar
campaign. They buy dozens of glitzy Oscar ads in Variety and The
Hollywood Reporter, set up screenings, provide video copies of
films to Academy voters and make stars available for interviews and
other appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to admit that last year, Gwyneth Paltrow was
everywhere,'' said USA Films' Steve Flynn of 1998's best-actress
winner for ''Shakespeare in Love.'' ''It was very aggressive and a
smart thing for her to do, and I think it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn's best-actress candidate last year, Cate Blanchett in
''Elizabeth,'' was overseas shooting a picture, and ''her
unavailability definitely hampered my opportunities to keep her
visible'' for Academy consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Big Oscar campaigns can put smaller films at a disadvantage.
Even so, movies with relatively modest Oscar budgets managed to
garner acting nominations this year, including Swank in ''Boys
Don't Cry,'' Janet McTeer in ''Tumbleweeds,'' Richard Farnsworth in
''The Straight Story'' and Sean Penn and Samantha Morton in ''Sweet
and Lowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether any of them can actually win
without an expensive Oscar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Oscar campaigning dates back to the 1920s and '30s, some
critics say it has become too gaudy, cheapening the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole notion of campaigning runs counter to what the
process really is about, which is our members making subjective
evaluations of filmmaking,'' said Ric Robertson, the Academy's
executive administrator.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the Academy instituted rules to prevent
studios from bestowing lush video packages and other gifts on Oscar
voters. Academy officials would like to tone the campaigns down
further but do not see any legal way to restrict such things as
trade ads, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how pervasive are those ads?
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so many you don't even pay attention to them anymore.
It's like a perfume ad in Vogue,'' said Alexander Payne, director
of ''Election.'' He is nominated for adapted screenplay with
co-writer Jim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Like last year with DreamWorks' ''Saving Private Ryan'' and
Miramax's ''Shakespeare in Love,'' the two studios are going
head-to-head for best picture, DreamWorks with ''American Beauty''
and Miramax with ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have the biggest buzz factor and have been the most
visible in trade ads, though other studios have been quick to shell
out Oscar marketing money, Disney for ''The Insider'' and ''The
Sixth Sense,'' Warner Bros. for ''The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, DreamWorks declined to discuss its Oscar
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to trust the Academy,'' said DreamWorks
spokeswoman Vivian Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   Other studios, including Disney, Paramount and Universal, also
refused to talk about Oscar strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Miramax, the Disney-owned independent distributor
that has turned awards campaigning into a science, said Oscar
marketing does not unduly influence the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Trade ads simply encourage Academy members to see a particular
movie, then serve to ''remind people about the emotional reaction
they had to the movie after they had seen it,'' said Mark Gill,
Miramax West Coast president.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Bollinger, an Academy member and Hollywood publicist since
the 1950s who worked on Humphrey Bogart's winning Oscar campaign
for ''The African Queen'' in 1951, said awards marketing is just
part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ''People seem to forget that the Oscars themselves were created
as a marketing tool for the industry,'' Bollinger said. ''I readily
admit I have been influenced by these ads to go and see a film. But
I don't ever remember casting a vote for a film because of its
Oscar campaign.''

   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks finished mostly higher on Monday,
fueled by investors turning to technology and telecom shares.
</P>

<HEADLINE> First lady launches effort to curb Ritalin use among very young  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents should use caution in giving their
preschool children Ritalin and other mind-altering drugs, meant to
treat attention deficit disorders, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton said today, making use of her position as first lady to
highlight a matter that troubles many families.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are intended to treat attention deficit disorders, but
''some of these young people have problems that are symptoms of
nothing more than childhood or adolescence,'' Clinton said at a
White House meeting she called with national health and education
officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan she outlined proposes new government warning labels for
the drugs, a national study of their use and a fall conference on
children's mental health.
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted the efforts are not an attack on medical
treatments for children's emotional well-being, some 125 of which
are in the pipeline. ''Some children do have severe emotional
behavioral problems that can be helped by prescription drugs. These
children are waiting for our help and today we are taking important
steps to provide it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that rapid increases in the drugs' use
bears watching. Recent studies show a doubling to tripling of the
number of children under age 4 taking Ritalin, a common brand name
for the stimulant methylphenidate, which is believed to increase a
child's alertness by stimulating the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit disorder, or ADD, usually is diagnosed in
school-age children based on interviews and observed behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of ADD include the restless inability to sit still to
read, study or even watch television. Often a child cannot play in
group games, and a common symptom is the inability to control
impulses. Some mild forms of these symptoms are common in many
children, leading experts to worry that ADD is diagnosed too often.
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities worry that the drugs supplant behavior therapy,
which in many cases might be more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ritalin, more young children are also taking
clonidine, a blood pressure drug used to treat sleep problems
stemming from attention disorders, and antidepressants such as
Prozac. In the federal Medicaid program, prescriptions for
antidepressants have doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health is about to start a
nationwide study of Ritalin use in children under the age of 6,
said Clarissa Wittenberg, communication director of the mental
health arm of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Children at selected sites around the nation will be observed.
Previous study, Wittenberg said, shows that drugs alone are not the
answer to treating children with such disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''While behavioral therapy can be very effective and medication
was most effective, probably the wisest course to go for treating
children is both,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Supporters of stadium point to more reasons for stadium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Selling naming rights for the proposed
University of Connecticut football stadium in East Hartford could
fetch between $1 million and $3 million, but there may be a few
sticking points before any deals can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-seat stadium, proposed for a 75-acres parcel of land
donated by United Technologies Corp., would cost taxpayers about
$90 million as part of the Adriaen's Landing riverfront development
project. The plan still needs legislative approval, and supporters
say selling the name of a stadium to a corporation could help cover
some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The value of naming-rights deals has exploded in the last five
years, and as far as we can tell, there's no end to it,'' said Dean
Bonham, a Denver-based consultant who has worked on many big
corporate stadium deals.
</P>
<P>
   In two big professional sports deals, Bonham said, American
Airlines paid $195 million for a Dallas hockey and basketball
arena, and Federal Express paid $205 million for the Washington
Redskins football stadium name. College stadiums are also hot, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan said tax laws
may prevent an outright sale of naming rights because the stadium
would belong to the public, financed by tax-free bonds. To get
around that, the state could receive a ''gift'' from a corporate
donor and bestow an honor on the company, in the form of the
stadium's name, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to sell naming rights can also be foiled if UTC insists on
the location name, Bonham said.
</P>
<P>
   Hosting soccer games at the stadium could also bring in more
cash by expanding its use beyond the handful of home UConn football
games.
</P>
<P>
   Planners are designing the stadium to meet specifications for
college, professional and international-level play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is going to have a better stadium for soccer,'' said R.
Bartley Halloran, chairman of the Capital City Economic Development
Authority, which is developing the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said there are no agreements, but the stadium could
hold men's and women's soccer for UConn, as well as the University
of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, an expansion of major league soccer into
Hartford is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   But David Askinas, associate commissioner of the United Soccer
Leagues in Tampa, Fla, called such hopefulness ''a great leap of
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Askinas said the proposed stadium might be too large for many
soccer uses. NCAA soccer draws far smaller crowds, even at the
highest levels, he said; UConn, averaging 2,400 fans per game,
attracts some of the biggest crowds. And the NCAA Final Four, in
December, is always held in a warm-weather state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The point, said Halloran and Richard Gray, the governor's point
man on Adriaen's Landing, is that soccer would be just one more
possibility, with no guarantees of added use. The plan before
lawmakers anticipates only UConn football.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key from the planning standpoint is to design as much
flexibility as possible into the stadium,'' Gray said.

<HEADLINE> No contest plea does not mean admission of guilt, despiteconviction  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE FEICA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)-- A conviction for stealing does not
necessarily mean somebody is a thief, the state Supreme Court said
in ruling that a Groton town worker fired for embezzlement be
returned to his job.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2 decision released Friday involved the case of David
Warren, who sold dumping permits to residents at the town landfill.
He was fired in April 1997 after pleading nolo contendre, or no
contest, to a larceny charge.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was accused of pocketing money for the permits and was
arrested in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement was recorded as a conviction for larceny in
the sixth degree, a misdemeanor involving the theft of $250 or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was fined $85 plus $15 in court costs. He opted for the
plea deal to save at least $5,000 in legal fees, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Warren's union, United Steelworkers of America, took the case to
arbitration and won Warren's reinstatement. The arbitrator had
ruled there was no independent evidence that Warren had stolen
anything, and said he should return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator noted that ''Warren neither had pleaded guilty to
the crime charged nor had he been found guilty after a trial,''
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The town appealed to a lower court which threw out the
arbitrator's decision. The case eventually made its way to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In writing for the majority, Justice Joette Katz said ''There is
.. no factual foundation whatsoever for the assertion that Warren
embezzled even one penny from his employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz wrote that the no contest plea was not necessarily an
admission of guilt, but rather a matter of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arbitrator made a factual finding, which is binding on
this court, that Warren had pleaded nolo contendre, because, for
financial reasons, he had deemed such a plea a more convenient and
cleaner way to resolve the charges against him,'' Katz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Francis M. McDonald and Justice David M. Borden
filed dissents.
</P>
<P>
   Both said there is no distinction between a conviction from a
plea of no contest and a conviction after a guilty plea or trial.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Jail Ban Playboy  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court turned a cold shoulder to
free-speech and pro-nudity claims Monday by refusing to let an
Arizona jail's inmates get Playboy magazines delivered to their
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected a challenge to the jail's ban on all
depictions of frontal nudity. The appeal, turned away without
comment, contended the ban violates inmates' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Maricopa County sheriff's office has prohibited
jail inmates from possessing ''sexually explicit material,'' which
it defines as anything that shows male or female frontal nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The county runs one of the nation's largest jail systems,
housing up to 6,500 inmates at facilities in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Mauro challenged the ban in 1995 after officials denied
his request that his subscription to Playboy be directed to the
cell where he was being held while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro later was convicted of fraud and is an inmate at the
Arizona State Prison in Florence. His case against Maricopa County
and Sheriff Joseph Arpaio had remained alive, however, because he
was seeking monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jail's ban covers publications and inmates' own artwork and
is said to be aimed at preventing inmate fights and harassment of
female jail employees.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge upheld the ban but a three-judge federal
appeals court panel struck it down. The three-judge panel said the
prohibition was too sweeping and would include ''such magazines as
National Geographic, medical journals, artistic works and countless
other materials.''
</P>
<P>
   An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the three-judge panel last August by a 7-4 vote. The
majority of that court concluded the county's policy fell within
guidelines provided by a 1987 Supreme Court decision on jailhouse
censorship because the ban is ''reasonably related to legitimate
penological interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal, Mauro's lawyers noted that a Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue and Victoria's Secret catalog are allowed, but
Michelangelo's ''David'' or concentration camp photographs are
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The county's lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal
because it ''fails to offer any evidence that other inmates have
been denied artistic or scientific publications under the policy.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 117.27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose today, but the broader
market held back as nervous investors waited to see whether the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 117.27 at 10,712.50.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.54 at 1,466.01, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 81.97 at 4,716.16.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led higher by its technology components.
Hewlett-Packard rose 8| to 146 7/16, and Intel rose 6| to 136{.
</P>
<P>
   Also, United Technologies rose 2 3/16 to 56 13/16; AT&AMP;T rose 3[
to 56 5/16; and DuPont rose 1 15/16 to 54{.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portfolio managers have been recognizing value in some of the
old industrial stocks,'' said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist
at J.P. Morgan's private client group. A protracted decline at the
start of the year left many blue-chip companies at bargain prices
before the Dow began bouncing back last week.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Dow components continued to struggle. Boeing
slipped 1/16 to 37[ even after the company's engineers and
technical workers agreed to end a 40-day walkout.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in
electronic commerce, lost more than half its value. Shares
plummeted 127 21/64 to 99 27/64 after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which had soared 2000 percent in the past 12 months
to a high of 333 on March 10, almost singlehandedly caused the
decline in the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies. With its
big run-up, MicroStrategy had become one of the Russell's largest
companies in terms of market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 was down 15.01 at 559.76.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Fed's meeting.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth increase since last June.
Higher interest rates generally send stocks lower because they cut
into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,
said that while he expects a rate increase Tuesday, he believes Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan won't act aggressively for the remainder of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Greenspan does not want to break the back of the best
economic recovery this nation has enjoyed in its history,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 600.03 million
shares, compared with 943.43 at the same time in Friday's busy
session.

<HEADLINE> Senate race in N.J. features contrasting personalities, heavyspending  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EWING, N.J. (AP) -- When Sen. Frank Lautenberg announced last
year that he would retire at the end of his term, former Gov. Jim
Florio saw it as an opportunity to revive his political career.
Wall Street banker Jon S. Corzine saw it as an opportunity to begin
one.
</P>
<P>
   The two are now squared off in a Democratic Senate primary
battle that promises to be one of the most bitterly contested and
expensive of the 2000 political season. Though they share liberal
positions on many key issues, their personalities and campaign
styles are a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, the one-time congressman and one-term governor whose
political career was derailed seven years ago by a series of
unpopular tax increases and an upstart Republican named Christie
Whitman, remains as forceful and self-assured as ever at 62. It's
an image that befits his background as the son of a Brooklyn
shipyard worker, former Navy boxer and lawyer by training.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, also touts his working-class roots as the son of an
Illinois farmer. But there the personal similarities end. Bearded,
soft-spoken, professorial in dress and manner, Corzine made a
fortune on Wall Street. He stepped down as chairman of Goldman
Sachs after taking the investment bank public.
</P>
<P>
   He is cheerful and approachable but has been criticized as a
dull, colorless campaigner and a boring speaker. He acknowledges
his campaign style remains a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am still not Huey Long in this process, but I think we have
made strides. I am a lot more comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a bankroll estimated at more than $300 million, Corzine is
prepared to invest heavily in his political future.
</P>
<P>
   He has already spent some $4 million to lay the groundwork for
his campaign and help Democratic candidates in state races. An ad
campaign launched this week to bolster his minimal name recognition
will spend $888,000 on television ads in the expensive Philadelphia
and New York media markets over seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The big spending has opened the door for Florio and his
supporters to renew their charges that Corzine is trying to buy a
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are having Wall Street, generically, come and acquire a
party in the way that they acquire a company,'' Florio fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has a lot of ground to gain between now and the June 6
primary. Three recent polls indicate his name is known to only
about one in five New Jersey Democrats and have him trailing Florio
2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine has won endorsements from several key county
organizations and party leaders, including Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats warm up to Jon Corzine very quickly,'' said Tom
Byrne, a Democratic Party activist who flirted with a Senate
candidacy himself before Corzine arrived on the scene. Byrne is the
son of former Gov. Brendan Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne questions Florio's electability, citing the baggage he
carries from his ill-starred gubernatorial term.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes way beyond the income tax to the point where many
Democrats who have worked with him over the years do not want to do
so anymore,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of personalities and the furor over spending mask
considerable similarities on the issues. Corzine favors
government-paid health coverage for everyone, tough gun control and
federal programs to provide access to a college education for
anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   He rejects the liberal label -- politely. ''I use the term
progressive,'' he said. ''The fact is that the federal government
has been much more successful that our political process has
allowed it to be painted.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio's platform is tailored to appeal to the party's
traditional working-class constituency: health insurance for
working families and a strong Social Security system for their
retirement.
</P>
<P>

   Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 19
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose today, but the broader
market held back as nervous investors waited to see whether the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting tomorrow.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, but John H. Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc., said that believes Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan won't act aggressively for the remainder of
the year. Just before 3 p.m., the Dow was up 19.86 at 10,615.09. On
the NYSE, decliners edged advancers 1,487-1,423. The Nasdaq fell
169.26 to 4,628.87, fueled by a drop in MicroStrategy, a maker of
software used in electronic commerce. MicroStrategy lost more than
half its value, with shares plummeting 127 21/64 to 99 27/64 after
the company revised its financial results for 1998 and 1999.

   Lehman Beats Analysts' Expectations
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said today its
first-quarter earnings surged 156 percent to $541 million, a figure
well above analysts' predictions. Lehman attributed its strong
results to record revenues in the company's investment banking and
securities trading businesses. Lehman earned $3.69 a share, 59
cents above high-end expectations, for the three months ended Feb.
29. During the first quarter of 1999, the firm reported net income
of $211 million, or $1.57 a share, as Wall Street recovered from a
global financial crisis brought on by economic strife in Asia and
Russia. Shares of Lehman, the fourth largest U.S. securities firm,
were down 2 7/16 this afternoon at 89.

   Feds Phasing Out MTBE Gas Additive
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced today it
will ban MTBE as a gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to
public health and the environment. MTBE, a leading oxygenate and
octane booster used in one-third of the gasoline sold in the United
States, reduces emissions of smog, but it has been linked to
groundwater pollution. Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said her agency will seek to
eliminate use of MTBEs under the Toxic Substance Control Act. She
said the ban, expected to take up to three years to implement,
would have little effect on consumer costs.

   China Oil Imports Expected To Rise

   PARIS (AP) -- China's long-term level of oil imports will
outstrip by three times the country's own forecast, the
International Energy Agency said today. The figures suggest that
China will become a far more influential player in the global oil
market and in the oil-rich Middle East, the agency said. ''China's
economic growth has outstripped its own energy resources,'' said
William Ramsey, deputy director of the IEA. Separately, IEA
Director Robert Priddle urged OPEC countries to release
''substantial'' extra oil supplies to help reduce soaring prices at
the pump.

job. The strike by 15,000 to 17,000 members of the Society of

   U.S. Suggests World Bank Reforms
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration put forward today a
package of proposals to overhaul lending activities at the World
Bank and other regional development banks. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said that the organizations should refocus their
efforts on providing loans for projects in the world's poorest
nations that are not likely to attract support from commercial
banks. In a speech in New York, Summers said that when loans are
made to developing countries that can attract private capital, such
as China and Brazil, those loans should carry higher interest rates
than loans to the nations that don't have access to private capital
markets.

   3 European Stock Markets To Merge
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The planned merger of stock exchanges in France,
Belgium and the Netherlands marks an important step forward in
efforts to forge a pan-European exchange that could compete more
effectively with Wall Street, analysts said. The new exchange,
called Euronext, would be the largest single stock market in
continental Europe and would make it easier and cheaper for
investors to trade shares in companies listed jointly on their
respective exchanges. The combined exchanges would continue to
operate trading floors in all three countries, and each would list
the stocks of its partners. Market capitalization of the listed
companies would be $2.3 trillion. Euronext, to be incorporated as a
Dutch company, hopes to complete its merger within the next seven
months.

   Inflation Rate Rises in EU Nations
</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The inflation rate in the 11 euro-zone
countries was 2.0 percent in February, up from 1.9 percent in
January and 0.8 percent a year ago. Also, the European Union
statistical office Eurostat said that annual inflation in the 15 EU
nations rose to 1.9 percent in February from 1.8 percent in
January. In February 1999, EU inflation stood at 1.0 percent. The
rise is significant because the European Central Bank has set 2.0
percent as its target ceiling for inflation in the euro zone. The
highest annual inflation - a year-on-year rise of 4.6 percent - was
recorded in Ireland.

truck and bus maker Scania as anticompetitive. According to a
report in the Milan daily Corriere della Sera, Fiat and its truck
unit Iveco would most likely bid solely for Scania.

<HEADLINE> Family seeks investigation of inmate's death  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Plainfield man hung himself in jail two
days after he lost a bid to withdraw his guilty plea to killing his
mother-in-law, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at East Jersey State Prison found Mark Masters hanging
by a bedsheet in his cell at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, Department of
Corrections spokesman Chris Carden said. Carden said he did not
know when guards had last seen Masters alive.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mitzner, Masters' attorney, said Monday family members
spoke to Masters on Saturday night and said Masters was in good
spirits and understood that his loss in court on Friday was not the
end of his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was apparently fearful for his life because he had had an
altercation with sheriff's officers,'' Mitzner said.
</P>
<P>
   Carden said the Corrections Department would investigate the
death as it does every inmate death, but said Monday, ''There's no
indication of foul play.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters, a 37-year-old former handyman, had been serving a
30-year sentence since 1993 for strangling his 74-year-old
mother-in-law, Mary Mason, and cutting off her hands with an ax on
March 4, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Masters surrendered to police at the Plainfield home he shared
with his wife, mother-in-law and stepdaughter after a 19-hour
standoff with police that ended when he shot himself in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Masters pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but later asked to
withdraw his plea, saying he had proof that his wife at the time,
Minka Barany, killed her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Masters appealed to state Superior Court Judge Ross Anzaldi for
an evidentiary hearing on Friday, presenting an affidavit from
stepdaughter Dominique Barany, who said Minka Barany confessed to
her months after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''She told me that she killed her mother and that it was all her
fault that her mother was dead,'' said Dominique Barany, who was 13
at the time of the killing, in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Masters told Mitzner he entered a guilty plea because Minka
Barany told him she would kill her daughter if he didn't take the
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Masters became violent in court on Friday, biting Union County
Sheriff's Officer Scott Jones in the left arm and requiring several
more to restrain him, Sheriff Ralph G. Froehlich said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's officers only handled his transfer from the
courthouse to the Union County Jail and had no contact with him at
East Jersey State Prison, Froehlich said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 162; Dow Rises 51  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply today as
profit-taking investors once again moved money out of technology
stocks and into old-fashioned industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 162.76 at 4,635.37.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 51.19 at 10,646.42, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 10.24 at 1,454.23.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the Nasdaq diverged as investors drew money out of
lesser-known names in the software and biotechnology groups and
poured it into computer makers and more established technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led higher by Hewlett-Packard, up 8| to 146 7/16,
and Intel, up 6| to 136{.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in
electronic commerce, lost more than half its value. Shares
plummeted 127 21/64 to 99 27/64 after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which had soared 2000 percent in the past 12 months
to a high of 333 on March 10, almost singlehandedly caused the
decline in the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies. With its
big run-up, MicroStrategy had become one of the Russell's largest
companies in terms of market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 was down 20.50 at 554.27.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies also contributed to the Nasdaq's
weakness as investors took profits from the sector's big run early
this year. The Nasdaq's Biotechnology Index more than doubled
between Dec. 1 and March 7, leaving those companies vulnerable to
profit-taking. President Clinton's announcement last week that he
wants to make some genetic research openly available -- rather than
bought and sold by biotech companies -- has unsettled many
investors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 5} to 79[ and Amgen fell 4 51/64 to 58 21/64.
</P>
<P>
   While those stocks fell, investors sought out blue-chip
including United Technologies, up 1] to 56; AT&AMP;T, up 2{ to 55
11/16; and DuPont, up 1| to 54 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portfolio managers have been recognizing value in some of the
old industrial stocks,'' said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist
at J.P. Morgan's private client group. A protracted decline at the
start of the year left many blue-chip companies at bargain prices
before the Dow began bouncing back last week.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Dow components continued to struggle. Boeing
slipped [ to 37 1/16 even after the company's engineers and
technical workers agreed to end a 40-day walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Fed's meeting.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth increase since last June.
Higher interest rates generally send stocks lower because they cut
into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,
said that while he expects a rate increase Tuesday, he believes Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan won't act aggressively for the remainder of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Greenspan does not want to break the back of the best
economic recovery this nation has enjoyed in its history,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 734.74 million
shares, compared with 1.07 billion at the same time in Friday's
busy session.

<HEADLINE> North Mozambique Hit By New Floods  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Just as aid agencies were making
headway in feeding hundreds of thousands displaced by flooding in
southern and central Mozambique, new floods hit a remote northern
region Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Messalo River overflowed its banks in the northern province
of Gabo Delgado after a week of torrential rain, submerging up to
four villages. The floods blocked the main road to Tanzania -- about
70 miles to the north -- and cut several districts off from the rest
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the damage was still being assessed, but the scale
was nothing like that caused by floods in the central and southern
areas last month.
</P>
<P>
   No lives had been lost or were at risk in the northern flooding,
said Silvano Langa, head of the country's national disaster
management agency.
</P>
<P>
   Farmlands, homes and businesses have also been flooded over the
past week in a northwest district near Mozambique's border with
Zimbabwe, Langa said. The Zambezi River flows through the area.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao told reporters he feared more
flooding would occur along the Zambezi River -- which is fed by
rivers in neighboring Malawi -- because Malawi has had heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels had risen Monday on the flooded southern Limpopo
River, and on the central Save and Buzi rivers, but government
officials said they were expected to fall again.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozambican weather bureau predicted light showers would
continue over much of the country until Wednesday, when the weather
was expected to clear.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program, meanwhile, planned to move 230 tons of
food overland from Zimbabwe to Zumbu and distribute it by boat to
villagers affected by flooding along the Zambezi River, said Abby
Spring, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll from the floods still stood at 492 on
Monday. Langa said more bodies had been found, and the death toll
was in the process of being revised.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military teams began scaling down their aid flights to
an estimated 360,000 flood victims being housed in aid camps. Four
British and two German helicopters left Mozambique on Sunday,
reducing to 47 the number of aircraft available for relief
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's six helicopters and seven planes were
scheduled to continue flying relief flights until April 2.
</P>
<P>
   While trucks are increasingly being used to distribute food,
helicopters are still sorely needed in areas where roads washed
away by the floods have yet to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   But Simao said the phased withdrawal of the aircraft would not
affect aid distribution, and civilian aircraft would be hired if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union announced Monday it will increase its annual
economic assistance to Mozambique to $150 million for 2000, a 50
percent increase over 1999 aid levels.
</P>
<P>
   The EU pledged to continue sending emergency aid for another six
months. The 15 EU member nations have already donated $85 million
to Mozambique, and have approved $156 million in debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Plummet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures plummeted Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after a wet weekend in the Midwest tempered
concerns of a crop-wrecking drought this spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean prices gave back all the gains they posted in a strong
rally last Friday, tumbling on heavier-than-expected rainfall in
key growing areas. The big runup in prices late last week had been
predicated partly on forecasts for a dry weekend, which were proven
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Corn fell for the same reasons, also pressured by new forecasts
for rain in the Midwest later this week which should reduce drought
worries.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices were another victim of the weather-driven
commodities markets. Wheat sank immediately due to the weekend
rains in the central United States, and were pushed lower by the
forecasts for precipitation in the winter wheat belt later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 6 cents to $2.66\ a bushel; May corn
fell 5 cents to $2.35} a bushel; May oats fell { cent to $1.21{ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 11} cents to $5.25} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .28 cent to 72.20 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 83.40 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .08 cent to 71 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .65 cent
to 92.72 cents a pound.

patient to undergo the implant procedure, which was developed by a
consortium of European researchers to help people who have lost the
use of their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, surgeons implanted 15 electrodes on nerves and
muscles in Merger's legs, connecting them with wires to a computer
chip embedded in his abdomen. The procedure had to be repeated in
February after problems arose.
</P>
<P>
   Merger was able to stand up by himself in early March, and he
took his first steps last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a whole lot of people like me who need this,''
Merger said during a news conference at European Union headquarters
Monday. ''It's hard to imagine not being able to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Pierre Rabischong of Montpellier University in France,
a project coordinator, said the implanted chip allows Merger to
create artificial muscle movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to reproduce what happens in the brain ... with
electrodes to nerves and muscles,'' said Rabischong. ''We are not
working miracles here, but allowing patients to stand up using
their own muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, scientists hope patients will be able to control
their movements by pressing buttons on a walking cane now under
development that will act as a remote control. For now, scientists
transmit instructions to the chip via computer. The signals are
transmitted to the electrodes in the legs and converted into muscle
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are by no means at the end of the road. A lot of work is
still required,'' Rabischong said.
</P>
<P>
   Merger was living proof of that Monday. A demonstration of him
walking at EU headquarters had to be postponed because a computer
glitch failed to communicate commands to the computer chip, meaning
he could not walk.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle Tronconi, 23, is one of six people due to receive
implants later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I will be able to reduce my disability and to be able
to do more things than I can do right now,'' the 23-year-old
Italian said. ''I hope to walk because of the research
developments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabischong said that there are more than 300,000 people in
Europe with paralysis of the lower limbs. Their average age is 31,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and six governments -- France, the
Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Italy, and Britain -- have been
working on developing the technology since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Previous electronic systems have allowed paralyzed people to
stand and walk with a walker, sometimes for more than a mile, said
Naomi Kleitman, director of education at the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Those
systems use electrodes taped on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Systems that implant computer-controlled electrodes have tested
in the lab for many years as well, she said. They may allow more
sophisticated control over leg nerves and muscles, although there
has been some problems with long-term maintenance of the implanted
electrodes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleitman said she couldn't comment directly on the European
system without knowing more details.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Pursues Cheaper Oil  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Richardson's itch to travel is no secret.
As a congressman, U.N. ambassador and now secretary of energy, he
may have logged as many miles journeying as anyone in President
Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   He's on the road again this week, this time in search of greater
oil production and lower fuel prices. The outcome may determine
whether the Hispanic former lawmaker remains on the list of
often-mentioned potential vice presidential running mates on the
Democratic ticket with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Trotting the globe on a moment's notice, Richardson gained
notoriety as a congressman with a string of unorthodox freelance
diplomatic missions that won freedom for American hostages in North
Korea, Iraq and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the point man in Clinton's ''quiet diplomacy'' aimed
at convincing members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to open their spigots and push back prices that -- if not
contained -- could drive the world economy into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is to decide March 27 on new production levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it looks good for (oil) production increases,''
Richardson said in an interview before departing for Africa and
then on to Europe for meetings with energy ministers from Nigeria,
Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and others.
</P>
<P>
   He packs what he considers his lucky charm: a travel-worn,
rumpled blue blazer that became a trademark in the mid-1990s rescue
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have it with me,'' he said, adding after a pause, ''I'm
going to need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 52, the most visible Hispanic in Clinton's
administration and a New Mexico congressman for 14 years, must
wonder sometimes about his luck since leaving the U.N. post to
become energy secretary 15 months ago. The Energy Department
usually doesn't garner a lot of headlines. When he moved there,
some thought he might disappear from the limelight despite his
acknowledged political ambitions and folksy style.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has found himself enmeshed in almost continuous
damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was the uproar over security problems and alleged
espionage at the department's nuclear weapons labs. Richardson
scrambled from one congressional hearing to another and onto
weekend television news programs to stay one step ahead of critics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be higher, both economically and
politically, as Republicans view the specter of $2-a-gallon
gasoline this summer as fodder for attacks against the
administration and Vice President Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Public unrest at the gas pumps comes at an untimely moment for
Richardson as well. As the administration's most prominent
Hispanic, he frequently has been discussed as a possible No. 2 on a
Gore presidential ticket. But if negotiations with OPEC fail and
the gasoline price run-up is not abated, Richardson could be
blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson witnessed the grassroots force of the issue last
weekend in California, where he met with Saudi Arabia's oil
minister. People recognized him, he said, and they wanted to know
what was being done to bring gasoline prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe our (approach) of quiet diplomacy has been working,
so we're continuing it,'' he said. Without offering specifics, he
said he hopes for ''sizable production increases in a timely
fashion,'' predicting that would prompt prices to start falling by
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources say Richardson privately has expressed
concern that talk of U.S. use of its emergency oil reserve or
threats against oil producing countries could anger some OPEC
members and jeopardize any increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Richardson has sought to convince the OPEC ministers
that it is in their interest to pump more oil.
</P>
<P>
   During his trips to the Persian Gulf last month, he and his
staff swamped the Saudi and Kuwaiti ministers with charts and
statistics showing the dramatic shortfall in oil inventories, the
expected demand and the possibility that $30 dollar-a-barrel oil
might send not only America's economy but also the world's into a
tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument he intends to repeat in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to stress the importance of sufficient increases in
a timely fashion,'' said Richardson. ''I'm not pressuring. ... The
OPEC ministers, all who I talked to, recognize that high oil prices
have become a problem and what is needed is stable prices.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Party Admits Financial Woes  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President-elect Chen Shui-bian, whose
party acknowledges it's a novice in financial affairs and lacks a
ready pool of talent to draw on, faces a tough challenge in trying
to run Taiwan's complex economy.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has one of Asia's most stellar economies -- it rode out
the financial crisis of the late 1990s virtually unscathed, largely
because of the island's huge success in creating a world-leading
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   But after Chen's opposition Democratic Progressive Party rocked
the political structure of Taiwan with his election win Saturday,
his young and inexperienced party now has to deal with issues that
were handled by the Nationalists for more than 50 years, since
Taiwan and China were politically separated.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to crucial economic issues -- naming a team to run
the Finance Ministry, for example -- Chen has no ready pool of
talent to draw on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial expertise of the DPP is not good, or not enough
in the quantity sense,'' Chen's executive campaign manager, Chiou
I-jen, told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't mean we're worried about Taiwan's financial
performance,'' Chiou added.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy should chug along well enough to withstand
any minor bumps along the way as the DPP deals with its economic
learning curve, Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
   The DPP has made enormous gains in local and legislative
politics in its 13-year history, but Chen's victory will give the
party its first leadership opportunities at the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices plunged Monday on Chen's victory, and panicky
Taiwanese dumped their currency in favor of the U.S. dollar. As it
often has, the Taiwanese government moved to limit the decline by
purchasing shares and propping up the Taiwan dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But the government warned investors that they will have to live
with the outcome of Saturday's election. Vice Finance Minister Yen
Ching-chang told traders that if they keep selling, Taiwan cannot
indefinitely keep buying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the shares of a few companies rallied on hopes that Chen
will lift bans on direct air and shipping links with China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who takes office on May 20, on Monday reaffirmed he wants
to improve trade ties with the huge, developing market in China,
which is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   China has been apprehensive about Chen since his party favors
formal independence for Taiwan, while Beijing has sought
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, politics and business have long been closely linked,
and Chen's administration will end up in charge of a number of big
state-owned industries -- such as utilities, the telephone company,
banks, oil refineries -- that have been controlled for decades by
the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Even the big air carrier, China Airlines, is run by a board of
trustees appointed mostly by the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over such enterprises is no task for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan also has hundreds of small businesses owned by the
Nationalist Party, and there could be disputes over whether some
property was obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Chiou, the campaign manager, said the DPP worries that the
Nationalists might try to walk away with some of their assets for
fear the new government will challenge their ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we can't get any concrete information,'' about some
Nationalist holdings, Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiou said Chen's team will ''wait and watch'' and hopes to meet
soon to discuss the workings of Taiwan's business world with
President Lee Teng-hui and the party's investment manager, Liu
Tai-ying.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns may turn out to be exaggerated, but change is
clearly on the way and it won't necessarily be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chen is going to break some of the business behavior patterns
of the past,'' said Peter Kurz, the top executive in Taiwan for
Wall Street investment bank Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic modus operandi of how you do business here in Taiwan
is going to change,'' Kurz added. ''Chen is going to be a reformer,
and some of the cozy ties between business and government from the
past will change.''

White House postpones Germany trip.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton has postponed a May
visit to Germany for talks with world leaders because British Prime
Minister Tony Blair is unable to attend, a White House spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to reschedule. No new date has been set,'' said
Mike Hammer of the National Security Council staff, accompanying
Clinton on a six-day visit to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to have spent May 1-2 in Aachen, Germany, for a
conference with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema and Blair. Clinton also was to have
received a prestigious award, the International Charlemagne Prize.
Hammer said the May dates conflict with Blair's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that a stop in Germany will be tagged on when
Clinton visits Portugal for a June 5 summit with European Union

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise in Treasury Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $8.5 billion in three-month bills
at a discount rate of 5.780 percent, up from 5.730 percent last
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a
rate of 5.895 percent, up from 5.860 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the highest since Feb. 13, 1995, when
the bills sold for 5.820 percent. The six-month rate was the
highest since April 3, 1995, when the rate was 5.900.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.947 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,853.90 and 6.160 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,702.00.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.20
percent last week from 6.18 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Flies Into Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By ELMIRA KOZHAYEVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Playing up his image as a tough leader,
acting President Vladimir Putin flew into Chechnya in a fighter jet
on Monday and said he was ready to hold talks with rebels.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly inspecting parts of the devastated Chechen capital
on a dramatic pre-election visit, Putin signaled that Moscow was
willing to discuss the republic's future if the rebels give up
their weapons and abandon armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready with those people -- even with those people -- to
start talks,'' Putin said in Khankala, a suburb of Grozny. ''They
have this choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped short of calling for peace talks with the rebels,
repeating Moscow's demands that they surrender their weapons in
return for amnesty. The Russian government has said some top rebel
leaders would face criminal charges even if they surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's visit appeared tied to presidential elections Sunday, in
which he holds a commanding lead. He came to Grozny in the back of
a two-man Sukhoi 27 fighter jet, wearing a leather flight jacket
over a business suit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Putin sounded a conciliatory note with his
remarks on possible talks about the future of Chechnya. Many
Russians approve of his handling of the war, but the government has
shown signs of wanting to wrap it up.
</P>
<P>
   While the rebels have been driven into the mountains, they have
not given up fighting despite repeated Russian claims that the
insurgents have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin also warned that Moscow is ready to continue the war,
saying the rebels would be blockaded in the mountains and hunted
down by special forces troops. ''They will be eliminated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Putin's first visit to Grozny since Russian troops
captured it early last month after bombarding the city for months
with artillery and air strikes. It was not known if Putin visited
Grozny before.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian assault has left the city a wasteland of shattered
buildings, and some officials had proposed abandoning it. But Putin
said Monday that ''Grozny will be slowly restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin inspected a unit of paratroopers scheduled to be pulled
out of Chechnya and honored soldiers with medals and other awards.
</P>
<P>
   The advances against the rebels have allowed Russia to begin
scaling down its military operation and Putin said ''there is no
sense in keeping surplus troops in the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that an extended military presence could be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have a lot of problems and it is clear that this
demands significant forces,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a news report said a Russian pilot taken hostage in
October had been freed in Komsomolskoye, a Chechen town captured by
Russian forces after two weeks of heavy shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Alexander Zhukov was seized when his jet went down in
Chechnya during a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces raised the Russian flag over Komsomolskoye on
Monday, claiming control of it after fighting with small pockets of
rebels earlier in the day. About 75 rebels surrendered there
Monday, Russian news media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Interfax news agency reported that a Chechen
field commander, Salautdin Timirbulatov, had been captured by
Russian troops. Russian television stations later broadcast a
videotape purportedly showing him executing a prisoner of war from
the previous Chechnya conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of hostages have been taken in Chechnya since the
republic won de facto independence from Russia at the end of a
1994-96 war. Moscow has said that one of the reasons behind its
current campaign to retake Chechnya is to stop the kidnappings and
restore order to the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September,
preceded by weeks of air raids. The offensive began after rebels
invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last summer.

<HEADLINE> Senegal Pres. Diouf Concedes Loss  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- President Abdou Diouf conceded Monday that
longtime rival Abdoulaye Wade defeated him in Senegal's weekend
elections, marking a triumph for democratic change on a continent
plagued by fraudulent balloting, coups and civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands took to the streets in the capital, Dakar, to
celebrate what was once unthinkable in Africa -- a sitting president
admitting an election loss.
</P>
<P>
   After an uninterrupted 40-year rule by his Socialist Party, some
celebrants were surprised the Diouf had willingly given up power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I dreaming?'' laughed Boubacar Diop, whose car was full of
celebrating youths. ''I don't think I'm still sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Diouf telephoned Wade early Monday to acknowledge his loss in
Sunday's run-off elections.
</P>
<P>
   He told Wade that being president is ''a difficult mission and I
wish you all the luck in the world,'' Diouf's campaign manager,
Khalifa Sall, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's concession was also read on state radio. While no date
has been set for the inauguration of the new president, it is
expected to occur on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling parties who control campaign funds, and often electoral
authorities, rarely lose elections in Africa. The few African
countries that have had handovers from one elected government to
another -- including South Africa, Zambia, Benin and Cape Verde --
have become icons of peaceful change.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's Socialist Party had been in power since independence
from France in 1960. Wade had warned of a popular revolt if Diouf,
64, won a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Wade told his supporters Sunday to ''remain vigilant'' for
''serious election anomalies. But after Diouf conceded, the angry
campaign cry of ''Sopi!'' -- meaning ''Change!'' in the Wolof
language -- suddenly turned into a victory cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is destiny. This is paradise!'' cried Serigne Fallou, a
41-year-old Wade supporter who camped out all night outside the
candidate's home in Dakar. ''We are in heaven today.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Diouf, who came to power in 1981, of fostering a
corrupt elite and ignoring the country's poor. In recent years,
unemployment and crime have increased in Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, 73, tapped a growing desire among poor voters for change.
Nearly two-thirds of the West African nation's population is
illiterate; hospitals and roads are badly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal, with a population of 10 million in an area about the
size of South Dakota, has had a reputation as one of Africa's most
stable nations, and one of the few to hold regular elections.
</P>
<P>
   It has a vibrant trading economy despite few natural resources
and its status as one of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The vote featured a battle of personalities, with little
emphasis on policy or ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Although official results were unavailable Monday, private and
public radio stations said early returns showed Wade winning by a
large margin in cities and major towns.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's campaign spokesman, Momar Thiam, said he won more than 60
percent of the vote. However, this could not be independently
confirmed and Diouf's campaign headquarters were nearly abandoned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of violence, ballot theft and other irregularities
marred Sunday's vote. Several injuries and dozens of arrests were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Dakar, voter turnout appeared lighter than in the first-round
balloting, in which Diouf won 41 percent compared to 31 percent for
Wade, but neither won the simple majority needed for election.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf is planning to lead his party's parliamentary opposition
and has no plans to give up politics, Sall said, noting ''He is not
the kind of man to abandon a sinking ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wade left Dakar on Monday to pay homage to his Muslim
religious mentor in the town of Touba, about 120 miles to the east.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Wants To Get Into Debates  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reform Party and Patrick Buchanan demanded
a podium at the presidential debates Monday, saying that
Republicans and Democrats are conspiring to rob the third party of
any chance to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we're asking is a chance to be heard in those debates, and
make the case for a new American foreign policy, a new trade
policy, a new immigration policy,'' Buchanan said after filing a
complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is, if you will, a conspiracy by the two parties to keep
third parties out of the presidential debates and therefore to
maintain a hammerlock on the presidency of the United States,'' he
added. ''Without the debates, there really is no chance, I believe,
that the Reform Party can win the presidency of the United States,
and that is grossly unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, Buchanan and the Reform Party take issue with
a ruling Jan. 6 by the Commission on Presidential Debates that only
candidates with 15 percent standing in five national public opinion
surveys may participate in the events. Buchanan, who has not yet
won the Reform Party nomination, now stands in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's executive director, Janet Brown, said the rules
were ''fair and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The CPD's mission is to sponsor debates that will present the
leading candidates for president of the United States to the public
in an informative manner,'' she said in a statement. ''We are
confident that our plan ... will allow us to achieve that
objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC has 90 days to respond to the complaint. If it does not
allow Buchanan and the Reform Party to participate, the
conservative commentator says he will take the case to federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Reform Party Chairman Pat Choate said the 15
percent threshold is arbitrary as well as skewed by the fact that
commission leaders are members of major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a single member of the Reform Party on the
commission itself,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The sample sizes and the questions asked in the polls vary from
news outlet to news outlet, none of which are ''hotbeds of
Buchananism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that perhaps they are not objective institutions to
be deciding whether or not I ought to be in a presidential
debate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Buchanan said, the rules would hurt voters by
excluding his views on such issues as immigration and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''My views, our views, Reform Party views, the views of
millions, the majority in some cases, a significant minority in
others, won't get heard in the presidential election if we're
denied access to that debate, and fairness demands it,'' Buchanan
said.

<HEADLINE> Strollers, Pull Toys Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 44,000 jogging strollers were recalled
Monday because their brakes may fail, causing runners to lose
control and endanger children riding in them, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally 4,900 wooden pull toys were recalled because a part
may fall off and cause a choking hazard to small children.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC said the stroller recall involved the single and double
models of the InSTEP and Healthrider jogging stroller, manufactured
by Minnesota-based InSTEP LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, including Burlington Coat Factory, J.C. Penney and
Target sold the strollers nationwide between December 1998 and July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the recall involved seven models, ZS100,
ZD200, ZS100WS, ZD200WS, ZS100HR, PR100 and PR200, which consumers
should stop using immediately and contact the company for a repair
kit. No injuries have been reported, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The pull toy recall involves ''The Wooden Pull Along Bead
Coaster'' manufactured by Maxim Enterprise Inc. of Middleboro,
Mass. sold nationwide by Zany Brainy stores from November 1999
until last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wheels can break off and the bead can detach from the pull
string, posing small parts choking hazards to young children,'' the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident a detached bead was found in a child's mouth,
but no injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should return the toys to the store for a $15 refund.

<HEADLINE> Armed Man Arrested Near Queen  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A man with an 8-inch kitchen knife
strapped to his leg was stopped by police Monday when he attempted
to make his way into a convention center that was the site of a
lunch for Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Philip Pailthorpe, 39, sought to pass himself off as a
member of the elite Special Air Services but was grabbed by police
because he was seemed suspicious, police Superintendent Donald
Graham said. He was wearing a white T-shirt and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Pailthorpe was charged with unlawfully
possessing a knife in a public place and possession of cannabis.
His lawyer told the court Pailthorpe would plead guilty but that he
did not intend to harm the queen.
</P>
<P>
   ''His intention was protecting the queen at all times, not
harming her in any way,'' Simon Bleasel said. He told the court
Pailthorpe suffers from a nervous disorder that requires
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Pailthorpe was ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment
before appearing in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the kitchen knife, police who arrested Pailthorpe
at the Sydney Convention Center found what was possibly a hoax bomb
-- a plastic container containing batteries and wires -- in his
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   The incident recalled a visit by Prince Charles in 1994, when a
man lunged at the prince and fired blank shots from a starting
pistol. The man was arrested and Charles, who stayed calm
throughout, was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The security alert came on the first full day of the queen's
13th tour of Australia, her first visit since Australians voted
last November to keep her as their head of state.
</P>
<P>
   As the drama was unfolding at the convention center, the queen,
dressed in a matching lime-green skirt, coat and hat, was given a
21-gun salute and met by an honor guard outside the city's Opera
House.
</P>
<P>
   Despite humidity and rain, about 3,000 people turned out to
catch a glimpse of their monarch as she was met by Prime Minister
John Howard. Looking happy and relaxed, the queen and her husband,
Prince Philip, smiled and waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The royal couple later had lunch at the convention center with
dignitaries including Howard, a monarchist whose backing helped
seal victory for the queen's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the vote, the queen said in a speech that she
accepted and respected the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shall continue faithfully to serve as queen of Australia ...
to the very best of my ability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, however, the queen appeared to acknowledge that
her days as Australia's ruler may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the future may bring, my lasting respect and deep
affection for Australia and Australians everywhere will remain as
strong as ever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday in Canberra, the queen had a brief private audience
with Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chairwoman Evelyn Scott,
who briefed the monarch on attempts to lay the groundwork for
reconciliation between Aboriginals -- the nation's original but now
underprivileged inhabitants -- and other Australians.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the queen is scheduled to tour Sydney's Olympic site
-- the closest she will get to the 2000 games since Howard, in a
break with tradition, has not invited her to open the events on
Sept. 15.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 187; Dow Ends Up 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply today as
investors once again moved money out of newer technology stocks and
into shares of more established computer makers and old-fashioned
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite
index was down 187.62 at 4,610.51.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 85.01 at 10,680.24.
Broader indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the Nasdaq diverged as investors drew money out of
lesser-known names in the software and biotechnology groups and
poured it into the largest, most dominant technology companies.
Hewlett-Packard, Intel and IBM led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the very high prices of many of these stocks, people who
want to be heavily invested in technology are believing that maybe
they should stick with the tried and true,'' said Richard A.
Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors combined to derail the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in electronic commerce,
lost more than half its value after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999. The change came after
MicroStrategy altered the way it recognizes revenue to comply with
current requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which had soared 2000 percent in the past 12 months
to a high of 333 on March 10, almost singlehandedly caused the
decline in the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies.
MicroStrategy's woes also hastened investors' move toward more
established technology companies, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their problems really rattled investors,'' Dickson said. ''If
you're investing in IBM, you know they're not going to hit you with
this kind of accounting surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers were mostly lower after Barron's magazine
reported this weekend that dozens of prominent companies are
strapped for cash and may go out of business unless they're
acquired or receive major new investments. Amazon.com and eToys
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies also contributed to the Nasdaq's
weakness as investors took profits from the sector's big run early
this year. The Amex Biotechnology Index more than doubled between
Dec. 1 and March 7, leaving those companies vulnerable to
profit-taking. Also, President Clinton's announcement last week
that he wants to make some genetic research openly available --
rather than bought and sold by biotech companies -- has unsettled
many investors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen and Amgen fell.
</P>
<P>
   While those stocks fell, investors sought out blue-chip stocks
including United Technologies, AT&AMP;T and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portfolio managers have been recognizing value in some of the
old industrial stocks,'' said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist
at J.P. Morgan's private client group. ''There's not a lot of money
coming out of the market, but money is being channeled from the new
economy to the old.''
</P>
<P>
   A protracted decline at the start of the year left many
blue-chip companies at bargain prices before the Dow began bouncing
back last week.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Fed's meeting.
Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates
by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth increase since last June.
Higher interest rates generally send stocks lower because they cut
into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 7.84 to 1,456.63.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,584 down, 1,378 up and 490
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 912.91 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.29
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 25.56 to
549.21.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Predicts Fed Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
bluntly signaled that the central bank will keep raising interest
rates until the economy's red-hot growth slows to a more moderate
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting that the next increase, the fifth rate
boost since last June, will occur Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essentially a foregone conclusion,'' said William
Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock in Boston. ''Greenspan has
laid out the logic that demand is growing too fast, spurred by
stock prices, and it is unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market
Committee will announce its decision around 2:15 EST Tuesday,
following one of their eight regularly scheduled meetings for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, the Fed has raised rates four times in
quarter-point steps, boosting the federal funds rate -- the interest
banks charge each other -- to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks in turn have increased their prime lending rate
in lockstep with the Fed's moves, pushing the benchmark for
millions of consumer and business loans to 8.75 percent, its
highest level since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all of the Fed's efforts have done little to slow an
economy that has continued to surge ahead, powered by robust
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's gross domestic product grew by a torrid 6.9 percent
rate in the final three months of last year and many economists
believe growth in the current January-March quarter will come in
around 5 percent, far above the 3.5 percent rate the Fed would like
to see at this stage of the expansion that began in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has warned in recent speeches that the strong consumer
demand, which he said was being powered by the boom in wealth
created by the stock market, cannot continue to outstrip supply
without triggering serious inflation problems.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Greenspan's warning seemed to indicate the Fed was
aiming its interest rate increases squarely at the high-flying
stock market, prompting some in Congress to question what business
the Fed has in trying to jack up interest rates in order to make
stock prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   But other economists believe Greenspan's comments were
misinterpreted, saying his real point was that strong demand, from
whatever source, must calm down to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed is in a no-win situation right now,'' said Diane
Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago, who said the central
bank is trying to raise rates enough now to slow growth before
inflation gets out of hand, when they would be forced to slam on
the brakes even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ''If inflation was already out of control, everybody would be up
in arms and say, 'Why isn't the Fed tightening more?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the underlying rate of inflation, after taking out the
big boost in energy prices, has remained benign. Core consumer
prices rose just 1.9 percent last year, the best performance in 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been on a wild ride this year, with the Dow
Jones industrial average posting huge declines from late January
until last week, when it roared back to life with a 666 point gain
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the Fed might be considering a half-point
rate hike Tuesday if not for the fact that they don't want to be
seen adding to market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday, many economists are looking for at least two more
rate increases, at the May 16 meeting and the June 28 meeting,
pushing the funds rate up to 6.5 percent, the highest level since
January 1991, when President Bush was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After that, many analysts believe the central bank will wait to
see how the economy reacts during the summer and fall presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may be able to stay on hold for the rest of the year if
the economy slows, something that will be helped not only by higher
interest rates but rising energy prices, which means consumers will
be spending more at the gas pumps and less in department stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the economy will slow in the second half of the year,
in part because of higher interest rates and higher oil prices,''
said David Wyss, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ''The Fed
wanted to move early in the year before the campaign gets under
way.''

<HEADLINE> German Party Nominates First Woman  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's conservatives nominated the first woman
and first former East German to head a major political party on
Monday, a step hailed as a milestone in the country's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Merkel's nomination as Christian Democrat Party
chairwoman follows a devastating campaign financing scandal that
had left the country's dominant postwar party nearly on its
deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it unbelievable that I could be nominated with the full
unified support of the party to the chairmanship,'' Merkel said.
''This is a piece of German unification that until some time ago I
could never have imagined living through.''
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, 45, will face no challengers at a convention in April
where she is expected to be confirmed as party head, following in
the footsteps of such prominent German politicians as Konrad
Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She will replace Wolfgang Schaeuble, who
was pressured to resign last month over his handling of the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Under Schaeuble's leadership, the party faced one damaging
revelation after another in the wake of Kohl's admission in
December that he accepted up to $1 million from donors he has
refused to name.
</P>
<P>
   Even Schaeuble was forced to admit he had accepted $50,000 in
cash from a key figure in the scandal -- contradicting his own
earlier statements to parliament that he had never met that person.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel's rapid rise in the party has led to speculation she
could become Germany's first woman chancellor candidate, although
she told reporters Monday that no decision would be made this year
on who would run in the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show Merkel's popularity has surged, making her the
second highest-rated politician, behind the Christian Democratic
Saxony state governor Kurt Biedenkopf and ahead of the public's
previous political darling, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble said Merkel's nomination was secured by the
''unusually large'' endorsements she received at local party
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great step in German unity to have an East German woman
as chairwoman of a major German party,'' said Biedenkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel has brushed aside suggestions she is too liberal to lead
the party, saying Monday she has no plans to shift the party's
political direction and pledging to follow the Christian Democrats'
charter. She also said being a woman would not influence her
political priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not carry out the work expected of me in a
gender-specific way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first senior party members to distance herself from
the scandal-tarnished Kohl, Merkel said she could still distinguish
the former chancellor's positive achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kohl was essential to German unity, and to European
unification -- that is and remains his achievement,'' Merkel said.
''We know today that also many things happened during this time,
but I am of the opinion that we must separate one thing from the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in the western city of Hamburg in 1954, Merkel was only a
couple months old when her father, a Lutheran pastor, was assigned
to a parish in a small town in East Germany. The holder of a
doctorate in physics, she eventually worked as a chemist in a
scientific academy in East Berlin -- but her ties to the church kept
her from her desired career as a Russian and physics teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell, she became involved with
the burgeoning democracy movement rooted in East German churches.
Merkel joined the Christian Democrats just two months before German
reunification on Oct. 3, 1990.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israelis Hurt in Drive-By Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two Israelis were shot and wounded in a
drive-by attack in the West Bank on Monday, a day before the
arrival of Pope John Paul II and the resumption of
Israel-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The shots came from a car overtaking the Israeli vehicle on a
road near Tarkumia, west of the West Bank city of Hebron, according
to military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the
Israelis was seriously wounded and the other suffered moderate
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio reported that after emergency treatment at the
scene, the two were flown by military helicopter to a Jerusalem
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drive-by shootings have been attributed to the
extremist Hamas, a Palestinian group opposed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack came as Israel prepared to hand over another
portion of the West Bank to the Palestinians, under terms of an
interim accord signed last September. The Palestinians are to
receive control of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians are to resume talks on
a peace treaty, which broke off in early February. The talks are to
take place at Bolling Air Force Base outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian extremists opposed to peace with Israel have often
tried to time attacks to coincide with events in the peace process.
In 1996, a series of suicide attacks on Israeli civilian buses
caused dozens of casualties and halted the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is to arrive in Israel on Tuesday. Visiting
Jordan on Monday, he noted the need for Middle East peacemaking,
calling the conflicts in the region ''grave and urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive-by shooting took place not far from the ''safe
passage,'' an Israeli highway Palestinians are allowed to use to
drive between the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Bill would bar Con Ed from charging outage costs to customers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A bill in the state Assembly would bar
Consolidated Edison from imposing on customers the cost of the
outage at its Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important that the ratepayers not pay for the failures
of Con Ed,'' Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill would prohibit the state Public Service
Commission from allowing the utility to apply the cost of
replacement power while Indian Point 2 is out of service --
estimated at $600,000 a day -- to the utility's rate base or
otherwise passing through the charge to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed's president, Michael Evans, said earlier this month that
the utility intended to pass along most of the costs of the Feb. 15
outage to ratepayers. A utility spokesman estimated that would add
about $2 a month to the typical electric bill of a residential
customer.
</P>
<P>
   A leak in a tube at the plant carrying radioactive water
resulted in the release of a minute amount of radioactive steam
into the atmosphere. There was no measurable effect on the
environment and no one was injured, but it resulted in the first
alert in the 26-year history of the Westchester County plant.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the utility was aware of the possibility of the
failure and could have avoided the outage by replacing steam
generators sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of Democratic state legislators filed a
''prudency petition'' with the Public Service Commission calling on
the agency to refuse to let Con Ed pass the cost of the outage on
to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed Joseph Petta said utility officials had not seen Silver's
bill as of Monday and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials expect to know more about when Indian Point 2
can be restarted based on an evaluation of the damage to the plant
which will be completed within two weeks.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State University of New York Chancellor
Robert King is getting paid an extra $90,000 a year for staying in
his Albany-area home instead of living in the SUNY-provided
chancellor's residence, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The previously unrevealed housing allowance is in addition to
his $250,000-a-year salary that SUNY officials announced in
December when King was hired.
</P>
<P>
   The salary and housing allowance added together mean that King,
who has no previous academic experience, received a 130 percent
raise when he left his job as Gov. George Pataki's state budget
director to lead SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   King is a close friend of the governor and the two have known
each other since King joined the state Assembly in 1987. Pataki had
arrived in the Assembly two years earlier. As head of Pataki's
budget office, King was known as a fiscal hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why you would need a housing allowance if you
have a taxpayer supported residence and are largely based in
Albany,'' said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest
Research Group, who cautioned that his group had not done a
comparison of similar university systems. ''I don't know what the
justification is.''
</P>
<P>
   King was in Chicago on Monday at an education conference and not
available for comment, SUNY spokesman E.J. McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is clearly outrageous that salary (supplement) was
not revealed,'' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is he has no experience in the field,'' the
Assembly Democrat told Albany's WROW-AM radio. ''I don't know why
we have to pay top dollar to someone at this point who may be
learning on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   King isn't the only state official not using his official
residence in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki only rarely stays at the Executive Mansion, preferring to
stay most nights at his posh Victorian home in Garrison, Putnam
County. The governor does not get an extra housing allowance,
Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki controls the SUNY system through his appointments to the
SUNY Board of Trustees. The trustees selected King as chancellor
and approved the housing supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner used to have an official
residence in Albany but it was sold in 1995, officials said.
Education Commissioner Richard Mills does not get a housing
allowance, spokesman Thomas Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   During their search for a chancellor, SUNY officials were told
by their search consultant, Korn/Ferry International, that the
chancellor's residence -- a penthouse suite in SUNY's baronial
central headquarters in downtown Albany -- probably would not be
suitable for a candidate with a family, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who is married and has children has a house in Clifton
Park, told SUNY officials he didn't want to live in the
chancellor's residence, McMahon added.
</P>
<P>
   He said King plans on using the housing allowance to buy a new
house closer to his office at SUNY central.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post first reported the SUNY housing allowance in
its Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY had not revealed the housing allowance previously, McMahon
said, because it wasn't in the resolution that the SUNY trustees
approved for King's hiring and no one asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody was deliberately trying to hide the compensation,'' the
SUNY spokesman said. ''It simply wasn't revealed ... but it wasn't
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   King's predecessor, John Ryan, also was paid $250,000 a year by
SUNY and lived in the chancellor's residence. He did not get the
housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old King, as budget director, made $147,490 a year.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that in setting up the supplement for King, SUNY
officials were influenced in part by the fact that City University
of New York Chancellor Matthew Goldstein -- who had been hired in
July -- got a $250,000-a-year salary and a $90,000-a-year housing
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the thoughts that went into the size of the housing
allowance for our chancellor was the size of the housing allowance
for the CUNY chancellor,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to be competitive with academic peer institutions,
and first and foremost, right under their nose, is CUNY,'' McMahon
said. ''And CUNY's got that package.''
</P>
<P>
   There are differences between the SUNY and CUNY situations. CUNY
no longer had an official residence available when Goldstein took
the job. Also, housing costs are considerably less in the Albany
area than in New York City where CUNY is located.
</P>
<P>
   Without a chancellor in residence, the SUNY residence will be
used for visiting dignitaries and official university activities
like luncheons, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and King are the two highest paid state employees,
even without the housing allowances, according to records
maintained by the state comptroller's office.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Dept. Posts Budget Deficit  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury posted a budget deficit of $41.7
billion in February, a month that typically records the lowest
revenues and the largest deficits. The government remains on track
to produce a surplus for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's deficit for February, released Monday,
was smaller than the $42.3 billion deficit posted in February 1999.
It also was smaller than the $43.1 billion deficit many analysts
expected and the $44.4 billion deficit projected by the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   February normally is among the months with the lowest revenues
and the largest deficits, because there generally are fewer tax
payments flowing into Treasury's coffers and more tax refunds being
paid out, budget experts said. But with Leap Year, the government
had one more collection day in February, thus helping to boost
revenues higher than those of February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for February 2000 totaled $108.7 billion, while
expenditures came to $150.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first five months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1,
the government is running a deficit of $188 million. Revenue during
that period totaled $741.8 billion, while spending came to $741.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   If a surplus materializes as expected for fiscal year 2000,
which ends Sept. 30, it would be the first time the government
reported three consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and
1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.69 billion
surplus for fiscal 2000, while the CBO sees a $179 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal year 1999, the government reported a record surplus
of $124.4 billion. The 1999 surplus followed a $69.2 billion
surplus in 1998, the first time the government finished in the
black since 1969, and the back-to-back annual surpluses were the
first since 1956 and 1957 under President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, prompted by coffers brimming with government
surpluses, the Treasury said Monday it anticipates buying back some
more of the national debt during the second half of April.
Additional details were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury has bought back over the last couple of weeks $2
billion of the debt and paid sellers around $613 million in
premiums to cash in their bonds early. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said in January the government would buy back as much as
$30 billion in debt this year.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not revise January's surplus of $62.15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the biggest spending categories were Social
Security, $35.96 billion; programs of the Health and Human Services
Department, $30.81 billion; military spending, $21.18 billion; and
interest on the public debt, $20.78 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government collected $45.7 billion in individual income tax
payments last month compared with $42.8 billion for February 1999.
It received $1.78 billion in corporate tax payments, up from $1.18
billion.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Death Toll Could Be 330  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Prisoners dug a long trench Monday and a
bulldozer shoveled charred corpses into a common grave, the final
resting place for hundreds of members of a religious cult led by a
former prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims apparently were women, and police counted
the bodies of 78 children, the interior minister said. He put the
total number of dead at 330.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the ones we could count,'' Interior Minister Edward
Rugumayo said. ''The others are unrecognizable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugumayo spoke to reporters in Kampala after inspecting the
burned hulk of the church hall just outside Kanungu, 215 miles
southwest of the Ugandan capital. He said that in addition to the
330 bodies found after Friday's fire in the church, five bodies
were spotted through a hole in a nearby pit latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Rugumayo said police were sure there were more bodies in the
latrine, a walled, communal structure common in African villages,
but were awaiting digging equipment to excavate the pit. He did not
offer an explanation of how or when the bodies got into the
latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Official estimates of the number of deaths have varied between
235 and 600. On Monday, bodies were shoveled into a long trench dug
by inmates, but it did not appear that officials were counting
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''What emerges out of all this,'' Rugumayo said of the sect,
''is that the authorities never suspected anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 10-year-old Christian sect, known as the Movement
for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, was founded by
Cledonia Mwerinde, a former prostitute who had the chapel built on
the grave of her father. The sect had about 1,000 members in nine
districts in Uganda and was legally registered as a nongovernmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still sect members out in other districts, and they
are being pursued,'' Rugamayo said. ''We're going to close down all
the branches of this sect and are going to be more vigilant about
NGO-registration in the future,'' he said. ''But we can't stop
freedom of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about the sect were sparse.
</P>
<P>
   Police had earlier identified the five primary leaders as the
40-year-old Mwerinde; Joseph Kibweteere, 68, also known as ''The
Prophet;'' and former Roman Catholic priests Dominic Kataribabo,
32, Joseph Kasapurari, 39, and John Kamagara, 69.
</P>
<P>
   Local Roman Catholic Church officials have not spoken about the
fire and deaths; officials said all local bishops are away on a
retreat. The press office of the Vatican said Monday it had no
information and no comment about the reports that some sect leaders
had been priests.
</P>
<P>
   Police said earlier Monday that the five main leaders --
including Mwerinde, whom her followers called ''the one who has had
a vision'' -- all died. But Rugamayo said later that only two
leaders' bodies had been positively identified -- the manager of the
sect's farm and ''a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Banura, a professor of theology at Kampala's Makerere
University, said the group was an offshoot of the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing centered around worship because these were
people who were very uncomfortable with the way worship was being
carried out by the church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the fire, people who lived near the compound told
police and reporters that sect members had told them about a
sighting of the Virgin Mary and that something big was going to
happen. Kibweteere had reportedly predicted the world would end on
Dec. 31. When that didn't happen, he moved the date up to Dec. 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Syncretic Christian religious sects are mushrooming across
Africa as many people become disillusioned with the inability of
politicians to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sect members insisted on receiving Holy Communion on their knees
rather than standing and refused to speak for fear of breaking
commandments. But they did sing and pray aloud.
</P>
<P>
   President Yoweri Museveni warned the nation's religious leaders
against those who might endanger the lives of the unsuspecting.
</P>
<P>
   The government ''believes in the freedom of worship. It also has
a duty to protect the lives of the people of Uganda ... and to
ensure that Ugandans are not at the mercy of some dangerous and
opportunistic individuals who parade themselves as religious
leaders,'' a statement from Museveni's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Baingana, a psychiatrist in the Ministry of Health,
said fears about what would happen in the year 2000 and grinding
poverty have fueled religious sects in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have these gaps in their lives, spiritual gaps, and
they look for different ways of filling them like joining cults,''
she said. ''Our history has made us more vulnerable because life
has been very hard.''

<HEADLINE> Strollers, Pull Toys Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 44,000 jogging strollers were recalled
Monday because their brakes may fail, causing runners to lose
control and endanger children riding in them, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally 4,900 wooden pull toys were recalled because a part
may fall off and cause a choking hazard to small children.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC said the stroller recall involved the single and double
models of the InSTEP and Healthrider jogging stroller, manufactured
by Minnesota-based InSTEP LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, including Burlington Coat Factory, J.C. Penney and
Target sold the strollers nationwide between December 1998 and July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the recall involved seven models, ZS100,
ZD200, ZS100WS, ZD200WS, ZS100HR, PR100 and PR200, which consumers
should stop using immediately and contact the company for a repair
kit. No injuries have been reported, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The pull toy recall involves ''The Wooden Pull Along Bead
Coaster'' manufactured by Maxim Enterprise Inc. of Middleboro,
Mass. sold nationwide by Zany Brainy stores from November 1999
until last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wheels can break off and the bead can detach from the pull
string, posing small parts choking hazards to young children,'' the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident a detached bead was found in a child's mouth,
but no injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should return the toys to the store for a $15 refund.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buoyed by two major Israeli concessions, the
Clinton administration is reopening negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority. Next weekend, President Clinton tries
personal diplomacy with Syrian President Hafez Assad in a parallel
bid for a second Mideast accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser attributes the stepped-up
U.S. role to dynamics abroad, not to any effort to build a larger
legacy for Clinton in his final year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is not the friend of peace in the Middle East,'' said
Sandy Berger, traveling with Clinton in South Asia. ''Any sense of
urgency comes from their clocks and not our clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing he would meet Sunday with Assad in Geneva, Clinton
said in Dhaka, Bangladesh, ''I don't want to unduly raise
expectations, but I think this is an appropriate thing for me to do
to try to get this back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to the announcement in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The government-run Tishrin newspaper, in an editorial that ran
before Clinton's announcement, said, ''The rulers of Tel Aviv have
not given up their expansionist greediness for the Arab lands and
their peace claims lack credibility and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials hoped the Geneva meeting would produce a
resumption of the Israel-Syrian negotiations broken off in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks begin Tuesday without Clinton, who
has interceded in previous sessions, in the seclusion of
Washington's Bolling Air Force Base. They will focus on terms of a
final settlement now that Israel has designated the land it is
turning over to Yasser Arafat that would expand Palestinian control
of the West Bank to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   American hosts anticipate about a week of talks. The two
delegations will be put up in townhouses on a quiet street on the
base and meet in a comfortable separate building.
</P>
<P>
   The two concessions by Israel are its decisions to put a Jewish
settlement under the effective security control of the Palestinians
for the first time -- a possible omen -- and to give the Palestinians
land on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria deadlocked after a round in
January between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharra. Assad has not participated
directly since the talks resumed in December, following a
three-year lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Barak, Gadi Baltiansky said Israelis hope the
Clinton-Assad meeting will lead to renewed negotiations, but he
added that ''can only take place when the circumstances are
suitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would not introduce any specific proposal
when he sees Assad, nor did he expect immediate results. And yet,
Berger said, ''there are some things best discussed face to face,
leader to leader.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Clinton's third meeting with Assad. Syria's listing
by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism bars most U.S.
economic support but has not kept the president from seeing the
Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   At the Israeli-Palestinian talks, Clinton's stand-in is Dennis
B. Ross, longtime American mediator, who is bound to reflect the
policy of this and past U.S. administrations that Israel should
give up territory to the Arabs in exchange for promises of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet approved a pullback from an additional 6.1
percent of the West Bank on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It puts a tiny gated Jewish settlement called Negohot, about an
hour's drive from the capital, under the effective security control
of the Palestinian Authority in that the two dozen families who
live there may be subjected to Palestinian checks entering and
leaving their community.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat lays claim to virtually all of the West Bank, where tens
of thousands of Jews live.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant concession by Barak's government, Israel
will give the Palestinians three suburbs near, but not abutting,
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the talks opening Tuesday over lunch at the air base,
Palestinian negotiators will be pressing for part of Jerusalem and
for a state.
</P>
<P>
   The American hosts, as they do frequently in such negotiations,
barred reporters from the base.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Ross and his
mediating team intended to ''be helpful,'' but may not participate
in all meetings. The teams will be led by senior negotiators Oded
Eran for Israel and Yasser Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erekat for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. has long believed that the Palestinian issue
represents the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' the State
Department said in a statement on Friday. ''A solution that meets
the needs of both Israelis and Palestinians is essential if there
is to be a comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aim is an overall accord by mid-September, four months
before Clinton's term ends. A settlement, and also possibly an
agreement between Israel and Syria in which Israel gives up the
strategic Golan Heights, are key goals for Clinton is his final
year.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Snow-Cave Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATTON, Vt. (AP) -- Two college students spending a night
outdoors were killed in the collapse of their snow cave, apparently
after a piece of heavy machinery dumped snow on their shelter while
they slept, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Shumway, 19, and Robert Carr, 18, freshmen on spring break
from Plymouth State College in New Hampshire, were found buried in
the collapsed cave by friends Saturday morning at the Stratton
Mountain ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   Avid outdoorsmen, Carr, Shumway and a group of friends had gone
to Stratton to watch the U.S. Open Snowboarding competition. They
dug the cave at the edge of a parking lot, while the rest of their
group spent the night sleeping in cars and campers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan M. Davis, Windham County state's attorney, said Monday that
a bucket-loader dumped snow either on the snowbank or nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may or may not have contributed to their deaths,'' he said.
''It certainly appears the cave collapsed as a result of the snow
dumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said crews from the ski resort had been sanding the
parking lot and moving snow around in preparation for the crowds of
skiers. He said the snow dumping apparently took place between 5
a.m. and 6 a.m. Saturday, two to three hours before the men were
discovered packed in snow in their sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he does not expect any criminal charges. ''It
certainly appears at this point in time to be accidental deaths,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Baldwin, an experienced hiker who works at the Appalachian
Mountain Club's Pinkham Notch hut, said snow caves can be very warm
but must be constructed with care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be incredibly dangerous because like in an avalanche,
if it collapses, the snow settles in like concrete,'' he said.
''Even if you were sleeping with a shovel, you probably couldn't
dig yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumway, who died of asphyxiation, was the son of New
Hampshire's health and human services commissioner, Donald Shumway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jake was full of energy and spirit. Hiking, camping,
snowboarding and music were a big part of his life,'' his parents
said in a statement. ''We take comfort in knowing he died doing
something that he loved.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Men Arrested in Iran Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Six men have been arrested in the shooting
of reformist Saeed Hajjarian, Iran's security agency announced
Monday. The agency offered no information on the suspects' motives.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects has confessed to shooting Hajjarian in the
face on March 12, according to the Supreme National Security
Council, the nation's top security body.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian 46, a city councilman and confidant of President
Mohammad Khatami, regained consciousness Sunday after one week in a
coma.
</P>
<P>
   No other information on the suspects was released, and there was
no indication of their political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-reform newspapers and Hajjarian's allies have blamed the
attack on hard-liners who oppose Khatami's cultural, social and
political reforms. The hard-liners have used vigilante groups and
members of the security forces in the past to attack or intimidate
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Abassali Alizadeh, head of the Tehran judiciary, commended the
''serious efforts'' of the Interior and Intelligence ministries and
police in apprehending the suspects, according to a report by the
Islamic Republic News Agency, IRNA.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people who were trying to disturb the security of the
country have been arrested,'' Alizadeh said. ''It is a New Year's
present for the people of Iran.'' Monday is Nowruz, or the Persian
new year.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi said
police were investigating several possible suspects in the
shooting, including the Mujahedeen Khalq, an exiled dissident
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian has been ''on the hit-list of the terrorist Mujahedeen
Khalq organization since March 1999,'' IRNA quoted Yunesi as
saying. The minister stopped short of accusing the group of
carrying out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, which seeks the violent overthrow of
Iran's Islamic government, dismissed Yunesi's comments on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad-Reza Zafarqandi, a member of the medical team treating
Hajjarian, said his patient's condition was improving daily after
he underwent two operations, according to the IRNA report.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen, Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against most major
currencies Monday in listless foreign exchange trading on the eve
of a Federal Reserve policy-making meeting, which is widely
expected to result in another increase in U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar dipped to 106.36 Japanese yen in late New York
dealings from 106.37 yen late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also fell against the euro, which traded at 97.34
cents, up from 97.15 cents late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Many currency traders expect inflation fighters at the Fed to
boost interest rates by a quarter percentage point Tuesday in a bid
to keep the economy from overheating. It would be the fifth
increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank raised rates one-quarter point last
week and its leader issued new inflation warnings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg told reporters in
Brussels that he expects ''continued price pressures being
exerted'' in Europe, and said the ECB had underestimated the impact
of rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of oil prices has lasted longer and at a higher
level than anticipated. This has caused us to think the future
level of inflation will come closer to 2 percent than anticipated
earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell to 1.6561 Swiss francs from 1.6590 and to 1.4694
Canadian dollars from 1.4726 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound fell to $1.5699 from $1.5758.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0093 German
marks, down from 2.0134; 6.7388 French francs, down from 6.7527;
and 1,989.18 Italian lire, down from 1,993.16.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Waging War, One Year Later  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- ''They'll bomb us again!''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the start of the NATO bombing campaign, those words
are on nearly everyone's lips in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the near-panic gripping the Serbs, faced with
the threat of civil war, likely clashes in secessionist Montenegro
and signs the country is sliding toward dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have repeatedly denied any plans to renew the
airstrikes -- unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic makes an
overtly aggressive move, such as attacking allied troops stationed
in Serbia's troubled Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic -- who has started four wars in the Balkans and
lost all of them -- has a history of such actions, especially when
he seeks to divert public attention away from the country's
economic collapse and social decline, which threaten his grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where Milosevic is concerned, whenever one imagines the worst
possible scenario, that's the one that happens,'' says Andrej
Marjanovic, a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   He described the Serbs as ''on the verge of collective
paranoia,'' brought on by the tremendous fear engendered by the
NATO airstrikes and the bleak and uncertain future they now face.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing more airstrikes, people are stocking up on food, and men
are planning escape routes over the border or hiding places to
avoid the draft. Lines for visas in front of Western embassies are
longer than ever. Authorities last week ran out of passport
booklets because of the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no hope in this country,'' said a man in his early
20s who gave only his first name, Milan, as he waited in line for a
visa outside the Austrian Embassy. ''I don't want to live through
another bombing hell, or let Milosevic send me to another senseless
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the disquiet, air raid sirens have been tested in
several Serbian towns and, according to opposition claims, the army
recently issued over 100,000 draft notices for reservists, mostly
in rural areas. Unconfirmed reports that the borders were closed
for men of military age sent shock waves through Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that a simple test of air raid sirens is enough to
trigger general panic is a true sign that the psychological warfare
against this nation has been waged successfully,'' said Ljubodrag
Stojadinovic, a prominent independent media columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes, begun one year ago Friday to force an end
to Milosevic's crackdown against Kosovo Albanians, have failed to
bring his downfall or shake his grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on top of international sanctions, the 78-day allied
bombing campaign -- which destroyed oil refineries and much of
Yugoslavia's other infrastructure -- has given Milosevic a perfect
scapegoat for the country's overall decay.
</P>
<P>
   For Milosevic, the war against NATO and the United States is
still being waged, and the enemies are all those who oppose his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent congress of his ruling Socialist Party, Milosevic
launched one of his fiercest attacks on political opponents,
calling them pro-Western ''weaklings,'' ''thieves,''
''colonizers,'' ''toadies'' and ''cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   There are widespread fears in Serbia that Milosevic might start
a civil war to preserve power, after being weakened by the
country's deep economic and social crisis and the virtual loss of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime is prepared to send police and other 'death squads'
against Serbian citizens,'' said opposition leader Vuk Draskovic.
''But a fierce response is being prepared by this impoverished
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in pro-independence Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner
in the Yugoslav federation, have grown so high that a clash between
the Serb-led Yugoslav army and Montenegrin police seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   A government crackdown against dissent in Serbia is in full
swing, with independent media outlets heavily fined or banned and
independent journalists threatened. Police have arrested and beaten
up anti-Milosevic student activists and protesters, and opposition
leaders are facing trials for speaking against the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these are minor scuffles in comparison to what awaits us
in the near future,'' said opposition leader Vuk Obradovic.

<HEADLINE> Agency: Capitol Has Firehazards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of people who work in and visit the
Capitol complex every day are endangered by untested fire alarms,
unprotected stairwells and unattended hazardous materials, a
congressional agency said Monday as it issued eight citations for
violations and ordered quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Compliance said the violations, all fire hazards,
are serious. The architect of the Capitol was told to rectify them
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it said exit stairwells in the Capitol Building
and three surrounding lawmaker office buildings were ''unprotected
against fire, smoke or toxic fumes, posing an undue danger to the
lives and safety of occupants.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's general counsel Gary Green said some of the
stairwells have air vents ''which exacerbate the smokestack
effect'' where the stairwells act as chimneys, pulling smoke and
fumes into the upper levels.
</P>
<P>
   He said the obligation to test and maintain sprinklers and alarm
system has been ''almost uniformly disregarded for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Franklin, administrative assistant for the architect's
office, which is responsible for congressional buildings and
grounds, said ''a lot of remedial work has already begun.'' He said
they had discussed the problems cited with the Office of Compliance
and ''they borrowed our watch to tell us what time it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said the pace of work depends on the budget they get
from Congress. An emergency spending bill now moving through
Congress would provide $15 million this year to address the fire
safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman has told Congress fire
safety work is complicated by the historic nature of the buildings
and the reluctance of lawmakers and their staffs to evacuate their
workspace for major renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Green agreed that the architect had responded to past complaints
including 1998 citations for improper storage of flammable liquids.
But he said that since then inspectors have found hazardous
chemicals in other work areas of the Capitol, including cylinders
containing high levels of carbon monoxide gas that had not been
tested for leakage since 1964 and ''pose a deadly risk of releasing
colorless, odorless toxic gas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these chemicals were removed after they were found, but
there is still a need for better employee training.
</P>
<P>
   The citations are similar to those issued to private industry by
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, except they
don't carry a fine. The citations allege that the architect
violated the Congressional Accountability Act, which was passed
five years ago to force Congress to comply with many health and
safety laws imposed on the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a January report on fire safety in congressional buildings,
the compliance office found ''the overall level of fire safety to
be far below that of most other American office buildings of
similar size and age.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect's office was ordered to install fire-rated doors
by Sept. 30 where feasible and submit alternatives for other areas
to the compliance office by Sept. 30, 2001. Design and installation
should be completed for all areas of the Capitol by Sept. 30, 2003,
the citation said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that ''none of the required inspection, testing and
maintenance'' had been performed on sprinkler systems, the
architect was ordered to take corrective action within 90 days.
Annual testing of alarm systems also was required, in that case by
June 30.

<HEADLINE> E. Dole For V.P. Petition Launched  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite her opposition, supporters of
Elizabeth Dole launched a petition drive Monday to make her the
Republican Party's vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly believe that a Bush-Dole ticket is the best chance
for a Republican victory in 2000,'' said Pam Coy, spokeswoman for
''The National Petition Drive for Elizabeth Dole for Vice
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's going to be like a breath of fresh air in Washington,''
Coy added. ''She has an amazing ability to multitask like nobody
we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its effort, the group launched a Web site and mailed
informational packets to Republican governors and other party
leaders around the country. The packets include a sign-up form,
sample letters of support to newspaper editors, display ads and a
prerecorded radio spot.
</P>
<P>
   While no petition can formally place Dole on the GOP ticket,
organizers hope to generate a groundswell that convinces the
presumptive Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to pick
the former Cabinet secretary and ex-American Red Cross president as
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's campaign says it does not support the effort by Earl Cox,
a Charleston, S.C., resident who previously tried to draft Colin
Powell as president and Dole as a presidential candidate before she
launched her own aborted candidacy last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are opposed to it and we asked them not to proceed,'' said
Stewart McLaurin, a Dole spokesman. ''She's just not supportive of
such a draft or petition drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, Dole's former spokesman who now works for Bush,
said talk of a running mate is premature. He outlined the three
criteria Bush has said he will use to pick his running mate:
someone who can be president, who agrees with his political
philosophy and who likes him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those will be the criteria the governor uses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh traveled to
Washington on Monday to meet with Capitol Hill and Republican
National Committee leaders about melding their efforts. It was
believed that Don Evans, the Bush campaign's finance chief, will
join the RNC in a top-level post.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Allbaugh planned to meet with RNC Chairman Jim
Nicholson and the campaign's congressional liaisons, Sen. Paul
Coverdell of Georgia and Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israelis Hurt in Drive-By Attack  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a car full of Israelis,
wounding three, in a drive-by attack in the West Bank on Monday,
the car's driver said, a day before the arrival of Pope John Paul
II and the resumption of Israel-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The shots came from a car near Tarkumia, west of the West Bank
city of Hebron. One of the Israelis was seriously wounded, another
moderately and the third lightly. Seven people were in the
Israelis' vehicle, its driver Yoram Sharabi, told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Sharabi said the seven were entertainers performing for Israeli
soldiers. He said a car parked at the side of the road waited for
his vehicle to pass, then overtook it as a gunman inside opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drive-by shootings have been attributed to Hamas, a
Palestinian extremist group opposed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack came as Israel prepared to hand over another
portion of the West Bank to the Palestinians, under terms of an
interim accord signed last September. The Palestinians are to
receive control of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians are to resume talks on
a peace treaty, which broke off in early February. The talks are to
take place at Bolling Air Force Base outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian extremists opposed to peace with Israel have often
tried to time attacks to coincide with events in the peace process.
In 1996, a series of suicide attacks on Israeli civilian buses
caused dozens of casualties and halted the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is to arrive in Israel on Tuesday. Visiting
Jordan on Monday, he noted the need for Middle East peacemaking,
calling the conflicts in the region ''grave and urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive-by shooting took place not far from the ''safe
passage,'' an Israeli highway Palestinians are allowed to use to
drive between the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Finishes Military Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's inspector general Monday gave
Defense Secretary William Cohen his report on how the military's
'don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuality is being carried
out, Pentagon sources said.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the three-month study will not be released
until Cohen reviews it, said Defense Department spokeswoman Susan
Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had ordered the review -- based partly on a survey of
military personnel and on spot checks on bases and installations --
after President Clinton complained in December that the policy was
not working as intended.
</P>
<P>
   Under the military's policy on homosexuality, instituted in
1994, the military is not supposed to ask service members about
their sexual orientation, unless there is evidence of homosexual
conduct. Still, soldiers who say they are gay may be discharged.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said the policy was never supposed to
facilitate rooting out people who are gay or allow for harassment,
both of which have occurred under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced new guidelines in August that would require all
troops to undergo periodic anti-harassment training and assign
investigations of homosexual activity to more senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the new review also would help the
Pentagon better gauge whether the August guidelines were being
followed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Leader Remains a Mystery  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- When Russians were asked to compare Vladimir Putin
to an animal by pollsters, most people had the same response: a fox
or a wolf -- cunning, elusive and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The jarring comparison symbolizes how many Russians admire Putin
as a strong leader and how little they know about the man. There is
even less to explain his meteoric rise to the top of the Russian
government and what looks like certain victory in March 26
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin remains as much a riddle to Russians as he does to'' the
rest of the world, said Thomas Graham of the Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter to Russian voters, angry and disillusioned
by years of chaos and corruption. They believe Putin can end the
lawlessness infecting Russia by doling out bare-knuckle justice.
And they don't seem too worried about just how far he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, far fewer, see Putin as a specter from the Soviet past.
Critics say the ex-KGB officer is masquerading as a democrat and
that he will bring back the iron rule of the secret police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of the future president's inner circle look like his
twin brothers -- all lean, neat, with officers' bearing, faces
absolutely devoid of any expression and empty glazed eyes,'' the
liberal weekly Itogi said.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark poker face, Putin denies he will be a
dictator as calmly as if he were declining an offer of coffee. But
he is vague about his plans beyond saying he will continue reform
while increasing state controls.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about Putin cuts across every group and class. Some
democrats say Putin is a reformer, others claim he is a fascist.
Communists say Putin will wreck Russia with market reform, while
some reformers fear he will choke free enterprise. Some people find
him strong and inspiring, to others he is menacing, and some say he
is bland.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's background has been turned inside out for insights to
explain the man who could lead Russia for a decade and who will
have his finger on the nuclear trigger. The digging has produced
many questions and few answers.
</P>
<P>
   Short, slender, with blond hair and penetrating blue eyes, Putin
comes across as stern, often cold. ''Frankly speaking, I do not
experience any internal conflict, vacillation or torment,'' he once
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people seem to have known Putin in the past, or are not
willing to say much if they did. Those who work with him now all
sound as if they are reading the same script, praising Putin as
bright and hardworking. Nobody offers personal details, or claims
to be a friend or intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to soften Putin's image, aides have trickled out a few
personal details. He has a wife, two children and a poodle and is
said to be a devout Christian. But it was film of Putin, a judo
black belt, flipping opponents that really grabbed public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a well-disciplined person, and discipline is what our
country needs most of all,'' said Lyuba Belova, a worker at a
factory Putin visited.
</P>
<P>
   The one part of his past that Putin seems happy discussing are
his years in the Soviet secret police, which at its height killed
and imprisoned millions. He says the KGB's work was deplorable, but
praises its skill.
</P>
<P>
   In an unspectacular 15-year KGB career, Putin worked against
dissidents in the Soviet Union and as a spy in the former East
Germany. Putin says his KGB chiefs considered him a bit reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't and I didn't think that I had a decreased sense of
danger, but psychologists came to this conclusion having followed
my behavior for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's career blossomed after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
when he says he was free to show his true feelings and back
democratic reform. In a few years, he shot from obscurity to the
top for reasons that are not clear, although he seemed to have a
knack for pleasing powerful bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where corruption allegations have tainted many
prominent people, there is no evidence that Putin tried to enrich
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Putin rose through bodies with unsavory records. He
was a deputy mayor in St. Petersburg, a city that become a byword
for corruption; worked in the Kremlin's finance agency, the focus
of corruption allegations involving ex-President Boris Yeltsin's
family; and was regarded as a hard-liner when he headed the KGB's
successor, the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   With no clear accomplishments and largely unknown, Putin was
named prime minister by Yeltsin in August 1999. Four months later,
Yeltsin resigned, saying Putin was the best man to defend Russia's
young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry that charmed Putin's superiors worked with many
ordinary Russians. Almost overnight, Putin became the most popular
politician in Russia, hailed for his handling of the war against
separatists in Chechnya and his talk of tough rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin enjoys such broad support because people don't know what
kind of person he is, and they pin their expectations on him,''
said Boris Nemtsov, a former prime minister. ''As people get to
know Putin, they will become more sober.''

   Nasdaq Drops 187,62; Dow Up 85.01
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply today,
closing down 187.62 at 4,610.51. The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 85.01 at 10,680.24. The Dow and the Nasdaq diverged as
investors drew money out of lesser-known names in the software and
biotechnology groups and poured it into the largest, most dominant
technology companies. Hewlett-Packard, Intel and IBM led the Dow's
advance. Several factors combined to derail the Nasdaq.
MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in electronic commerce,
lost more than half its value after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999. MicroStrategy shares were down
140 at 86}. Internet retailers also were mostly lower after
Barron's magazine reported this weekend that dozens of prominent
companies are strapped for cash.

   Analysts Expect Fed Rate Hike
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
bluntly signaled that the central bank will keep raising interest
rates until economic growth slows to a more moderate pace, leaving
analysts to predict another rate hike will occur tomorrow. The
central bank's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee
will announce its decision around 2:15 EST. ''It is essentially a
foregone conclusion,'' said William Cheney, chief economist at John
Hancock in Boston. ''Greenspan has laid out the logic that demand
is growing too fast, spurred by stock prices, and it is
unsustainable.'' Since last June, the Fed has raised rates four
times in quarter-point steps, boosting the federal funds rate -- the
interest banks charge each other -- to 5.75 percent.

   Lehman Beats Analysts' Expectations

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said today its
first-quarter earnings surged 156 percent to $541 million, a figure
well above analysts' predictions. Lehman attributed its strong
results to record revenues in the company's investment banking and
securities trading businesses. Lehman earned $3.69 a share, 59
cents above high-end expectations, for the three months ended Feb.
29. During the first quarter of 1999, the firm reported net income
of $211 million, or $1.57 a share, as Wall Street recovered from a
global financial crisis brought on by economic strife in Asia and
Russia. Shares of Lehman, the fourth largest U.S. securities firm,
were down 3| at 87 13/16.

announced today. Both companies said they settled their differences
to avoid the costs, time and distractions of lengthy legal battles.
The agreement means all outstanding litigation, including six
patent suits filed between May 1998 and June 1999, have been
dismissed. Xerox had filed complaints involving Hewlett-Packard's
products using inkjet, color balancing and resolution enhancement
technologies. Hewlett-Packard's suits involved Xerox products using
touchscreen controls, inkjet and image enhancement technologies.
Hewlett-Packard shares were up 5 at 144, and Xerox was up 3/16 at
26.

   US Airways Urges Alternative Plans
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- US Airways is warning its customers to
prepare for a possible strike Saturday by its flight attendants,
urging them to prepare alternative arrangements. The flight
attendants' union has said it would target random routes with
impromptu walkouts to cause maximum chaos. In response, the airline
has said it would shut down rather than subject passengers to
unpredictable travel. With a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. EST
Saturday, US Airways flight attendants are back at the bargaining
table in a final attempt to resolve a three-year contract dispute
with the nation's sixth largest airline. The talks are being
supervised by Ernest DuBester, chairman of the National Mediation
Board.

   Feds Phasing Out MTBE Gas Additive
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced today it
will ban MTBE as a gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to
public health and the environment. MTBE, a leading oxygenate and
octane booster used in one-third of the gasoline sold in the United
States, reduces emissions of smog, but it has been linked to
groundwater pollution. Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said her agency will seek to
eliminate use of MTBEs under the Toxic Substance Control Act. She
said the ban, expected to take up to three years to implement,
would have little effect on consumer costs.

<P>
   Treasury Dept. Posts Budget Deficit
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department posted a budget
deficit of $41.7 billion in February, a month that typically
records the lowest revenues and the largest deficits. Revenue for
February 2000 totaled $108.7 billion, while expenditures came to
$150.4 billion. The deficit was smaller than the $43.1 billion
deficit many analysts expected and the $44.4 billion deficit
projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The government
remains on track to produce a surplus for the year. If a surplus
materializes as expected for fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept. 30,
it would be the first time the government reported three
consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and 1949.

   U.S. Suggests World Bank Reforms
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration put forward today a
package of proposals to overhaul lending activities at the World
Bank and other regional development banks. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said that the organizations should refocus their
efforts on providing loans for projects in the world's poorest
nations that are not likely to attract support from commercial
banks. In a speech in New York, Summers said that when loans are
made to developing countries that can attract private capital, such
as China and Brazil, those loans should carry higher interest rates
than loans to the nations that don't have access to private capital
markets.

<HEADLINE> Critics, victims applaud EPA's decision to ban oxyfuels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMMONTON, N.J. (AP) -- Andrea Hartley knows well the problems
with MTBE -- the breathing difficulties, the dizziness, the
headaches. The ailments, which she blames on the controversial
gasoline additive drove her to move to another state and later buy
a diesel-powered car.
</P>
<P>
   To Hartley and others, Monday's announcement that the federal
government would ban the use of MTBE was a breath of fresh air. But
she wants Congress to go a step further by banning all oxygenated
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've already subjected us to a major lab experiment over
the last 10 years,'' Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, a leading oxygenate and octane booster, is short for
methyl tertiary butyl ether. It is contained in about one-third of
the gasoline sold in America, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in response to the Clean Air Act of 1990, it was added
to automobile fuel to reduce smog. But critics believe the cure may
have been worse than the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley, of Hammonton, blames it for dizziness, headaches,
irritated nasal passages, loss of balance and other health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are things that have come upon me, to a large degree,
since it was instituted in New Jersey,'' said Hartley, 40, a
freelance writer and mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Her problems began in 1991. When her doctors were unable to
diagnose a specific reason for some of her ailments, Hartley began
wondering if the air she was breathing was to blame. When she
complained to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies and
others, they told her they'd heard similar complaints from people
exposed to MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, she began driving to Delaware -- where
MTBE-added gas wasn't in use -- to fill the tank of her 1987 Dodge
Caravan. That provided some relief, but it didn't last. Gas
stations there began carrying MTBE-added gas.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she began traveling from her home (she lived then in
Magnolia) to Lancaster, Pa., where she could fill up with gas that
didn't contain the oxygenated additive. She lived there for six
months, then moved back to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Still plagued by the problems, she traded her van in for a
diesel-burning 1981 Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like being liberated. I was able to go out again,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people had similar respiratory problems. But they weren't
the only ones pointing the finger at MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   The additive also found its way into groundwater supplies.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey-American Water Co., the state's largest water
utility, last month asked federal officials to stop its use after
detecting low levels of it in wells.
</P>
<P>
   The company found MTBE traces ranging from 0.5 parts per billion
to 4.5 parts per billion in six of the company's 200 wells
statewide. Among them were wells in Atlantic, Burlington and Morris
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said Monday her agency will ask Congress to eliminate a
section of the 1990 Clean Air Act that requires gasoline in areas
with serious air pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Browner's announcement Monday came four days after U.S. Rep.
Rodney Frelinghuysen grilled her about MTBE before the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Carol Browner (that) Congress is working on legislation
to ban MTBE,'' Frelinghuysen said Monday. ''In the meantime, I said
to Ms. Browner the EPA has the authority to prohibit its use now.
So I simply asked her, 'Why aren't you doing anything? Does the EPA
think MTBE is not a serious enough problem?'''
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to replace the oxygenate standard,
which led to the use of MTBE, with a requirement that a small
percentage of all motor fuels be made from renewable sources, such
as grain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always pleased to see steps taken to phase out MTBE,''
said Barry Dorfman, of Maple Shade, who is director of special
projects for Oxybusters, a grassroots organization that formed in
response to MTBE-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''But from what I understand about the Toxic Substances Control
Act, that could take years to finally go through after all the
legal challenges that are likely to be made. I'm just not sure how
effective it will be,'' said Dorfman.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the MTBE experience ''the greatest environmental
calamity in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It never even cleaned the air. Asthma rates have been
skyrocketing as its use has increased,'' Dorfman said.
</P>
<P>
   What will replace MTBE? The head of the New Jersey Farm Bureau
had a corny idea -- use more ethanol, which is made from corn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Producing ethanol fuels from New Jersey corn is a natural
complement to the state's investment in purchasing farmland to
preserve open space,'' executive director Peter Furey told the
state Assembly Environment Committee in Trenton. ''While producing
a clean, safe alternative to MTBE ... we provide an opportunity for
farmers to produce a value-added crop and provide the market
diversification they need to do business in one of the most
expensive states in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 12.4 million gallons of ethanol were sold in New
Jersey, compared with the 3.7 billion gallons of MTBE used by
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks told the panel Congress should
investigate the dangers of MTBE and fund programs to clean drinking
water contaminated by it. He also called for the National
Institutes of Health to make ''the first full study'' on the effect
of MTBE on human health.

<HEADLINE> Wartime Pope The Subject of Debate  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- His detractors say Pope Pius XII did not
condemn the Holocaust because he wanted to protect the Catholic
Church at any price. His admirers say his diplomatic silence during
World War II helped save thousands of Jewish lives.
</P>
<P>
   Among a small group of experts, Pius' wartime record has been
the subject of fierce debate for years. Now, the Holy Land visit of
the current pope, John Paul II, is prompting a wider scrutiny of
Pius XII, who has been considered by the Vatican for beatification
-- to the great dismay of Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with John Paul's arrival in Israel on Tuesday, the
Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel has published ''The
Holocaust and the Christian World,'' a 271-page collection of
essays and historical documents that examine the role of the
churches and church leaders, including Pius XII, during the Nazi
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The cover photo shows high-ranking German Catholic clergymen
giving the Nazi salute, the right arm stretched out, as they stand
next to Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on the Vatican and Pius XII, historians, priests
and rabbis came to widely divergent conclusions about the pope who,
according to a recent biography by Briton John Cornwell, ''Hitler's
Pope,'' harbored a secret antipathy toward Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Michael R. Marrus wrote that as fascism spread across
Europe, the Catholic Church remained aloof and rarely spoke out
against the persecution of Jews -- a continuation of its traditional
policy of political neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The top priority of the pope was the survival of the church, not
saving lives, though individual nuns and priests took personal
risks to save Jews, wrote Marrus of the University of Toronto.
''Seeing the institutional church as a supreme value in its own
right, those in charge of its fortunes tended unhesitatingly to put
these ahead of the victims of Nazims,'' Marrus wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1943, with Rome under Nazi occupation, the Nazis
began rounding up Jews ''virtually on the doorstep of the Papal
Palace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, others said there was considerable evidence that behind
the official stance of neutrality, Pius and other top church
officials tried to stop deportations of Jews or hide those being
persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Fisher, an interfaith activist at the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops in Washington, D.C., said 80 percent of Italy's
Jews were saved, hidden largely in the monasteries and convents of
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Pius also pointed to Nazi reprisals against
Catholics of Jewish origin in the Netherlands in 1942, a response
to the vocal condemnation by Catholic bishops there against the
deportation of Dutch Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is one of the strongest backers of his wartime
predecessor, much to the consternation of Jewish leaders, including
Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Israel Lau, who has close personal ties
with the pontiff and has praised him as one of the best friends the
Jewish people have ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, an interfaith activist with strong ties to
the Vatican, said the pope's continued defense of Pius was a
''serious tactical error,'' but that during the pope's Holy Land
trip it was best not to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope and trust that the pope is wise enough not to use this
occasion, his trip to Israel, to raise the issue of Pius XII,''
Rosen said Monday. ''I know that many in the Jewish community are
wise enough not to raise this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilena Steinfeldt, an editor of the Yad Vashem collection of
essays, said the book was not meant to indict the Catholic Church,
but to raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   For a more informed debate, the Vatican should grant free access
to World War II-era documents in its archives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a general feeling that not enough was done (to stop
the genocide),'' Steinfeldt said. ''Still, we are not interested in
a declaration of guilt, but a real reckoning.''

<HEADLINE> Heating Cos. Battle For Customers  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LEBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Memories of budget-busting heating oil price
increases during January's numbing cold wave are fueling an
advertising war in the Northeast in which natural gas providers are
trying to gain ground from oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, home heating oil prices soared to nearly $1.80
per gallon during January's record-setting cold snap, a dollar more
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the gas companies will use this past season's
price hike to try to convert our customers. We are trying to battle
that,'' said Michael Ferrante, president of the Mass Oilheat
Council Inc., representing 300 retail and wholesale oil
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of a half-dozen in the Northeast running radio
advertisements urging customers to stick with oil, despite last
winter's skyrocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
   But natural gas distributors hoping to capitalize on consumer
fears already have begun to woo oil customers with their own ad
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The push is paying off, according to Tom Kiley, president of the
New England Gas Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley said he believes consumers are looking at January oil
bills and asking, ''if this happens now, can it happen again?''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people switching from oil to gas since January has
more than doubled compared to last year, according to Michael
Durand, a spokesman for ComGas which serves the Cambridge,
Worcester and Framingham areas of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had some pretty amazing statistics so far,'' Durand
said. ''Usually people wait until it's warmer before switching.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the January spike, oil is typically less expensive than
gas, according to Ferrante. In nine of the past 10 years oil prices
have been lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil price spike is being blamed on a supply squeeze as
international oil producers reduced production of crude oil over
the past year. The oil ads are meant to ''rebuild consumer
confidence,'' Ferrante said. Similar ads are running in
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and
the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. region.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley said some of the oil ads go too far, including one he said
implies gas companies could not provide heat to all their
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   But even Kiley concedes oil is historically cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't quarrel with ads that say oil has been less expensive
than gas in recent years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike MacDonnell, 35, a sprinkler fitter from Braintree, Mass.,
is the kind of homeowner both groups are trying to lure. MacDonnell
heats his house with oil, but uses gas in a three-family house he
owns.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonnell said he prefers oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year I had gas, the price went up every winter
regardless of what's going on with the economy,'' said MacDonnell,
who added he will keep gas in his other property. ''I don't think
it's worth the expense to switch either way.''

<HEADLINE> Skier at Little Whiteface Mountain dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, N.Y. (AP) -- A 25-year-old Albany man died after
hitting a tree while skiing at Little Whiteface Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Brendon Prostko, a graduate student at the State University of
New York's Albany campus, was skiing the intermediate-level
Excelsior Trail on Sunday when he went off the trail and into the
woods, said Sandy Caligiore, director of communications for the
Olympic Regional Development Authority. Little Whiteface is
adjacent to the larger Whiteface Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel were contacted by another skier who called
on his cell phone at about 3:30 p.m. after discovering Prostko's
body about eight feet off the trail. How long Prostko had been
lying there was unknown. Prostko was taken to Adirondack Medical
Center in nearby Lake Placid, where he died from multiple traumatic
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiore said it appeared Prostko was skiing alone because
there were no witnesses to the accident and no one reported him
missing. The man's parents were notified in Virginia of their son's
death, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 188.13; Dow Up 85.01  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply Monday
as investors once again moved money out of newer technology stocks
and into shares of more established computer makers and traditional
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 188.13 to close at 4,610.00. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 85.01 to close at 10,680.24. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 fell 7.84 to 1,456.63, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies plummeted 25.59 to 549.20.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the Nasdaq diverged as investors drew money out of
lesser-known names in the software and biotechnology groups and
poured it into the largest, most dominant technology companies.
Hewlett-Packard, up 5 5/32 to 144; Intel, up 5[ to 135; and IBM, up
2} to 112}, led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the very high prices of many of these stocks, people who
want to be heavily invested in technology are believing that maybe
they should stick with the tried and true,'' said Richard A.
Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors combined to derail the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, a maker of software used in electronic commerce,
lost more than half its value after the company revised its
financial results for 1998 and 1999. The change came after
MicroStrategy altered the way it recognizes revenue to comply with
current requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which had soared 2000 percent in the past 12 months
to a high of 333 on March 10, plummeted 140 to 86}. MicroStrategy
almost singlehandedly caused the decline in the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies and hastened investors' move toward more
established technology companies, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their problems really rattled investors,'' Dickson said. ''If
you're investing in IBM, you know they're not going to hit you with
this kind of accounting surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers closed mostly lower after Barron's magazine
reported this weekend that dozens of prominent companies are
strapped for cash and may go out of business unless they're
acquired or receive major new investments. Amazon.com fell | to 64
3/16 and eToys fell 1 11/16 to 11 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies also contributed to the Nasdaq's
weakness as investors took profits from the sector's big run early
this year. The Amex Biotechnology Index more than doubled between
Dec. 1 and March 7, leaving those companies vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen fell 5[ to 58 after Barron's detailed its upcoming patent
infringement trial. Also, President Clinton's announcement last
week that he wants to make some genetic research openly available --
rather than bought and sold by biotech companies -- has unsettled
many investors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While those stocks fell, investors sought out a wide range of
blue-chips. United Technologies rose 1{ to 56[, AT&AMP;T rose 3| to 56
13/16 and DuPont rose 2 1/16 to 54|.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portfolio managers have been recognizing value in some of the
old industrial stocks,'' said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist
at J.P. Morgan's private client group. ''There's not a lot of money
coming out of the market, but money is being channeled from the new
economy to the old.''
</P>
<P>
   A protracted decline at the start of the year left many
blue-chip companies at bargain prices before the Dow began bouncing
back last week.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was relatively calm on the eve of the Federal Reserve's
Open Market Committee meeting. Many on Wall Street expect the Fed
to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth
increase since last June. Higher interest rates generally send
stocks lower because they cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy
just enough to contain inflation. Last week, government economic
data hinted at a very modest slowdown, encouraging investors to
believe that dramatically higher rates won't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.13
billion shares, compared with 1.55 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.8 percent.

By The Associated Press	   A powerful sunnyowstorm blew through the central
Rockies on Monday,
the first day of spring, canceling flights and shutting down ski
lifts. A wide band of showers stretched across the East.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heavy sunnyow fell on parts of Wyoming and Colorado, accompanied by
wind gusting to 80 mph in the mountains of northerain Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines canceled 131 of its 300 flights at the Denver

airline to stop its airplanes from landing or taking off there.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Steamboat Springs shut down its ski lifts and sent
sunnyowmobiles to pick up people still on the mountain because of the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just ripping through here,'' resort spokesman Mike Lane
said.

<P>
   In southeast Wyoming, 15 inches of sunnyow fell in Chugwater and 10
inches fell in Woods Landing, and some highways were closed because
of the blowing sunnyow.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise a Bit in Light Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose slightly in light trading Monday in
advance of a Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday that is widely
expected to result in a fifth increase in short-term interest rates
since June.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond nudged up 1/32
point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, continued to hover around Friday's late
level of 6.00 percent. The last close below 6 percent was on Sept.
24, 1999, when the long-term bond yielded 5.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds have rallied in recent weeks as the federal government
bought back $2 billion in long-term debt. The Treasury Department
has said it plans to buy back up to $30 billion in debt this year,
and traders are expecting much of those repurchases to go through.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while Fed rate increases to cool off the economy
have been sending short-term rates rising, the central bank's
efforts to head off a resurgence in inflation are seen as aiding
long-term bonds. Rising inflation makes long-term fixed-income
investments less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities
were down 1/32, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to up
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.96 percent as the
discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 5.78 percent. Six-month
yields were 6.15 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage
point to 5.88 percent. One-year yields were 6.21 percent as the
discount rose by 0.02 percentage point from Friday to 5.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.68} percent from 5.75 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5/32 point to 94 5/16. The average
yield to maturity fell to 6.06 percent from 6.07 percent.

<HEADLINE> Old-School Badgers in Round of 16  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Dick Bennett is smiling this week, and his
players say it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been here for 35 years in Wisconsin, trying to prove his
system works at a major-college level,'' said Mike Kelley, the
junior guard who led the defensive charge in Wisconsin's 66-59
second-round upset of top-seeded Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the clincher. This should prove it to everybody who
said it couldn't be done. ... He's got the right to have a little
fun with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which was 13-12 just four weeks ago and quietly
hoping at least to host a first-round NIT game, might be the most
unlikely team in the round of 16. The Badgers say they owe it all
to Bennett and his system, which has been both praised and reviled
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our success is a product of our system,'' guard Jon Bryant
said. ''You look around our locker room, and we don't have any
really incredible players. But as a team, when we're doing what
(Bennett) wants us to do, we're tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has been coaching for too long to worry about
validation. Still, he can't suppress a little self-satisfaction as
the Badgers prepare for their trip to the West Regional semifinals
in Albuquerque to face LSU on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm too old not to enjoy this a little bit,'' Bennett said.
''You never know which team will be your last one, so it's nice to
see these guys getting close to maximizing their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has heard the criticism, and unlike some coaches, he
admits he listens to it. Bennett's style of basketball -- which he
taught for nearly two decades at Wisconsin-Stevens Point and
Wisconsin-Green Bay before moving to Madison five years ago -- is
only slightly more fun than dental surgery, and just about as
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   He stresses defense above all else, using multiple sets and
frequent adjustments. The offense is supremely deliberate and
half-court-oriented. Fast breaks happen only by accident.
</P>
<P>
   The system both hides the flaws and muffles the strengths of
Bennett's players in favor of a complete team effort. None of the
Badgers even made honorable mention on the all-conference teams
chosen both by the media and the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really the first recruiting class that was his own
choice,'' said junior forward Mark Vershaw, the team's leading
scorer. ''We knew that we were recruited to play his style. We're
the ones that had to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the funny thing about success, Bennett said. It took
just two wins in the NCAA tournament for Bennett's robotic,
unimaginative, offensively inept, dull team to become a brainy,
disciplined, defensive-oriented, hard-working team. Bennett can
only laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only one job that's easier than being a critic, and
that's being a Maytag repairman,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's late-season run is most remarkable for the
suddenness with which it occurred. The Badgers started the 2000
conference season slowly, and after a 51-48 loss at Ohio State on
Feb. 2, Wisconsin was 11-10 and fans were grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims to know exactly when or why, but somewhere in
February, the team's hard work in Bennett's system began to pay
off. Since then, the Badgers are 9-3, with all three losses coming
against No. 5 Michigan State. They beat Indiana in the regular
season finale and won two games in the Big Ten tournament to clinch
an NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Fresno State in the first round, Wisconsin took on
an injury-depleted but confident Arizona team. Several Badgers
heard that the Wildcats were already talking about playing LSU in
the next round just moments before facing Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we might have snuck up on Arizona,'' Bennett said. ''I
don't think coach (Lute) Olson was unprepared, but players have a
way of minimizing their competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin won't be sneaking up on anybody else, and those
critical of Bennett will have a much harder time arguing that his
system doesn't produce results.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers have been to three NCAA tournaments in Bennett's
five years in Madison after just one trip in the previous 50 years.
He has won 20 games twice and raised the program to the middle of
the Big Ten pack.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is enjoying the Badgers' position, he hasn't stopped
preparing for LSU, which plays a similarly slow half-court game.
When asked how he'll beat a team that looks a lot like his own,
Bennett smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we'll have to break out our running game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Ask For Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Lawyers prosecuting Pakistan's ousted
prime minister on Monday asked for the death penalty, saying Nawaz
Sharif deserved the ''maximum punishment'' for the role he played
during an October coup against his government.
</P>
<P>
   Raja Quereshi, the provincial attorney general, told the
anti-terrorist court that Sharif deserved to be put to death for
refusing landing rights to a plane carrying Army Chief Gen. Pervez
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Quereshi also sought the death penalty for Sharif's six
co-defendants, including his younger brother Shahbaz. In addition
to the attempted murder and hijacking charges, the seven are
accused of kidnapping and terrorism. All counts carry a possible
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Quereshi said the court is obliged by law to hand down the
maximum penalty. The law that established the special
anti-terrorist courts was amended during Sharif's government to
make it mandatory that the maximum penalty be applied in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from Oct. 12, when Sharif -- who had fired
Musharraf as army chief of staff -- allegedly ordered officials at
the Karachi airport to close the facility and block runways in an
effort to prevent the airliner with the general and 197 others
aboard from landing.
</P>
<P>
   The same day the military revolted and overthrew the democratic
government. Sharif has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the army took control of the airport
tower, allowing the general to land safely. The pilot of the
Pakistan International Airlines plane testified earlier that when
the aircraft touched down, it had barely seven minutes of fuel
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution asked for the death penalty as it launched its
closing arguments Monday. There was no immediate reaction from
Sharif on the prosecution's request.
</P>
<P>
   The court will hear another two days of arguments from
prosecutors before defense attorneys are given three days to wrap
up their case.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said Sharif and his co-defendants conspired at a
meeting at the prime minister's house to prevent the aircraft from
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Quereshi cited the testimony of Aminuddin Chaudhry, the former
civil aviation authority chairman, who turned state's witness in
exchange for immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry said Sharif ordered the plane diverted to the Middle
East with the knowledge that it would not have enough fuel to
complete the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The trial resumed after a delay following the refusal of
Sharif's lawyers to participate in proceedings in Karachi because
they feared for their lives after the shooting death one week ago
of one of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers apparently reconsidered after the army government
promised them additional security.

<HEADLINE> Impending Twinkie shortage looms from Maine to metro New York  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Teamsters' stranglehold on shipments
of Wonder Bread, Twinkies and other Interstate Bakeries Corp.
products reached all the way down the northeastern corridor to
Philadelphia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Philadelphia bakery was shut down after pickets appeared
Monday, and Teamsters planned to set up pickets in Buffalo, N.Y.,
as well. A New York City bakery also was shut down over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wave that's going to go right across the country,''
said Richard Volpe, director for the union in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began Wednesday with 1,400 Teamsters in New England
who were upset because Interstate Bakeries declined to abide by
arbitration rulings surrounding the company's only New England
plant in Biddeford.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact grew as fellow Teamsters refused to cross the
picket lines set up in other states by the New England drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Biddeford plant made J.J. Nissen, Wonder Bread, Hostess and
Drake's Cakes products. On Friday, a bakery in Wayne, N.J., closed
and that was followed by the closing of the New York City plant on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those plants, along with the plants in Philadelphia and Buffalo,
employ close to 3,000 members of the Bakers Union, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies quickly boosted production of bread, which has a
two-day shelf life. The supply of products like Hostess Twinkies
and Drake's Cakes also was becoming scarce across the New England.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's Supermarkets Inc., which owns 168 stores in New England,
posted signs in its stores on Saturday to explain that certain
baked products were not available because of the strike, said
spokesman Bernie Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hostess products and Drake's Cakes, Shaw's customers
are seeing more Little Debbie and Entenmann's cakes, in addition to
more Shaw's baked goods, Rogan said from his office in East
Bridgewater, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, we have not had any customers who have become
indignant over the lack of Twinkies. I think people basically
understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has been peaceful for the most part, although a
picket was struck Thursday by a truck operated by a management
driver in Biddeford.
</P>
<P>
   The union has accused the company of refusing to honor
arbitration rulings on work rules and to let a fired trucker return
to work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major sticking points has been the company's
requirement that drivers deliver more than one brand of Interstate
products at a time. The Teamsters say the practice violates work
rules designed to protect drivers who get paid different amounts
for each brand.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains it was shut out of the arbitration
process, and it has asked a judge to clarify the process, said Mark
Dirkes, senior vice president for marketing in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial impact on the company and lost wages,
there were no talks scheduled. Both the Teamsters and the company
said the other had to make the first move toward resolving the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   David Nelson, an analyst from CS First Boston in New York, said
the strike doesn't threaten Interstate Bakeries but that it will
dim the company's near-term prospects, especially when coupled with
growing gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strike and rising gas prices, Nelson downgraded
his earnings estimates for Interstate Bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you have to shut down a plant, that causes
complications and the loss of business,'' Nelson said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Killed in Drive-By Attack  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli soldiers opened fire on a Palestinian
car at a checkpoint Monday, killing a woman and wounding her
husband, after a drive-by attack against Israelis nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings came a day before the arrival of Pope John Paul II
and two new steps in the peace process: a transfer of West Bank
territory to the Palestinians and the resumption of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers shot at the car at a roadblock near the Israeli
settlement of Tsurif, Palestinian security officials said. The
slain woman's husband suffered a gunshot in the back and was in
stable condition, said hospital officials in the nearby town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the soldiers opened fire. The Israeli
military had no immediate information about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli roadblock was set up after a gunman fired at an
Israeli vehicle in a drive-by attack nearby earlier Monday. Three
of the seven Israelis in the car were wounded in that shooting, one
seriously, driver Yoram Sharabi told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drive-by shootings have been attributed to Hamas, a
Palestinian extremist group opposed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's shootings came as Israel prepared to hand over another
portion of the West Bank to the Palestinians, under terms of an
interim accord signed last September. The Palestinians are to
receive control of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials signed the maps late Monday.
Signing for the Palestinians, West Bank police commander Haj Ismail
Jabber said the handover would ''help push forward the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Transfer of the territory, including villages near Ramallah,
Hebron and Bethlehem, was set for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Israel and the Palestinians are to resume talks on
a peace treaty that broke off in early February. The talks are to
take place at Bolling Air Force Base outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israel released 10 Palestinian security prisoners Monday as a
goodwill gesture ahead of the Washington talks. Five prisoners were
freed Sunday. The prisoners served time for killing suspected
Palestinian collaborators with Israel or injuring Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian extremists opposed to peace with Israel have often
tried to time attacks to coincide with events in the peace process.
In 1996, a series of suicide attacks on Israeli civilian buses
caused dozens of casualties and halted the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is to arrive in Israel on Tuesday. Visiting
Jordan on Monday, he noted the need for Middle East peacemaking,
calling the conflicts in the region ''grave and urgent.''

<HEADLINE> Feds To Phase Out MTBE Gas Additive  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration moved Monday to ban
the gasoline additive MTBE, an octane booster that has helped clean
the air but has begun to contaminate water supplies around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to take action,'' said Carol Browner,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''Americans
deserve both clean air and clean water, and never one at the
expense of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is now used in one-third
of the gasoline sold in the United States, primarily in areas with
smog problems. The ban, expected to take up to three years to
implement, is a ''backstop measure'' in case Congress can't agree
on a way to phase out MTBE, Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 9,000 community water wells near leaking underground
storage tanks in 31 states may be affected by contamination from
MTBE, according to a study being published this week in the journal
Environmental Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also recommended moves by Congress that would
curb the use of the additive while preserving a market for ethanol,
a more expensive corn-based alternative to MTBE:
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating a section of the 1990 Clean Air Act that led to
widespread use of MTBE by requiring gasoline in areas with serious
air pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring the continued use of ethanol and other fuels made
from biomass and other ''renewable'' sources. Such a requirement,
opposed by the oil industry but backed by agricultural interests,
could boost the price of corn as much as 10 cents a bushel while
having a negligible impact on shoppers, according to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Browner and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the
administration will insist on replacing the oxygenate mandate with
some kind of renewable-fuels standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration ... is not going to take or support any
action that undermines the continued growth of ethanol and other
renewable fuels,'' said Glickman, who appeared at a news conference
with Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol is a potent political issue in several Midwest
corn-growing states, including Illinois, that could be pivotal in
this year's presidential campaign between Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated, or oxygenated, gasoline is required to be sold in
all or parts of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas,
Virginia and Wisconsin. Arizona also uses the fuel because its
supplies primarily come from California refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol is used instead of MTBE in Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, which has been used in gasoline for two decades, has been
detected in 20 percent of the ground water in areas where
reformulated gas is required, compared to 2 percent in other areas,
according to the U.S. Geologic Survey.
</P>
<P>
   California, which has more leeway than other states to regulate
air pollution, has already decided to ban the use of MTBE by the
end of 2002. California, which is seeking a waiver from the
oxygenate mandate, estimated that substituting ethanol for MTBE
would add one to two cents a gallon to the price of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news. We are getting rid of a dangerous poison
and taking a giant step forward for clean water,'' said Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA advisory panel recommended dramatically curtailed usage
of MTBE because of potential water pollution problems and
elimination of the oxygenate standard in the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not suggest, however, imposing the renewable-fuels
requirement that the administration proposed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With advances in refining, neither MTBE nor ethanol is still
needed to maintain air quality, the oil industry contends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it would be a mistake to substitute one mandate for
another. That's how we got into this in the first place, Congress
legislating the content of gasoline,'' said Edward Murphy, a
spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Wohlschlegel, a spokesman for the Republican-controlled
House Commerce Committee, said EPA's ethanol proposal was
''transparently political.'' Browner ''should spend more time on
creating good public policy than on playing campaign manager to
Vice President Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Various bills are being introduced in Congress to phase out the
use of MTBE while protecting the ethanol market. Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said the administration is ''taking the right steps in
moving to get MTBE out of gasoline and putting more renewable fuels
like ethanol into gasoline.''

<HEADLINE> Accused coach admits sexually abusing teens  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A former youth hockey coach who admitted
having sexual contact with three teen-age boys was sentenced Monday
to 2 1/3 to seven years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gilbert, 36, of Brampton, Ontario, pleaded guilty earlier
this month in Onondaga County Court to three separate charges
related to three victims.
</P>
<P>
   After Gilbert completes his state prison sentence in New York,
he will be returned to Canada to face criminal charges there in
connection with his contact with one of the victims on that side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert pleaded guilty to a felony charge of sodomy, admitting
he engaged in deviant sex with a 13-year-old Canadian boy between
July 1 and Aug. 31, 1998, while the boy was staying at his former
home in Baldwinsville.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian boy told authorities that he had more than 100
sexual encounters with Gilbert during a relationship that started
when he was 11. Most of the incidents occurred at Gilbert's
apartment in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sexual abuse
related to sexual contact with a 16-year-old boy in North Syracuse
last October.
</P>
<P>
   He also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of attempted
endangerment of a child, admitting he tried to engage in sexual
contact with a 15-year-old at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert was a volunteer assistant coach in the Lysander Youth
Hockey Association in Onondaga County for three seasons before
moving to Canada in September 1999. His teams included primarily
boys, ranging in age from 11 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gilbert never coached any of the boys he admitted
victimizing, said Chief Assistant District Attorney Rick Trunfio.

<HEADLINE> Court: Race No Factor in Transers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused to allow a Maryland
school district to consider race in deciding whether to let
students transfer to another school, brushing aside a plea to
resolve how far administrators can go to promote diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices on Monday sanctioned a lower court
ruling against the Montgomery County, Md., school district, which
had barred a white boy from transferring from his
minority-dominated neighborhood school to a mostly white magnet
school. In doing so, it declined a request by the National School
Boards Association to defend educators' leeway to foster diversity
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the action by the justices was not a ruling, it did
leave intact the lower court position that such ''racial
balancing'' is unconstitutional when not needed to remedy past
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County Public Schools' lawyer, Patricia A.
Brannan, said she was disappointed the justices will not hear the
district's argument that it is trying to avoid creating ''racial
isolation'' in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important when children are very young ... that
giving them that interracial exposure and culture makes a very
strong impression in terms of being able to deal with people
different from themselves,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools can use race-neutral methods to pursue diversity,
countered Jeffrey D. Eisenberg of Silver Spring, Md., who sought to
send his son Jacob to a magnet school. ''I consider myself to
support diversity. I thought the use of racial bars was too
unfair,'' Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Petersen Jennison, the Eisenbergs' lawyer, said: ''I
don't think they (the justices) want to touch, at this point, the
issue of whether diversity is a compelling governmental interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will have another chance to address the issue
when it considers whether to hear a similar case from Arlington
County, Va. In that case, the same 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals that decided the Maryland case said the Arlington County
public schools could not consider race in deciding which children
could attend an alternative kindergarten. Both Montgomery and
Arlington counties are suburbs of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rulings affect all schools in Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of public school districts allow children to
transfer to different schools through school-choice programs,
magnet schools or charter schools that are publicly funded but
involve less government regulation. Many have been sued over the
use of race in deciding which transfers will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting Montgomery County, the school boards association
said that racial diversity in public schools is a lawful goal
because ''K-12 schools hold a special mission of instilling
citizenship and good character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Montgomery County case, Jacob's parents -- Eisenberg and
Elinor Merberg -- wanted him to attend a magnet school emphasizing
math and science when he started first grade in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They sued after school district officials barred the transfer
because it would harm the racial diversity of Jacob's neighborhood
school, Glen Haven Elementary. It was 24 percent white, 40 percent
black, 25 percent Hispanic and 10 percent Asian at the time. White
enrollment had dropped by 15 percent over the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   The magnet school, Rosemary Hills Elementary, was 66 percent
white, 16 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob's parents said the school district's decision violated his
constitutional equal-protection rights. A federal judge refused to
order a transfer, but the 4th Circuit court struck down the school
district's policy last October.
</P>
<P>
   If student transfers lead to schools dominated by one race or
another, ''any racial or ethnic imbalance is a product of private
choices and it does not have constitutional implications,'' the
appeals court ruled.

<HEADLINE> Irabu Pleased To Be An Expo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Standing on the mound of a practice field
behind Roger Dean Stadium, Hideki Irabu was almost as far from the
Bronx as he possibly could be.
</P>
<P>
   And happy to be a Montreal Expo.
</P>
<P>
   Dealt to Montreal on Dec. 22 after falling out of favor with
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre, the
30-year-old Japanese right-hander admitted he didn't know much
about the team he had been traded to.
</P>
<P>
   What he did know about the Expos, though, interested him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew they had some good young players that know how to play
baseball,'' Irabu said through interpreter Go Ikeda after pitching
four innings in a minor league game Tuesday. ''There's a lot of
potential here.''
</P>
<P>
   With his new teammates enjoying an off-day and just a handful of
spectators on hand on to see the game on one of the back diamonds
of the complex the Expos share with St. Louis, Irabu kept to his
five-day pitching schedule. He allowed one run and three hits to
players in the Cardinals' minor league camp.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has fared just as well against major league competition so
far this spring, going 3-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three starts,
including five shutout innings against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 strikeouts and just one walk in his those three games,
Irabu has proven to be everything new owner Jeffrey Loria -- a New
Yorker who grew up rooting for the Yankees -- could have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's working as hard as we want him to,'' Montreal pitching
coach Bobby Cuellar said. ''He's a pleasure. He understands and he
fits in with everybody and everything we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had 64 starts with the Yankees -- including 28 in
1998 and 27 last season, Irabu only made one postseason appearance
for New York, the team he had dreamed about playing for as a child.
</P>
<P>
   And that appearance -- his final one for the Yankees -- was a
13-hit, eight-run debacle while pitching 4 2-3 innings of relief
against Boston in Game 3 of the AL championship series.
</P>
<P>
   After having been called a ''fat ... toad'' by Steinbrenner
earlier in the season and cast aside on the road to two World
Series championships, Irabu is looking forward to being able to
repay the confidence that Expos manager Felipe Alou has shown him.
</P>
<P>
   Though verbal communication is impeded by the language barrier,
Cuellar says that the team is careful to ensure that Irabu always
feels comfortable about making sure that he understands what is
going on, and that he is understood, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a manager here who's really involved a lot in
that,'' Cuellar said. ''We're not smarter than anybody else but
(Alou) has a way of handling people that come from everywhere else.
We're confident that things will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it known -- through his translator -- to him that if
something's wrong, we want to know. If he has any problems or if
there's something we're doing and he doesn't understand it, we want
to know. We have to keep those lines of communication open and
we're doing that every day. He's like any other pitcher we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   On a staff includes 20-somethings Dustin Hermanson, Javier
Vazquez, Mike Thurman and Carl Pavano, Irabu is by far Montreal's
most experienced starter.
</P>
<P>
   And though he'll no longer have Mariano Rivera around to close
out his starts, Irabu is impressed with the quality of the Montreal
relievers, including former teammate Graeme Lloyd and NL saves
leader Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very strong bullpen,'' Irabu said. ''They have a lot
of experience with Graeme, Steve Kline, Anthony Telford and
Urbina.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Spends $13M in February  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His record-shattering treasury drained by a $2
million-a-week advertising binge, George W. Bush for the first time
trails Democratic rival Al Gore in available cash to spend pursuing
the White House over the next five months, records showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's latest spending report shows he began March
with just $7.5 million -- a tenth of the $73.9 million war chest he
amassed while vanquishing a tougher-than-expected challenge from
John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore's spending slowed over the last two months
along with the threat from his now-ousted challenger Bill Bradley,
leaving the vice president with $10 million in the bank to begin
the month, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has begun to hit the fund-raising trail in pursuit
of $10 million in fresh funds -- a marked reversal that now forces
him to catch up in a money chase he once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor cited the ''hard-fought primary'' in
releasing a report that detailed the sudden reversal of fortunes.
His aides said he already has raised $225,000 this month since
capturing the GOP nomination on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is ready for a fresh start after eight years of
partisanship, division and gridlock under Clinton-Gore. America is
ready for a president who will bring people together to reform
education, save Social Security, strengthen our military and lower
taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men face challenges as they try to conserve money for
national advertising and targeting of key electoral states over the
next five months. Late this summer they'll each receive $67.6
million in federal funds for their fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Bush has raised so much money for primaries that he
has tapped most of the traditional GOP donor base, while Gore is
facing a $40.5 million spending limit he agreed to when he accepted
federal funds for his primary campaign. Bush declined federal
financing for r the primaries, freeing him from the limits.
</P>
<P>
   With some additional fund raising, Gore expects to have about
$14 million to spend through his party's nominating convention. If
Bush reaches his goal, he'd have about $17 million to spend before
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be as much as an advantage as Bush hoped for at the
start of the process,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of
government at Colby College in Maine who studies political
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The February spending report details where much of Bush's
historic treasury went.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis showed he spent $13.2 million last month --
$7.6 million of it on advertising in nine states with early
primaries such as California, New York, South Carolina and
Michigan. He won three of the four, ultimately forcing McCain from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also spent $1.9 million on direct mail and postage,
$236,000 on telemarketing, and $72,500 on polling.
</P>
<P>
   The spending brought his total at the start of March to $63.3
million. And he still had another $3.1 million in unpaid bills --
including $874,921 for telemarketing and $1.1 million for direct
mail -- leaving him about $7.5 million in the bank
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Gore reported $4.1 million in unspent money at
the end of February plus another $7 million in unspent federal
funds owed his campaign. He spent $6.1 million last month, bringing
his overall spending total to $33 million, and raised $2.1 million,
bringing his fund-raising total to $37.2 million. Gore also
reported debts of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore was on pace to raise $400,000 this week at
fund-raisers in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention is on Bush's prolific spending, Corrado
noted the Texas governor needed to force more than a half-dozen
Republican challengers out of the race, including a free spending
millionaire, Steve Forbes, and McCain, a self-styled maverick who
caught on late with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''That success in fund raising in 1999 essentially moved this to
a three-person race before any votes had been counted and ensured
that Forbes' financial wealth would not be an advantage versus
Bush,'' Corrado said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say the early fund raising allowed Bush to achieve
the strategic objectives he sought, which was to use money to get
everyone else out of the race and to be able to outspend those who
were left standing.''

<HEADLINE> Diplomat, Man Charged in Visa Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A U.S. diplomat and a man from Guyana have been
charged in what federal officials described as a scheme to sell
visas to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Carroll, 32, of Chicago and Halim Kahn, 36, of
Georgetown, Guyana, were arrested Friday on charges of conspiracy
to commit bribery and visa fraud, federal prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago said that it also seized
$535,000 and 10 gold bars from safe deposit boxes controlled by
Carroll, a State Department Foreign Service officer, in the Chicago
area.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not say how many visas had been sold by the two
men. But they said that at the time of their arrests they were
planning to sell an additional 250 visas for at least $1 million in
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 months starting in March 1998, Carroll was the officer in
the embassy in charge of issuing visas to Guyanese and other
foreign nationals.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Tribunal Rape Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convened a landmark trial Monday against three Serbs charged with
running camps during the Bosnian war where Muslim women and girls
were beaten, gang-raped and forced to bear Serb babies.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said at least 10 witnesses will testify against
Radomir Kovac, Dragoljub Kunarac and Zoran Vukovic, who face up to
50 counts of rape, torture, enslavement and outrages upon personal
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case about the women and girls, some as young as 12
or 15 years old, who endured unimaginable horrors as their worlds
around them collapsed,'' said Canadian prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, who have pleaded innocent to the charges, face a
maximum life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial marks the first time an international court will hear
a case about camps set up to specifically rape women. It is part of
an attempt by U.N. prosecutors to make wartime sexual assault one
of the most grievous and punishable crimes under international law.
</P>
<P>
   The number of alleged rapes that occurred during the summer of
1992 in the southeast Bosnian city of Foca were so numerous that
prosecutors had to prepare charts to help present their case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say many victims suffered permanent gynecological
harm in addition to the psychological torment that follows a sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Foca case is not the first trial at the U.N. tribunal, which
has handed down sentences of up to 45 years to 14 defendants from
all sides of the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the first trial in which all the charges are sex
crimes and rape is being prosecuted as a crime against humanity --
as a systematic attack on a civilian group.
</P>
<P>
   That presents prosecutors with an added burden of proving that
the rapes were the product of a coordinated scheme, said Kelly Dawn
Askin, a gender-crimes expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to establish that the sexual assaults constituted a
widespread systematic attack, and that might be hard with a series
of isolated incidents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trial follows a string of rulings at the Yugoslav
tribunal and its counterpart on the 1994 Rwandan genocide that have
demonstrated courts were progressive on gender-based crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants sat in stony silence as they followed the
proceedings. Kunarac, a Bosnian Serb Army commander and the key
defendant, occasionally tapped the keyboard of a notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel hearing the case is led by Florence Mumba
of Zambia, whose involvement in a U.N. commission on women's rights
is the focus of a defense appeal in an earlier rape trial that
ended with the conviction of a Bosnian Croat.
</P>
<P>
   Ryneveld reminded judges of the earlier rape trial of Bosnian
Croat Anto Furundzia, which recognized that recollections of
''victims who have suffered traumatic experiences are not
necessarily unreliable.''

<HEADLINE> Mother of Suspect Defends Actions  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Evicted, pushed off welfare
and working two jobs to make ends meet, Tamarla Owens says she was
just trying to help her sons when she sent them to live with her
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is left praying both for her 6-year-old son and for the
family of young Kayla Rolland, whom the boy is accused of killing
in their first-grade classroom with a gun found at his uncle's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cry every night for Kayla,'' Owens said in an interview last
week. ''It's not fair a mother had to lose a child. They're in my
prayers every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors' depiction of Owens as a neglectful mother who sent
her son to live in a ''flophouse'' is unfair, she said. Owens
claimed she didn't know it was a dangerous environment and said she
thought it was the best way to ensure that the boys could continue
attending their regular school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not that bad a person everybody is saying I am,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, 29, and her husband, Dedric Owens, who is in jail on a
probation violation, were charged with child neglect in the Feb. 29
shooting at Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   A judge has given Owens' sister temporary custody of the
couple's 6- and 8-year-old sons and 5-year-old daughter. A custody
hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Monday, two men pleaded innocent to federal charges of
possessing a stolen handgun police say the boy used in last month's
killing. Jamelle Andre James, 19, and the boy's uncle, Sir Marcus
Winfrey, 22, were ordered jailed on $25,000 bond apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey's lawyer said his client was unjustly being blamed.
''It's clear the government's interested in scapegoats,'' William
W. Swor said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said her life has been tough since she became pregnant at
20.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband in and out of jail, Owens for a while stayed
home with her kids while living off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But in January 1999, required to work as part of Gov. John
Engler's effort to get people off welfare, she found two part-time
jobs at a mall about 35 miles from her Mount Morris Township home
just north of Flint.
</P>
<P>
   The commute required taking two buses each way. On some days,
she left home at 8:30 a.m. -- not returning until 11 p.m. During
those days, family members and friends watched the children while
she was gone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, eight days before the school shooting, she was evicted for
falling behind on the rent. Owens said she couldn't find another
affordable place, so she sent her sons to her brother's house and
her daughter to her sister's. She wouldn't say where she stayed
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother is really responsible. He made sure they ate, he
made sure they had clean clothes to go to school, he made sure they
took baths and he walked them to school every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of guns and drugs in the house are news to her, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never sat in his house for hours at a time. I go check on
him, and then I'm gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said she feels partly to blame because she wasn't home as
often as she thought she should be. But that, she said, is because
the state told her she had to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes single mothers is all kids have, and if you take
that single mother from them, then they have nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Truscott, a spokesman for the governor, said the state
probably could have prevented Owens from being evicted. And as part
of Engler's welfare plan, the state provides child care,
transportation and medical insurance to people who leave the
welfare rolls to get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Her minister said Owens turned to her siblings for help with the
best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She put them to where she knew there would be somebody to love
and cherish her kids because of the closeness of her family,'' said
Pastor Danyiel Griffin of the El Bethel Evangelistic Missionary
Baptist Church in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said she still doesn't know exactly what happened the day
of the shooting. Her 6-year-old son -- whom she described as ''the
most lovable little boy I've ever known'' -- usually withdraws when
she has tried to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   But she has vivid memories of his response just after the
shooting: ''He was like, 'I shot a little girl,' and I started
crying, then he was like, 'Well, Mama I didn't mean to,' then he
started crying, so we were both crying standing in the hallway just
crying. And he was like, 'Mama, I really didn't mean to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she asked him again what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't mean to shoot her, Mama. I didn't mean for her to
die,'' her son answered, then started coloring and asked her to
read him a book.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Set To Flicker Out  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Those who plan to succeed where Iridium failed
say they've got better satellite technology, better phones and
better prices. Now they need to address Iridium LLC's biggest
problem.
</P>
<P>
   That means finding enough people who really need mobile phones
that work anywhere in the world. How else can a company hope to pay
for a multibillion dollar satellite system like the one Iridium is
about to destroy in the Earth's atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar Telecommunications LP, the second company to launch a
space-based wireless phone service, is salivating now that its
bankrupt predecessor is about to flicker out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Iridium told a bankruptcy court on Friday that it
wants to pull its satellites from orbit because it can't find new
investors, Globalstar began offering a trade-in on Iridium phones
that were soon to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But if Globalstar were to grab every one of Iridium's 55,000
subscribers, it would still be hard to say Globalstar will ever
find enough customers to produce a profit for its investors, led by
Loral Space and Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wall Street's take on Globalstar has only worsened as
Iridium's fortunes took turn after turn for the worse in recent
months. Since the start of the year, Globalstar's shares have lost
two-thirds of their value. And as Iridium's saga turned hopeless
over the past two weeks, at least two major brokerages lowered
their ratings on Globalstar.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by these humbling experiences, pedigree names
continue to stake their reputations on the satellite concept,
including Boeing and none other than Craig McCaw, the wireless
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the global market looks just as ripe as it did
when Motorola Corp. conceived of Iridium more than a decade ago.
More than 3 billion people have never made a phone call, wireless
or wired, and satellites may provide an easier way to connect those
people than installing cables.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's unclear whether many of those people can afford to
pay the type of rates the satellite companies need to recoup their
investment. Likewise, while just 10 percent of the planet is
covered by land-based cellular networks, most of the people who can
afford mobile phones live in that small swath of the world where
regular wireless service is available.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can only compete in areas where there's no cellular
service, and the number of users who can afford (satellite phone
prices) is uncertain,'' said John Coates, the satellite industry
analyst for Salmon Smith Barney. ''The concept still makes sense,
but you can't generate profits if the price of service is 10 times
greater than cellular.''
</P>
<P>
   While Globalstar has tried to differentiate itself with prices
well below even the reduced prices instituted by Iridium last
summer, it's not so clear that ordinary consumers and business
people will be willing to pay more than a dollar per minute for
wireless calling when regular cellular minutes are now tallied in
dimes and quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If everyday consumers and business travelers won't pay for it,
that leaves a rather limited pool of specialized markets such as
the military, oil rigs, ships at sea and mountain climbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price of wireless is coming down significantly, and the
satellite providers are suggesting they can take the price back
upstream,'' said Gary Miller, chief executive of Aragon Consulting
Group, a St. Louis-based research firm. ''They have a faulty
business model that would have early adopters fund the growth of
the satellite system and be the front engine to pull the mass
consumer in.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Shane Burton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets signed their first
unrestricted free agent of the offseason, defensive tackle Shane
Burton, who agreed to a one-year deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, entering his fifth pro season, can earn as much as
$700,000 through incentives for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel there is a tremendous upside for Shane, who was hurt
for much of last year with a shoulder injury and did not play much
with the Bears,'' agent Drew Rosenhaus said. ''He wanted to play
for Bill Parcells and Al Groh and Mike Nolan and Ray Hamilton. The
Jets have an exciting scheme, and besides that, (linebacker) Marvin
Jones, who is my client, told me the Jets need more big people.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton is 6-foot-6, 305 pounds. The Jets are expected to use a
3-4 alignment, but need some versatility up front, where they tend
to rotate linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an NFL veteran, Shane Burton has displayed the toughness
and experience that should be attributes for him in competing for a
spot on the defensive line,'' Jets coach Groh said.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-round pick in the 1996 draft out of Tennessee, Burton
played his first three seasons with the Miami Dolphins. He was
waived by Miami in training camp last summer and signed by Chicago.
He appeared in 15 games, but played sparingly and had only 14
tackles and three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Burton also will be used on special teams. He has blocked four
field goals in his career.

<HEADLINE> Infielder Hayes Released by Mets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Infielder Charlie Hayes, told he
wouldn't make the New York Mets' opening day roster, was released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes played in 11 spring training games, hitting .386
(10-for-26) with two doubles, one home run, and seven RBIs. Hayes,
34, had signed as a free agent Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the important thing for me now is to be with my
family,'' Hayes said. ''I talked to (Mets GM Steve) Phillips and
Bobby (Valentine) and they pretty much told me I wasn't going to
make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said several clubs have expressed interest in Hayes and
the 11-year major league veteran will remain at the Mets' training
complex for a few days to ponder any offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't appear that Charlie was going to make our team, so
we decided to give him his release so he might have a chance to
catch on with another team,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has played for the Giants, Phillies, Yankees, Rockies and
Pirates, and was a member of the Yankees 1996 World Series
championship team. Hayes has a .264 career average with 232
doubles, 135 home runs and 690 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to be honest with Charlie,'' Valentine said. ''He
wanted to be seen and we let other teams see him. He was hitting
the ball well. I think he can still play. His effort for us was
very good.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Teens Killed By Swerving Van  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- They are a common sight along busy Interstate
15 -- juvenile offenders in bright orange vests, picking up trash.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 45 of them were scouring the desert landscape when a
strip-club dancer who allegedly was driving under the influence
careened off the highway and slammed into the group, killing six
youths aged 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had no warning at all. The van ... just wiped them out,''
said Kirby Burgess, director of the Clark County Juvenile Services
program.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, 20-year-old Jessica Williams, said she had smoked
marijuana two hours before the crash, according to Nevada Highway
Patrol Trooper Michael Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was treated for minor injuries and then jailed on drug
charges and six counts of reckless driving and driving under the
influence. She remained in custody Monday, and it was unclear
whether she had a lawyer who could comment.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Shane David estimated the van was traveling 75 mph, the
legal speed limit, when it ran off the road just north of downtown
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   County officials defended the program, which is used for
youngsters who have committed minor juvenile offenses -- much
different from the so-called juvenile boot camps around the nation.
They work on projects such as removing graffiti and picking up
trash, and can earn credits to pay fines and restitution to
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The program earns the county $46,000 a year from Silver State
Disposal Service, southern Nevada's major trash hauling company.
Some of the trash that the young workers have to pick up comes off
of Silver State trucks making regular runs between Las Vegas and a
landfill 20 miles northeast of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think because the program has been very successful over the
past 11 years, we will continue,'' Clark County spokesman Doug
Bradford said. ''But we will take a look at additional safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Those might include placing cones to restrict traffic in the
lane closest to where the youths are working, Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Two clean-up crews were working at the time of Sunday
afternoon's accident, one on the right side of the highway -- the
group that got hit -- and one in the center divider.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol Sgt. Steve Cabrales said passenger vans that had
brought the juveniles to the work area were parked, and one was on
the right shoulder with its emergency flashers blinking.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred 11 days after another I-15 crash that
killed eight and injured five. That accident occurred 30 miles
south of Las Vegas, after the driver fell asleep, Cooke said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Approves Bread Merger  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved the $625
million merger of The Earthgrains Co. and Metz Holdings Inc. on
Monday after they agreed to sell two Midwestern brands of white
sandwich bread.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the original deal would have substantially
reduced competition in Des Moines, Iowa; Kansas City, Mo.; and
Omaha, Neb., for the sale of what the industry calls white pan
bread, because it is made from enriched white flour baked in flat,
deep-walled pans.
</P>
<P>
   The companies agreed to sell Earthgrains' Colonial brand in Iowa
and in parts of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Illinois, and Metz's
Taystee brand in parts of Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   They will retain the Colonial brand in Arkansas, Tennessee,
Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama and other parts of Missouri
and Illinois. And they will retain the Taystee brand in Michigan,
Minnesota and parts of North and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agreement also permits the government to
require the companies to sell Earthgrains' Des Moines bakery and
other assets related to distributing white bread in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without these divestitures, families with children -- the
primary consumers of white pan bread -- would have faced higher
prices throughout much of the Midwest,'' said Assistant Attorney
General Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   The division simultaneously filed a lawsuit to block the
original deal and a proposed agreement to settle that lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in Chicago. The court must approve the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Earthgrains, headquartered in St. Louis, operates 43 bakeries
throughout the nation and had sales of $1.9 billion last year. In
the areas covered by the agreement, it markets white pan bread
under the Colonial and IronKids brands and private labels.
</P>
<P>
   Metz, headquartered in Sioux City, Iowa, is a subsidiary of
Specialty Foods Corp., of Deerfield, Ill., and had revenues of more
than $600 million last year. Metz markets white bread throughout
the Midwest and in the covered area sells it under the Taystee,
Pillsbury and Old Home brands and private labels.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Sits Out Game With Bad Knee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Next time, Sammy Sosa will run over the
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' star sat out Monday's game and will skip
Tuesday's road trip because of a banged-up knee he got in a
home-plate collision with Colorado Rockies catcher Scott Servais.
The injury isn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's swollen a little bit, but it's nothing we need to worry
about,'' said Sosa, who looked like his normal self, cracking jokes
in the clubhouse and cranking up his radio. ''Nothing big.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's right knee hit Servais' shin guard when they collided
Sunday. He had a few cuts and scrapes, and his knee was still
slightly swollen Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd play if this was the regular season. But since it's
spring training, Chicago Cubs manager Don Baylor decided to give
him some time off.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I play him on it today, it's going to be sore,'' Baylor
said. ''We can't have him limping when we go in to start the
season. So one day of treatment and rest will probably help him a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been one of the most durable Cubs the past three
seasons. He played in 162 games last year and in 1997, and appeared
in 159 games in 1998, when he hit 66 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one or two days, my knee will be great,'' Sosa said. ''I'll
be ready to play 162 games.''

<HEADLINE> Tourney Lifts Seton Hall Spirit  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Two games, two overtimes, two upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has 10th-seeded Seton Hall surged into the final 16 of
the NCAA tournament, but the success has also raised spirits at a
school still mourning the deaths of three students in a dormitory
fire two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess something like this gives a lot of hope for the
school,'' Jason Pascual, a student, said Monday as he sat in the
cafeteria at the campus center. ''It's a great moment in what has
been a tragic semester, and this is something everybody can look to
and draw strength and encouragement from.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very inspirational. It's a great run they are having.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing unusual on campus Monday. No banners hanging
from dorm windows, only a sign in front of Walsh Gym with the final
score from Sunday's 67-65 win over second-seeded Temple and noted
that Ty Shine had 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   The cafeteria, though, was the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a player walked into the fast-food mecca, he seemed
to be on a first-name basis with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Way to go, Rimas.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Great game, Ty.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also words of encouragement. Good luck for Friday's
game against Oklahoma State. Don't stop until the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Rimas Kaukenas said it felt like 1,000 people
offered congratulations on Monday, a far cry from Sunday night when
the team returned to campus shortly after students got back from
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting,'' Kaukenas, a native of Vilnius, Lithuania,
said. ''It's really good to know the school is excited. I was
really anxious to come back on campus and see people be happy about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling has even spread off campus, as students Ben Chibnik
and Chris Roberts noted walking through town.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were fans there were never before,'' Chibnik said. ''We
went down South Orange Avenue and there were all these Seton Hall
fans, kids in apartments leaning out the widows. Where were they
when we were losing?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every student interviewed on Monday said they watched at
least a part of the Pirates' wins over Oregon and Temple on Friday
and Sunday in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Mellin was one of the few who didn't. The sophomore was in
Florida with the university softball team.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team was well informed. Warming up for a game on
Friday against Canisius, someone yelled across the field ''Seton
Hall won.'' A cheer went up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great, finally there's like a school spirit that hasn't
happened,'' she Mellin said. ''Finally everyone is starting to get
involved and into the basketball team. Just the spirit around this
campus is great. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, on Jan. 19, students in Boland Hall, a freshman
dorm, were awakened by fire alarms at 4:28 a.m. Before dawn broke,
three students had died and scores were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Chibnik and Roberts are still dealing with the scars. Both lived
in the third floor of Boland, where the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are acting like nothing happened,'' Chibnik
said. ''But for the people who were actually there, it's harder now
than it really ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chibnik had a session planned with a counselor later Monday
night. Even though he's moved to another dorm, he's had trouble
sleeping -- even at home.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has vivid memories of the fire -- 4:28 a.m is ingrained
in his mind. So is the smell of burning plastic and the sight of
thick black smoke when he opened his apartment door, unable to see
as he crawled along the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   He rubs his knees as he tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''The floor was so hot, I burned my knees a little, the hair on
my knees burned,'' Roberts said. ''I thought I was going to die. I
got up and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   It led to a door and safety.
</P>
<P>
   But that was months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like it's been a boost,'' Roberts said. ''It's good to
see a good attitude around the school for once.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy will always be there,'' Mellin said. ''This kind
of raises the spirits up. There is always a positive out of
everything, something you look forward to.''

<HEADLINE> 'Brockovich' Squashes Other Films  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julia Roberts swept into theaters as
tough-talking ''Erin Brockovich'' and captured a superstar share of
weekend film receipts: $28.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The film's debut at No. 1 earned more than the next three films
combined. The previous weekend's leader ''Mission to Mars'' dropped
50 percent from its debut earnings to finish second at $11.4
million. ''Final Destination'' was No. 3 with $10 million in its
opening, according to final weekend figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' had the second-highest March opening ever --
just behind the $31.4 million of Jim Carrey's ''Liar, Liar'' in
1997. It was also the second-best Roberts' film debut behind last
July's $30 million for ''Runaway Bride,'' said Exhibitor Relations
Co. Inc., which charts the box office.

<HEADLINE> Holloway Questionable For Friday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Seton Hall point guard Shaheen
Holloway needed crutches to walk on his sprained left ankle Monday.
His status is questionable for Friday's game against Oklahoma State
in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who converted a full-court driving layup on Friday to
give Seton Hall a 72-71 overtime win over Oregon, had a second set
of X-rays taken of the ankle Monday. They were also negative, Seton
Hall sports information director Marie Wozniak said.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI was also performed to examine the ligament, but the
results won't be known until Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior was treated with ice and electric stimulation on
Monday. Holloway also is wearing a compression boot.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway sustained a high sprain of the left ankle in the first
half of a 67-65 overtime win over Temple in the second round
Sunday. Ty Shine, his replacement, scored a career-high 26 points
and hit a game-winning 3-pointer with 18.9 seconds to play.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urged To Reduce Poverty  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank should refocus its efforts
toward reducing poverty in the world's poorest countries, the
Clinton administration said Monday as it offered a package of
changes aimed at blunting a congressional effort for an even more
radical overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the World Bank and
regional development banks working in Asia, Africa and Latin
America should be more selective in the kinds of loans they make.
They should emphasize poverty reduction, Summers said, while
leaving financing of commercial projects to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the development banks should reward countries that
best use foreign loans to alleviate poverty, rather than lending
only to countries that face the direst financial circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that there will inevitably be a tension between
helping the countries most in need and helping those who will use
multilateral development bank resources well,'' Summers said. ''But
... increasingly we need to shift the balance in favor of providing
support to countries where donors can have confidence that
assistance will be well used.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Summers said that when loans are made to poor countries that can
attract private capital, such as China and Brazil, those loans
should carry higher interest rates than the World Bank charges for
loans to the poorest nations that lack access to private capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' package of proposals also included recommendations for
the development banks to emphasize loans for vaccines to fight
health problems of the Third World and projects that would protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's reform proposals for the development banks
followed a similar set of recommendations by Summers in December to
overhaul the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the administration's proposals do not go nearly
so far as those of an advisory commission appointed by Congress.
That panel, chaired by economist Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon
University, recommended limiting the IMF to providing short-term
emergency loans to countries facing balance-of-payments crises.
</P>
<P>
   The Meltzer panel also wanted the World Bank to eliminate the
two-thirds of its lending that goes to countries such as China and
Brazil, which have access to global capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes its more modest reform package will
shape the upcoming debate in Congress and at the spring meetings of
the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from the audience, Summers said groups
that support the aims of the IMF and the World Bank to fight
poverty need to build a grass-roots constituency in the United
States to air their views in Congress. Conservative Republican
members are supporting the more radical cutbacks favored by the
Meltzer commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until that constituency (to battle global poverty) is larger,
this will be a very difficult fight,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not have the power to impose changes on
the IMF and the other multinational lending institutions, but the
size of U.S. voting shares in all of the organizations gives
America a powerful voice for arguing change.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency,
the World Bank, both of which are headquartered in Washington, the
regional development banks are the Inter-American Development Bank,
the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said in all the debate, the world should not lose sight
of the important role played by the development banks in promoting
global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work of the World Bank and the regional development banks
is probably more important now than it has ever been,'' Summers
said. ''As the president has often observed, today the United
States has as much to fear from states that are too weak as states
that are too strong.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Secures 12,000 Season Tickets  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Wild has met NHL guidelines
for expansion clubs by securing 12,000 season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day in Minnesota Wild history,'' club CEO Jac
Sperling said Monday, seven months before the team begins play in
the new 18,600-seat Saint Paul Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL requires that expansion clubs reach the 12,000 season
ticket mark by April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''This validates the NHL's return to Minnesota and we look
forward to building a championship team for our fans,'' Wild
president Tod Leiweke said.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL awarded teams to St. Paul and Columbus, Ohio, in its
latest round of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota lost the North Stars to Dallas in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said it was ''a daunting task'' to secure 12,000 season
tickets, including suites and club level seats at the new arena,
which will be completed in September just before the Wild's
inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had an unbelievably high conversion rate of over 90
percent,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The league average for the last five expansion teams -- San Jose,
Anaheim, Florida, Nashville and Atlanta -- was a 69 percent
conversion rate, team spokesman Bill Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony Monday, Gordie Howe presented the 12,000th Wild
season ticket holder, Dennis Pladson, 56, of South Saint Paul, with
a team jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are so important to the game of hockey,'' Howe said.
''It's tough playing to half a house, and believe me, I've been
there before.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception, Howe's wife, Colleen, surprised the team by
announcing the couple planned to become Wild season ticket holders
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gordie and I are going to purchase four season tickets and we
will rely on the Wild management to distribute them,'' she said.
''We wanted to do something for kids who would not normally have
the opportunity to see a hockey game in such a beautiful setting.''

<HEADLINE> State recommends more spending for foreign languages, smallerclasses  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Some school districts would get more state
funding to help pay for foreign language instruction and to lower
class sizes in elementary grades, under new school funding
guidelines released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts would also see a jump in their special education
funding in the 2001-2002 school year, under the figures released
Monday by the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The department released the amounts it deems necessary for
districts to deliver the ''thorough and efficient education''
required by the state constitution. The new figures don't kick in
until the 2001-2002 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature must approve the amounts, which vary by
grade levels, before they become final.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are one factor in a complicated formula that
determines how much state aid each district receives. Enrollment
and a district's wealth are other major factors used to determine
state aid.
</P>
<P>
   The per-pupil amounts vary from about $3,900 for each
kindergartner to about $8,780 for each high school student.
Currently, those amounts range from $3,541 to $8,500. The
department issues the funding report every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Districts can spend more or less, depending on local need. And,
most districts receive only a portion of their funding from the
state. The rest comes from property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner David Hespe is recommending the
biggest increase -- nearly 10 percent -- for elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the state to help districts lower class sizes from an
average of 21 to 18 in grades kindergarten through third.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe is also recommending the state begin to fund its mandate
that all elementary schools teach a foreign language by 2001-2002.
Educators have complained that the state is failing to provide any
funding for that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new figures, districts with increasing elementary
enrollment stand to gain the most, said Mike Azzara, the education
department's assistant commissioner of finance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will redistribute aid to those districts that have a
greater percentage of elementary students,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts would also enjoy a boost in special education
funding -- another area that educators have long complained the
state underfunds. The guidelines range from $315 per pupil for
children with the mildest disabilities to about $13,000 for
students with severe disabilities. Currently, the amounts range
from $300 to about $12,600.
</P>
<P>
   Middle and high schools would receive increases to keep pace
with inflation, under the new figures.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association, said the increases for elementary schools and special
education are good news.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're recognizing that school districts are going to have
costs associated with the world language standard and that has not
been recognized before,'' said Belluscio.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the state is acknowledging that districts are
incurring legitimate costs to educate children with learning
problems by restoring -- and increasing -- special education funding
that was cut a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report also outlines costs for preschools, which the state
Supreme Court has ordered for all 3- and 4-year-olds in 30 of New
Jersey's poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers provide that districts would receive $4,575 per
preschool student, or between about $500 to $800 for each student
in the district, whichever is greater, Azzara said.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures would give more money to districts that have a
growing preschool and elementary enrollment, Azzara said, adding
that about half of the 30 ''special needs'' districts would receive
''significant'' increases in preschool funding.
</P>
<P>
   But David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center, which
represents poor children in the 30-year-old school funding fight,
said the numbers are, once again, based on models rather than the
needs of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no explanation of how they arrived at $4,575 per pupil
for preschool,'' said Sciarra. ''This report needs to be rejected
by the Legislature. They should order (the education department) to
come up with a number that has some basis in the real world.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Chief Hopes For Aid  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombian Defense Minister Luis Fernando
Ramirez said Monday night he is hopeful Congress will approve $1.6
billion in assistance for Colombia within the next month, but he
cautioned that the proposal could be delayed until later this year
or scuttled altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez met with reporters at the State Department after a day
of consultations with Clinton administration officials and
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   During his meetings, he reviewed the steps his government is
taking to combat human rights violations -- a major source of
concern among many lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said the package, aimed primarily at combatting drug
traffickers, should be taken up by the full House next week and by
the Senate shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear it will be approved, but all efforts are being
made to see it passed before Holy Week,'' he said. Holy Week begins
on April 16, Palm Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of a $9 billion assistance package that
also includes money for Kosovo and other trouble spots. Ramirez
indicated he was concerned that the package could be rejected not
because of opposition to the assistance to Colombia but because of
other aspects of the package.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, the House Appropriations Committee voted 33-13 to
send the proposal to the full House. It contains $1.7 billion in
assistance to combat drug trafficking in the Andes, the bulk of the
money earmarked for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said the costs to Colombia will be high if Congress
decides to handle the aid program through the normal appropriations
process rather than on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is not treated as an emergency supplemental, it would
delay the implementation of the process in Colombia,'' he said,
noting that a large part of the request is not cash but rather
equipment, such as helicopters that must be ordered and assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Delays would only assist drug traffickers in southern Colombia
against whom the aid package is primarily directed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his meetings here, Ramirez is using his U.S.
visit to tell private groups that the aid request is worthy of
support. He flew here after a visit to San Francisco and planned to
meet with groups at Harvard University on Tuesday before returning
to Colombia later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Army: Review Needed in Rivers Case  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army Corps of Engineers officials say further
study is needed before determining whether there is any validity to
charges the agency doctored data to defend $1 billion in dam
construction on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers, according to
an in-house review released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the study suggested re-examining barge traffic to see
whether the construction needs to be done immediately or can be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The internal examination is among several investigations into
whether the agency ordered changes in economic analysis of the need
for expanding the 60-year-old lock-and-dam system from Minneapolis
to Cairo, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sweeney, the Corps economist who led the seven-year, $54
million study, filed a sworn affidavit last month accusing top
Corps officials of rigging the data. Sweeney maintains he was
reassigned in 1998 after his team concluded the costs of
large-scale improvements would far outweigh any benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The barge industry and grain shippers want swifter passage,
while environmentalists argue that navigation is killing the rivers
and their ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps study said in general the study followed agency
guidelines but concluded ''additional information and explanation
is required.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum, signed by Major Gen. Hans Van Winkle, the Corps'
deputy commander for civil works, recommended broadening the review
to include navigation industry and public-sector interests, as well
as other Corps districts. The memo also suggested re-visiting
earlier projections of growth in barge traffic and looking more
closely at the impact of lengthening the locks on recreational
boating and on fish and habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Corps spokeseman Homer Perkinds said the four pages of
recommendations will be followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report states what needs to be done, and I think we'll let
it stand on its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges by Sweeney, accompanied by reams of supporting
documents, prompted the federal Office of Special Counsel to
conclude the Corps probably violated the law and to order a full
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera announced last month that the
National Academy of Sciences, a congressionally chartered private
group, would review the Corps' study.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups want spending on the project halted until
the investigations are settled. Tim Searchinger, an attorney with
Environmental Defense, a pro-environment group, said the Corps'
report raises many of the same issues cited by Sweeney and
opponents of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like a compromise between the chefs and the cleanup
team,'' Searchinger said. ''It raises good questions and bad
questions, but we think the real point is that it's not appropriate
for the same people who cooked the books to be doing the new
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corps had planned to issue draft plans for improving the
system of 43 locks and 37 dams as early as July, but the
investigations could delay that. Four alternatives, from $190
million to $1 billion, are on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent analysis leans toward lengthening five
Mississippi River locks, along with other, smaller improvements.
The most costly also would double the capacity of two Illinois
River locks.

<HEADLINE> Nader Foresees Health Changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Consumers, nurses and doctors should
take advantage of looming changes in the medical system to force
creation of universal health care, consumer advocate Ralph Nader
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Yogi Berra said, 'When you reach a fork in the road, take
it,'' he told the California Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   A Green Party candidate for president, Nader said for-profit
health maintenance organizations are ''destabilizing themselves by
their own greed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are in a real transitory period, which gives us a
real opportunity to recast our health care system in a nonprofit
mode and implement universal health care,'' he told reporters
before his speech.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doubted that Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the likely Democratic and Republican candidates for
president, would push for ''sound medical plans for every
American.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I see piecemeal, complex, inscrutable kinds of programs by two
politicians who are afraid to take on'' medical corporations, Nader
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 47 million Americans lack health insurance and another
20 million don't have enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nader got less than 1 percent of the vote as the Green Party's
presidential candidate in 1996, but he said that was because he
didn't really campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, he said he plans to raise several million
dollars, qualify for federal matching funds and campaign actively
in all 50 states.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Campaigns Against Ritalin  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used the power of the
White House bully pulpit to call attention Monday to a troubling
matter for parents of preschoolers -- the use of Ritalin and other
mind-altering drugs to treat youngsters' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be senator from New York announced several federal
initiatives after a White House meeting with Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Surgeon General David Satcher and
other child and health leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here to bash the use of these medications,'' said
Clinton. ''But we do have to ask some serious questions about the
use prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   She outlined a plan to ask the Food and Drug Administration to
issue guidelines for use of such drugs for children under 6. She
also proposed more clinical trials on the young, a fall conference
on children's mental health, handbooks for parents and training for
doctors who treat their children.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady later dismissed questions about whether the White
House event was primarily intended to bolster her Senate campaign
in New York against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her
presumed Republican rival. He, too, has been accused of campaigning
from city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've worked on these issues for more than 30 years,'' said
Clinton. ''I'm going to keep working on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking the lead on family issues from Washington could give
the first lady an advantage in her new home state, said political
scientist Griffin Hathaway of Towson State University in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House platform is the most visible in the country,''
Hathaway said. ''With an unprecedented congressional campaign by an
incumbent first lady, that magnet is even more amplified.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks, he said: ''If the policy initiatives have
not worked, that can generate backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she was motivated by research showing a steep climb
in toddlers being medicated without adequate research into what
works best for children still undergoing crucial brain development.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, usually is
diagnosed in school-age children based on interviews and observed
behavior. Symptoms include a restless inability to sit still to
read, study or even watch television. Some mild forms of these
symptoms are common in many children, leading experts to worry that
ADHD is diagnosed too often.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these young people have problems that are symptoms of
nothing more than childhood or adolescence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that
from 1991 to 1995, doctors' prescriptions for 2- to 4-year-olds
jumped threefold for Ritalin, a common brand name for the stimulant
methylphenidate. The drug is believed to increase a child's
alertness by stimulating the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children on antidepressants such as Prozac, often
used to control bedwetting, doubled in that time period.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., manufacturer of Prozac, said the drug was never
intended to be given to young children. ''Prozac is approved for
use in patients 18 years of age and older who suffer from
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia,'' the
Indianapolis-based drugmaker said. ''Lilly does not promote the
product's use in any other patient population.''
</P>
<P>
   Behavior therapy can be more helpful than drugs, said Deborah A.
Ziegler, an expert on behavior disorders for the Council for
Exceptional Children, a suburban Virginia-based advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> Torre Says He's Looking For Depth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Most managers would love to have Joe Torre's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees manager says his team lacks depth, but he
remains happy with his pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were not as deep as we were last year,'' Torre said Monday
before the Yankees played Pittsburgh on Monday night. ''I like our
pitching. That's what I'm keying on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees face two pitching questions -- finding a No. 5
starter and the health of reliever Allen Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall is the frontrunner for the No. 5 spot, but has
struggled in his two starts after being sidelined by a stiff back.
</P>
<P>
   Although Torre expects Yarnall to fill the role, he's less than
definitive about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fifth spot is up for grabs at this point in time,'' Torre
said. ''His (Yarnall) stuff is good. His confidence is what I'll
keep my eye on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall, who has allowed 15 runs in four innings, will follow
David Cone Tuesday night when the Yankees host Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza would likely get the nod should Yarnall falter.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has been bothered by a sore throwing shoulder. He threw
off a bullpen mound Monday, and might make a game appearance by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New York is looking to replace backup infielder Luis Sojo,
designated hitter Chili Davis and backup catcher Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Melo and Rafael Bournigal are battling for the infield
spot. Chris Turner and Tom Pagnozzi, who missed all of last season
following shoulder surgery, are the leading backup catcher
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The frontline people are still all in place,'' Torre said.
''The offense, I really don't dwell on that. I know you can win
with three or four runs if you have the pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Niedermayer: I Should be Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The NHL will hold a hearing on
Tuesday to consider disciplinary action against New Jersey Devils
defenseman Scott Niedermayer for hitting Florida's Peter Worrell
over the helmet with his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer said Monday that he should be suspended for the
strike which came with 1:45 remaining in the Devils' 5-2 win over
the Panthers on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A melee ensued and Worrell, who did not appear to be hurt,
created more controversy. Leaving the ice, he made a
throat-slashing gesture toward the Devils bench.
</P>
<P>
   While the action is banned in the NFL, hockey has not banned it.
</P>
<P>
   The Niedermayer hit comes less than a month after Marty McSorley
of Boston was suspended for the season for swatting Donald Brashear
of Vancouver across the side of his head with a two-handed swing of
his stick. The attack sidelined Brashear for the season with a
serious concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, who has never been suspended in eight seasons,
received a match penalty for attempting to injure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ugly,'' Niedermayer said. ''I can't really say anything.
It was not the thing to do. It was a mistake. I can't go and take
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey general manager Lou Lamoriello hoped that the
infractions would not be seen in the same light.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have confidence it will be treated as an isolated
situation,'' Lamoriello said Monday. ''It should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida assistant coach Bill Smith told the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel that Niedermayer's chop over Worrell's head ''was as
bad as McSorley's.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying not to make excuses, Niedermayer and his teammates
said Worrell played a dirty game. He elbowed Niedermayer and
received a penalty early in the contest and later was sent off for
charging defenseman Colin White.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils also felt Worrell threw other elbows that did not
receive penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how Scott feels,'' Devils center Bobby Holik said.
''We're only human. We make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik was angry at the throat-slashing gesture by the 6-foot-6
Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NFL has a written rule on that,'' Holik said. ''The NHL
might have to come up with something, too.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Probe Expanded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has expanded its
investigation into possible gasoline tank leaks on DaimlerChrysler
minivans during side-impact crashes to include 2000 model-year
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tank of a 2000 Dodge Caravan leaked during recent
government testing, said officials from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. Two earlier NHTSA crash tests on
1999 minivans also exposed gas leaks that could spark fires.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler spokesman Mike Aberlich said the company is
conducting its own tests, but has not seen similar results. He also
said the company had no complaints of fuel leakage or fires because
the tank's hose came loose in crashes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working to try to figure out what it is they saw and why
because as we look at the real world accidents that have happened
with minivans over the years, we haven't seen this phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA side-impact tests are designed to gauge how well the
vehicle protects passengers in a crash, not gas-tank performance.
It simulates a vehicle crashing into the side of the minivan at
about 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   During a test of a 1999 Dodge Caravan minivan on Jan. 5, the
hose that channels gasoline from the gas pump into the minivan's
fuel tank pulled loose from the tank, and half the tank's test fuel
spilled out, an agency report said.
</P>
<P>
   That led to an investigation focused on the Dodge Caravan and
Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager, and Chrysler
Town and Country from model years 1996 through 1999. The
investigation, begun in June, initially focused on more than 2
million minivans, but expands by about 750,000 with the year-2000
models.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork
including any complaints. An investigation eventually can lead to a
recall, but many are dropped.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Returns Ecuadoreans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A U.S. Coast Guard cutter turned 234
Ecuadoreans over to national authorities Monday after intercepting
their boat as they tried made their way for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorean-registered boat, the Viviana II, was seized
Saturday morning in the Pacific Ocean 240 miles off the Andean
nation's shore by the Thetis, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter based out
of Key West, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's navy said the 40 women and 194 men found on the
Viviana II were all from the country's central Andes and were
detained because they were traveling through international waters
without documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers, all reportedly in good condition, were handed
over to Ecuadorean officials Monday, the navy said, and were being
held in the port of Esmeraldas, 112 miles northwest of the capital,
Quito.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what charges, if any, would be
lodged against them.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Steve Matthews, spokesman for the Coast Guard in Miami, said
the U.S. government received permission from Ecuador to stop the
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Their intended destination was Nicaragua, U.S. Coast Guard and
Ecuador authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Knight, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard's 11th
District in San Francisco, said a growing number of Ecuadoreans are
using high seas routes to Central America and Mexico to illegally
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last one that we intercepted was in January and that was
the fourth or fifth in the last 12 months,'' she told The
Associated Press. ''We've noticed a rapidly growing trend of
Ecuadoreans boarding these vessels and heading for other ports with
the ultimate destination being the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's 12 million people are struggling through their worst
economic crisis in decades. Last year, some 320,000 citizens
legally emigrated from the country.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Hear Burma Case  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN McMILLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A Massachusetts law against doing business with
Myanmar because of its poor human rights record has confronted the
U.S. Supreme Court with a fundamental constitutional question: Can
state and local governments make their own foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and an appeals court have said no, and
Massachusetts has appealed to the nation's highest court. As the
justices hear the case Wednesday, cities and states with similar
laws and activist groups will be watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more people who are becoming interested in grassroots
influence on international affairs and human rights issues see this
may be a turning point in the techniques they will be able to
use,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing, who sponsored Massachusetts'
law.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, the Southeast Asian nation formerly known as Burma, is
one of the world's poorest countries and is controlled by its
military. The United States and other countries have restricted aid
since thousands of protesters were gunned down in a 1988
pro-democracy uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago -- while U.S. policy still allowed trade with
Burma -- Massachusetts lawmakers barred the state from buying goods
and services from companies that do business with Myanmar -- unless
there is no other comparable bid. Exceptions were made for
purchases of some medical devices, for news-gathering companies and
for telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the so-called Burma Law said they had a right to
influence foreign policy and decide how to spend taxpayers' money,
calling it a matter of free speech and states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the law was approved, the federal
government imposed similar but less restrictive trade sanctions on
Myanmar. So the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule by late
June, could decide that the Massachusetts law is essentially moot
because of the federal action.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's opponents, including the National Foreign Trade
Council, which represents 580 major U.S. corporations and sued
Massachusetts over the law, hope the court goes much further -- and
restricts state and local governments' rights to enact such laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group and the U.S. government say foreign policy
matters ought to be left to Washington, so as not to weaken the
United States' position as a business partner. They cite the
constitutional provision granting foreign policy powers to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country has to be able to speak with one voice,'' said
Frank Kittredge, president of the trade council.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Massachusetts law was struck down by a federal
judge in 1998 and the decision was later upheld by an appeals
court, there are about 20 similar laws elsewhere in the country,
including in New York City, Ann Arbor, Mich., and Chapel Hill, N.C.
Other cities are considering such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing pointed out that if local governments cannot set such
purchasing rules, activists might turn to such tactics as consumer
boycotts, which he said are potentially more detrimental in the
long-term to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Kittredge said competitors in other countries see differing
state and local policies in the United States and use that as a
sales tactic, telling potential customers that an American company
may not be a reliable supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a business perspective, it's a terrible thing,'' said
Robin Conrad, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which also
opposes the Burma Law. ''You've got 50 states plus the District of
Columbia, 309,000 sub-federal jurisdictions, able to enact their
policies. It makes an overall mess of things.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Dead Fraternity Brothers Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Hundreds of students, many wearing
sweatshirts adorned with their Greek letters, packed a campus
auditorium Monday to mourn three fraternity brothers killed in a
weekend fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are simply no words to express our sadness,'' Bloomsburg
University President Jessica Kozloff told students.
</P>
<P>
   A fire in the off-campus Tau Kappa Epsilon house killed the
three -- including the fraternity president --early Sunday. Others
jumped to safety in their underwear from a second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's any number of things it could be,'' said Bloomsburg
police Sgt. Joe Wondoloski. ''We can't rule out a cigarette being
thrown down and smoldering, or an electrical overload. There were
space heaters there. There was a DJ there at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire started several hours after the end of a party attended
by about 30 students.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg, founded in 1839, is a state university about 100
miles northwest of Philadelphia with an enrollment of about 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators reacted Monday to the fire with a resolution
and a bill aimed at improving campus fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would force public and private universities to get
sprinklers for all student housing within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not address off-campus, private buildings like the
fraternity house at Bloomsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said future legislation may target private buildings
where students live.

<HEADLINE> Coke Workers Shoot For Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Black employees of the Coca-Cola Co. hope to
force a quick settlement of a racial discrimination suit against
the soft drink giant by staging a series of rallies during a bus
ride to the company's annual meeting in Delaware next month.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Coca-Cola Justice Ride'' will carry about 150 current and
former workers on the journey from Atlanta, said Larry Jones, a
former human resources manager and chief organizer of the rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shareholders, and we will be making our voices heard at
the meeting,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   A convoy of three buses will leave April 15 and will stop for
rallies in Greensboro, N.C., Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C.,
before reaching Delaware for the April 19 meeting, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants also plan to meet with members of Congress to
discuss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The company had no comment on Jones' plan.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Daft, Coke's new chairman, has said the company is
''working toward an expedient and equitable resolution'' of the
suit. Daft is creating a new position of vice president and
director of diversity as part of an effort to meet soon-to-be
established diversity goals.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by eight current and former employees, claims
Atlanta-based Coke has discriminated against blacks in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations. The company has denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Jones wants the company to settle the suit quickly. He said the
settlement should include reparations to black employees and
systematic changes that improve conditions for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this lawsuit degenerates into something less than fair and
total reparation for the full class of individuals, then we will
absolutely consider calling for a national boycott,'' said Jones,
who had been with Coke for 15 years when he was laid off last month
along with about 500 other workers as part of a reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks with a mediator are scheduled to begin next
month.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Sues Shalala Over Organ Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JENNY PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin and its two major transplant
centers sued U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
on Monday over new rules intended to change the way organs are
distributed for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The rules order the United Network for Organ Sharing to send
more organs to the sickest patients, regardless of where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, organs are distributed locally first. Wisconsin
stands to lose under the new system because its organ donation
rates are high and its patients generally get organs faster than
those in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, the state claims Shalala's agency stripped the
United Network for Organ Sharing, the private agency running the
nation's transplant program, of the power to decide how organs
should be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims Shalala's actions unlawfully substitute her
personal judgment for that of medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin officials are seeking an injunction to prevent Shalala
from enforcing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services officials disputed the lawsuit's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regulation is entirely grounded in the law as Congress
intended,'' said Jon Nelson, who oversees the department's
transplant division.
</P>
<P>
   Policy experts in Congress and others believe it would be
unconstitutional for Shalala to lose her authority to set policy.
Legislation pending in Congress would clarify who has authority to
set the transplant policy.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Louisiana has also tried to stop the new rules in
court in a case now on hold. South Carolina has threatened a
lawsuit as well.

   Funeral For Preschoolers Held in Quebec
</P>
<P>
   NICOLET, Quebec (AP) -- The signs of lives ended much too soon
were everywhere Monday at the funeral for two of the seven
pre-schoolers killed in a minivan collision last week on a day-care
outing.
</P>
<P>
   A blue teddy bear holding a child's flannel blanket sat on a
table overlooking the somber mourners who crowded the local Roman
Catholic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Two small, white coffins lay side by side. Placed behind them
were lovingly crafted, colorful posters of sunshine and doves.
</P>
<P>
   The simple service was attended by about 500 family, friends and
others who just wanted to say a quiet goodbye to five-year-old Karl
Tailly-Duval and his playmate Viviane Cloutier, four.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals also were held in other communities on Monday for
two-year-old Stacy Roy and Frederic Isabel-Fournier, five.

Safety Advocates Urge Proper Use of Seat-Belts After Quebec
Accident
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The tragic crash of a day-care minivan that
killed seven pre-schoolers in Quebec has parents and safety
advocates taking a second look at how children are secured in
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary inquest shows each of the 10 children traveling to
a maple sugar shack was probably wearing a seat belt when the
deadly collision occurred. However, the same belt might have been
used to secure as many as three children.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Automobile Association said Monday it has anecdotal
evidence to suggest many parents, unaware of the risk at which they
are putting their children, are not following safety
recommendations for buckling up their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely never strap more than one child to a seat-belt,''
Rosalinda Fischer, manager of public and government affairs for the
CAA, warned emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shouldn't happen. A seat-belt was designed to hold one
person. The reason for that is if two people are strapped together,
on impact, their heads and bodies are going to crash together.''
</P>

Liberals Makes no Apologies For Export Loans
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Liberals made no apologies Monday for giving
loans to foreign governments, agencies and companies to buy
Canadian, while the Economic Development Corporation called reports
of bad loans ''a complete fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   EDC spokesman Rod Giles said it's not true that the
taxpayer-backed EDC rang up $22 billion in outstanding loans -- of
which $2.8 billion had been written off.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are probably confusing that with the amount of money we
have set aside in the event we need to cover lost loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles confirmed that $1 billion was given to the U.S. railroad
Amtrak to support Canadian companies that make equipment and
supplies. He refused to disclose details.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Amtrak loans are already being repaid.

Conference Board To Study Soaring Gas Prices For Feds
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A study commissioned by the federal government on
soaring gas prices will do nothing to help consumers grappling with
the problem now, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Industry Minister John Manley announced in the Commons on Monday
the study will examine why gas prices have ballooned in the past
year and report back by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board of Canada, a public policy think-tank, will
study the relationship between prices at the pump and the price of
crude oil, consumer demand and gasoline supply.
</P>
<P>
   It will also look into the conduct, structure and performance of
the gasoline industry.
</P>
<P>
   While many agreed a broader study is probably a good idea,
critics said the issue has already been studied to death and the
government is simply ducking responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really have to wonder how credible and sincere the desire to
help is here,'' said David Bradley of the Canadian Trucking
Alliance.

British Columbia Farmer on Combine Ends Protest Journey in Ottawa
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- After harvesting bushels of public attention with
his protest trek from British Columbia, grain farmer Nick Parsons
parked his big red combine on Parliament Hill on Monday to make
some political hay.
</P>
<P>
   The producer, who lumbered his way to Ottawa at speeds of about
20 kilometers hour, took his concerns about the future of farm
families to Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
   But Parsons, 52, was shut out of Prime Minister Jean Chretien's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Police later forced him to move his Massey Ferguson combine,
festooned with banners and bumper stickers, to a park area several
kilometers away from the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Vanclief wouldn't promise more farm aid but said the issue will
arise again this week when he meets with provincial agriculture
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has refused repeated invitations to visit Prairie farms
hit hard by what many say is the worst income crisis since the
Depression.

<HEADLINE> Wrestlers Subpoenaed in Child Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The attorney for a 13-year-old boy accused of
killing a 6-year-old playmate by slamming her into a table has
subpoenaed Hulk Hogan and another wrestler to testify at his
client's upcoming murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was mimicking wrestling moves he had seen on TV,
attorney Jim Lewis has said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis served subpoenas Sunday on wrestlers Terry ''Hulk Hogan''
Bollea and Steve ''Sting'' Borden during a World Championship
Wrestling show. Earlier this month, Lewis subpoenaed World
Wrestling Federation champion Dwayne Johnson, who wrestles as ''The
Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wants the wrestlers to testify at the trial of Lionel
Tate, who is charged as an adult with first-degree murder for last
July's death of Tiffany Eunick.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wants the three to show jurors how pro wrestlers make
their televised action appear authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was copying such moves, but didn't realize the injuries
they could cause when he allegedly gave Tiffany a bear hug, dropped
her onto a table and then swung her into a railing, Lewis has said.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF is trying to squash Johnson's subpoena, saying the
wrestler has no connection to Tiffany's death.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Don Baker, a journalist known as a
defender of laws aimed at keeping government meetings and records
open to the public, died Sunday. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had worked at the Deseret News covering Salt Lake and
Davis county suburbs since 1997. He was also the paper's curling
specialist for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining the Deseret News, Baker worked at the
Standard-Examiner in Ogden for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Baker received numerous awards for his reporting, including the
1993 Clifford P. Cheney Service to Journalism Award, the top honor
given out each year by the Utah Society of Professional
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Baker worked to get the Utah Legislature in 1991 to adopt the
Government Records Access and Management Act, which opened many
government records to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also was an accomplished bluegrass musician who once
played for President Jimmy Carter at a White House picnic.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Andrea, two children and six

</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- DeAnn Evans, associate professor of
journalism at the University of Utah and the first female managing
editor of a Utah newspaper, died Sunday of a heart attack. She was
59.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in media criticism and ethics, Evans spent her
career in Salt Lake City, where she built a reputation as a devoted
educator.
</P>
<P>
   Evans joined the Deseret News in 1967 and worked her way up the

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Retired state Sen. John T. Hicks, who
once forced a committee meeting to adjourn for lack of a quorum by
declaring ''I'm not here,'' died Sunday of a heart attack. He was
74.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was a crafty Democrat who at a 1989 meeting of the Senate
Oversight Committee blocked a vote on the method for selecting
state Supreme Court justices by insisting he was absent, thereby
preventing the committee from meeting its quorum.
</P>
<P>

journalist. He worked briefly at The Wichita Eagle and The Miami
Herald before joining the Times as a copy editor in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His journalistic skills, language aptitude and knowledge of
national and world affairs propelled him to the Times news desk, a
small group of editors who polish copy as it leaves the newsroom
departments and oversee preparation of the front page.
</P>
<P>
   King spent the last decade on the news desk, refining the
content and style of major stories and their accompanying
headlines. Often, King laid out Page 1 in consultation with the
paper's top editors.
</P>
<P>
   King was a member of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists
Association and served as a mentor for many new Times staff
members.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers was fined $7,500
by the NBA on Monday for criticizing the officials after Friday's
Magic-Raptors game in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers was upset that his team shot only 13 free throws -- the
same number that Vince Carter of Toronto attempted.
</P>
<P>
   The referees ''may as well as been wearing Raptors jerseys and
cheering for Vince Carter,'' Rivers said. ''The bottom line is we
have a bunch of guys with no names. John Amaechi gets bumped -- no
foul. Vince Carter gets bumped -- foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the NBA's reaction will be, Rivers said: ''They'll
fine me, but they'll agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine was issued by NBA vice president Rod Thorn.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night's game in Chicago, Rivers said: ''I did it,
I regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a problem with the fine. I just thought my
players needed someone to stand up for them.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Wants Renewed Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By GREGG AAMOT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Less than a month after Gov. Jesse
Ventura led the Minnesota Reform Party out of the national
organization amid growing unrest and concerns about policy, other
activists want to re-establish the party in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Scofield, the Midwestern regional representative for the
national Reform Party, said Monday that a founding convention has
been scheduled for April 7 in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Minnesota Reform Party broke from the
national party over concern about unrest in the party and growing
support for presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan's conservative
views. The Minnesota chapter changed its name back to the
Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield said the main purposes of the founding convention will
be writing a party charter and electing delegates to the national
convention. While a presidential candidate will not be endorsed,
Scofield and other activists who gathered in St. Paul said they
support Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield said Independence Party members and Ventura would be
welcome to join. ''They are the ones who went away and
disassociated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick McCluhan, the chairman of the Independence Party, played
down the impact a renewed Reform Party would have on third-party
efforts in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Reform Party is not really going to be much of a factor
other than putting forth Pat Buchanan as a presidential candidate
in this state,'' he said. ''Beyond that, I think they have a
half-dozen activists, and that's about the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's spokesman said the governor would not comment.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Warns of Strike  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Flying on US Airways this weekend? You may
want to make other arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's flight attendants' union, which might strike
Saturday, has said it would target random routes with impromptu
walkouts to cause maximum chaos. In response, the airline said it
would shut down rather than subject passengers to unpredictable
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a great inconvenience to passengers if US Airways
didn't inform them to look for alternatives,'' Joshua Javitz, an
expert on airline labor negotiations, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For airline passengers, predictability is everything, Javitz
said. US Airways would suffer greater losses in the long term if it
tried to operate through a strike and undermined customer loyalty,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, US Airways
flight attendants are back at the bargaining table in a final
attempt to resolve a three-year contract dispute with the nation's
sixth largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations aimed at preventing a walkout began Friday. The
talks are being supervised by Ernest DuBester, chairman of the
National Mediation Board, which oversees labor disputes in the
transportation industry. Negotiations are expected to continue
until an agreement or the strike deadline is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are singularly focused on reaching an agreement that is
fair both to the flight attendants and to the company,'' said US
Airways executive vice president Lawrence Nagin.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Association of Flight Attendants sent a letter
to US Airways investors last week in an attempt to build outside
pressure on the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than sit down and negotiate a fair contract with the
flight attendants, US Airways is planning to hurt its employees,
hurt its passengers and hurt its investors by shutting the airline
down,'' said the letter, signed by Lynn Lenosky, president of the
union's US Airways council.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 US Airways flight attendants are working under a
contract that expired at the end of 1996 and gave them their last
pay raise, of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants have released a list of 49 routes that could be
affected, including Washington-Boston, San Francisco-Philadelphia
and New York and Orlando, Fla. Other major airlines serve all of
the targeted routes, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways serves destinations in 38 states and the District of
Columbia, as well as Canada, Europe, Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''US Airways simply cannot risk losing our customers'
confidence,'' executives said in a Feb. 23 letter to employees. In
case of a shutdown, the letter said, all workers -- except flight
attendants -- would continue to be paid ''for as long as is
financially feasible.'' The Arlington, Va.-based airline has nearly
45,000 workers who could be furloughed.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is advising concerned customers to contact its ticket
agents or their own travel agents. Nagin said the airline has
planned to make alternative arrangements for passengers or
compensate them on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for US Airways attendants is $17,145 a year,
while those at the top of the pay scale, with 14 years seniority,
earn $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants are resisting the airline's proposal to put them
under a pay-and-benefits formula based on what its biggest
competitors offer, plus 1 percent. Other unions representing US
Airways workers have accepted the formula, which the company says
must be applied across the board to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants argue that management has not clearly
spelled out how the formula would affect their pay and fear it
could result in erosion of some benefits.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who can legally block the walkout
temporarily, also will be kept up to date on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's last airline shutdown because of a labor dispute
was in 1998, when Northwest Airlines was grounded for two weeks,
furloughing nearly 30,000 employees when its pilots struck.
</P>
<P>
   In Northwest's case, Clinton stopped short of using his
authority to stall a transportation strike for 60 days. Instead, he
dispatched aides who ultimately coaxed the two sides back to the
bargaining table. But in 1997, he ordered striking American
Airlines pilots back to work almost instantly.

airline co-pilot over California, an irate Bronx woman was arrested
Monday aboard an America West jetliner after allegedly entering the
cockpit in flight and striking another co-pilot, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 2186, an Airbus A-320 jetliner bound for Phoenix from New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport with 128 passengers
and five crew members aboard, was diverted to Albuquerque because
of the disturbance, agent Doug Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Laverne Brown, 39, of the Bronx, was arrested at about 5
p.m., Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was charged with committing a crime aboard an aircraft,
namely interfering with a flight crew, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently she refused to return to her seat, failed to obey
the orders of the flight personnel, became angry, went into the
cockpit and struck the co-pilot,'' Beldon said. ''The passenger was
obviously under the influence of alcohol. She threatened a flight
attendant and assaulted the co-pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   She faces an initial appearance Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate
and was spending the night at the Bernalillo County Detention
Center, Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a 39-year-old Missouri man broke into an Alaska
Airlines cockpit and grappled with a co-pilot. The FBI and Federal
Aviation Administration reported that Peter L. Bradley Jr. of Blue
Springs, Mo., apparently tried to seize control of the throttle and
fuel controls near Monterey, Calif. Bradley was arrested when the
plane landed in San Francisco after the flight from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Police Officer Joe Reilly said the man displayed
bizarre behavior, spoke nonsense, took off his socks and shirt and
yelled to the other 42 passengers: ''I'm going to kill you all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known what Brown was unhappy about
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said she couldn't release
details and declined to say what triggered the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did have an incident with an unruly passenger. The captain
decided to divert to have this passenger removed due to concern for
flight safety,'' Nowack said in Phoenix.

<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Lucienne Berthieu came off the bench and
score 22 points and Hamchetou Maiga pulled down 20 rebounds Monday
night as Old Dominion defeated SMU 96-76 in the second-round of the
NCAA Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Lady Monarchs (29-4) went on a 9-3 run to
close the first half ahead 37-30, but the 12th-seeded Mustangs
(22-9) twice narrowed the gap to five after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion then expanded its lead to 18 with a 16-3 run over
three minutes -- capped by a 3-pointer by Natalie Diaz -- to make the
score 72-54 with about six minutes to go. Diaz had seven of her 19
points in that stretch.

   The Lady Monarchs had a 50-34 rebounding edge and shot 50
percent from the floor to the Mustangs' 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Flooding Wrecks Crops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Flooding from torrential rains in recent
weeks has destroyed crops, killed thousands of cattle and left
hundreds of people homeless, the Civil Defense Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rains ended a severe drought that affected a third of
Bolivia earlier this month. Rain-swollen rivers overflowed their
banks, covering fields of soy bean, cotton, corn and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The rains have also flooded parts of the cities of Santa Cruz,
with a population one million, and Cochabamba, with a population of
450,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Defense Office said the crops of 22,000 families had
been destroyed and at least 10,000 cattle killed, as well as
hundreds of people left homeless. The affected families have not
only lost their crops but are also facing severe food and potable
water shortages, the office said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Agency for International Development and CARE
began providing emergency food supplies Monday that will reach 39
farming communities in the Bolivian lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian Government also began a campaign to install
emergency potable water systems in flood areas. The government is
also seeking donations of medicine and food supplies to assist
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Bermejo, a major producer of sugar cane, and the
region of Villamontes, a natural gas and petroleum producer, were
cut off from the rest of Bolivia due to landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains have also been falling on the Bolivian highlands,
destroying roads and bridges. The main road connecting the cities
of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz have been interrupted several times
this month by landslides caused by rains.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame 76, Xavier 64  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- David Graves scored 24 points and Troy
Murphy added 21 as Notre Dame beat Xavier 76-64 Monday night in the
NIT second round, giving the Irish their first 20-win season in
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Musketeers (21-12) took 36 3-pointers, but hit only four
over the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier cut the Notre Dame (20-14) lead to 64-61 on Maurice
McAfee's 3-pointer with 2:09 left. But Murphy converted a
three-point play on Notre Dame's next possession, and the Irish hit
9-of-10 from the line over the final 1:19 to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Matt Carroll, who finished with 13 points, was 6-of-6
from the line during that stretch. The Irish were 21-of-27 from the
foul line, while Xavier was 6-of-11.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier led 45-44 early in the second half before the Irish
reeled off a 15-4 run that included 3s from Graves, Murphy and
Martin Ingelsby. Notre Dame capped off its spurt after officials
hit the Xavier bench with a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Ingelsby hit both free throws, and the Irish led 59-49 with
10:30 left. Xavier was able to pull close when the Irish scored
just two points in a seven-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored 21 first-half points as the game quickly turned
into a 3-point shooting contest. The Musketeers missed their first
three attempts from beyond the arc and finished 12-of-36 from
3-point range, while the Irish were 9-of-17 and outrebounded Xavier
41-30.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee led Xavier with 18 points, all on 3-pointers, while Kevin
Frey added 11 and Lloyd Price had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame will be the host to the winner of the BYU-Southern
Illinois game on Wednesday for a berth in the NIT Final Four. It
will be Notre Dame's third straight home game in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Warns Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council warned the
warring parties in Afghanistan on Monday not to launch spring
offensives that they are reportedly preparing.
</P>
<P>
   Council president Amwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh admitted the
15-member council has repeatedly called for an end to fighting --
which has killed thousands and driven tens of thousands from their
homes -- but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the council needs to have some teeth in terms of
what it is pronouncing,'' Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the council was supporting peace talks organized by the
Organization of the Islamic Conference ''and will take appropriate
action ... if any breach of the peace takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban religious army rules 90 percent of Afghanistan,
where it has imposed its strict version of Islamic law. It is
battling opposition forces based in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Francesc Vendrell, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal
representative to Afghanistan, said after briefing the council that
governments close to each side to urge them ''not to carry out an
offensive -- and also to stop supplying weapons to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are considered the main supporters of
the Taliban. Iran is believed to support the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Vendrell, who just returned from the region, said all
information coming from Afghanistan ''suggests there is a buildup --
and that there is an intention to carry out a military offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. envoy will work out of Islamabad, Pakistan, starting in
April, trying to persuade the two sides to negotiate a cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers 98, Rockets 85  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bob Sura scored seven points as the Cleveland
Cavaliers pulled away early in the fourth quarter Monday night to
snap a six-game losing streak with a 98-85 victory over the Houston
Rockets, who lost their eighth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp and Lamond Murray added 17 points apiece, Sura had 16
and Andre Miller 12 as the Cavs won for the first time since March
5.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Steve Francis and Walt Williams had 17 points each for
the Rockets, who lost Sunday by two points at Toronto on Vince
Carter's dunk just before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   There was no drama in this loss as the Cavs broke it open with
an 11-2 run in the fourth. Sura hit a 3-pointer and had two layups
in the spurt -- one on a nice feed from Cedric Henderson -- to help
the Cavs open an 82-68 lead with 7:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   None of Cleveland's starters played in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon scored just two points in 16 minutes for the
Rockets, whose losing streak is their longest since they dropped 10
straight in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who had just six points on 1-of-6 shooting in an
overtime loss to Miami on Saturday, scored 10 points in the third
quarter as the Cavs opened a 69-62 entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored Houston's first 13 points of the second half and
assisted on a beautiful alley-oop dunk by Francis, who followed it
with a steal and dunk and hit a jumper to put the Rockets up 58-54.
</P>
<P>
   However, Murray hit a 3-pointer and Miller scored on a drive as
the Cavs closed the quarter with a 13-4 spurt.
</P>
<P>
   In a first half that ended in a 39-39 tie, both teams showed why
they're not in playoff contention with some atrocious play.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon played just five minutes for the Rockets, who shot 44
percent from the field, 25 percent from the line and committed 11
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs were worse, shooting 37 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Despite the win, the Cavs were booed at the final horn for
failing to reach 100 points. Everyone in the crowd wins a free
''Chalupa'' from Taco Bell when the team hits 100. ... The Cavs
activated Cedric Henderson before the game and placed F Ryan Stack
on the injured list. Henderson, who missed 19 games with a torn
thumb ligament, scored six points in 13 minutes. The Cavs said
Stack has been experiencing persistent weight loss and dehydration.
... Francis leads the Rockets in scoring, assists and steals. No
Rocket rookie has ever led the team in two categories for a season.
The last Houston rookie to lead the team in scoring was Ralph
Sampson in 1984.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Seeks Rules on Ritalin  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used the power of the
White House bully pulpit to call attention Monday to a troubling
matter for parents of preschoolers -- the use of Ritalin and other
mind-altering drugs to treat youngsters' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be senator from New York announced several federal
initiatives after a White House meeting with Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Surgeon General David Satcher and
other child and health leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here to bash the use of these medications,'' said
Clinton. ''But we do have to ask some serious questions about the
use prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   She outlined a plan to ask the Food and Drug Administration to
issue guidelines for use of such drugs for children under 6. She
also proposed more clinical trials on the young, a fall conference
on children's mental health, handbooks for parents and training for
doctors who treat their children.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady later dismissed questions about whether the White
House event was primarily intended to bolster her Senate campaign
in New York against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her
presumed Republican rival. He, too, has been accused of campaigning
from city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've worked on these issues for more than 30 years,'' said
Clinton. ''I'm going to keep working on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking the lead on family issues from Washington could give
the first lady an advantage in her new home state, said political
scientist Griffin Hathaway of Towson State University in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House platform is the most visible in the country,''
Hathaway said. ''With an unprecedented congressional campaign by an
incumbent first lady, that magnet is even more amplified.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks, he said: ''If the policy initiatives have
not worked, that can generate backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she was motivated by research showing a steep climb
in toddlers being medicated without adequate research into what
works best for children still undergoing crucial brain development.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, usually is
diagnosed in school-age children based on interviews and observed
behavior. Symptoms include a restless inability to sit still to
read, study or even watch television. Some mild forms of these
symptoms are common in many children, leading experts to worry that
ADHD is diagnosed too often.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these young people have problems that are symptoms of
nothing more than childhood or adolescence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that
from 1991 to 1995, doctors' prescriptions for 2- to 4-year-olds
jumped threefold for Ritalin, a common brand name for the stimulant
methylphenidate. The drug is believed to increase a child's
alertness by stimulating the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children on antidepressants such as Prozac, often
used to control bedwetting, doubled in that time period.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., manufacturer of Prozac, said the drug was never
intended to be given to young children. ''Prozac is approved for
use in patients 18 years of age and older who suffer from
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia,'' the
Indianapolis-based drugmaker said. ''Lilly does not promote the
product's use in any other patient population.''
</P>
<P>
   Behavior therapy can be more helpful than drugs, said Deborah A.
Ziegler, an expert on behavior disorders for the Council for
Exceptional Children, a suburban Virginia-based advocacy group.

35 Kashmir Sikhs Massacred
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen massacred 35 Sikhs in India's northern Kashmir
state late Monday, even as President Clinton was beginning a visit to the Asian
nation, police said. It was the first major attack on the Sikhs since a Muslim
insurgency began 10 years ago in Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan claim the
Himalayan territory and have fought two wars over it. Clinton -- who arrived in
New Delhi, 400 miles to the south, on Monday evening after a visit to Bangladesh
-- had said that reducing tensions between India and Pakistan was one of his
objectives of the trip. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack

''No matter how difficult, no matter how long, the process of seeking peace must
continue,'' the pontiff said on the first day of his weeklong trip. The
79-year-old pope was making a 27-hour stop in Jordan on his tour of Old and New
Testament sites that will take him to Israel and the Palestinian territories --
visits fraught with controversy. John Paul insists it is a spiritual trip with

Rivers was upset that his team shot only 13 free throws -- the same number that
Vince Carter of Toronto attempted. Toronto won 95-91. The referees ''may as well

''The bottom line is we have a bunch of guys with no names. John Amaechi gets

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- An irate woman who allegedly entered
the cockpit of an American West jetliner in flight and struck the
co-pilot was arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 2186, an Airbus A-320 bound for Phoenix from New York
with 128 passengers and five crew members, was diverted to
Albuquerque because of the disturbance, FBI supervisory agent Doug

</P>
<P>
   Denise Laverne Brown, 39, of New York City, was arrested at

</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently she refused to return to her seat, failed to obey
the orders of the flight personnel, became angry, went into the
cockpit and struck the co-pilot,'' Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passenger was obviously under the influence of alcohol,''
Beldon added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, held at the Bernalillo County Detention Center in
Albuquerque, faces a charge of interfering with a flight crew. An

<P>
   He was arrested when the plane landed in San Francisco after the

<HEADLINE> Leaders: Let's End China-Taiwan Feud  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- In their first public verbal volley,
Taiwan's next president and China's top leader agreed Monday that
they should negotiate an end to five decades of feuding -- but
neither budged on major points that have blocked talks.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated statement from Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said Chen Shui-bian, who won Saturday's election despite
China's intense opposition, was welcome to come to the mainland for
talks. Beijing imposed a condition, however, repeating that Taiwan
must first recognize that it is an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Chinese officials tried to brand Chen, a
former Taipei mayor and opposition leader, as a radical who would
declare Taiwan independence and spark a conflict with China's
military just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two sides split amid civil war in 1949, Beijing has
given the island a choice: eventual reunification or war. A war
could quickly involve the United States, which has hinted it might
help defend the island.
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncements from Beijing often send Taiwan's stock market
plunging, but share prices climbed Tuesday, with stocks up 5
percent in early trading. Analysts said buying by government funds
and fading fears of war with China inspired the buying.
</P>
<P>
   While making courtesy calls early Tuesday, Chen did not directly
address Jiang's comments but repeated that he would ''seek lasting
peace across the Taiwan Strait.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting two days of meetings in Beijing on Monday, the United
States' U.N. ambassador, Richard Holbrooke, said Taiwan and Chen's
win would be topics of discussion. He declined to say what he would
say to Chinese officials. Stanley Roth, the top East Asian official
at the State Department, was with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a parallel diplomatic mission, former congressman Lee
Hamilton, an expert on Chinese affairs, heads to Taiwan on
Wednesday to urge restraint from the new government there.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang offered to ease tensions with Taiwan in his statement
issued by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said before and still hold today that whoever comes to
power in Taiwan, he is welcome to the mainland for talks, and we
may also go to Taiwan,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jiang repeated a long-standing condition for talks:
They can only happen if Taiwan agrees that it is an inseparable
part of China. This is known as the ''one-China principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen objects to the principle because he fears that if he
accepts it, he would have to agree that the ruling government of
that one China is in Beijing. This would mean that Taiwan was ruled
by a local government unequal to the undemocratic, communist
regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Chen repeated that he was willing to discuss ''one
China'' and anything else with Beijing, but he would not agree to
allow the principle be a condition for talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as we are treated as equals, there is nothing we
cannot discuss,'' Chen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's insistence on equality at the bargaining table squares
with the current Nationalist government's China policy, and most
Taiwanese have supported that position.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public does not favor immediate independence,
fearing it would spark a war, most Taiwanese also don't want Taiwan
to be bullied into a quick deal with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Chen worked the hardest to prove to voters
that he was willing to work with Beijing. He softened his position
on independence, saying he would only put the issue to a islandwide
vote if China attacked.
</P>
<P>
   He often said that unlikely leaders -- including President Nixon
-- often produce surprising diplomatic breakthroughs. He likes to
point out that Nixon, a fervent anti-communist politician,
re-established U.S.-China ties.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seemed Taiwan-China relations were mired in a
semantic disputes that would continue during Chen's presidency, all
hope should not be lost, said James Seymour, a political scientist
at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible to play around with language,'' Seymour said.
''If there is goodwill on both sides, they will be able to come up
with language both can agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   While paying courtesy calls to campaign supporters Monday, Chen
reaffirmed that he wanted to improve trade ties with China's huge,
developing market.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also said he would quickly seek a meeting with Taiwan's
respected envoy to China, Koo Chen-fu, who has had good rapport
with Beijing's envoy to Taiwan, Wang Daohan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, angry protesters have been surrounding the
Nationalist Party's headquarters in downtown Taipei. The crowd
swelled to 3,000 Sunday, and some broke car windows and scuffled
with police. The demonstrators dwindled to a few hundred by Monday,
but they were joined by reform-minded lawmakers who demanded Lee
resign immediately as party boss.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits Ill. on Eve of Primary  </HEADLINE>
By SARA BAKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, speaking on the
eve of a primary with little relevance for his campaign, urged
voters who backed John McCain's to support him in November. Gore
also criticized Republican rival George W. Bush's policies and
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say a word to the supporters of Senator John McCain
in the Republican primaries,'' Gore said told almost 1,000 people
Monday night at Lincoln Land Community College. ''To any who can
hear the sound of my voice, whatever party you're in ... I'd like
to ask for your support.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who marshaled support among Democrats and independents,
dropped from the Republican presidential race earlier this month
after devastating losses on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also criticized Bush, the likely Republican nominee, for
airing campaign commercials in Illinois last weekend that claim
Gore and President Bill Clinton have ''failed'' on education.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a negative ad, just like he ran against John McCain,''
said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has taken up the issue of campaign finance reform,
reiterated his support for eliminating all 30- and 60-second
television and radio ads in favor of weekly presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wouldn't that be a better way to honor our democracy?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also questioned some of Bush's policies and proposals, from
his stances on education and Social Security to his relationship
with the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore saved his harshest words for Bush's tax proposal, a
five-year, $483 billion plan that the vice president says would
consume the projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do the basic arithmetic, what you'll find out is that
his risky tax scheme that he's proposing ... would spend the entire
budget surplus for the entire next 10 years, plus another trillion
dollars on top of that,'' he said. ''I believe they're hoping that
you won't add up the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew to Springfield from a secret weekend getaway in the
South with his wife, Tipper. The trip was disclosed after it became
clear that the Air Force Two flight was not originating from
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. Aides refused to say
where the couple went.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Gore picked up endorsements from several Illinois
supporters of his former rival, Bill Bradley, including Reps. Bill
Lipinski and Luis Gutierrez and state Rep. Jeff Schoenberg,
D-Evanston, Bradley's state coordinator.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 102, Hornets 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 25 points and the
Philadelphia 76ers withstood two second-half rallies Monday night
in a 102-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Hill had 16 points and Eric Snow and Theo Ratliff 14 each
for the 76ers. Eddie Jones led Charlotte with a game-high 28,
followed by David Wesley with 17 and Eddie Robinson and Anthony
Mason with 14 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers, trying to catch Toronto for fourth place in the
conference and home-court advantage in the first round of the
playoffs, moved three games ahead of sixth-place Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte led 36-35 when Derrick Coleman was ejected for a
flagrant foul against Toni Kukoc with 6:41 left in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc sustained a small cut under his right eye as a result of
the Coleman foul. After the cut was stitched in the locker room,
Kukoc returned late in the second period and later drew a technical
foul himself.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, which lost its third straight, rallied from a
nine-point deficit with a 10-0 run for an 86-85 lead on Jones'
3-pointer with 6:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper by Wesley countered two free throws from Hill to put
Charlotte ahead 88-87 with 5:31 left, but the Sixers mounted an 8-0
run that ended with Iverson's runner over Jones with 3:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets could get no closer than three points the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   After Coleman's departure, the Sixers mounted a 14-4 run that
resulted in a 49-40 lead on Iverson's 3-pointer with 3:50 left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's advantage grew to 61-50 at the half, thanks to
George Lynch's follow shot as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson led all scorers at the half with 20 points on 7-of-13
shooting, including 3-of-3 from 3-point range. Jones provided the
Hornets' only two field goals in the final 6:41 of the second
quarter after Coleman was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers held a 69-61 lead midway through the third quarter
before Robinson hit four baskets during a 9-0 run. The spurt was
punctuated by a technical foul against Kukoc for arguing an
offensive foul called against him.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, however, closed the period with a 10-2 run to lead
79-72 entering the final quarter. A minor skirmish between Aaron
McKie and Mason resulted in technicals against both players with
1:06 left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Hornets are 4-0 in overtime contests and 9-0 in games
decided by five points or less... In 13 appearances against
Charlotte, Iverson has scored 30 or more points six times... The
Hornets' best victory margin ever (52 points) came against
Philadelphia in a 136-84 drubbing Feb. 27, 1992.

<HEADLINE> Sabres 4, Canadiens 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Jay McKee sparked a three-goal second
period outburst as the Buffalo Sabres jumped back into playoff
contention Monday night with a 4-1 win over the injury-riddled
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Afinogenov and Dixon Ward also scored for the Sabres,
Vaclav Varada, who also had an assist, sealed the win by scoring
into an open net with 5.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres moved into a tie with Montreal for the Eastern
Conference's final spot, one point ahead of the idle New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the Sabres -- who have played one more game
and have one fewer victory than Montreal -- have been in eighth
place since Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gilmour assisted on Varada's goal, giving him two goals and
eight points in five games since joining the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Rucinsky spoiled Dominik Hasek's shutout bid 7:49 into
the third as the Canadiens had a four-game winning streak against
the Sabres snapped. The teams meet once more this season, April 1
at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, missing five regulars including Saku Koivu (knee)
and Trevor Linden (ribs), have only one win in five games (1-3-1).
</P>
<P>
   After outshooting Montreal 15-4 in the first, the Sabres scored
on Jeff Hackett 1:44 into the second.
</P>
<P>
   Varada set up the play when he rode Jesse Belanger off the puck
and fed McKee at the left point. McKee then fired a 40-footer just
inside the far post.
</P>
<P>
   Afinogenov scored on a breakaway nine minutes later, and Ward
capped the surge when his knuckleball shot fooled Hackett with 5:03
left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Rucinsky, set up in front by Belanger, waited for Hasek to go
down before flipping a shot in.
</P>
<P>
   The hobbled Canadiens, who have lost an NHL-high 495 man games
to injury this season, did get some promising news earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI exam on Benoit Brunet's back showed that the forward did
not sustain disc damage as originally feared. Also, forward Shayne
Corson has been cleared to practice after he was hit just below the
eye by a puck in last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres are also hoping to get a pair of players back this
week, including captain Mike Peca, whose missed seven games with a
dislocated left shoulder. Peca has been skating with the team for
the past week and says he may be set to return for Thursday's game
against Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, out for the six games, is day-to-day
with a fractured finger.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian mission control on Monday switched on the
main computer aboard the long-dormant space station Mir, ahead of
next month's planned return of cosmonauts to the station, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mir has been orbiting unmanned since August as the cash-strapped
space program searches for funding to keep it aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The government had said it would ditch the station this month
unless private investors came up with funds. But it later agreed to
keep Mir in orbit after Amsterdam-based MirCorp agreed to pay dlrs
10-20 million to lease commercial rights on the station.
</P>

   Cosmonauts Sergei Zaletin and Alexander Kaleri are to blast off
for the Mir on April 4, for a mission expected to last 45 days.

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Watson Expects To Play  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA guard Earl Watson underwent laser
surgery Monday to repair a small hole in the retina of his left
eye. His vision was fine afterward and he is expected to start the
Bruins' NCAA tournament game Thursday against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   The retinal problem apparently existed for some time, said Dr.
Steven Schwartz, and was discovered only because Watson sustained a
blow above his eye in last Saturday's 105-70 victory over Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had four stitches to close that wound, but woke up Monday
morning with the eye very sore and almost swollen shut. He had the
eye examined, and the retinal hole was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise, It probably wouldn't have been found until
physicals before next season,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor then performed the routine, 15-minute laser surgery
to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was stressful,'' Watson said. ''It was scary, somebody
doing something with my eye. But it was cool. Technology is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the elbow from Maryland's Jason Blake, Watson's eye
was still swollen half-shut late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long as he is able to see OK, I don't think it will be any
problem,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said of Watson, who had a school
record 16 assists, plus 17 points, including 5-of-6 from 3-point
range, and no turnovers against Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the retinal hole could have become a problem if it
were not repaired, thus the quick surgery. He added that Watson's
vision is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Watson missed the Bruins' practice Monday afternoon, but came to
Pauley Pavilion with Schwartz afterward to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt, the 6-foot-1 junior said, ''Actually, I'm
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who performed the laser procedure at UCLA's Jules
Stein Eye Institute some five hours earlier, quipped: ''That's how
we want him, hungry -- and focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is expected to work out with the Bruins on Tuesday as
they prepare for the matchup with Iowa State at Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's ''Iron Man,'' Watson has started all 96 games during his
three-year career at the school.

<HEADLINE> No.18 Oklahoma 76, No. 14 Purdue 74  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- LaNeishea Caufield scored 26 points,
including 16 in the second half, as Oklahoma rallied to beat
defending national champion Purdue 76-74 on Monday night in the
second round of the women's NCAA East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (25-7) trailed from the start until Caufield hit two
free throws with 63 seconds to go for a 73-72 lead. Purdue (23-8)
had two chances to regain the lead and one to tie it in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   First, Purdue's Katie Douglas, who struggled offensively for the
second straight game, missed on a drive and was called for a foul
with 41.4 seconds remaining. Stacey Dales hit two free throws and
on the next trip down the court, and a 3-point attempt by Douglas
bounced off the front of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Cooper, who had a career-high 34 points, then grabbed
the rebound but stepped out of bounds. Dales, who added 16 points,
then made one of two free throws with 21 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper missed two free throws with 9.9 seconds left and then
scored a basket with just over a second to play.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, ranked 18th and seeded fifth in the region, trailed by
as many as 17 points in the first half, and was down 59-46 with
11:05 to go.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-2 run brought the Sooners back into the game with Jadrea
Seeley capping the run by hitting a 3-pointer with 7:06 to go. It
made the score 61-59 as Purdue was going more than four minutes
without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue pulled ahead 68-62 on a three-point play by Shinika Parks
with 5:18 to go, but Oklahoma wouldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's previous high was 26 points. Parks scored 17 of a
career-best 22 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, seeded fifth, will play top-seeded Connecticut in a
semifinal game Saturday at Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended a seven-game NCAA tournament winning streak on
its homecourt for Purdue. The Boilermakers built a 42-25 lead in
the first half and held a 44-32 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   But, two days after seeing a 20-point first-half lead disappear
in the opening round before coming from behind to edge Dartmouth
70-66, the second half problems returned and this time Purdue was
not able to deliver in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring leaders of both teams struggled. Douglas, the Big
Ten player of the year, finished with four points as she made
1-of-11 shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Phyleisha Whaley, the Big 12 player of the year who became
Oklahoma's career-scoring leader on Saturday, had 11 points and was
4-of-8 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Punter Bidwell Says He's Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Punter Josh Bidwell says he's ready to
spring a surprise on Packers coaches when he returns to practice
for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer last Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis ended Bidwell's rookie season and started his
treatment for testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, he estimated his health at about 95 percent
recovered, and he currently is the only punter on the roster for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the coaches will be surprised about how far along I
am, given the reports that my physicians have been giving them
throughout the year,'' said Bidwell, who will work out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a lot further along than I imagined,'' he said. ''I'm
hitting the ball well right now, probably better than they think I
can hit them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being nearly 100 percent right now will show them they
probably don't have to put quite as much effort into finding
another guy going into (training) camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Punting a football, though, wasn't foremost on Bidwell's mind
after he was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Green Bay for his home in Eugene, Ore., to begin
the road to recovery, Bidwell said his emotions hit rock bottom.
Just the idea of cancer cells in his body took a toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment sapped his strength and made him a shell of the
well-conditioned athlete he had been.
</P>
<P>
   He came to realize punting a football isn't such an important
thing, but he wanted to get back to the NFL, and the road back
began with physical rehabilitation in December.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwell said he started lifting weights, but was limited to
5-pounders at first. He did water aerobics to regain his range of
motion, flexibility and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure at that time if he could return to the football
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going through this physically, I was in terrible shape,'' said
Bidwell, who averaged 40 yards on 11 punts during three 1999
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really couldn't imagine myself getting back into the shape
I'm in now,'' he said. ''It seemed so far off. Once I got fully
recovered from my surgeries, I was beginning to see that I was
going to get back into good shape, maybe better shape.''
</P>
<P>
   During his recovery, Bidwell never asked the question many do
when diagnosed with a serious illness: Why me?
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew where I was going to be March 20 as compared to where I
was going to be when this started,'' said Bidwell, a fourth-round
draft pick from the University of Oregon in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is tough, but I was excited about the man I was
going to be afterward. I knew that once I defeated it, I was going
to have a perspective on life and I was going to be able to see
things at face value for what they're worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Bidwell's outlook on his life has changed. He wants
to be Green Bay's punter this season and for many more seasons, but
football holds a different place on his list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when the Packers showed interest in San Diego punter
Darren Bennett, Bidwell wasn't disappointed. He said when the

<HEADLINE> Duke 90, Western Kentucky 70  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Georgia Schweitzer and freshman Sheana Mosch
each scored 25 points as second-seeded Duke beat Western Kentucky
90-70 Monday in the second round of the women's NCAA East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (27-5), last year's national runner-up, advanced to its
third straight final 16. Missy West and Krista Gingrich added 11
points apiece and Rochelle Parent pulled down 11 rebounds for the
Blue Devils, who rebounded from a poor offensive showing against
Campbell in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Duke will meet third-seeded LSU, a 57-45 winner over Stephen F.
Austin, in the regional semifinal in Richmond, Va. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Western Kentucky (22-9), seeded 10th, lost in the second round
for the second straight time and has not advanced beyond the second
round since 1986 when the Lady Toppers went to the Final Four.
ShaRae Mansfield scored 21 points and Jaime Walz and Jamie Britt
added 17 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Western Kentucky, with only nine active players, had rallied
from seven points down in the second half to hold on for a 68-65
win over Marquette in the first round, but they could not pull off
a repeat against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Down by six a halftime, Western Kentucky tied the score after an
8-2 run to open the second half. During the span Britt scored two
baskets and her second made it 40-40 with 17:01 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lady Toppers, who had been able to score under the
basket through double-team defense earlier, started to fade despite
rallying throughout the season for wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils responded with a 10-1 run the next four minutes
after it was tied, and after West and Schweitzer each hit a 3, Duke
led 50-41 with 13:30 to go.
</P>
<P>
   West made another layup and Schweitzer converted a fast-break
layup to increase Duke's lead to 61-46 with 10:09 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Western Kentucky cut it to seven twice over the next five
minutes, the last at 7:12 left after Natalie Powers made two free
throws to trim the lead to 67-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Toppers got no closer than 67-57 at 6:43 the rest of
the way.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lawmaker Heading To Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lee Hamilton, who became an expert on Chinese
affairs during service as an Indiana congressman, will travel to
Taiwan this week to encourage restraint after the election of a new
president whose party supports independence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke,
and Stanley Roth, the top East Asian official at the State
Department, are delivering the same message in Beijing. They
arrived Sunday on a visit announced two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are believed to be under pressure from the
military hierarchy to follow through on threats to take military
action against Taiwan now that the island's voters have defied
Beijing by moving closer to the path of independence.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials have been reassured by the absence
of provocative rhetoric by the two sides since the election.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic missions to both Beijing and Taipei are believed
aimed at encouraging the two rivals to renew a dialogue, consistent
with long-standing administration policy. China considers the
island a province in rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Hamilton is leaving Wednesday for Taiwan. The official declined to
say that the former Democratic lawmaker was acting as an emissary
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation was that Hamilton, who now heads the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is making a
private trip to Taiwan but is ''familiar with the president's
thinking and is well acquainted with the views of senior members of
Congress'' on China-Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilson Center declined all comment on Hamilton's travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a political moderate who ended his 34-year
congressional career last year, once served as chairman of the
House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot send an administration official to Taiwan. That
would violate the one-China policy that successive presidents have
pursued for years.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Sandy Berger, accompanying Clinton to
South Asia this week, plans to visit China at the end of that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters Monday in Bangladesh, Berger said, ''I think
the statements that Mr. Chen has made in the last 24 or 48 hours
have been conciliatory. The statements from the Chinese side have
been, I think, measured. And I think this is a time to now seize
upon an opportunity that exists to resume a dialogue between Taipei
and Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., sent a letter to Chen promising to support his
efforts to renew a dialogue with China on the basis of ''peace
through strength.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Taiwan made clear this weekend that if there is
still 'one China,' there are without question two Chinese states --
one communist, one free; one whose leaders rule with an iron fist,
the other whose leaders serve at the pleasure of the people,''
Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the time has come when the United States must adopt a
China policy that recognizes that Beijing must not be allowed to
follow through on its threats last week against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A March 6 announcement by the U.S. mission to the United Nations
said Holbrooke will remain in China from Sunday through Wednesday.
Like Hamilton, Holbrooke has strong China credentials. As a State
Department official, he was an architect of the Carter
administration's 1979 decision to open diplomatic relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration watched with unease last week as China warned
Taiwan of possible military action if voters elected as president
Chen Shui-bian, the candidate most sympathetic to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the election results were announced, Clinton urged
the two sides to open a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States strongly supports such dialogue and is
committed to promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the
region,'' the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton congratulated Chen on his victory and said the election
''clearly demonstrates the strength and vitality of Taiwan's
democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested Over Plane Incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- An irate woman who allegedly entered
the cockpit of an America West jetliner in flight and struck the
co-pilot was arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 2186, an Airbus A-320 bound for Phoenix from New York
with 128 passengers and five crew members, was diverted to
Albuquerque because of the disturbance, FBI supervisory agent Doug
Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Laverne Brown, 39, of New York City, was arrested at
about 5 p.m., Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently she refused to return to her seat, failed to obey
the orders of the flight personnel, became angry, went into the
cockpit and struck the co-pilot,'' Beldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passenger was obviously under the influence of alcohol,''
Beldon added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, held at the Bernalillo County Detention Center in
Albuquerque, faces a charge of interfering with a flight crew. An
initial court appearance was scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said she couldn't release
details and declined to say what triggered the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a 39-year-old man broke into an Alaska Airlines
cockpit and grappled with a co-pilot. The FBI and Federal Aviation
Administration reported the man apparently tried to seize control
of the throttle and fuel controls near Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested when the plane landed in San Francisco after the
flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Woman Said To Drag Another to Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUMA, La. (AP) -- A woman was charged with dragging another
woman to death under her car, refusing to stop even when her
passengers told her she had hit someone.
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie Ann Fields, 20, was booked with drunken driving and
vehicular homicide and freed on $25,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne Glassford, 25, of Houma, bled to death, her body
scraped raw from chest to thighs, according to Bruce Peters, chief
investigator for the parish coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other people in the car told her she had hit someone. She just
didn't stop,'' said Col. Godfrey Buquet, spokesman for the
Terrebonne Parish sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Glassford was dragged about a fifth of a mile from a nightclub
parking where she had tried to stop Fields early Sunday morning --
supposedly because Fields had run over another woman's foot. ''We
don't know who yet. Nobody's come forward,'' Buquet said.
</P>
<P>
   Glassford was standing next to the car when Fields turned and
drove away, knocking her down, according to a news release; in
spite of her passengers pleas to stop, Fields kept driving both
then and after the body came loose from the car, according to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy looking for her car arrested Fields about 20 minutes
later.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A former Black Panther leader wanted in the fatal shooting of
a sheriff's deputy in Atlanta was arrested in Alabama tonight, police said.
Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was arrested by federal agents in Lowndes County, Ala.,
west of Montgomery, and several other people were arrested with him, Atlanta
police told television station WAGA. No other details were immediately
available. Authorities did not immediately return phone calls from The
Associated Press. Al-Amin, 56, is accused of fatally shooting deputy Ricky
Kinchen and wounding deputy Aldranon English in a shootout Thursday night. The
deputies were trying to serve Al-Amin arrest warrant at his store in southwest
Atlanta.

35 Sikhs Slain in Kashmir

   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen massacred 35 Sikhs in India's northern Kashmir
state late Monday, even as President Clinton was beginning a visit to the Asian
nation, police said. It was the first major attack on the Sikhs since a Muslim
insurgency began 10 years ago in Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan claim the
Himalayan territory and have fought two wars over it. Clinton -- who arrived in
New Delhi, 400 miles to the south, on Monday evening after a visit to Bangladesh
-- had said that reducing tensions between India and Pakistan was one of his
objectives of the trip. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
in the village.

the 52 statues recovered look fine and some probably will be awarded Sunday. If
any are ''nicked or dinged, they will not be used,'' Davis said.

franchise-record 13-game home winning streak. O'Neal had eight points, three

stay in the matchup of division leaders. He finished with 28 points and 12
rebounds for the Lakers, who have won 22 of their past 23 games. Miami played
shorthanded up front because of injuries to forward P.J Brown (sprained ankle)
and Otis Thorpe (foot).

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Fallout Study Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five permanent U.N. Security Council
members should lose their veto power ''in exceptional
circumstances'' to prevent another Holocaust or Rwanda genocide, a
study of political fallout from the Kosovo crisis recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations University study, released Monday, said that
requiring the consent of all five permanent council members for a
humanitarian intervention could lead to paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could lead to unilateral action -- such as NATO's air
campaign against Yugoslavia -- which violates international law and
undermines world order.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line question for us is this: Faced with another
Holocaust or Rwanda-type genocide on the one hand, and a Security
Council veto on the other, what would we do?'' said Ramesh Thakur,
the university's vice rector and co-editor of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study calls on governments to reach ''an international
consensus about the point at which a state forfeits its
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends removing the veto power of the five
permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain,
France, Russia and China -- in exceptional circumstances ''so that
the support of a majority of the great powers is all that is
required to permit states to engage in humanitarian war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo-based United Nations University is autonomous within
the U.N. framework and serves as a think-tank for the U.N. system.
It has no students of its own, no faculty or campus. Instead, it
operates through a worldwide network of academic and research
institutions -- including its own research and training centers -- to
address global problems.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela: US OPEC Pressure OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A senior Venezuelan official said
Monday that U.S. pressure on the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to increase oil production is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a legitimate position they have,'' Deputy Oil Minister
Bernardo Alvarez said in a radio interview, referring to U.S.
efforts to convince OPEC nations to increase production in order to
reduce prices, which have reached nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said during his weekly radio
program Sunday that President Clinton had asked Venezuela, an OPEC
member, to ensure that OPEC increased production soon.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he told Clinton that he was willing to listen to
concerns over oil prices. In return, he asked Clinton to lend an
ear to Venezuela's concern about poverty and foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna and are widely
expected to agree on some kind of an output hike, although it's not
clear when or by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez is currently touring OPEC
countries in a bid to ensure consensus before the meeting.
Rodriguez already visited Iran, Iraq and Kuwait. He is scheduled to
travel to Algeria and Libya before arriving in Vienna March 23.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Isaias Rodriguez said his
country shares U.S. concern about oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Excessive high oil prices could also hurt producing nations,''
Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Speaks About Sticks, Visors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Even with two high-profile attacks, Wayne Gretzky
doesn't see stick fouls getting out of control in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Niedermayer's hit to the helmet of Florida's Peter
Worrell and the two-handed swing Gretzky's former teammate Marty
McSorley landed on the temple of Donald Brashear, hockey has again
showed its dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer faces disciplinary action on Tuesday for hitting the
forward on the helmet on Sunday night, while McSorley has been
charged with assault with a weapon after clubbing an unsuspecting
Brashear on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gretzky acknowledged these things occur every year,
they are not commonplace in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's something that happens all the time,'' said
Gretzky, who retired following last season. ''It's an occurrence
that periodically happens because of the pressure. The NHL does a
good job of curtailing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky appeared at a Toronto hospital Monday to donate a
robotic device that helps children link up to school classes while
undergoing dialysis treatment. He is donating $1 from every
purchase of his new clothing line to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's career scoring leader said he is nervous about the
future of McSorley, who gained fame as Gretzky's bodyguard with
Edmonton and Los Angeles. McSorley was suspended for the rest of
this season and will appear in court on criminal charges on April
4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to expect,'' Gretzky said. ''Nobody likes a
scene like that. He got punished. Unfortunately for Marty, he has
to go through a tougher situation, which is a trial. He's not the
first person to do something like that and he's not the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky does advocate making visors mandatory in the NHL in
light of the serious eye injury to Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman
Bryan Berard on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''My stance is similar to every other parent whose kids play
hockey,'' Gretzky said. ''There's absolutely no reason to take it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they should leave their visors on. These kids play
years and years with visors and there's no reason they should take
them off. Eventually, you'll see every player wearing a visor.''

<HEADLINE> Monday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news out of the Chicago Cubs' training camp wasn't exactly
shocking: Another pitcher went on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to happen one or two times a week last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes, scheduled to start the season opener against the
New York Mets in Tokyo on March 29, was put on the DL Monday
because of tendinitis in his right shoulder. He'll be eligible to
come off April 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm angry,'' Valdes said. ''I'm not happy with the decision,
but there's nothing I can do. I have to go with it. I don't want to
make an issue out of it. It's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has had a sore shoulder the past few days, and manager
Don Baylor said Saturday that Valdes might be done for the spring.
Valdes started taking anti-inflammatories Sunday and the shoulder
felt better by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to make sure we take care of it now and it's not
an issue that moves into April and May and June,'' general manager
Ed Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   With Valdes out, Jon Lieber will likely pitch the opener and
Kyle Farnsworth the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year, also
figures to start the season on the DL as he recovers from
reconstructive elbow surgery. Wood, who pitched for the first time
last weekend, is expected back later in April.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Glenallen Hill also appears headed for the disabled
list after pulling his left hamstring Sunday. Doctors have said it
could be two to three weeks before Hill is ready to play, manager
Don Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, meanwhile, sat out Monday's game and will skip
Tuesday's because of a banged-up knee he got in a home-plate
collision with Colorado Rockies catcher Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's swollen a little bit, but it's nothing we need to worry
about,'' Sosa said. ''Nothing big.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., the Atlanta Braves said reliever Kerry
Ligtenberg is expected to pitch as scheduled Tuesday despite
getting hit in the face by a batted ball in Venezuela last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg, struck by a Quinton McCracken shot in Saturday
night's game at Caracas, sustained a cut on his cheekbone and a
bruise under his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly thought I had it,'' said the right-hander, coming
off ligament replacement surgery in his right elbow. ''I don't know
if it hit the ground and hopped, but I put my glove up. I thought I
had it judged. It got on me a lot faster than I thought. ... I'm
lucky it didn't hit me in the eye or nose.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire hit a three-run homer but the
Philadelphia Phillies overcame a seven-run deficit, beating the St.
Louis Cardinals 8-7 on Tomas Perez's RBI single in the 10th inning.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell moderately Tuesday morning
after a three-day weekend on selling of high technology issues. The
dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 109.54 points, or 0.56
percent, to 19,456.78 at the end of the morning session. On Friday,
the average closed up 313.04 points, or 1.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.67 yen in late morning trading, up 0.73
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New
York level of 106.36 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday for a national
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started lower Tuesday as players
avoided making significant moves ahead of a key U.S. monetary
policy meeting scheduled later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants said they will closely monitor the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the impact of any
interest rate decision on volatile U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street observers expect the Fed to raise interest
rates by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth increase since last
June. Higher interest rates generally send stocks lower because
they cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Traders in Tokyo said the FOMC's expected decision has already
been factored in.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq composite index fell 188.13 to 4,610.00
at Monday's close. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.01
points to close at 10,680.24.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 13.17 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,661.05.
The TOPIX closed up 28.65 points, or 1.74 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained some ground against the
yen as foreign and domestic players sold the Japanese currency in
the absence of major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   But many investors were retreating to the sidelines ahead of the
Fed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.62 yen, up from
102.60 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8600 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8300. Its price fell
0.25 point to 99.49.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Seeks Boost From Boston Market  </HEADLINE>
By GEOF BECKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Seeking to warm up earnings in its frozen
foods division, H.J. Heinz Co. has pinned hopes on new meals sold
under the Boston Market Home Style label.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz is introducing the frozen foods this week in Pittsburgh,
its corporate home, where it planned to give away 1,000 meals
Tuesday in Market Square, a popular lunchtime gathering spot that
will be transformed into a ''Boston Market Square'' by proclamation
of City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heinz frozen foods, over the next couple of years, we firmly
believe, will show revenue and profit growth well in excess of
Heinz corporate goals,'' said Neil Harrison, president and chief
executive of Heinz Frozen Food Co.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson predicts Boston
Market meals will add $200 million to sales within two years.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Johnson expects frozen foods revenue to grow 4 to
5 percent and profits to grow 8 to 10 percent, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz began selling Boston Market meals in September on the West
Coast and now makes them available in 30 percent of the country.
Sales so far indicate first-year revenue will meet the target $100
million, Harrison said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are watching the Boston Market project with great
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years, investors have been disappointed by the
lagging stock prices of prepared foods companies such as Heinz,
whose stock Monday was about 38 percent below its 12-month high.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things work out to the extent that Bill Johnson envisions,
(Boston Market) could be a terrific boost to their earnings,'' Bear
Stearns food analyst Terry Bivens said. ''As new product launches
go, this is pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivens said he tasted and liked the meals, which include four
meat and poultry varieties, costing about $4 each, and five
side-dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz expects the brand will bolster its struggling frozen foods
division, helped by growth in the Smart Ones diet frozen foods and
a new resealable bag for Ore-Ida frozen potatoes being tested in
Phoenix and Denver. National introduction of the bag is scheduled
for June, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's third-quarter overall earnings rose 5 percent from
a year ago, but frozen food sales dropped 6.7 percent to $227.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the decline in part to the sale of
product lines such as pocket sandwiches and a small bakery business
but also said it has sold fewer meals overall and had to cut prices
to compete with private labels.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz licensed the Boston Market label last spring, agreeing to
pay Golden, Colo.-based Boston Chicken Inc., which filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1998, a royalty based on sales. Heinz also
may create Boston Market soups and condiments and eventually market
the brand overseas, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The royalty agreement is part of the tentative sale of Boston
Chicken and its 858 Boston Market stores to McDonald's Corp. Boston
Chicken creditors will vote on the sale in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, McDonald's fully understands ... brand management. We
expect they will continue to develop the Boston Market brand, which
will only be good for us,'' Harrison said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 100, Heat 89  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal dominated during a pivotal stretch
early in the second half Monday night and the Los Angeles Lakers
rallied from a 13-point halftime deficit to beat the Miami Heat
100-89.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Miami's franchise-record 13-game home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had eight points, three blocks and a dazzling assist
during a 22-2 run that put Los Angeles ahead to stay in the matchup
of division leaders. He finished with 28 points and 12 rebounds for
the Lakers, who have won 22 of their past 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   Miami played shorthanded up front because of injuries to forward
P.J Brown (sprained ankle) and Otis Thorpe (foot).
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning more than held his own in the matchup of
All-Star centers, scoring 33 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. But
Mourning missed his first seven shots in the second half and had
three straight attempts blocked by O'Neal during the Lakers' big
spurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, playing their fourth game in five nights, took
charge after falling behind 57-42 early in the third period. O'Neal
threw a one-handed alley-oop pass to Kobe Bryant for a dunk made
the score 59-all, then sank consecutive baskets to put Los Angeles
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was never closer than three points in the final minutes,
and 3-pointers by Robert Horry and Glen Rice helped seal the
victory. Rice finished with 28 points, and Bryant added 23.
</P>
<P>
   Foul trouble limited O'Neal to 17 minutes and 12 points in the
first half, and Miami shot 56 percent to lead 55-42 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: VIPs in the crowd included Venus and Serena Williams and
Gary Sheffield. ... Los Angeles' Rick Fox received a double
technical with 10:48 left and was ejected. ... The Lakers improved
to 19-1 when playing the second game of back-to-back nights. ...
The game was the Lakers' first in Miami since Nov. 25, 1997. ...
Heat coach Pat Riley on his rivalry with Lakers coach Phil Jackson:
''Phil and I have one thing in common -- we've both been blessed
with the opportunity to coach great players. Period.''

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Plans Lemon Beverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch plans to introduce a
lemon-flavored malt beverage May 1, the brewer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Doc Otis, the beverage is made with real lemon juice.
The St. Louis-based maker of Budweiser, Bud Light and other beers
said the goal is a product that is pleasantly sweet but with enough
tartness to appeal to adults. It follows other recent rollouts of
non-traditional beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our popular high-end beverages such as Tequiza are
demonstrating there are additional opportunities in the flavored
malt-beverage segment,'' said Steve Bagwell, vice president of
premium plus brands. ''We believe Doc Otis will capitalize on this
trend by appealing to high-end beverage consumers who prefer more
exotic flavors traditionally linked to imports and micro/specialty
beers, mixed drinks, wine and wine coolers.''
</P>
<P>
   Doc Otis will be available in six- and 12-packs of clear
bottles. Each back label features one of six narratives about the
fictional character Doc Otis, portrayed as a personality out of the
wild west of the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch on Monday also launched Tequiza Extra,
a beer with a stronger tequila flavor than Tequiza, which was
introduced last year.

<HEADLINE> Peapod Inc. Stock Plunge Continues  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Still scrambling to find enough financing to stay
in business, troubled Internet grocer Peapod Inc. is being sued by
shareholders over a stock swoon that began only last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two New York law firms -- Abbey, Gardy &AMP; Squitieri and Faruqi &AMP;
Faruqi -- filed a class-action complaint in federal district court
in Chicago on behalf of shareholder Lila Gold, charging Peapod and
its top executives with misrepresenting its cash funding needs.
</P>
<P>
   The action says the company ''artificially inflated'' the stock
price in violation of federal regulations, most notably with a Nov.
8 statement that it had sufficient funds to operate into the third
quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More investors are expected to sign onto the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Skokie, Ill.-based Peapod, Paula Wheeler, said
the company had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's stock plunge continued for a third day Monday. After
plummeting 52 percent last Thursday when the chief executive's
abrupt departure caused key financiers to pull an offer of $120
million, it fell another 12 percent to $3.12{ a share on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's big troubles are traced to the health problems of CEO
Bill Malloy, who informed the company last week he had to leave the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod is the No. 1 Internet grocer in a fledgling field, with
100,000 customers in eight U.S. markets, but like many high-promise
e-commerce businesses it is still striving to turn growth into
profit.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Malloy's illness and the funding withdrawal by
four institutional investors last week, the company said it only
has $3 million cash left and is exploring all options, including a
sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Zona Research Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., said Peapod erred by
failing to take advantage of existing services and warehouse
products, as competitor WebVan does. Also, it said, Peapod fell
victim to the huge infrastructure costs of home delivery services,
which even a 20 percent quarterly growth in its customer base
couldn't overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the shakeout in the online grocery business
doesn't mean the industry as a whole is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absolutely a company-specific event,'' said Barry
Stouffer, an analyst for J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street took a bite out of most Internet grocers'
stocks Monday, Peapod competitor NetGrocer.com, based in North
Brunswick, N.J., received a $30 million infusion in cash from
Italian foodmaker Parmalat SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Chambers, chairman and chief executive of the Parma,
Italy-based company, said it sees potential for the business both
in the United States and abroad.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Electoral Panel Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on
Monday swore in an electoral commission to oversee a vote called
for in a peace agreement that ended eight years of civil war,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, which brought the Revolutionary United Front rebels
into a power-sharing government, calls for elections after all the
warring factions are disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   But many RUF fighters have refused to turn in their weapons.
Cease-fire violations remain common, and the rebels have repeatedly
blocked U.N. troops deployed to monitor the peace from moving
freely through the country.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF remains in control of much of eastern Sierra Leone, and
human rights organizations have reported rebels looting villages,
burning houses, raping women and mutilating civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Security Council increased the U.N. force size
from an initial 6,000 to 11,100. But as of early March, only 5,880
troops had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels killed tens of thousands of people and horribly
disfigured thousands more in their campaign to gain power in Sierra
Leone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A prominent underworld figure and
former paramilitary leader was shot and killed in Belgrade on
Monday -- yet another in a series of recent gangland-style
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Lainovic was killed in front of the Hotel Serbia in a
Belgrade residential area, Beta news agency reported. The agency
quoted witnesses as saying they heard three shots around 4 p.m. and
then saw a young man running away.
</P>
<P>
   Lainovic was believed to control the crime network in the
northern city of Novi Sad, about 45 miles north of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Lainovic was also a former commander of the Serb Guard, a
paramilitary group organized by opposition Serbian Renewal Movement
which fought on the side of the Serb rebels in Croatia at the start
of the war there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Serbia's notorious warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, also
known as Arkan, was killed in a Belgrade hotel. Weeks later,
Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic was gunned down in a
restaurant.

<HEADLINE> 35 Sikhs Killed in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen rounded up and killed 35 Sikh
villagers in India's disputed Kashmir state, police said Tuesday,
even as President Clinton was beginning a visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's massacre was the first major attack on Kashmir's
small Sikh community since separatist Muslims launched their
insurgency 10 years ago. Sikhs are considered a neutral minority,
but Indian officials earlier had warned of violence by Muslim
militants hoping to draw attention to Kashmir during Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan claim the Himalayan territory and have
fought two wars over it.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were not immediately identified and no group claimed
responsibility for the attack, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton -- who arrived in New Delhi, 400 miles to the south
Monday evening after a visit to Bangladesh -- had said that reducing
tensions between India and Pakistan was one of his objectives of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kashmiris were hoping the president's visit would lead to a
breakthrough in the long deadlock on the region's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart expressed outrage over the
killings, saying in a statement that ''our most profound sympathies
go out to the victims of this brutal massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The attackers entered the village of Chati Singhpura Mattan
after dark and forced the residents from their homes, police
officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They separated the men from the women, announcing that they were
conducting a ''crackdown.'' Indian security forces operate
similarly when searching a neighborhood for militants they suspect
may be hiding there.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then opened fire on the men, killing 35 of them. One
man was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''They brought out the males from their homes and shot them at
point-blank range,'' said A.K. Bhan, the director general of
police. He said the attackers spoke Urdu, the language common in
both Kashmir and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Army troops began searching the hills and forests near the
village, about 42 miles from Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital.
</P>
<P>
   Sikhs have lived mostly undisturbed in the Kashmir Valley, the
only area in predominantly Hindu India with a Muslim majority. Many
run the trucking companies that supply the valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, attacks by the militants have focused on
army bases and patrols rather than random terrorism, and have shown
a higher degree of training and expertise, senior army officers
told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   They said about 3,500 militants were in Kashmir, and many of
them had infiltrated the cease-fire line from Pakistan, with the
help of the Pakistan army. Pakistan denies giving active aid to the
militants.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the Sikh village is controlled by armed Kashmiri
groups which abandoned separatism and were recruited by the Indian
army as a counterinsurgency auxiliary force.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed In Car Wash Robbery  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Five people were shot to death and another
critically wounded early Monday in an apparent robbery at a car
wash, and police were searching for a suspect who was reportedly
fired from the business last week.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were discovered by an employee arriving for work at
the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash, police spokesman David Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen anything this gruesome, this vicious in quite
some time,'' Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were looking for a suspect in the slayings -- an
ex-employee named Robert Wayne Harris, 28. Television reports said
Harris was fired Friday after police arrested him for exposing
himself to two women at the business.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were looking into whether Harris may
have returned seeking revenge for his termination.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified three of the dead as car wash employees Dennis
Lee, 48; Rhoda Wheeler, 45; Augustine Villasenor, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Villasenor's brother, Benjamin, 32, and Roberto Jimenez, 15,
died at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. An unidentified man
was in critical condition at Parkland. Authorities declined to say
if the other victims were employees of the full-service car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Police declined to say if the other victims were employees of
the full-service car wash.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication when the shootings happened,
but a former employee said workers generally arrive about 7 a.m.
The business closes at 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're my friends,'' said Lance Turner, a former employee.
''I worked side by side with them. When hardworking people get hurt
like that, it's a sad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a jewelry store nearby, Pete Reyes, said he
complained to police two weeks ago because people he believed were
car wash employees were there after hours and threw a beer bottle
at him.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> D.C. Voting Right Suit Rejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A three-judge panel on Monday ruled against
District of Columbia citizens who filed two lawsuits seeking voting
rights in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The majority said in its 2-1 decision that while the denial of
voting representation was an inequity, the Constitution and
numerous courts have allowed the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony A. Williams said he was deeply disappointed by the
U.S. District Court panel's ruling. The city intends to petition
the Supreme Court, he said, and would urge the Clinton
administration not to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The city has one delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton,
but she is not allowed to vote on the House floor, nor are
representatives from other U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to dismiss the lawsuits were Judge Merrick Garland of the
federal Court of Appeals and District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.
Senior District Judge Lewis Oberdorfer dissented.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Diplomat Beeby Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Christopher Beeby, a former New Zealand foreign
minister who served on the World Trade Organization's appeals body,
has died. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Beeby died in his sleep in Geneva Sunday, according to a WTO
statement. Officials did not have details of the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Beeby served as deputy secretary of foreign affairs from 1985 to
1991, and became New Zealand's ambassador to France and Algeria in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada invited Beeby to mediate a 1995
dispute over the Pacific Salmon Treaty but Washington rejected his
report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he was appointed to the appellate body of the newly
formed WTO. He served on the panel that judged the first trade
appeal brought to the WTO, and went on to be reappointed for
another four years last December.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Ruling Party Trounced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- The ruling Conservatives suffered a
major defeat in municipal elections over the weekend -- indicating
the right-wing party faces an uphill struggle to win general
elections scheduled for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives won just 199 out of 1,667 seats on different city
and country councils contested across Lithuania, down from the 493
seats they won in the last local election in 1997, according to
preliminary results released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the result of the Sunday poll seemed to confirm
widespread expectations that the Conservatives, in power since
1996, are headed for a crushing defeat in upcoming parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment rising to a post-Soviet high of 11 percent and
the government implementing harsh austerity measures to rein in a
yawning budget deficit, the ruling party has seen its popularity
plummet over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner Sunday was the New Union, which took 270
seats. The newly formed center-left party, headed by a former
Soviet prosecutor, Arturas Paulauskas, argued during the campaign
that Lithuania was selling out to foreigners by privatizing key
state industries.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee 75, Arizona 60  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- All-American Tamika Catchings scored 21
points, including 16 in the first half, to lead Tennessee to a
75-60 victory Monday over Arizona in the NCAA Mideast second round.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the six-time national champion Lady Volunteers
(30-3) into the round of 16 for the 19th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (25-7) exited in the second round for the second year in
a row, but with the best record in Wildcats history.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings gave the Southeastern Conference champions and
regional top seed a 4-3 lead on a driving layup through traffic
with less than two minutes gone. Arizona played catchup from then
on.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats didn't score a single fast-break point and were
outscored 18-12 by the Lady Vols on second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, averaging 72 percent from the free throw line, was
12-of-21 (57 percent) for the game. Tennessee was 17-of-24 (71
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee broke to a 33-21 halftime lead as Arizona struggled on
the boards, going the first 11 minutes without a rebound, and
missing eight of 10 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Three 3-pointers by Lisa Griffith kept Arizona close in the
first half, but the Lady Vols came out running in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-4 Tennessee run, keyed by a 3-pointer by Kara Lawson and
another by Semeka Randall, pushed the Tennessee lead to 50-31 with
11:31 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings added eight rebounds to her 9-for-16 shooting. Randall
added 15 points and Lawson had 14.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Lackey led Arizona with 13 points. Griffith and Tatum
Brown had 11 each.

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Plenette Pierson scored 19 points Monday
night to lead Texas Tech to a 76-59 triumph against Tulane in an
NCAA women's Mideast Regional second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson paced a balanced scoring attack for third-seeded Texas
Tech (27-4). Aleah Johnson, Katrisa O'Neal and Tanisha Ellison each
added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tech broke open a close game late in the first half, putting
together a 10-2 run that turned a 24-22 lead into a 36-24 halftime
advantage. The flurry was punctuated by back-to-back 3-pointers
from Amber Tarr and Keitha Dickerson, who hit a running shot from
beyond the top of the key as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders pushed the lead to as many as 16 points during
the opening stages of the second half, but sixth-seeded Tulane
(27-5) sliced the gap to 49-39 at the 10:24 mark on a pair of free
throws by Grace Daley, who led all scorers with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tech answered with a 15-foot jumper from Tarr, a follow shot by
Ellison and a layup by O'Neal to make it 55-39 with 8:17 left.
Tulane got no closer than 13 points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrecia Roberson was the only other Tulane player in double
figures with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which won its 30th consecutive home game, advances to the
Mideast Region semifinals, where it will meet Notre Dame.

<HEADLINE> New York Power Authority delays sale of nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After more than 10 hours of closed-door
deliberations and meetings with would-be buyers, the New York Power
Authority put off a decision late Monday to sell its two nuclear
plants, citing unresolved tax liability issues with a bid.
</P>
<P>
   The move by NYPA's board of trustees to delay continuation of
the talks until its next regular meeting, March 28 in Albany,
prolonged a bidding war for the assets between Dominion Resources
Inc., of Richmond, Va., and Entergy Nuclear LLC, of Jackson, Miss.,
the only prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Nuclear is a unit of New Orleans-based Entergy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a tax liability issue revolving around the
decommissioning fund and its transfer that leaves the Power
Authority with a potential exposure of anywhere between around $100
million to $400 million,'' NYPA spokesman Mike Petralia said.
''Entergy has resolved it. Dominion has not.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominion's Mark Lazenby gave no comment late Monday on the
status of Dominion's offer, which was slated to expire at 11:59
p.m. EST Monday, according to the terms of its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would very much like Dominion to stay in the bidding
process,'' NYPA spokesman Steve Shoenholz said, adding that he
wasn't aware of any contractual restrictions that would prevent
Dominion from continuing to participate in the auction.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of the stations would represent the largest nuclear plant
sale in the country. Assets include the 980-megawatt Indian Point 3
nuclear unit in Buchanan, N.Y., the 825-megawatt James A.
Fitzpatrick nuclear plant in Oswego, N.Y., nuclear fuel for the
stations and 1,700 staff members at the plants and at a
headquarters in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be paid over seven years in equal annual
installments following an initial payment of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion, a latecomer to the bargaining table with an
unsolicited bid in February, had upped the stakes in a recent
bidding war for the assets with an offer made public late Friday
that it said was worth $1.52 billion, topping rival Entergy's
claimed value of $1.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which advised NYPA on the sale, set the
nominal price of Dominion's offer for the plants at $945.7 million
including fuel, or $774.8 million without fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy's offer was nominally priced at $898 million, which
includes its offer for the plants and their fuel as well as
proposed decommissioning payments. The Entergy offer was nominally
priced at $636 million not including fuel.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's evaluations were substantially lower than the
figures put forth by the two bidders because J.P. Morgan set the
value of contingent aspects of the deals at much lower levels, the
NYPA's Shoenholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Contingencies included offers to share in savings gained through
economies of scale in plant operation and decommissioning expenses,
seen through future projects and purchases, and in proposed
profit-sharing plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan fixed the net present value of Dominion's offer for
the assets at $727 million and calculated additional speculative
economic benefits would bring the total to $786 million.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy's offer was given a net present value of $647 million,
and the company priced additional economic benefits associated with
decommissioning funds and power sales agreements at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan vice president Harris Kretzge added that there was
only a $40 million to $50 million maximum potential difference in
the offers by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion said last week its offer included a direct payment of
$946 million, 10 percent above Dominion's original unsolicited
offer and 17 percent above Entergy's proposed direct payment of
$806 million.
</P>
<P>
   In defending its proposal, Dominion cited a profit-sharing
agreement with the NYPA it said was worth $169 million in
speculative value if power prices top current projections, compared
with a $35 million profit-sharing pledge by Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion also touted the operating record of its two nuclear
stations in Virginia and said it was giving the transaction its
full corporate backing, whereas Entergy is a limited-liability
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion charged that the Entergy proposal had been inflated by
$100 million in phantom value related to decommissioning costs, as
well as power sales agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The original Entergy offer committed 46 percent of Fitzpatrick's
power to NYPA in 2000, decreasing to 31 percent in 2004 at $32 a
megawatt hour, the expected price in the emerging competitive power
market.
</P>
<P>
   In its increased bid, Entergy had said it offered to sell the
remaining output of the plant at $29 per megawatt hour through
2004. But Dominion said that Entergy's official offer that was due
March 10 only extended that offer through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   A winning bid would increase Dominion's nuclear holdings to six
units at four plants, including the two-unit North Anna and Surry
plants it owns and operates in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the units to Dominion would give the company a
foothold in the U.S. northeast power market, where Entergy has
already been a successful buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy approached NYPA more than two years ago about a possible
purchase of the plants. A successful bid would enlarge its
ownership portfolio to seven stations, making it the second-largest
owner of nuclear plants, behind Chicago-based Unicom Corp. and
Philadelphia-based PECO Energy Co., which have agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Nuclear bought the 670-megawatt Pilgrim nuclear unit
from BEC Energy's Boston Edison Co. in July for $80 million. The
one-unit station is located in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Nuclear is also managing decommissioning activities at
the Maine Yankee plant near Wicasset, Maine, and at Northeast
Utilities' Millstone unit 1 station near Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy said recently it is interested in Consolidated Edison
Co. of New York's planned auction of the 980-megawatt Indian Point
2 nuclear unit.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy said its strategy of buying plants close to each other
helps the facilities share maintenance costs.

Gunmen Massacre 35 Sikhs in Kashmir
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen rounded up and killed 35 Sikh villagers in
India's disputed Kashmir state, police said Tuesday, even as President Clinton
was beginning a visit to India. Monday night's massacre was the first major
attack on Kashmir's small Sikh community since separatist Muslims launched their
insurgency 10 years ago. Sikhs are considered a neutral minority, but Indian
officials earlier had warned of violence by Muslim militants hoping to draw
attention to Kashmir during Clinton's visit. India and Pakistan claim the
Himalayan territory and have fought two wars over it. The gunmen were not
immediately identified and no group claimed responsibility for the attack,
police said.

Abdullah Al-Amin, who was known as H. Rap Brown, was arrested in Lowndes County,
Ala., west of Montgomery, Agent Theodore Jackson said. Jackson said Al-Amin was
spotted about 6:30 p.m. and was arrested about three hours later in
Autaugaville, Ala. Al-Amin was spotted peering out from a shed, and he
immediately began firing shots at the team of U.S. marshals who spotted him,
Jackson said.

the 52 statues recovered look fine and some probably will be awarded Sunday. If
any are ''nicked or dinged, they will not be used,'' Davis said.

Inflation Rises in EU Nations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Inflation in the 11 euro-zone countries was 2.0
percent in February compared with a year earlier, up from 1.9 percent in January
and 0.8 percent a year ago. The European Union statistical office Aerostat said
Monday that annual inflation in the 15 EU nations rose to 1.9 percent in
February from 1.8 percent in January. In February 1999, EU inflation stood at
1.0 percent. The rise was significant because the European Central Bank has set
2.0 percent as it's target ceiling for inflation in the euro zone. The ECB
raised key lending rates by a quarter percentage point last week.
